165
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:29,034
Yeah, I think you're in need
of some family assistance.

166
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:32,663
So I brought some of my dad's trial books.
This is one of his faves.

167
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:36,500
Maybe we should watch a few episodes
of How to Get Away with Murder.

Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt,

169
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,006
but Devi's grandmother
wanted to join the fun.

She was almost alive in the 1920s.

Hello, Auntie.

Help me down, child.
Don't touch my hip! Too brittle.

momentarily granting Devi a recess
from her own personal trial,

176

but Devi knew
this relief was only temporary

177
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,743
and she would need
to have a word with the judge.

178
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:13,454
Okay, I think we should start
by listing the facts.

179
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:17,541
All right.
Daisy drove the car that killed Myrtle.

180
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,877
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and here's my thought.

181
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:22,213
What if I leave the facts to you two,

182
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:24,715
and I'm in charge of playing
to the court's emotions?

183

- I'll bite. How would you do that?
- By being Gatsby's silent haunting ghost.

184

Is that so you don't have to do work?

My ex-girlfriend and I,

208
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,220
we broke up right after we signed up
for this couples' cooking class,

209
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:55,014
and now I gotta see her every Wednesday.

210
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:58,601
- Why are you still going to the class?
- Because I paid for 11 weeks upfront.

What, I'm gonna let her make delicious
date-night foods on my dime?

- Okay, the point is,

213
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,070
I get to see her every week,

214
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:13,407
of all the things that annoy me about her.

215
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,660
Like her cackling laugh,
or her overuse of the word "random,"

216
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:19,830

her semester abroad in London.

Oh, that's kinda cool.

It's not. It's basic.

219
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,794
The point is,
distance makes the heart grow fonder,

220
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:29,006
and proximity
makes the heart want to barf,

221
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:31,216

Your Honor, Daisy Buchanan

and the reason why Mr. Gatsby is not.

335
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,695
Well, at least not in his corporeal form.

336

<b><font color="#ca004b">[CLEARS THROAT]</font></b>

337

Anyway, if Daisy
had not run over Myrtle Wilson

338
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:33,912
and allowed Mr. Gatsby
to take the blame for it,

339
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:38,417
then George Wilson would not have thought
Mr. Gatsby was his wife's lover,

340
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,211
and therefore, would not have killed him.

<b><font color="#ca004b">[MUSIC ENDS]</font></b>

345

"Her voice is full of money."

346
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:00,188
That's how Jay Gatsby described Daisy.

347
00:17:00,272 --> 00:17:04,276
Now, the prosecution has given
a rather simple assessment of the case.

348
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,444
No offense.

349
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:07,946
For it's not Daisy's fault
that Gatsby is dead.

350
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:14,453
No, no, the fault lies in the rampant
classism and materialism of the 1920s,

351
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:20,375
and the society in which Daisy existed
gave her no choice but to reject Gatsby,

352
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,628
which ultimately led to his demise.

353
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:27,340
Thus, the defendant is incontestably...

354
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:30,385
innocent.

We call Nick Carraway,

So, uh, Nick,

360
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,240
Because she like blew my boy off,

361
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:54,993
even though Gatsby threw, like,
sick parties for her,

362

all I have is my ability to marry well.

with Eleanor.

481
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:44,926
Seems like you're in a fight
with lots of people.

482
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:48,555
Paxton, I'm so sorry I yelled at you.

483
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:51,057
Yeah, you were really rude,

484
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:55,145
but I have been trying
to take your advice.

485
00:23:55,228 --> 00:23:58,314
I saw, and look, your team won today.

486
00:23:58,398 --> 00:23:59,649
Not because of me.

487
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:04,446
<b><font color="#ca004b">[SIGHS]</font></b>
I... I just don't get it.

488
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:07,365
You know, I worked as hard as I could,

489
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:10,160
and still got thrashed by the kid
you cheated on me with.

490
00:24:11,244 --> 00:24:13,413
I mean, maybe I am dumb.

491
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:14,581
You're not dumb.

492
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,125
Yeah, but I'm not smart.

493
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:23,465
Can I give you some non-yelling advice?

494
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:27,927
I don't think you worked
as hard as you could.

495
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:30,638
I think you did the assignment,

496
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:33,016
but if you really wanted
to wow your teachers,

497
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:34,726
you have to go above and beyond.

498
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:39,022
What's the hardest
you ever pushed yourself in swimming?

499
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:43,568
Uh... I guess there was that one time
I accidentally swam to San Diego.

500
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:46,821
What? From Los Angeles?

501
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:47,906
Yeah.

502
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,617
Wow! Well, okay.

503
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:53,661
Swim to San Diego in school.

504
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,670
Okay. Yeah, I'll give that a try.

505
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:08,384
Oh, do you mind just pulling up
by that fire hydrant over there?

506
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:10,595
You can't see it from my house,

507
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:13,223
and I don't want my mom
to flip out that I rode with you.

508
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:18,895
Yeah, I'd be down not to interact
with your mom ever again.

509
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:25,068
But anyway, I promise,
I'm a changed woman.

510
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:28,404
From now on,
I'm as chill as a Slurpee, bro.

511
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:30,907
I'll believe that when I see it.

512
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:32,575
- Hmm.
