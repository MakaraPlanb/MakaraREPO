in the United States, correct?

272
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:21,264
Yes.

273
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:23,808
And even though
you were an American citizen by birth,

274
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:25,852
you were still considered
a foreign threat.

275
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:27,979

<b><font color="#ca004b">[ALL LAUGH]</font></b>

277
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,901
Manzanar was located in a farm town
that was abandoned

278
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:36,404
because the water was diverted
to Los Angeles, which created a desert.

279
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:38,698
The summers were over 100 degrees,

280
00:15:38,782 --> 00:15:40,492
and the winters were bitterly cold

281
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:42,744
because there wasn't enough oil
to go around.

282
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:46,331
Now, Ojichan, what was the hardest thing
about living in the camp?

283
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:51,211
Seeing my father's heart break.

284
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:53,505
He was a proud man.

285
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,051
But when they made him a prisoner,
they stole his dignity,

286
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:01,429
and I don't think
he ever recovered from that.

I'm sorry, Ojichan.

why I never talked about it until now.

to pay for the cloud.

Thanks, Dad.
I couldn't have done it without your help

You guys came even after I said
those terrible things to you.

Of course, we did. Life's too short
not to speak to each other.

I'm so, so sorry.
I didn't mean any of it.

Yeah. He dumped me over text.

Can't believe I didn't see
what a tool he was.

I could easily be sucked into a cult.
