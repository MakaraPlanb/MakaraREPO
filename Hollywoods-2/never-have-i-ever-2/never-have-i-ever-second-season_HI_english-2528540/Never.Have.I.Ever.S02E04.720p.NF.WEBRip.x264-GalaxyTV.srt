I treat coming out of this place? Hmm?

468
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:37,658
Auntie, it's my fault.
I'm so sorry.

469
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:41,704
Last night, Devi and I
were talking about how hard it is

470
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:45,416
to be South Asian girls in a country
that only celebrates western beauty.

471
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,421
And... And the nose ring is such a powerful
symbol of Indian femininity.

472
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:53,049
Devi just wanted to decolonize her nose,

473
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:56,427
and I stupidly suggested
we do it last night to surprise you.

474
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:00,973
Now I see how irresponsible that was.

475
00:23:01,057 --> 00:23:02,183
I'm so sorry.

476
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,770
Was there any alcohol or...
or kissing boys?

477
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,564
Absolutely not.
I don't do either of those things.

478
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,026
This was just a halal moment of rebellion.

479
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,487
Yeah! It was halal as hell.

480
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,990
Well,

00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:26,999
And actually, it looks...
it looks nice on you, Devi.

483
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,421
You cannot go to a tattoo parlor

with our initial hypothesis.
