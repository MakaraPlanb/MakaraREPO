Why you gotta be so possessive? I'm out.

- What's poppin'?
- Yo.

471
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:57,661
- I brought Tarts for my favorite tutee.
- Thank you.

472
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:02,248
Mmm.

473
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,794
- These hit different when you earn them.
- Hmm.

That's sick.

It's a start.

478
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:15,304
Thanks for pushing me, by the way.

479
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:20,684
Of course. I mean, I sort of owe you
for the fact that you got hit by a car.

480
00:23:22,937 --> 00:23:24,688
And the other thing.

481
00:23:25,523 --> 00:23:27,525
Yeah, the other thing.

482
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:30,277
We really don't need to talk about that.

483
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,529
We're cool.

484
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:36,200
Really? Wow. That's a relief.

00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:37,283
Yeah.

486
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:41,414
I mean, it's... it's crazy when you think
about it, right? You and me?

487
00:23:42,415 --> 00:23:44,875
I mean, there's no way
it would've worked out.

488
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:49,672
I mean,
we just don't make any sense, you know?

489
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:53,050
Uh... Right. Right.

490
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:57,138
Tutor and tutee seems like a much more
natural relationship between us.

491
00:23:57,888 --> 00:23:58,888
Exactly.

492
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:04,437

- Yeah.

It's pretty crowded.

00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:12,611
I see Zoe Maytag wasn't overly concerned
with leaving room for others.

496
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:16,031
That's Zoe. She actually wrote over,
like, a couple names I think.

497
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:17,908
I'm not surprised.

A "B." Did Devi have a bad day?

500
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:36,093
No, I had a good day.
I actually studied and got this on my own.

501
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:38,262
You opened a textbook?

502
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:41,307
I did. I even read
all the words on the pages.

503
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,100
She taught you how to read?

Someone get her on Twitter.
We need her realness.

506
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:52,151
You were right. If I'm going to college,
I want to earn it.

I'm proud of you.

Thanks, Becca. I'm proud of you too.

Hey, could you try these on?

510
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:03,037
I think you're the same size
as Kendall Jenner.

as a multi-hyphenate.

00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:18,719
I hope we've all learned that
we shouldn't judge a book by its cover,

516
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:21,680
