Eve, I have to come clean.

468
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:23,938
That woman isn't a woman at all.

469
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,774
She's a mother. My mother.

470
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:27,900
She is?

471
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:30,986
Do you not want me to meet her?
Are you embarrassed of me?

472
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,864
No, of course not!
I'm embarrassed of her.

473
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:35,908
I know she's gonna say
something weird to you.

474
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:38,828
She's definitely gonna tell you
how much she liked the movie Carol.

475
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:42,498
Great, I hope she does.
It's my favorite Christmas movie.

476
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:44,708
Now, suck it up and introduce us.

477
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:48,295
Fab. Haven't seen you for the whole relay.
Where've you been hiding?

478
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:50,172
Hi, Mom. Um...

479
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:53,217
This is Eve, my girlfriend.

480
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,094
Eve? The Eve?

481
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,473
Oh my gosh,
it is so nice to finally meet you!

482
00:23:59,557 --> 00:24:02,810
Did Fabiola tell you?
I hung a rainbow flag on our porch.

483
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:05,771
That's awesome!
And also, great job on the relay.

484
00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:07,398
Everything looks amazing.

485
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:09,984
Aw! Well, if you think this looks good,

for the Winter Dance.

487

You two are going, right?

488
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,492
I don't really think
that's our thing, Mom.

It's a tradition!

491

It's where they crown
the Cricket King and Queen.

492
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:29,128
Mom, it's just a popularity contest
that's like super heteronormative

493
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:31,297
and reinforces the gender binary.

494
00:24:31,797 --> 00:24:32,798
Right, Eve?

495
00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:36,469
Yeah, I don't know if anyone really cares
about Cricket King and Queen anymore.

496
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:38,012
I was Cricket Queen.

497
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:39,847
Oh, I'm so sorry--

498
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,266
And Fabiola's dad was Cricket King.

499
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:45,019
We were actually
the first Cricket King and Queen of color.

500
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:46,937
Whoa, that's amazing!

501
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:49,482
And it may sound silly,
but it really meant a lot

502
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:51,692
to all of the other students
who looked like us.

503
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:53,235
Oh my God, Fab,

504
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,529
we should run for Cricket King and Queen!

505
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:57,239
Cricket Queen and Queen.

506
00:24:57,323 --> 00:24:59,450
That is an excellent idea.
