of how I became me?

438
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:27,813
It all began on a goat farm

439
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:30,899
in the civil parish
of Barton-upon-Humber--

440
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:33,235
Actually, I didn't mean to interrupt you,

441
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:36,280

I could discuss something with you first.

442
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,282
Well, of course, it's your time.

443
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:41,577
Evan sent out the first draft
of the paper last night,

444
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,412
and my name was left off of it.

445
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:46,957
Oh, and you feel
that you should have been credited?

446
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,669
Yes. I don't know if Evan told you,
but I was the one who realized

447
00:21:50,753 --> 00:21:53,547
which cells had the greatest tendency
for clonal self-renewal.

448
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,175
Well, that was a fine observation,

449
00:21:56,967 --> 00:22:00,220
but I don't get involved
in the politics of the lab.

450
00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:03,640
If Evan left your name off,
I'm sure he had a reason.

the dance committee,

474
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,302
and they told way more people.

475
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:25,055
Give me a couple extra detentions,
and we'll call it even.

476
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:27,057
This is not a negotiation.

477
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:29,977
You started a rumor,
then you lied to your principal,

478
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,355
and then you let two students
take the fall for it.

479
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:35,732
But a suspension goes
on my permanent record!

480
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:37,818
That could ruin my chance
to go to Princeton!

481
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:40,320
Mom, do something!

482
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,115

Meet me in the car.
Just grab your stuff.

489
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:04,970
Hey, Aneesa.
Could I talk to you for a second?

490
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:09,141
I am so sorry about what happened.

491
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:12,686
But Principal Grubbs just suspended me.
Maybe if you talk to her--

492
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:15,022
Wow. That's what you care about?

493
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:19,109
I thought the girls at my last school
were selfish. You're on another level.

494
00:24:19,193 --> 00:24:20,861
I'm not trying to be selfish.

495
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:23,947
I feel terrible about what happened,
but you don't understand.

496
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:27,242
I've wanted to go to Princeton forever.
Like, it's my whole thing.

497
00:24:27,326 --> 00:24:30,245
Now my whole thing is being the new girl
with an eating disorder.

498
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:32,247
Just so you know,
I never hooked up with Ben.

499
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:34,833
It's insanely obvious
you two have some kind of history.

500
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:36,960
But I saw you guys go into Trent's tent.

501
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:40,130
Dude! To hide from you
because you were making us run!

502
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:42,841
Everyone was right.

503
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,635
You are crazy, Devi.

504
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:48,764
Thanks a lot.
Just failed my bio test.

505
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:52,100
Are you mad at me?
That's not my fault.

506
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:54,019
If you'd studied with me like you said--

507
00:24:54,102 --> 00:24:57,481
Paxton, if you want good grades,
then be a good student.

508
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,191
I can't hold your hand forever!

509
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:01,652
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've just been suspended!
