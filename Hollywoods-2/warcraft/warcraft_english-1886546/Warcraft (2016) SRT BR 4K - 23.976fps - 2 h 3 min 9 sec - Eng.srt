1
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:26,003
« There has been a war
between orcs and humans »

2
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,130
« for as long as can be remembered. »

3
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:36,889
« But there was once a time when we did not
even know who our enemy was. »

4
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:43,479
« Or what that evil green magic,
the Fel, had done to us. »

5
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,702
« But in the beginning,
how could we have known? »

6
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,455
« What choice did we have? »

7
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,542
« Our world was dying »

8
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,962
« and I had to find my clan a new home. »

9
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,180
Durotan...

10
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,850
I can feel your eyes.

11
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,271
I thought you were asleep.

12
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,773
I was.

13
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,072
Dreaming of a hunt

14
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,992
through the snow.

15
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,418
I've thought of a name.

16
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:51,005
Well, keep it to yourself, wife.

17
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,507
I'll choose a name when I meet him.

18
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,509
Or her.

19
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,720
Oh...

20
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,265
And how will the great Durotan
name his son

21
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,602
if I do not travel
with him?

22
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,103
A son?

23
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:09,774
Can you hide your fat belly?

24
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,613
Better than you can hide your fat head.

25
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,500
FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!

26
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,650
So many clans in one place, Orgrim.

27
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,028
Laughing Skull, Blackrock.

28
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,488
All have been summoned.

29
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,241
It will be a mighty warband.

30
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,744
Just wonder who's left to fight.

31
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,416
Victory or death!

32
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,920
Blackrock, over there.

33
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,006
How much longer, Blackhand?

34
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,342
We are ready, Gul'Dan.

35
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,310
What did she say?

36
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,022
She begs for you to free her child.

37
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,316
But I need him.

38
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,193
I need all of them.

39
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,548
Move, "haw-breech"!

40
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,223
What is that?

41
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,726
Gul'Dan's magic.

42
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,700
The fuel for my magic is life.

43
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,037
We only have enough prisoners
to send through

44
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:31,081
our strongest warriors.

45
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,626
But that will be enough.

46
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,253
The enemy is weak.

47
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,755
When we arrive,

48
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:41,383
we will take them as fuel!

49
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,598
We will build a new portal!

50
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:52,269
And when it is complete,
we will bring through

51
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,980
all of the Horde!

52
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,412
Let me go first.

53
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,337
For the Horde!

54
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,063
With child?

55
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:02,816
You dare bring that < wachook >
into my warband?

56
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,904
Let me go, Blackhand!

57
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:08,405
Draka!

58
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:25,547
Push, little one. Push!

59
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,924
A new warrior for the Horde.

60
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,660
Lothar.

61
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,496
Come. I've got something for you.

62
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,004
What is it?

63
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,214
A mechanical marvel.

64
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,301
It's a boomstick.

65
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,682
Odd.

66
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,397
Take water.

67
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,616
You might want to head home, big man.

68
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:19,453
Someone's attacked one of your garrisons.

69
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,831
Seems your king needs you, Commander.

70
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:40,140
An entire garrison,
and no one saw anything?

71
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,642
We did find someone.

72
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,478
He was searching the bodies
here in the barracks.

73
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,650
In the barracks?

74
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,862
Finally! Are you in command?

75
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,832
That's the mark of the Kirin Tor.

76
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,377
What are you doing in my city,
spellchucker?

77
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,844
Let me complete my examination
of the body across the hall.

78
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,097
Now, why would I do that?

79
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,392
Within that body is the secret
to your attacks.

80
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,872
What was that?

81
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,958
You must summon the Guardian.

82
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,376
Medivh?

83
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,545
It should be he who explains it.

84
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,258
Only the King summons the Guardian.

85
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,469
Get him to Goldshire.

86
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,245
What kind of beasts?

87
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,164
Rumors, Your Majesty.

88
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,833
How does a garrison of 30 men
disappear without a whisper?

89
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:30,918
The Fel.

90
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:35,881
Or at least its influence.

91
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,926
Is this him?

92
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,344
Mmm-hmm.

93
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:41,595
Your Majesty.

94
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,306
Dad.

95
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,350
Thank you, Sergeant.

96
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,728
So, who are you, mage?

97
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,315
My name is Khadgar.
I am the Guardian novitiate.

98
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,026
I was. I renounced my vows.

99
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,467
You mean, you're a fugitive?

100
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,237
I'm not hiding.

101
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,156
Your Majesty...

102
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,036
I may have left my training,
but I didn't leave my abilities behind.

103
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,955
I've sensed something.

104
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,834
Dark forces, when it's strong,
it almost has a smell.

105
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,927
Knowing that something so evil
was so close,

106
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:16,254
I couldn't just ignore it.

107
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,956
Where has this happened?
Is this true?

108
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,147
What's going on out there?

109
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,218
Smoke, sir. Southeast.

110
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,765
Your Majesty, I urge you to engage
the Guardian with all haste.

111
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,266
They've reached Elwynn Forest.

112
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,727
Grand Hamlet is burning.

113
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,523
An attack?

114
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,694
What?

115
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,737
Stop requesting Callan.

116
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,781
Stay out of my business.

117
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,534
He wants to follow in
his father's footsteps.

118
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,953
My son doesn't need your help.

119
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,288
Tread carefully.
You talk to your queen.

120
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,045
You are my sister first.

121
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,049
When was your last visit to Karazhan?

122
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,719
With you. I don't know...

123
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,886
Six years.

124
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,930
And you've had no contact
with Medivh since?

125
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,640
Not for lack of trying.

126
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,061
Well, he can't hide from us now.

127
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,565
The Guardian is summoned.

128
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,459
Get on.

129
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,717
Good luck.

130
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,680
Okay!

131
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,616
We need them alive!

132
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,159
My baby!

133
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,453
This is not for a warrior.

134
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,000
Let me go!

135
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,005
Frostwolves do not join the hunt?

136
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,179
We prefer our enemies armed
with an axe, not a child.

137
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,932
We have been commanded, Durotan.

138
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,642
Respect the old ways.

139
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:40,857
There must be a worthy foe
somewhere on this dung heap.

140
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,527
Find them all! Try not to kill too many,

141
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,529
we need them alive.

142
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,896
Lothar.

143
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,189
Moroes.

144
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,358
Look at you.

145
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,986
You haven't aged a bit.

146
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,121
Where is everyone?

147
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,831
Many things have changed.

148
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,346
The power that must be locked away here.
The knowledge.

149
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,668
Where is he?

150
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,338
I didn't know so many books even existed.

151
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:47,883
Wait here.

152
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,428
And try not to touch anything.

153
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,972
He sees no one?

154
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,891
World's been at peace.

155
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,394
Good you are here, Lothar.

156
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:01,646
It will do the Guardian a world of good

157
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,774
to see a friendly face
beyond this old mug.

158
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,319
He can't refuse you.

159
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,279
Nor King Llane.

160
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,740
Not if he's summoned.

161
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,368
Chop-chop.

162
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,901
Did you summon him, Moroes?

163
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,780
No. He did not.

164
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,287
So...

165
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,207
You've become a sculptor?

166
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,960
I'm making a golem.

167
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,420
Usually takes years for the magic

168
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,214
to seep into the clay, but up here

169
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,341
it's much faster.

170
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,513
Make someone to keep Moroes company.

171
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,598
Help to clean up around the house.

172
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,059
Thank you.

173
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,731
It's good to see you, Lothar.

174
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,859
We need your guidance, Medivh.

175
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,154
Our king summons you.

176
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,866
Who's the boy downstairs?

177
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,251
Hello?

178
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,296
Guardian?

179
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,559
Have a good look around?

180
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,398
Get some ideas what you're going to do

181
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,799
with the place once it's yours?

182
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:53,766
Guardian,

183
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,779
I renounced my vow.

184
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,283
I didn't want to come here.

185
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,826
I swear, Guardian!

186
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,454
I urged them to find you. I told them.

187
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,414
You should be the one to explain.

188
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:07,874
Explain what?

189
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,000
Fel!

190
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,923
In Azeroth?

191
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,174
In the barracks.

192
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,467
One the bodies.

193
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,636
Guardian, What is the Fel?

194
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,767
A magic unlike any other.
It feeds on life itself.

195
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,270
It pollutes the user,
twisting everything it touches.

196
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:33,441
It promises great power,
but it exacts a terrible price.

197
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,986
There is no place for the Fel in Azeroth.

198
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,782
You've done the right thing.

199
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:42,992
We'll go.

200
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,964
Hey! Go home, you.

201
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,932
Step in.

202
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,824
Medivh.

203
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,325
Your Grace.

204
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,036
It has been too long.

205
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,790
Come.

206
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,169
Help us get to the root of these troubles
of ours.

207
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,965
What kind of beasts?

208
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,092
They're saying giants.

209
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,553
Armed giants, wolves to carry them.

210
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,472
Huge unstoppable monsters.

211
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,931
What of the other kingdoms?

212
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,766
Are they suffering the same?

213
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,978
All seek our protection, yet none
trust us enough to tell us anything.

214
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,773
We know nothing about
these so-called monsters.

215
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,567
We need prisoners.

216
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,460
Even a corpse would tell us something.

217
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,948
I don't know what danger we're in, Medivh.

218
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,868
I exist to protect this realm, my lord.

219
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,287
It is my very purpose.

220
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,372
I am the Guardian.

221
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,620
At least for the time being, anyhow.

222
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,461
Yes.

223
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,671
What are we gonna do about...

224
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,423
What is his name?

225
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,342
Khadgar, sire.

226
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,678
He'll be coming with us.

227
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:29,849
Well, then.

228
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,810
We better get going.

229
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,509
Halt.

230
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,418
It can't be.

231
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,300
Guardian?

232
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,553
Close ranks!

233
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,430
Watch your back!

234
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,108
Watch your flank! To your left!

235
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,201
Watch your flanks!

236
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,999
Watch your flank! To your left!

237
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,010
Guardian!

238
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,448
Die, you beast!

239
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,617
Don't try and take them
on with brute force.

240
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:02,835
They're stronger.

241
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,754
Be smarter.

242
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,795
The Fel.

243
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,463
They're all dying!

244
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,966
Only the green ones.

245
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,634
Kill that big bastard.

246
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,102
Durotan. Move.

247
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,741
Guardian.

248
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:16,470
Guardian, what did you do?

249
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,120
I was right, wasn't I? It's here!

250
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,621
Where are you going?

251
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,832
Get these men safely back to Stormwind.

252
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,542
I have to return to Karazhan.

253
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,503
You did well today.

254
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:32,759
Where's the Guardian?

255
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,010
Karazhan.

256
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,388
We need a prisoner. Where's your horse?

257
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:37,555
They took my horse.

258
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:40,349
Really? Just stay there.

259
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,126
No!

260
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,788
How much do you love your master?

261
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,833
I'll do it!

262
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,169
Back off!

263
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,800
Pity.

264
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,887
He would have made a good coat.

265
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,529
Over here!

266
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:09,957
You took it alone?

267
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:11,334
Yes.

268
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,670
Looks like the runt of the litter.

269
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:28,893
You.

270
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,355
What are you?
And why do you attack our lands?

271
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,567
He does not know what you speak.

272
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,194
You speak our language?

273
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,366
And I will wear your tongue!

274
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,213
I will not warn you again!

275
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,052
Tell him to stop.

276
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,553
You tell him.

277
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,895
You're welcome.

278
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,776
Have you a name?

279
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,614
You understand our language.

280
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:26,575
Again.

281
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,453
Have you a name?

282
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,335
Garona.

283
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,463
She calls herself Garona.

284
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,676
What kind of being are you?

285
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,767
She seems more like us
than those beasts we fought.

286
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,264
Orc.

287
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:49,932
Orc?

288
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:53,352
That's what you are,
or the beast in the cage was?

289
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,941
I know every race in the Seven Kingdoms.
I've never heard of "orc".

290
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,529
Show me where you come from?

291
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,162
This is not orc world.

292
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:12,955
Orc world is dead.

293
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,292
Orcs take this world now.

294
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,127
Not from this world?

295
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,796
How did you get here?

296
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,674
The Great Gate.

297
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:24,967
Deep in ground...

298
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:26,802
Into magic brought us here.

299
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,804
But how did you learn our language?

300
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:31,590
Orc take prisoner for the gate.
I learn from them.

301
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,641
Prisoners?

302
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,727
Our people?

303
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,562
Are they alive?

304
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,522
Yes. Many.

305
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:39,899
Why?

306
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,233
To feed the gate.

307
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,152
To bring in the Horde.

308
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:44,987
To take your world.

309
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,280
You'll take us to them.

310
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,616
No.

311
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,493
You'll take us to them.

312
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,329
Or you'll end up like
your friend in the cage.

313
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,752
You think you're fearsome?

314
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,422
Orc children have pets
more fearsome than you.

315
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,758
We're not trying to be fearsome, Garona.

316
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:09,053
We're trying to protect
our people, our families.

317
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:12,389
If you help us, I give you my oath,

318
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,517
you will have your freedom.

319
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,191
Fearsome Blackhand,

320
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,319
Warchief of the Horde.

321
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:31,033
You have allowed the small-teeth
to kill your warriors.

322
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:36,539
Worse, you've shamed your people
by running from an enemy.

323
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:41,836
Are you too weak to talk, Destroyer?

324
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:45,214
The Horde has no use for weakness.

325
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,884
Respect our tradition, Warchief.

326
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,181
You know the penalty.

327
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,227
Death!

328
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:02,022
For the Horde!

329
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:04,817
For the Horde!

330
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:08,237
For the Horde!

331
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,531
For the Horde!

332
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,078
Stop!

333
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,668
You dare interrupt this judgment?

334
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,420
We fought hard.

335
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:28,132
Their warlock used your Fel against us.

336
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,801
Only I can control the Fel.

337
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:38,350
I see you and your men have survived.

338
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,352
Perhaps Blackhand

339
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,189
kept you safely away from the battlefield?

340
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,483
Maybe he knows you're weak, too.

341
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:52,615
Do you wish to challenge me,
little chieftain?

342
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,955
I do not question, Gul'Dan.

343
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,333
But the Fel is born of death.

344
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,460
It must have a price.

345
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:08,797
A price paid in lives taken.

346
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,520
Will you hold your son?

347
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,372
He will be a great Chieftain.

348
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,082
Like his father.

349
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,542
A born leader.

350
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,045
I was no leader today.

351
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,180
He challenges you already.

352
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:03,269
If Gul'Dan can infect
one as innocent as him,

353
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,980
what chance do the rest of us have?

354
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,193
Whatever happens.

355
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,280
Whatever happens.

356
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,169
I see you.

357
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,006
This gate,

358
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,550
who showed it to Gul'Dan?

359
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,885
Who led him to Azeroth?

360
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,388
Gul'Dan called him a demon.

361
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,515
Did you see it?

362
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:43,225
Not the face,

363
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:45,019
but the voice.

364
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,730
Like fire and ash.

365
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,998
I'll be here if you need me.

366
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,724
Your mate.

367
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:26,435
I could kill you before
he even reaches me.

368
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:30,731
Lothar?

369
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,359
He is my brother.

370
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,528
The king is my mate.

371
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,772
You're the chieftain's wife then.

372
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:41,825
I suppose so.

373
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,293
Then killing you would bring me
even greater honor.

374
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:47,873
Not among my kind.

375
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,709
It is a cold night.

376
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:53,420
I thought you might use these.

377
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,307
It will warm you.

378
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,111
More of our villages burn tonight.

379
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,657
One of them is the village of my birth.

380
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,913
I cannot imagine what horrors
you have been through, Garona.

381
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:31,041
But this doesn't need to happen.

382
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,211
We have had peace in these lands
for many years now.

383
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:37,923
Peace between races
from all over the world.

384
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,471
What is...

385
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,687
I can have it removed.

386
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,608
There is a life here for you, Garona.

387
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,444
With us.

388
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,737
A life of freedom.

389
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:03,949
If you want it.

390
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,421
The Great Gate.

391
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:27,890
"From light comes darkness"

392
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,560
"and from darkness light."

393
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,437
Well, that's clear.

394
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,314
"Ask Alodi."

395
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,108
Alodi.

396
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,625
It's good to see trees again.

397
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,085
And the snow.

398
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,463
Even from a distance.

399
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,635
Remember when we would track blood ox
through the Frostwind Dunes?

400
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,762
There was always meat,

401
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:09,431
always life.

402
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,683
You don't think it's strange

403
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,436
that we lost our home
when Gul'Dan came to power?

404
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:17,272
One orc cannot kill a world, Durotan.

405
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,941
Are you sure?

406
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,609
Look around you.

407
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,195
Does it not remind you of something?

408
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:29,159
Wherever Gul'Dan works his magic,
the land dies.

409
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:34,373
If our people are to make
a home here, my friend...

410
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,961
Gul'Dan must be stopped.

411
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,049
We are not powerful enough
to defeat Gul'Dan.

412
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,217
No.

413
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,303
No.

414
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,809
But with the humans' help,

415
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,520
we could be.

416
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,827
I want that weapon.

417
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,583
You'll have me to protect you.

418
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,835
I need no one to protect me!

419
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:27,718
What are you looking at?

420
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,759
Bookworm. Take the first watch.

421
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:11,219
Respectfully, Commander,
my name is Khadgar.

422
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,097
My deepest apologies, Khadgar.

423
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,974
You see, I thought we bonded

424
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:18,000
when I didn't put you in a prison cell

425
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,716
for breaking into the Royal Barracks.

426
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,147
Now take the watch.

427
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:39,081
Well, at least you're not reading.

428
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:44,461
He Wishes to lie with me.

429
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,298
Beg your pardon?

430
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,259
You would be injured.

431
00:41:52,452 --> 00:41:53,770
I don't want to lie with you.

432
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,431
Good. You would not be an effective mate.

433
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,226
Why do you laugh?

434
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,729
I can't see how you humans
survive such a thing.

435
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,648
No muscles to protect you.

436
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,942
Brittle bones that break.

437
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:09,069
You don't look that different to us.

438
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,363
How did you survive?

439
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,990
Broken bones heal stronger.

440
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,702
Mine are very strong.

441
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:22,165
I'm sorry.

442
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,334
Do not be.

443
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,132
My name...

444
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:32,134
Garona.

445
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,429
It means "cursed" in Orc.

446
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,978
My mother was burned alive
for giving birth to me.

447
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:49,901
They kept you alive, though.

448
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:52,988
Gul'Dan did.

449
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,659
He gave me her tusk.

450
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,121
To remember her.

451
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,716
My parents gave me to the Kirin Tor
when I was six years old.

452
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:16,178
That's the last time I saw them.

453
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,515
Or any of my brothers and sisters.

454
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:25,145
It brings a family honor

455
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,272
to offer a child to the Kirin Tor.

456
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,942
To have their son taken up
to the floating city of Dalaran

457
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:34,070
and be trained by the most
powerful mages in the land.

458
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:38,700
Less so, to have them run away.

459
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,292
Well, that was cheerful.

460
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,922
The Great Gate.

461
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:57,511
Why do they need so many prisoners?

462
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,055
Like wood for a fire.

463
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,058
Green magic takes life to open the gate.

464
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,271
How many more orcs
are they planning on bringing?

465
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:07,322
All of them.

466
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:09,731
This is just a warband.

467
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,067
When the portal is opened,

468
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,402
Gul'Dan will bring the Horde.

469
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,578
Get them back to Stormwind.

470
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:25,622
We'll ride ahead.

471
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,342
Garona.

472
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,094
We should go. It's not safe...

473
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,180
Durotan.

474
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,101
To the north, there is a black rock
that touches the sky.

475
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,854
I would meet with their leader.

476
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:50,689
To challenge him?

477
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,942
I saw you lead the small-teeth
to our encampment.

478
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:56,444
They have seen what is being built.

479
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:01,283
But only you know what
Gul'Dan has planned for my people.

480
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,912
This magic is death, to all things.

481
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:09,541
Must be stopped.

482
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:12,794
Tell him.

483
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:16,298
The black rock, when the sun is highest.

484
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:17,966
I Will.

485
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:21,303
Chieftain.

486
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:23,722
If I return,

487
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,224
would you take me into your clan?

488
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,395
You're safer here.

489
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,105
With them.

490
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,867
Is it as you feared?

491
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,994
The Fel is everywhere.

492
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,413
Then you mustn't leave again.

493
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,126
They need a Guardian's help now
more than ever.

494
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:38,880
Maybe the boy can help.

495
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,012
We need solutions!

496
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,323
Easy for you to say that!

497
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:49,849
The Dwarven forges must work overtime.

498
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,185
You treat us no better than dogs.

499
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,312
We shall supply you no more!

500
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:55,730
Enough!

501
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:58,896
You have all called on Stormwind
in the past.

502
00:46:58,946 --> 00:47:00,698
Either for troops or arbitration.

503
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,613
If we do not unite

504
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:05,365
to fight this enemy,

505
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:07,492
we will perish.

506
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:08,618
Hear, hear.

507
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:11,746
Stormwind needs soldiers, arms, horses.

508
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:14,040
We have our own kingdoms to look after.

509
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,816
- Fight your own wars!
- Your Majesty.

510
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:18,378
Commander.

511
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,088
The orcs are building a portal,

512
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,215
through which they plan to bring an army.

513
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:25,385
If we do not stop them now,
we may never get another opportunity.

514
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,429
Where is he?

515
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,973
Where is the protector of Azeroth?

516
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,141
Where is the Guardian?

517
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:32,767
Where is Medivh?

518
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:34,686
My liege.

519
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,027
I suggest we take a recess.

520
00:47:36,077 --> 00:47:37,313
Take as long as you like.

521
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,940
We're done.

522
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,487
Commander.

523
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:47,574
What's left of the Fourth has retreated
from Stonewatch.

524
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:48,908
What's left?

525
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:51,411
Callan is among the injured.

526
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,461
Dad?

527
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:07,510
I'm fine. It's fine.

528
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,098
You had me worried.

529
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:18,104
Where's the rest of your troop?

530
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,356
They took most of them alive.

531
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,859
We'll get them back.

532
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:25,445
Don't be in such a hurry.

533
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,244
You're all I have.

534
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:36,664
I know.

535
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:39,292
I'm a soldier.

536
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:50,011
He would not ask for this meeting

537
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:52,055
if he thought he could defeat
Gul'Dan alone.

538
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,309
The Fel must truly terrify him.

539
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:57,811
Durotan is scared of nothing.

540
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,771
The location.

541
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:03,108
The suddenness of this meeting.

542
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:05,902
Sounds like a trap.

543
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:07,570
It is not. Could be.

544
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:08,780
It is not! Could be.

545
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,864
It is not!

546
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,491
What do you think?

547
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,160
It's too good an opportunity to ignore.

548
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,579
I think we have no choice.

549
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:20,625
We must stop the orcs
from opening the portal.

550
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:23,002
But we will need help.

551
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,046
And if he's lying?

552
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,214
Orcs do not lie.

553
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:27,423
What if he is?

554
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:29,549
There is no honor in it.
And where is the honor

555
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,350
in him betraying his own people?

556
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,805
Durotan is protecting his clan.

557
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,473
His enemy is the Fel.

558
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,142
Gul'Dan is the betrayer.

559
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:39,811
This orc, Durotan...

560
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,396
How do you know him?

561
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:42,564
He freed me.

562
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:44,774
And he is loved by his clan.

563
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,235
He is a strong Chieftain.

564
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:50,572
Strong chiefs must earn
their clan's trust.

565
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:54,492
If we are to expect you to join us,

566
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,203
we must earn yours.

567
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:08,089
To defend yourself.

568
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:10,758
With this?

569
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,719
Yes.

570
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,972
Find the Guardian.

571
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:19,934
What is this?

572
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:22,228
Guardian?

573
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:29,110
The gate. We saw it, in the Morass.

574
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:31,738
I've been putting together
all the clues I can about it.

575
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:33,198
This.

576
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,617
This drawing. Where did you copy it from?

577
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,701
Guardian.

578
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:37,785
And this.

579
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,665
And this.

580
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,542
And this?

581
00:50:45,207 --> 00:50:47,947
I've been researching ever since
I felt the presence of the Fel.

582
00:50:47,997 --> 00:50:49,839
I am the Guardian! Me.

583
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:53,092
Not you. Not yet.

584
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:55,425
I just thought you might appreciate
some help.

585
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,273
Don't presume you can help me.

586
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,401
You have no idea the forces,

587
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:13,071
I contend with.

588
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:16,407
If you want to help,

589
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:19,494
protect the king.

590
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,288
You leave the Fel to me.

591
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:35,843
Interesting choice.

592
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,220
Guardian.

593
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:43,476
Pack up and move to the west gate!

594
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:51,776
You there! Rise from your stall
and get moving. Now!

595
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,660
I need your help. I found a book.

596
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:01,786
Of course you did.

597
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,823
There was an illustration
that showed a gate

598
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:05,375
like the one we saw being built.

599
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:07,041
Sorry. Sorry.

600
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,251
Khadgar.

601
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,630
So then I tried to show the Guardian,
but he became furious.

602
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,215
Burned all my research.

603
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:17,376
He would've burned this, too,
if it hadn't been hidden in my robe.

604
00:52:24,017 --> 00:52:25,810
No, turn the page. Here.

605
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,187
Look.

606
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:29,689
See?

607
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:34,902
What do you think the image means?

608
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:36,362
The orcs were summoned.

609
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,365
From this side of the gate.
They were invited in.

610
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:46,539
And the Guardian burned your research?

611
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,502
He's probably just trying to protect you.

612
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,256
Now go away.

613
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,525
A good spot for an ambush.

614
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:19,405
Our sentries are well placed.

615
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,617
I will check again.

616
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:28,641
I am King Llane.

617
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,727
I'm told you wish to talk.

618
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:40,194
Ask him if they plan
to return to their home.

619
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,581
Our world is destroyed.

620
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,251
There is nothing to go back to.

621
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:58,337
We are not responsible
for destroying your world.

622
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:01,174
War with us will solve nothing.

623
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:11,184
He says, for orcs, war solves everything.

624
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:14,520
Then why is he here?

625
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,027
To save my people.

626
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,823
The Fel takes life
from more than its victims.

627
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,953
It kills the earth and
corrupts those who use it.

628
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,208
Gul'Dan would poison everything
with his death magic.

629
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,294
If my people are to survive,

630
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,838
Gul'Dan must be destroyed!

631
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,009
In two suns,

632
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:47,803
the humans we have captured

633
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,641
will be used to fuel the portal.

634
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,018
If you attack our camp

635
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:56,646
and draw his warriors away,

636
00:55:58,523 --> 00:56:01,901
Frostwolf clan will kill him.

637
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:06,072
Two days.

638
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,076
If we do this,

639
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,162
you will protect my people until then?

640
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:18,084
I will try.

641
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,129
Ambush!

642
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:23,256
It's a trap!

643
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,758
Traitor, die!

644
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,012
Retreat!

645
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:31,264
Back!

646
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,848
Protect our camp!

647
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,518
Fall back!

648
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:38,688
At the rim!

649
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,147
Protect the king!

650
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:05,631
Stay together!

651
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:12,221
Focus, man. Like old times.

652
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:25,067
Stand your ground!

653
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:33,534
Spread out!

654
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:37,663
Swords!

655
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:39,165
Look out!

656
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:41,500
Fall back!

657
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:53,179
You all right?

658
00:57:56,307 --> 00:58:00,102
You're no good to us dead.
Go! I'll get the others.

659
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:02,688
Fall back!

660
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:04,231
We're all getting out.

661
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,941
Medivh will cover our retreat.

662
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:10,655
Spread out!

663
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,241
Protect the rear!

664
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:15,409
Watch out!

665
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:20,706
Garona!

666
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:24,460
Stay together!

667
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,091
Fall back!

668
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,594
Cover your ground!

669
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,471
Where's the bloody Guardian?

670
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,556
At the rear!

671
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,396
Protect the king.

672
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:44,814
I got them.

673
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:02,957
Shield formation!

674
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,462
Kill the beast!

675
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,092
Retreat to the plateau!

676
00:59:56,177 --> 00:59:57,178
Fall back!

677
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,201
Medivh.

678
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,499
Medivh! Take it down!

679
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:39,553
Medivh!

680
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,353
Hold on, son.

681
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,981
Dad.

682
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:55,319
For Azeroth.

683
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,155
Medivh!

684
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:40,698
Callan.

685
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:50,684
He's here.

686
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:56,148
What's wrong with him?

687
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,816
We need to get him to Karazhan.

688
01:02:57,942 --> 01:02:58,984
I'll get the horses.

689
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:00,525
You won't make it in time by road.

690
01:03:00,553 --> 01:03:01,930
Take one of my birds.

691
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:12,915
Place him in the font.

692
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:16,653
Moroes, what's wrong with him?

693
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,879
I told him not to leave Karazhan.

694
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:36,230
I have to go.

695
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:38,941
We need the help of the Kirin Tor. Now!

696
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:40,067
Go.

697
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,569
There are medicines I must prepare.
Sit with him.

698
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,618
You and the baby must leave now!

699
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:54,456
You are a traitor, Durotan.

700
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,750
No.

701
01:03:57,001 --> 01:04:00,629
One who values what we once were.
Like you used to.

702
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:02,673
That time has passed.

703
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,092
We are but fuel for the Fel now.

704
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,011
There is still hope, Blackhand.

705
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:09,471
Our children.

706
01:04:18,439 --> 01:04:21,608
Do not make me take more innocent lives,

707
01:04:21,734 --> 01:04:23,027
young Chieftain.

708
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,240
If I submit...

709
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:32,369
Would you let my people be?

710
01:04:42,755 --> 01:04:44,590
What will I call our son?

711
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:50,637
Go'el.

712
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,322
You.

713
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:10,908
Where's the old man?

714
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,035
He told me to watch you.

715
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,497
The king?

716
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,248
He is alive.

717
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:22,544
Lothar's son is dead.

718
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,176
I argued for the meeting.

719
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:33,138
Lothar will hate me.

720
01:05:33,806 --> 01:05:35,265
This upsets you?

721
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,395
He is a great warrior.

722
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:43,440
He defends his people well.

723
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,527
A good mate for an orc.

724
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,029
I am no orc.

725
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,283
I am no human either.

726
01:05:56,453 --> 01:06:01,125
When I was younger,
I used to feel apart from my kin.

727
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:06,755
I traveled far and wide, looking for

728
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:08,924
wisdom.

729
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,343
Feel a connection with all the souls

730
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:14,054
I was charged with protecting.

731
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,391
In my travels, I met a strong

732
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:19,309
and noble people.

733
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,312
Among them, a female.

734
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,607
Who accepted me for who I was.

735
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,818
Who loved me.

736
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:36,285
It was not a life I was fated to have,
but it taught me something.

737
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,996
If love is what you need,

738
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:43,917
you must be willing to travel
to the ends of the world to find it.

739
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,508
You left your mate.

740
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:53,260
Go find Lothar.

741
01:07:15,324 --> 01:07:17,534
Step inside the circle.

742
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:27,544
This

743
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:32,299
is my gift to you, Garona.

744
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:05,332
Whole world in exchange for a statue.

745
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:08,543
Gods are strange creatures.

746
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,507
Frostwolves.

747
01:08:13,674 --> 01:08:16,385
You are a practical people.

748
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:20,013
Those of us from the south have
always admired that about you.

749
01:08:26,687 --> 01:08:28,522
When the portal opens

750
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:31,400
and the rest of the Horde join us,

751
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:34,611
we will gift them the Fel.

752
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:36,280
All of them.

753
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,073
Durotan did not agree to this!

754
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,993
And why would you care
what that traitor thinks?

755
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:45,539
It is time for a new leader
of the Frostwolf clan.

756
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,583
One who has the best interests
of his orcs in mind.

757
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:52,170
One who appreciates Gul'Dan's vision.

758
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:57,217
His power.

759
01:08:58,719 --> 01:08:59,886
Come...

760
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,889
I will grant you the Fel.

761
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,892
Durotan,

762
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:09,604
he has poisoned the Frostwolves
against Fel.

763
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:11,940
Let me gather them.

764
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:14,234
Bring them here.

765
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,570
Grant me the Fel in front of them.

766
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:20,198
Let them see how much stronger I become.

767
01:09:21,992 --> 01:09:23,827
As I said,

768
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,829
a practical people.

769
01:09:27,706 --> 01:09:30,083
This is a new dawn.

770
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,586
The time of the Horde.

771
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:34,755
Be feared

772
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:38,258
or be fuel.

773
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,314
I'm sorry.

774
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:56,485
Callan's mother

775
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:00,489
died in childbirth.

776
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:06,036
I blamed him for it

777
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:08,080
for years.

778
01:10:08,914 --> 01:10:10,791
I'm not gonna blame you.

779
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:22,469
He was so young.

780
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,191
In my entire life,

781
01:10:39,361 --> 01:10:43,156
I've never felt as much pain as I do now.

782
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:51,206
No...

783
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,667
No!

784
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,713
Move out. Go!

785
01:10:58,922 --> 01:10:59,923
Move!

786
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:03,093
Gul'Dan does not want to waste
his power on the Frostwolves.

787
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,678
Burn them!

788
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:12,853
Take the weak, kill the strong!

789
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:24,656
Get them!

790
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:31,788
I'll bathe in your blood!

791
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:32,956
Maybe.

792
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,207
But not now.

793
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:36,460
I can't give you long,

794
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:38,044
but I can give you a head start.

795
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,716
For the sake of your son, Draka.

796
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:44,551
Leave.

797
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,261
Now.

798
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:49,556
Kill them all!

799
01:11:57,898 --> 01:11:59,816
Burn it down!

800
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:03,403
You should have trusted in your Chieftain,

801
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:05,906
Orgrim Doomhammer.

802
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,251
She's getting away!

803
01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:45,737
Wait for me.

804
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:46,905
Khadgar!

805
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,865
How dare you return here!

806
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:49,950
Get out!

807
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:51,409
I come seeking your Wisdom.

808
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:53,245
There is nothing for you here now.

809
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,163
The Guardian Medivh is unwell.

810
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:56,623
What?

811
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:58,458
He has been poisoned by the Fel.

812
01:12:58,667 --> 01:13:00,502
What? Ridiculous!

813
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,671
What do you know of the Dark Portal?

814
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,214
You come back

815
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:05,632
and accuse the Guardian...

816
01:13:05,799 --> 01:13:06,967
What is Alodi?

817
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,302
How does he know?

818
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:17,644
Alodi.

819
01:13:18,228 --> 01:13:19,521
What is it?

820
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:23,733
An entity from a time before
the Kirin Tor existed.

821
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,987
We think it served a function
similar to that of the Guardian.

822
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:29,155
Protector.

823
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,784
No one beyond the Arch Council
knows of its existence.

824
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:34,661
And it will stay that way.

825
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:38,623
For you to mention it
in the same breath as the Dark Portal

826
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,208
is too much to be mere...

827
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:45,213
Coincidence.

828
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:48,592
Do I go in?

829
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:51,761
I don't know. It's never done that before.

830
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,740
Khadgar...

831
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,241
I know you.

832
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:15,076
From the library.

833
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,163
You're Alodi'?

834
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,460
I used

835
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:27,380
the last of my energies
to summon you here.

836
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:29,507
The Guardian has betrayed us.

837
01:14:30,175 --> 01:14:31,384
Medivh.

838
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:34,220
I saw the Fel in his eyes.

839
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:36,681
He is consumed by it.

840
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:38,725
If he is not stopped,

841
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:40,894
this world will burn.

842
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:44,022
I don't have the power
to defeat a Guardian.

843
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:47,108
Guardian is but a name.

844
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:50,278
The true guardians of this world

845
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:52,656
are the people themselves.

846
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,700
I know you see what the Kirin Tor cannot.

847
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:57,619
It's Why you left them.

848
01:14:57,786 --> 01:14:59,871
No one

849
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,500
can stand against the darkness

850
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:04,918
alone.

851
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:08,463
I don't understand what you want me to do.

852
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:13,593
Yes, you do.

853
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,766
Trust in your friends.

854
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,309
Together

855
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:22,977
you can save this world.

856
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:25,897
Always remember,

857
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,525
from light comes darkness

858
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:30,026
and from darkness...

859
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,071
Light.

860
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:44,582
Up, up.

861
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:54,384
Thank you, Moroes.

862
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,137
You'll recover, Guardian.

863
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,972
You always do.

864
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:00,932
No.

865
01:16:02,517 --> 01:16:04,060
Thank you.

866
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:06,688
For everything you've done.

867
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:25,123
I'm sorry, old friend.

868
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:31,045
Seems that I have let the orcs
into this world.

869
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:34,799
The Fel, it has twisted me.

870
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:38,470
I don't even know what else
I may have done.

871
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:43,266
I just don't remember.

872
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:51,316
Everything I've thought to protect,
I have...

873
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:53,359
Destroyed.

874
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,863
I can't control the Fel.

875
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:02,035
No one can.

876
01:17:14,214 --> 01:17:16,716
Five legions to block Deadwind Pass.

877
01:17:16,883 --> 01:17:21,554
Another 10 here, here, and here,
along Redridge Mountains.

878
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:22,972
Supply lines here.

879
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:26,142
While the Eastern Sea hems them
in both south and east.

880
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:31,064
If we hold these positions,
we will be at our strongest.

881
01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:33,316
Containment.

882
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:35,151
Until there is a better option, yes.

883
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:38,613
And when there's 10 times as many?
What then?

884
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:42,200
If there were easy answers...

885
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:45,161
Our priority must be to stop
the gate from opening.

886
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:47,614
Fail there, and it's just a matter of time

887
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:49,499
before they beat us with sheer numbers.

888
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,251
What do you suggest?

889
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:54,003
Send everything we've got.

890
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:57,257
Destroy the gate, free our people

891
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:58,758
and end the immediate threat.

892
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:00,218
And the orcs that remain?

893
01:18:00,299 --> 01:18:01,604
We'll take care of them later.

894
01:18:01,654 --> 01:18:03,698
After they've ravaged the entire kingdom.

895
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:05,223
My lords.

896
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,016
Medivh, you are up and well.

897
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,518
Ham.

898
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:09,936
I feel...

899
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,813
Restored.

900
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,106
We need you.

901
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:15,024
We've been agonizing over our options.

902
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,277
Some of us believe there are no options.

903
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,835
We need fresh eyes. I have news.

904
01:18:19,696 --> 01:18:21,239
I met with Durotan.

905
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:22,907
You met with Durotan?

906
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:24,617
The rebellion against Gul'Dan

907
01:18:25,285 --> 01:18:27,203
is gaining strength.

908
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:29,372
With their help, we can destroy this gate.

909
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,832
That doesn't change my plan.

910
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:31,916
What plan?

911
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:35,044
Anduin believes we should attack
with full force.

912
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:37,755
I'm concerned it leaves
the rest of the kingdom defenseless.

913
01:18:37,839 --> 01:18:39,382
How many legions would you need

914
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:40,925
to hold the orcs in place?

915
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:43,553
Five for Deadwind Pass.

916
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,025
10 for the Redridge Mountains,

917
01:18:45,075 --> 01:18:46,293
10 more to protect the city.

918
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:48,474
We've already lost 18 legions.

919
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:50,977
That leaves one, two, three.

920
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,186
Can it be done, Medivh?

921
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,480
No, it can't be done.

922
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,401
With three legions,
Frostwolves and my power...

923
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,603
With all due respect, Guardian your powers

924
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,436
have proven unreliable at best, recently.

925
01:19:03,362 --> 01:19:04,754
Llane, have I ever let you down?

926
01:19:04,804 --> 01:19:05,604
Let him down?

927
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,827
Where have you even been
for the last six years?

928
01:19:09,162 --> 01:19:10,163
Please, Anduin...

929
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,289
Medivh is the Guardian.

930
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:13,249
Not the one you remember.

931
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:15,168
He's lost!

932
01:19:15,335 --> 01:19:16,336
He's unstable!

933
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,504
And he won't be there
when you really need him.

934
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:20,673
Find your bearings, Anduin.

935
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,842
I would march into Hell for you

936
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:25,595
if I thought there was
the slightest chance of victory.

937
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:28,097
But there isn't. This is suicide.

938
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:29,223
Is this about Callan?

939
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:32,602
It was a tragedy.

940
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:35,438
If he hadn't been trying so hard
to win your approval

941
01:19:35,519 --> 01:19:36,911
he might still be with us today.

942
01:19:36,961 --> 01:19:38,107
Medivh.

943
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,109
Callan wasn't ready, you knew it.

944
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,861
And you let him play soldier anyway.

945
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:43,363
Anduin, stop! No!

946
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:44,530
You killed him!

947
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:45,782
Just save!

948
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:47,297
Commander, please, sir! Please!

949
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:48,785
Varis.

950
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:51,537
Take him to a cell to calm down.

951
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:54,666
You are no use to us like this.

952
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,972
We'll protect the kingdom, my lord.

953
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,057
You and I.

954
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:25,613
Why are you here?

955
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:27,240
The King.

956
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:30,159
He goes to fight the Horde.

957
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,038
With your Guardian's help

958
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,082
Durotan will kill Gul'Dan.

959
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:37,458
Don't trust him.

960
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,210
I have told you, orcs do not lie.

961
01:20:39,419 --> 01:20:40,670
Not Durotan.

962
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:45,842
Don't trust Medivh.

963
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:52,432
I will try to protect your king.

964
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:55,101
Don't go with them.

965
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,436
Why?

966
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:01,232
I don't want you to get hurt.

967
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:16,873
Come back alive.

968
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:27,633
- Free us.
- We're thirsty!

969
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:34,390
Spare us! Spare us!

970
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:39,771
Please! We need your help!

971
01:21:39,854 --> 01:21:41,439
Hey! Frostwolf!

972
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,986
Now, you're enemies with all sides.

973
01:21:47,153 --> 01:21:48,738
I'll tell them it was you.

974
01:22:03,211 --> 01:22:04,545
What happened?

975
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:09,133
I'm sorry, Durotan.

976
01:22:10,343 --> 01:22:13,262
I did not see how we could side
with the humans,

977
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:15,223
against our own kind.

978
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:18,184
I was wrong.

979
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:21,354
Gul'Dan's Fel magic is destroying us.

980
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,281
Safe. Where's Drake?

981
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,367
But the rest...

982
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:40,873
They wouldn't follow him
if they could see what he has become.

983
01:22:43,543 --> 01:22:45,378
Then I'll show them.

984
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,157
There is no other man I would entrust

985
01:23:14,282 --> 01:23:15,992
the safety of my family to, Varian.

986
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,370
Keep them safe while I'm gone.

987
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:34,135
Ready?

988
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:37,722
I would feel better
if Lothar were riding with us.

989
01:23:38,306 --> 01:23:39,432
We'll be fine.

990
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:42,685
I will return to Karazhan,
get ready for battle.

991
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:45,354
Find me at the portal.

992
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:00,745
Whoa, whoa, Whoa!

993
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:07,335
Psst.

994
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,086
Guard!

995
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:13,633
I know you're just doing your job.
And a good one at that.

996
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:16,677
But I've cooled down now.

997
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,764
So, if you'd just come
and open this gate...

998
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:21,849
So I can protect the King.

999
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:26,562
Open the gates!

1000
01:24:26,646 --> 01:24:27,733
I am just following my...

1001
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:37,907
Where the hell have you been?
The Kirin Tor.

1002
01:24:38,908 --> 01:24:41,494
It only works on the simple-minded.
Lasts about a minute.

1003
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,454
Your armor, Commander.

1004
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:46,123
Sorry.

1005
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:52,546
They have a full day ahead of us.

1006
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:54,645
I just hope we're not too late.

1007
01:24:54,695 --> 01:24:55,696
We can't go after them.

1008
01:24:55,881 --> 01:24:57,273
Not if you want to save Azeroth.

1009
01:24:57,323 --> 01:24:59,408
My King needs me!
Azeroth needs you more!

1010
01:25:00,513 --> 01:25:03,766
If you want to save your King,
we need to stop Medivh first.

1011
01:25:14,277 --> 01:25:15,361
Where is Medivh?

1012
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:18,364
We've got a demon to kill.

1013
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:25,997
Can't be far. Search over there.

1014
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,041
I need that baby.

1015
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:33,004
Check everywhere!

1016
01:25:39,844 --> 01:25:41,262
Search on the road!

1017
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:45,516
Remember,

1018
01:25:46,392 --> 01:25:48,561
you are the son of Durotan and Draka,

1019
01:25:48,686 --> 01:25:50,771
an unbroken line of Chieftains.

1020
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:53,357
Search by the river.

1021
01:26:39,737 --> 01:26:41,030
I am Durotan.

1022
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,657
Son of Garad.

1023
01:26:44,909 --> 01:26:47,036
Chieftain of the Frostwolf clan.

1024
01:26:47,495 --> 01:26:50,623
And I am here to kill Gul'Dan.

1025
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:54,960
A ghost cannot invoke < mak'gora >.

1026
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,464
You are the Chieftain of no clan.

1027
01:26:58,798 --> 01:27:00,591
Your people are food for worms.

1028
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:05,179
Some of us still live, Warchief.

1029
01:27:09,266 --> 01:27:11,185
Shall I make a quick end of them?

1030
01:27:12,103 --> 01:27:14,451
I always thought you were one
for tradition, Blackhand.

1031
01:27:17,817 --> 01:27:19,151
Durotan.

1032
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:24,740
Your clan was weak and you are a traitor.

1033
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:27,827
I accept your challenge

1034
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:32,081
if only to personally rip
the heart out of your pathetic body.

1035
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:33,791
What of the portal?

1036
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:36,627
You must be ready
when the incantation begins.

1037
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,171
This won't take long.

1038
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,674
Crush him, Gul'Dan!

1039
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,937
It's the incantation
to the orc home world.

1040
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:23,025
He's opening the portal.
We need to shut him up.

1041
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:28,781
The incantation...

1042
01:29:29,657 --> 01:29:31,575
I have no time for this.

1043
01:29:31,784 --> 01:29:32,910
Blackhand!

1044
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:40,751
This is a < mak'gora >.

1045
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:44,964
You will respect our tradition.

1046
01:29:45,965 --> 01:29:47,091
Keep fighting.

1047
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,267
Gul'Dan cheats!

1048
01:30:04,942 --> 01:30:05,985
That's cheating!

1049
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:07,152
Shame on you!

1050
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:08,654
You cheat, Gul'Dan!

1051
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:10,489
This is not our way!

1052
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,324
Traitor!

1053
01:30:28,299 --> 01:30:29,341
Gul'Dan!

1054
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:34,888
You have no honor.

1055
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:23,395
You will follow this thing?

1056
01:31:29,193 --> 01:31:30,402
Will you?

1057
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,158
You will follow this demon?

1058
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:37,576
We will not!

1059
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:38,827
I will not.

1060
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:40,204
Demon!

1061
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:41,634
He does not even look orc now!

1062
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:43,957
I follow a true orc!

1063
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,336
A Chieftain.

1064
01:31:53,676 --> 01:31:55,844
May your bones rot, demon!

1065
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:02,935
Anyone else?

1066
01:32:07,106 --> 01:32:08,941
And you, Warchief.

1067
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:11,110
You will take the Fel

1068
01:32:11,193 --> 01:32:14,613
and you will become stronger
than any orc has ever been.

1069
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:17,032
And when the Fel has remade you,

1070
01:32:17,116 --> 01:32:19,576
you will crush the small-teeth.

1071
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:25,499
Now claim my new world.

1072
01:32:35,384 --> 01:32:36,427
Frostwolves.

1073
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:41,181
We are on our own now.

1074
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,058
We few, then.

1075
01:32:53,152 --> 01:32:55,070
Get to the prisoners.

1076
01:32:55,154 --> 01:32:56,989
We will free our people!

1077
01:32:58,323 --> 01:32:59,658
Charge!

1078
01:32:59,742 --> 01:33:01,243
Get to it, men!

1079
01:33:01,452 --> 01:33:02,494
Move!

1080
01:33:08,876 --> 01:33:10,252
Attack!

1081
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:13,881
Ideas?

1082
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:21,346
Very impressive.

1083
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,599
Now try shutting him up.

1084
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:27,478
Well, that went well.

1085
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:33,650
It's moving! Do something!

1086
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:35,360
Fine.

1087
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:36,862
I'll handle this.

1088
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:39,074
You take care of Medivh.

1089
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,123
Hey, over here!

1090
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:49,374
Clay face!

1091
01:34:09,478 --> 01:34:10,521
Now, men!

1092
01:34:11,814 --> 01:34:12,981
Fire!

1093
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:43,720
At the rear!

1094
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:02,781
Come, my orcs.

1095
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:07,327
Let the Fel unleash
the full power of the Horde!

1096
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:16,712
For Gul'Dan!

1097
01:35:16,795 --> 01:35:18,130
For the Horde!

1098
01:36:05,552 --> 01:36:07,638
Hey! Kid, wake up!

1099
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:11,391
You all right?

1100
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:16,063
Quick thinking.

1101
01:36:16,188 --> 01:36:18,190
Slicing its head off like that. Yeah.

1102
01:36:18,565 --> 01:36:20,484
Just how I planned it.

1103
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,028
What now?

1104
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:25,697
The Guardian has to speak
the incantation himself.

1105
01:36:26,782 --> 01:36:29,701
As long as he's doing that,
we can get in close.

1106
01:36:30,535 --> 01:36:31,703
Distract him.

1107
01:36:32,037 --> 01:36:33,038
Then what?

1108
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:35,582
Get Medivh in the font.

1109
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:38,669
Is that all?

1110
01:36:50,973 --> 01:36:52,015
Medivh.

1111
01:36:52,933 --> 01:36:55,894
If there is something of you
still in there, old friend,

1112
01:36:57,688 --> 01:36:58,730
come back to us.

1113
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:21,044
Medivh.

1114
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:33,598
Come on.

1115
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:35,225
Kill me.

1116
01:37:37,644 --> 01:37:40,313
I've got nothing left
to live for now anyway.

1117
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:46,945
After all, life is just fuel to you,
isn't it?

1118
01:37:48,739 --> 01:37:50,866
But Llane, he believed in you.

1119
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:54,327
Don't kill your king.

1120
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:57,622
Don't kill your friend.

1121
01:38:06,048 --> 01:38:07,591
Whatever you plan to do, kid,

1122
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,177
do it now!

1123
01:38:15,474 --> 01:38:16,558
Now.

1124
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:20,145
Now! Now!

1125
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:22,314
Now, kid!

1126
01:38:30,447 --> 01:38:32,407
The portal, it's closing! Then do it now!

1127
01:38:32,491 --> 01:38:33,658
No.

1128
01:39:06,024 --> 01:39:07,359
You're stronger than he is.

1129
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:27,838
From light comes darkness,

1130
01:39:28,922 --> 01:39:30,549
and from darkness,

1131
01:39:31,383 --> 01:39:32,551
light.

1132
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:51,027
Show me your eyes.

1133
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:02,122
I have to go.

1134
01:40:08,712 --> 01:40:09,796
I'm proud of you.

1135
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:38,700
Stormwind.

1136
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:42,913
My lord! Through the portal, Stormwind!

1137
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:45,540
Thank you, Guardian.

1138
01:40:45,624 --> 01:40:46,625
Varis.

1139
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:48,376
Legion, forward!

1140
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:51,630
Attack!

1141
01:40:52,589 --> 01:40:54,299
Garona, ride with me.

1142
01:41:12,108 --> 01:41:13,151
Run!

1143
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:21,993
Varis, set the men in a perimeter.

1144
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:25,664
Garona, Karos, take what men
we can spare and free the prisoners.

1145
01:41:25,789 --> 01:41:27,540
And send them through to Stormwind.

1146
01:41:27,832 --> 01:41:29,626
Form a line, shield to shield!

1147
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:31,169
We will hold as long as we can.

1148
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:34,172
Get to the portal!

1149
01:41:36,216 --> 01:41:37,217
Go!

1150
01:41:37,384 --> 01:41:39,886
Mercy! Thank you!

1151
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:44,015
Stormwind.

1152
01:41:56,444 --> 01:41:57,862
Need more powder!

1153
01:42:01,658 --> 01:42:03,159
Help me push!

1154
01:42:04,536 --> 01:42:05,954
Come on, boys!

1155
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:08,039
Put some spunk into it!

1156
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:20,051
Go around! We'll attack them
from behind the portal!

1157
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:29,102
Watch your flank!

1158
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:31,813
Take care of him.

1159
01:42:38,278 --> 01:42:39,696
We should leave!

1160
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:42,282
We save as many of our people as we can!

1161
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:48,747
It's the loneliness.

1162
01:42:49,289 --> 01:42:51,207
It makes us weak.

1163
01:42:52,542 --> 01:42:53,668
Khadgar.

1164
01:42:56,755 --> 01:42:58,298
I'm sorry.

1165
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:02,427
I wanted to save us all.

1166
01:43:05,597 --> 01:43:06,681
I always did.

1167
01:43:22,405 --> 01:43:23,490
No!

1168
01:43:23,573 --> 01:43:24,616
It's closed!

1169
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:28,286
We've lost the Guardian.

1170
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:29,746
No, no, no!

1171
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:14,666
Blackhand comes to claim
the honor of killing you.

1172
01:44:20,463 --> 01:44:21,506
Garona.

1173
01:44:23,341 --> 01:44:25,343
No good will come from us both dying.

1174
01:44:26,845 --> 01:44:28,012
Look around you.

1175
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,181
We're surrounded.

1176
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:35,103
Your killing me is the only hope
we have for peace.

1177
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:39,566
You told Lady Taria that killing her
would bring you honor.

1178
01:44:40,525 --> 01:44:43,027
Well, killing me will make you a hero.

1179
01:44:46,823 --> 01:44:48,074
Survive.

1180
01:44:49,284 --> 01:44:51,995
Bring peace between orcs and humans.

1181
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:56,332
You must.

1182
01:45:14,934 --> 01:45:16,311
« You must. »

1183
01:45:42,629 --> 01:45:44,047
No! My lord!

1184
01:46:02,023 --> 01:46:04,108
She has killed their Chieftain, Gul'Dan.

1185
01:46:05,735 --> 01:46:08,029
The Horde embraces you.

1186
01:46:10,532 --> 01:46:11,699
Orc.

1187
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:47,151
Huh?

1188
01:47:49,672 --> 01:47:51,382
< Mak'gora >.

1189
01:49:05,957 --> 01:49:07,208
For my son.

1190
01:49:15,967 --> 01:49:17,218
Kill him.

1191
01:49:22,557 --> 01:49:23,808
Kill him!

1192
01:49:28,146 --> 01:49:29,147
Gul'Dan!

1193
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:31,858
The < mak'gora > is sacred.

1194
01:49:32,525 --> 01:49:35,027
The human won. Fairly.

1195
01:49:36,362 --> 01:49:38,364
Let your warriors honor their tradition.

1196
01:49:38,614 --> 01:49:40,783
I will not be disobeyed!

1197
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,328
What are you waiting for?

1198
01:49:50,168 --> 01:49:51,836
Do as I say!

1199
01:49:53,838 --> 01:49:55,131
Traitors!

1200
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:01,471
Get out of my way. I'll do it myself!

1201
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:03,306
Who will obey you?

1202
01:50:03,473 --> 01:50:06,100
If you go to war with your own kind...

1203
01:50:06,267 --> 01:50:09,020
If you do this, you will lose the Horde.

1204
01:50:09,812 --> 01:50:12,148
And this war is only beginning.

1205
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:53,481
For your son.

1206
01:50:57,902 --> 01:51:00,112
So your spirit can teach him.

1207
01:51:31,978 --> 01:51:33,062
Garona's dagger.

1208
01:51:34,939 --> 01:51:36,691
I pulled that from Llane's neck.

1209
01:51:37,358 --> 01:51:38,967
Well, there has to be an explanation.

1210
01:51:39,569 --> 01:51:41,195
Yes.

1211
01:51:41,404 --> 01:51:43,281
She made her choice.

1212
01:51:44,323 --> 01:51:45,700
I don't believe that.

1213
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:51,914
Maybe you and I didn't know her
as well as we thought we did.

1214
01:51:55,918 --> 01:51:59,922
« There is no greater
blessing a city can have »

1215
01:52:00,506 --> 01:52:01,966
than a king

1216
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,470
who would sacrifice himself
for his people.

1217
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:11,934
But such a sacrifice must be earned.

1218
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:14,145
We must deserve it.

1219
01:52:15,271 --> 01:52:19,483
If we only show our unity
to mourn a good man's death,

1220
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:22,111
was King Llane wrong to believe in you?

1221
01:52:22,612 --> 01:52:23,863
No!

1222
01:52:25,489 --> 01:52:27,283
We will avenge him, my lady!

1223
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:31,162
Lead us against the orcs, Lothar!

1224
01:52:31,621 --> 01:52:34,624
Lothar! Lothar! Lothar!

1225
01:52:49,013 --> 01:52:50,348
For Azeroth!

1226
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,683
For Azeroth and the Alliance!

1227
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:54,769
For Azeroth!

1228
01:52:55,519 --> 01:52:57,647
For the Alliance!

1229
01:53:21,545 --> 01:53:24,006
« You will travel far, my little Go'el. »

1230
01:53:29,804 --> 01:53:33,349
« My world may be lost,
but this is your world now. »

1231
01:53:34,725 --> 01:53:36,894
« Take what you need from it. »

1232
01:53:36,978 --> 01:53:40,648
« Make a home for the orcs
and let no one stand in your way. »

1233
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:45,945
My lord, you should see this.

1234
01:53:47,363 --> 01:53:50,408
« You are the son of Durotan and Draka, »

1235
01:53:50,908 --> 01:53:53,327
« an unbroken line of Chieftains. »

1236
01:53:53,411 --> 01:53:56,580
« And our people need a leader
now more than ever. »
