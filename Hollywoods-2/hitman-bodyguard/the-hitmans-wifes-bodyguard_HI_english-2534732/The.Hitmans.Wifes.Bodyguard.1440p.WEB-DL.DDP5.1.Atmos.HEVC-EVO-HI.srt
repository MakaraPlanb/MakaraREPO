evasive-car maneuvers,</i>

9
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,557
<i>the best gun-handling skills.</i>

10

he even has the best hair,</i>

11
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,562

his clients wear seat belts.</i>

12
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,032

13

14

The final award for the
Triple-A Bodyguard of the Year.

15
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,742
And the winner is...

16
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:17,845
my personal hero,

17
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,748
Michael Bryce!

18
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,984
- [man 1] Yes!
- [crowd cheering]

19
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,451
What?

20
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,419
[man 2] Well done, mate.

21
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,288
[cheering continues]

22
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:31,525
[man 3] Good job, Michael.

23
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,494
[grunts] So heavy.

- [slow clapping, faint]

31
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,000
- [whispers] Kurosawa.
- Michael-san.

32
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,221
[in Japanese]
Safe travels.

33
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,758
Why couldn't you protect me?

34
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,107
[gunshot]

35
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,077
Ticktock, motherfucker.

36
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,611
[Michael screams]

37
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,518
And how often
do you have this dream?

38
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,587
- Just once...
- Oh. Well, that's not too...

39
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,957
- ...a night.
- Right.

40
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,758
Mostly when I'm asleep.

41
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,827
It's what my life
was supposed to be.

42
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:41,963
I was the perfect
executive protection agent

43
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:47,134
till I lost it all when Darius Kincaid
killed my most important client.

44
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,468
- [gun cocks]
- [gunshot]

45
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,073
Darius Kincaid,
is he a relative of yours?

46
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,141
[Michael] God, no.

47
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:57,178
He's a hitman wanted for, like,
a zillion murders around the world.

48
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,980
<i>Even took a bullet for him.</i>

49
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,949
The Bodyguarding Committee,
they wouldn't recognize it.

50
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:04,551
Apparently, they don't take
kindly to protecting sociopaths.

51
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,188
So in two weeks, I have to go
in front of a tribunal

52
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,489
and try to get my Triple-A
rated license back.

53
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,194
To deal with the future,
we sometimes have to deal with the past.

54
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:17,464
Quite often validation issues
stem from a disapproving father.

55
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,501
I don't have validation issues.
I have a licensing issue.

56
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,704
I am a bodyguard
without a license.

57
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:27,474
That's like being a belly
dancer without a torso.

58
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,211
I'm thinking you need to
forget bodyguarding for a while

59
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,013
and find happiness within.

60
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,114
Within what?

61
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,849
Within yourself.

62
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,051
Happiness in who you are.

63
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,054
I'm listening.

64
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,989
Well, first things first,

65
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:45,760
I think, uh, all the guns and
violence are weighing on your soul.

66
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,595
So you need to get away
and clear your mind,

67
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,799
and then you can find
your future self.

68
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,902
Wait, wait. Like...

69
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:58,672
Like a cool futuristic
bodyguard with super powers?

70
00:03:58,706 --> 00:03:59,974
No, will you stop...

71
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,610
[sighs] Stop thinking
about bodyguarding.

72
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,148
Do you have
a dream vacation at all?

73
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,483
I've heard Italy is lovely at this
time of year, so how about Tuscany?

74
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,955
No, no, no. Not Tuscany. No Tuscany.
Anything but Tuscany.

75
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,756
Okay, uh, Capri then.

76
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,791
Capri.

77
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,193
Like the pants.

78
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,897
Also, a lot of clients
find it helpful

79
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,933
writing journal letters
to their future self

80
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,969
- or recording voice memos.
- [gasps]

81
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:30,905
What if I call him?

82
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,975
I could leave him voice messages.
I have my phone with me all the time.

83
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,609
Joanne, this is great.

84
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,611
I feel like we're making
really great progress here.

85
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,149
- So do I, yeah.
- [laughs]

86
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:44,852
And don't feel like you need
to check in with me again.

87
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,954
I mean, this is very much
your journey now.

88
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:50,191
- [whispers] My journey.
- You've graduated therapy.

89
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:52,026
Graduated?

90
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,493
Repeat after me.

91
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,098
"No bodyguarding."

92
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,734
N... No...

...bodyguarding.

96
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,109
- Good. And no guns.
- Hmm.

97
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,276
No guns.

98
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,746
Wait. No, no, hold on.
Can I, uh...

99
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,580
- Can I keep my pen knife though?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,750
- It's a very functional tool.
- You can keep your pen knife.

101
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:18,819
Just you and your future self
finding happiness within.

102
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:20,821
- Future self.
- That's the only two people

103
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:22,323
that you need to be protecting

104
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:24,258
- right now, okay?
- Right. Yeah. Okay.

105
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,559
- I can't believe I graduated therapy.
- I know. Congratulations.

00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,470
No! No, no, no. I said...

342
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,973
Baby, I need help.

343
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:33,440
Get anyone...

344
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:36,476
- ...but Michael Bryce.
- [Sonia] What?

345
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,445
Didn't he save
your <i>cucaracha's</i> ass?

346
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,748
[Darius] Doesn't mean I got
to be best friends with him.

347
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:44,684
He is the most annoying
motherfucker on planet Earth.

348
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:46,419
Excuse me?

349
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,688
I have 20/20 hearing.
I can hear you.

350
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:50,892
The dead guys can hear you.

351
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:53,861
And what do you mean I'm the most
annoying motherfucker on planet Earth?

352
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:55,897
How many times have you
nearly got me killed?

353
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,732
Not enough.

354
00:19:57,765 --> 00:19:59,499
Come on, baby.
Let's get out of here

355
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,069
before he starts the in-flight
safety demonstration.

356
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,537
[screams]

357
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,844
Are you using
pepper spray?

358
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:12,713
I'm on sabbatical.

359
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:16,817
And I'm trying to find
my spiritual awa...

360
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:20,021
[gags] Awakening.

361
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,957
[laughing]

362
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:26,593
Motherfucker!
You wouldn't know chi if...

363
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,029
[Michael] Hey!

364
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,766
I didn't have to be here,
you know?

365
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:36,070
I had fresh cucumbers
on my eyes!

366
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:39,572
I had a linen robe with
an insanely high thread count.

367
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,042
It was like sleeping
in a cloud.

368
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:43,911
- [engine revs, tires screech]
- Namaste, motherfucker.

369
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:44,979
[Sonia screams]

370
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:46,513
Darius?

371
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,149
[screams]

372
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:50,251
[O'Neill] The hitman,
the bodyguard and the con woman.

373
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,086
You dumb fucks
just killed Carlo,

374
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,855
the informant that was going
to punch my ticket home.

375
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:56,891
Who the fuck are you?

376
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,693
Interpol Agent Bobby O'Neill.
That's who the fuck I am.

377
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:02,263
And I know who all three
of you shitheads are.

378
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:06,801
Michael Bryce, Triple-A rated bodyguard.
Pillar of the community.

379
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,169
Present. Thank you.

380
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:10,071
Only I know, you lost
your license to protect

381
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,173
when Shotgun Willie there
killed Kurosawa.

382
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:14,075
- No. That's under review, okay?
- Shotgun Willie?

383
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:16,210
- Kincaid took that shot...
- Moreover...

384
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,714
you're still
taking clients.

385
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:22,582
Name one.

386
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,685
The Sultan of Mandara.
Brussels.

387
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,223
Your Majesty, I'm Michael Bryce,
your executive protective agent.

388
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:30,725
Get down! Shots fired!

389
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:32,659
Contact! Contact!

390
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,095
That's a felony, pal.

391
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:36,696
- Fucking Brussels. Fuck!
- [laughing]

392
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:40,101
As for you two, you're looking at
about a billion years in prison.

393
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:41,902
But today
is your lucky day.

394
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:44,005
Because instead of going
to the electric chair,

395
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:46,273
I'm going to give you
a shot at redemption.

396
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:48,743
Now, I got intel
on the mystery big shot

397
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:50,911
that's about to launch
a full-scale cyber attack.

398
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:54,281
Carlo, my now-dead informant,
was gonna buy a hard drive

399
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:56,150
containing the coordinates
for the attack.

400
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:58,618
Why are you looking at me?
I didn't touch Carlo.

401
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,888
Thanks to your bloodbath,
that can't happen.

402
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:04,591
So, you assholes are going to Portofino
and you're going to make the buy instead.

403
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:06,593
Uh, Bob,
uh, quick sidebar?

404
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,666
Listen. Uh, first off,
I am happy to postpone my sabbatical

405
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:15,803
if it's going to keep me
out of jail.

406
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:18,739
But I think you should really
reconsider working with these guys...

407
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:20,141
I don't want to go
to Portofino.

408
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:23,044
...because they're,
you know, fucking crazy.

409
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:24,611
[groans]

410
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:26,180
Fuck! Wow.

411
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:28,215
Okay, cum-for-brains.

412
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:32,353
You are gonna be the goofy bodyguard
for Carlo's British mistress.

413
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,055
While Grumpy Pants here

414
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:35,622
- makes sure that hard drive gets out.
- Grumpy Pants?

415
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,191
- [cell phone rings]
- Are we clear?

416
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:39,093
We can just take
the money and run, baby.

417
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,593
[Sonia] No, I'm tired
of running, Darius.

418
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:42,763
Ah, Superintendent Crowley.
How nice.

419
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:44,999
I don't want to go to
Portofino as his bitch!

420
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,300
Did you see how hard
that guy punches?

421
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,735
This was supposed to be
my honeymoon!

422
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,136
[gunshot]

423
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:52,106
What if somebody's
upstairs?

424
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:53,174
Shut up.

425
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:56,243
- Okay.
- [O'Neill] Change of plans.

426
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:58,712
There's been a heist at a Trieste
shipping dock, and it could be related.

427
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:00,748
But that does not change
what's happening here.

428
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:03,616
Sean Connery here is going to give
you a bunch of money to make the buy.

429
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,853
[O'Neill] See that?
It's your buy money.

430
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,155
One dime goes missing,
you try to go AWOL,

431
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:11,058
and I'm going to slap global Red
fucking Notices on all your asses.

432
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,727
- Oh, no! Not Red Notices.
- Red Notices? What are you doing?

433
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:15,029
Not on me!

434
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:17,164
- What is this, a Nokia?
- Listen to me.

435
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:19,166
- I don't know how to even work this thing.
- Look at me!

436
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,801
- Look at me!
- I'm looking at you.

437
00:23:20,835 --> 00:23:22,803
You stay in close contact
with me, you understand?

438
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:25,039
- I'll call you all the time.
- Shut up. When I call, you answer.

439
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:28,042
And you,
resources are kind of low.

440
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:31,378
I want you to enjoy
your transportation.

441
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:34,315
Do not fuck this up.

442
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:35,950
We're definitely going
to fuck this up.

443
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:37,684
- No, oh, my God!
- He's gonna fuck us up.

444
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:39,652
Look at the two people
you're saddling me with.

445
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,856
- [O'Neill] Get your asses to Portofino!
- There's zero chance

446
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:44,959
we're making it out of this room.
He may as well hire a brain-damaged kitten

447
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:46,360
with yarn to get us
out of this thing...

448
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:47,928
[O'Neill] Your fucking
honeymoon is over.

449
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:51,799
[screams]

450
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,370
[Sonia] I understand some people
get cold feet on their wedding day.

451
00:23:56,403 --> 00:24:01,375
But I would have never thought that you'd
get cold dick on our honeymoon night!

452
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:04,044
Baby, baby.
I said I was sorry.

453
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:06,714
Sorry is not good enough.
I want an explanation.

454
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:08,681
Where the fuck were you?

455
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:10,918
Where were you, Darius?
Just tell her.

456
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,153
I took a job, okay?

457
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:14,054
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Hey! Hey, hey!

458
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:17,224
- Fuck you!
- Perhaps now's a good time

459
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:19,260
to talk about
the seat belt rule.

460
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,896
Perhaps now's a good time to talk
about the shut-the-fuck-up rule.

461
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:24,798
I'm just saying it because she's
driving like a crash test dummy.

462
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,400
Do not criticize my wife's
driving, motherfucker.

463
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,235
Hush, hush, hush.

464
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:30,704
Do you know
what I just realized?

465
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:34,842
I'm not gonna let you crazy
motherfuckers ruin my shit.

466
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,443
[mouthing words]

467
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:38,746
I'll treat this as a lovely
road trip through Italy

468
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:42,750
- and I'll just pretend that you are still my devoted husband.
- I am!

469
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:45,452
And you, Breece, you will be...
you will be the human luggage.

470
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:46,954
- [laughs]
- Yes.

471
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:48,956
We are now on honeymoon.

472
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,925
First of all,
it's a mission.

473
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,127
Second of all,
and just so we're clear,

474
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,463
I promised my therapist no bodyguarding,
so I'm not protecting either one...

475
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:57,965
- Ow!
- This is not mission!

476
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,767
- This is honeymoon!
- What the fuck?

477
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,402
Hey! Eyes on road!

478
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:02,937
Eyes on road!

479
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,440
Babies
need to be created

480
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:08,809
in a stimulating
environment.

481
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:14,248
I must be aroused by sightseeing,
shopping, fine dining,

482
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:16,784
but we are officially
on honeymoon.

483
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:19,086
- For real? Really?
- Did she say fine dining?

484
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,256
Let's not do that, guys.
Let's just focus on the road here.

485
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:25,159
- [both moaning, grunting]
- All right. I got it.

486
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:28,195
No, it's fine. You guys just...
You guys have at it.

487
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:29,797
Maybe feather the brake
a bit.

488
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:32,266
Maybe feather the brake a bit!

489
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,168
["Tu Vuò Fà L'Americano"
playing on radio]

490
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,270
[imitates Italian lyrics]

491
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:39,473
- Yo, let me borrow your phone.
- Why'd you lie to her?

492
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:41,175
The fuck
are you talking about?

493
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,377
You lied to her back there.
You weren't on a job.

494
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,879
And how would you
know that?

495
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:50,918
Because there's, like, 22 body indications
when somebody lies and you exhibited 40.

496
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,359
If you say one word to Sonia about this,
I'll invent new ways to kill your ass.

497
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:01,795
Wow. You must have done
something really serious, Darius.

498
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,497
Honesty's the best policy.

499
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,833
I don't take relationship advice
from single motherfuckers.

500
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:08,102
I don't have a calling plan.
Make it quick.

501
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:10,404
[humming, mumbling]

502
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:16,944
[muffled] Yeah, I was
just wondering if I could...

503
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:18,779
[music continues on radio]

504
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,551
[Darius] I took a job, okay?

505
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:29,590
Portofino has water views,
which means that it's perfect for us...

506
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:31,458
- [Darius] Oh, shit.
- Where are you going?

507
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,294
[tires screech]

508
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:35,863
Sonia! What the fuck?

509
00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:38,198
You better hope that job's
worth it, motherfucker.

510
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:41,068
- What job?
- Let me do it.

511
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:45,306
Who the fuck is this?

512
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:48,242
[woman] <i>We have an availability
for</i> Carmen <i>at 2:00 p.m.</i>

513
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,844
Who the fuck
is Carmen?

514
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:53,981
<i>We have tickets to the opera</i>
Carmen, <i>and you wanted two, no?</i>

515
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:55,082
["Habanera" playing]

516
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,517
- I love <i>Carmen!</i>
- [laughs]

517
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,987
[Sonia] I love Carmen!

518
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:03,924
- [no audible dialogue]
- [music continues]

519
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,435
- [no audible dialogue]
- [music continues]

520
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:19,640
[Sonia moaning]

521
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:21,875
[Darius muttering, moaning]

522
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:25,112
- [Sonia] Let's make a baby!
- [Darius moans, screams]

523
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:27,014
[both moaning]

524
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:29,917
- [Darius coughing]
- [thudding]

525
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,618
What's that thumping?
I can't... Stop.

526
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:34,154
[gasps]

527
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:38,225
Are you people fucking insane?

528
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:40,394
Hey! Watch your mouth!

529
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:43,897
I picked you up from the
street, save you from sunstroke,

530
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,232
and now
you're calling me insane?

531
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:46,967
Sunstroke?

532
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,670
You could go to jail for
leaving a dog in a hot car.

533
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:52,339
And don't even get me started on
the psychological ramifications

534
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,274
of what I heard
you two doing.

535
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:56,243
- Oh, goddamn.
- Is that Valentino?

536
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:57,411
No, it's mine.

537
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,613
Did... Did you spend
the buy money?

538
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:02,349
Come on. They totally
expect us to spend some of it.

539
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:05,686
No, no. Obviously,
I'll cover it with my life savings.

540
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,654
[gasps]
I think that's a great idea.

541
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,191
I'm just going to
make a call.

542
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:13,026
I wish I had
some life savings.

543
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,628
<i>Hello.
You've reached Michael Bryce.</i>

544
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:16,563
<i>Please leave a message
and have a Triple-A day.</i>

545
00:28:16,597 --> 00:28:18,565
[beeps]

546
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,002
That little mission we're on...
Well, we're way off course.

547
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:25,639
Can't even see the course anymore.
Or hear it, for that matter.

548
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:31,178
Uh, my ears are still ringing
from ferocious sexual intercourse

549
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,448
leading to
a rolling quadruple climax.

550
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:37,651
Anyway, I'm venting.
I don't want to vent to you.

551
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:40,120
So, I'll catch up
with you later.

552
00:28:40,154 --> 00:28:42,222
Oh, shit!

553
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:44,992
Who were you talking to?

554
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,628
That's a secret.

555
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:50,097
- I know your secret.
- You do?

556
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,100
You are so lonely that
you were talking to yourself.

557
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,302
Ha!

558
00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:58,005
Listen, Breece.
You really hurt my feelings.

559
00:28:58,038 --> 00:28:59,707
Do you really think
I am crazy?

560
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:03,745
No! I think you're
unusually aggressive.

561
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:06,013
Uh, violent.
But in an unpredictable way.

562
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:08,682
- I would make a great mother, don't you think?
- I think you... Yes.

563
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:13,053
Oh, my God, a child would be so
lucky to have you as its host.

564
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,321
[sighs]

565
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:19,026
Thank you, Breece.
Thank you.

566
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:23,630
It must be
your powerful asexuality

567
00:29:23,664 --> 00:29:26,133
that makes you
such a good listener.

568
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:30,705
Let me guess.
Crowley gave us a shit lead.

569
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:34,341
No one will tell me what was inside.
It was a classified military shipment.

570
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:36,176
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

571
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,479
What are the fucking odds?

572
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:40,614
Seems lightning strikes twice.

573
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:44,117
We need to get
that packing slip.

574
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:45,986
How would you propose
we do that, Mr. Bobby?

575
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:47,722
[sighs]

576
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:51,158
What...

577
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:58,165
[people shouting]

578
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,669
- Jesus, what the fuck are you doing?
- Son of a bitch.

579
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:04,706
Last time I saw
something like this,

580
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:07,040
Bruce Willis was drilling
a hole in an asteroid.

581
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:09,076
[cell phone rings]

582
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,546
Bobby, I'm glad you called.

583
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,515
Listen,
it's a diamond-tipped drill

584
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:17,084
and I know there's a link,
but this drill was fucking massive.

585
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:18,452
[Crowley] <i>You were right.</i>

586
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,120
We picked up some chatter
in our Rome office.

587
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:22,422
The mob are making a buy
in Portofino.

588
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:25,459
They're purchasing classified
coordinates of a large-scale data grid.

589
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,327
<i>We've got
a surveillance team there...</i>

590
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:30,464
- We have a team in Portofino?
- <i>Yeah, moving into position now.</i>

591
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,767
- Get the chopper, get the chopper.
- <i>Oh, Bobby.</i>

592
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,502
If this actually turns out
to be what you say it is,

593
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:38,740
I will personally make sure you
get your transfer back to Boston.

594
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:40,474
Oh, ma'am,
I can't thank you enough.

595
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,409
Thank you so much.
Thank you, ma'am.

596
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:44,278
We're going to Portofino!

597
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,824
[Michael] Let's get into character.
I'm the bodyguard.

598
00:30:56,858 --> 00:30:59,727
Now, let's hear the British
accent of Carlo's mistress.

599
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:02,296
[in British accent] My British
accent is perfect, you fucking cunt.

600
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:05,566
Okay, let's skip the British accent and
go straight to being brutally executed.

601
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,668
<i>How's the sight line, D?</i>

602
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:09,202
[Darius] Mmm, mmm.

603
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,238
Just protecting my asset.

604
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,175
We're here
to see Vladimir.

605
00:31:17,912 --> 00:31:19,112
I'm the bodyguard.

606
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:20,581
Security check.

607
00:31:20,614 --> 00:31:23,383
- [sirens wailing]
- Two minutes out.

608
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:28,121
Crowley's got a team in place.
We gotta call off the buy.

609
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:30,490
If she finds out I've got those
shitheads working for me...

610
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:33,293
- [people cheering, chattering]
- [buzzing]

611
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:35,730
[metal detector beeping]

612
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,333
[line ringing]

613
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,335
- He's not answering the phone.
- Fuck.

614
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:43,403
What did I tell 'em?
Burn the phone. Pick it up!

615
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:46,741
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you very much. Great work.

616
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,711
[electronic music playing]

617
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,515
- Oh, shit.
- What's wrong?

618
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,785
[Michael] <i>Just a former client
and it's fine. He didn't see me.</i>

619
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:03,758
[in British accent]
You must be Vladimir.

620
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,494
Carlo sends his regards.

621
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:09,563
He thought I would
attract less attention.

622
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,299
- Well, he thought wrong...
- [Sonia giggles]

623
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:13,935
...but nobody's complaining.

624
00:32:13,968 --> 00:32:15,669
Son of a bitch.

625
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,643
- You have the security feed yet?
- Getting it now.

626
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:25,479
Don't move till the buy is made
and they're out of the club.

627
00:32:25,512 --> 00:32:27,581
- <i>There's too many civilians.</i>
- Roger that.

628
00:32:34,388 --> 00:32:39,326
These are the classified coordinates
to the entire European data grid.

629
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:41,294
Okay?

630
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:45,900
No, no, no.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

631
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,568
- [device beeps]
- These are proximity-paired.

632
00:32:50,504 --> 00:32:53,808
Until the buyer's fingerprint
disarms the bracelet,

633
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:57,377
I suggest you do not let the
briefcase out of five-meter radius

634
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:59,312
for more than 15 seconds.

635
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:02,549
- If you do, bracelet explodes.
- [beeps]

636
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:04,618
Keep it close.

637
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:10,357
It would be a shame for that beautiful
face to be disintegrated by TNT.

638
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,893
[laughs]

639
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:13,728
The fuck?

640
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,329
<i>I should just pop this
motherfucker right now.</i>

641
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:17,564
Address?

642
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:19,934
Oh, the delivery address?
In Florence.

643
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,836
[Sonia]
Oh, I love Florence.

644
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:24,271
And I adore culture.

645
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:28,341
[Vladimir] You will deliver to the buyer
tomorrow at the Ludovico Gallery auction.

646
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,977
Michael Bryce!

647
00:33:30,011 --> 00:33:32,612
- You have me confused with someone else.
- [man] No, no, no.

648
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:35,248
I'd never forget the face of the man
who saved my life in my darkest hour.

649
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:36,818
- Come on, bro.
- Michael Bryce?

650
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:39,619
Didn't he lose his license
when Kurosawa was killed?

651
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,823
No, no, no. He's got me
mistaken for someone else.

652
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:44,859
- [man] It's Michael Bryce!
- For the record, that's pending review.

653
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,293
- Fuck off!
- [babbling]

654
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:48,428
Hey, guys,
it's Michael Bryce...

655
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:53,400
Why would Carlo hire an unlicensed
bodyguard to protect the love of his life?

656
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,435
Right. You're fired.

657
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:56,536
You're fucking fired!

658
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:59,539
That's true, baby.

659
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:02,409
Carlo always has preferred
younger women.

660
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:03,711
Excuse me?

661
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:06,680
I've seen him
with a woman in her 30s.

662
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:08,281
But never this old.

663
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:11,518
- [laughing] Never.
- No, no, no. Don't laugh.

664
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:12,887
[laughing]

665
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:17,024
[laughing continues,
distorted]

666
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,562
- Here it comes.
- [Vladimir] Old lady, right?

667
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:27,068
[shouting, normal voice] What
the fuck did you just say?

668
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:30,604
You finger-licking
shit monkey,

669
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:34,075
donkey-blowing motherfucker!

670
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:36,309
[swearing in Spanish]

671
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:41,414
That sounded
really Mexican.

672
00:34:41,448 --> 00:34:42,784
Shit.

673
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:44,752
- [mobster] <i>Motherfucker.</i>
- We have a problem.

674
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:47,989

No, I'm freaked out

deeply rich in its timbre?

Yes, it's remarkable,
but a lot of people...

No, motherfucker, it's not his voice.

Stepdad. And I fail to
see how that's relevant.

Why don't you start seeing with
your heart instead of your hate?

973
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:09,696
Yeah?

974
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,499
- "Relevant"? "Heart"? "Hate"?
- You know exactly what I'm talking about!

975
00:52:12,532 --> 00:52:14,001
- All right now, boys.
- I'm sorry, Papa.

976
00:52:14,035 --> 00:52:16,804
No bickering
under my roof, okay?

977
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:18,005
Understood.

- I can eat.

Yeah. I've taken 20 myself.

- Yeah, for, uh... for Darius.

Right, Darius?

my husband at The Hague.

990
00:53:00,014 --> 00:53:01,849
He was very brave.

991
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:04,819
Check it out. Right there.

992
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,890

that looks like a freckle.

He also took a shotgun blast for me.
Last night.

994
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:14,461
Well, actually,
I was wearing Kevlar.

995
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:18,065
Kevlar? Real Triple-A's
never wear Kevlar.

996
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:21,135
'Cause, knowing Bryce
and his trusty penknife,

997
00:53:21,168 --> 00:53:24,105
he'll have the danger all taken
care of before it even gets to that.

999
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:31,212

have been taken out by the penknife.

Ah, yes.

00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:20,061
<i>But it wasn't the rides
he was interested in.</i>

1017
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:22,129
<i>It was the gelato.</i>

1018
00:54:22,163 --> 00:54:25,766
Then what happened?
Did he choose the wrong flavor?

1019
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,600
[Senior] <i>No, my dear.</i>

1020
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:29,937
<i>Fate chose his mother.</i>

1021
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:35,575
<i>To this day, I have no idea why a
full-figured, 290-pound Italian man</i>

1022
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:37,544
<i>wanted to ride
the Paratrooper.</i>

1023
00:54:38,545 --> 00:54:39,914
<i>Truth is, I don't want to know.</i>

1024
00:54:40,715 --> 00:54:43,184
<i>Some things
are best left unsaid.</i>

1025
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:44,885
[screams]

1026
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:46,653
[screaming]

1027
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:49,622
[Senior] <i>And Bryce, well,
he chose to blame himself.</i>

1028
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:52,960
That's why
he loves seat belts.

1029
00:54:52,994 --> 00:54:55,930
Still doesn't explain
why he's so annoying.

1030
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:00,167
You're annoying.

1031
00:55:05,773 --> 00:55:07,008
[sniffles]

1032
00:55:11,178 --> 00:55:13,680
Hey. Hi. Hi.

1033
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:15,548
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1034
00:55:15,582 --> 00:55:17,885
- Do you want me to push you?
- No, no, no. Thank you.

1035
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:22,823
I just... I cry sometimes
when I'm awake.

1036
00:55:22,857 --> 00:55:24,258
So...

1037
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:27,862
Your father told us
what happened to your mother.

1038
00:55:27,895 --> 00:55:33,234
If I'd just ordered peach gelato a
minute sooner, she'd still be alive.

1039
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:36,837
- It's my fault. My bad. I get it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1040
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:39,774
It's not your fault.
You cannot blame yourself.

1041
00:55:39,807 --> 00:55:42,609
I mean, it's perfectly normal
to feel guilty.

1042
00:55:42,642 --> 00:55:44,945
I understand you
better than you think.

1043
00:55:45,678 --> 00:55:48,015
My mother was eaten
by a shark.

1044
00:55:50,617 --> 00:55:54,021
You know, seeing your mother
being devoured by a beast...

1045
00:55:54,055 --> 00:55:57,224
It can really traumatize you.
More than you can think.

1046
00:55:57,258 --> 00:56:02,129
But, my God, has he done
a number on you, honey.

1047
00:56:02,163 --> 00:56:07,101
I mean, you are fucked up
in more ways than I can count.

1048
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:08,869
- Now it all makes sense.
- Yeah.

1049
00:56:08,903 --> 00:56:11,005
Including your obsession
with my boobs.

1050
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:15,675
What? Did you say with your boobs?
I've never thought about your boobs.

1051
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,745
- Not even once.
- Come on.

1052
00:56:17,778 --> 00:56:19,914
- You are obsessed with my boobs.
- Okay. Jesus Christ.

1053
00:56:19,947 --> 00:56:21,315
All right.

1054
00:56:21,348 --> 00:56:24,684
When you saved me,
you very gently cup your hands

1055
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:28,621
and push me by the boobs
to save me from the bullet.

1056
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:30,191
Not a lot of
alternative real estate...

1057
00:56:30,224 --> 00:56:33,227
And I could hear the little
boy inside of you screaming,

1058
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,796
"Mommy, please don't die.
I need you!"

1059
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,364
I don't think that's
what I was screaming.

1060
00:56:37,398 --> 00:56:40,367
I don't sound
like that at all.

1061
00:56:40,401 --> 00:56:43,304
- If it makes you feel any better...
- It doesn't.

1062
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:47,108
- I cannot eat gelato either.
- Right. Doesn't make me feel better.

1063
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:49,710
- I don't care.
- I'm lactose intolerant.

1064
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:52,645
I still don't care,
so...

1065
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:54,882
I'm gonna head back inside.

1066
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:57,384
I think they're serving,
um, self-esteem.

1067
00:56:57,418 --> 00:57:01,956
Okay. Hey, this was great.
It was really, really great.

1068
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:03,390
To get to
the safe house...

1069
00:57:03,424 --> 00:57:06,727
Excellent. Excellent.
Thank you very much.

1070
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,929
[Darius] So we just go up here
and make a right.

1071
00:57:09,897 --> 00:57:10,931
Good news.

1072
00:57:12,032 --> 00:57:14,201
My contact says
everything is all set.

1073
00:57:14,235 --> 00:57:17,171
We'll have that Ti-47 off
of you in no time.

1074
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:19,807
Meanwhile, I'll sort
everything out with Interpol.

1075
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,375
- Sonia.
- Okay?

1076
00:57:21,408 --> 00:57:23,711
Let's let 'em
have a moment together.

1077
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:26,147
Bryce...

1078
00:57:28,415 --> 00:57:29,783
I'm...

1079
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:32,987
sorry about the gelato.

1080
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:36,390
Hey.

1081
00:57:36,423 --> 00:57:40,227
Other guys lose their license
and never come back.

1082
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:44,431
- Look at you. You're gonna be a hero.
- [chuckles]

1083
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:47,168
I'll come down to the
safe house and see you

1084
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:49,870
after I've got
some more information.

1085
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:52,473
I will also have a talk
with the review board,

1086
00:57:52,506 --> 00:57:54,708
see to it you get
a good hearing.

1087
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:56,710
Thank you.

1088
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:59,780
- Thank you, Dad.
- No worries.

1089
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:07,087
- Oh, Bryce, take the Jag.
- ["Uh Uh What Did I Do" playing]

1090
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:11,025
The Jag? The one I wasn't even
allowed to look at as a kid?

1091
00:58:11,058 --> 00:58:13,360
[laughs] You've earned it.

1092
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:17,097
<i>♪ Oh, baby ♪</i>

1093
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:20,467

<i>♪ Oh, baby, uh, uh... ♪</i>

1095
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:24,505
- [Michael sighs]
- [Darius laughs]

1096
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:26,507
Damn,
I love this motherfucking car.

1097
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,342
- [Michael] Yeah!
- [Sonia] But you love me more?

1098
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,344
- Oh, baby!
- [Michael] Whoo!

1099
00:58:30,377 --> 00:58:33,080
- <i>♪ Sweeter than honey, girl ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Hey, hey, hey... ♪</i>

1100
00:58:33,113 --> 00:58:36,884
Can we just acknowledge for one
second that not only are we safe,

1101
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:40,454
but I think I'm going to get
my license back.

1102
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:44,124
All because of my father.
[chuckles]

1103
00:58:44,158 --> 00:58:46,493
I'm so happy for you,
Breece.

1104
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:49,797
Baby...

1105
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:53,434
[sighs]

1106
00:58:53,467 --> 00:58:55,970
...there's something I've
been meaning to tell you.

1107
00:58:57,104 --> 00:58:58,772
Ah... [groans]

1108
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:00,808
- What?
- [Michael] You know, I think I'm gonna...

1109
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:03,077
I'm gonna join Dad's agency.

1110
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,912
- Bryce and Son.
- [body thuds]

1111
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:06,847
That sounds...

1112
00:59:08,015 --> 00:59:09,216
A little cottonmouth.

1113
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:13,754
You guys just can't keep
your hands off each...

1114
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:15,789
[exhales]

1115
00:59:27,268 --> 00:59:29,136
[Michael]
This feels familiar.

1116
00:59:29,169 --> 00:59:31,005
[Darius] I don't spend that
much time with my head in bags.

1117
00:59:31,038 --> 00:59:33,274
[Michael] Do you think maybe
once you could spot the ambush?

1118
00:59:33,307 --> 00:59:35,209
- [Darius] No.
- [Sonia] Watch my hair, motherfucker.

1119
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:36,477
[Darius] Oh.

1120
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:40,781
What in the
A-double-money-sign is that?

1121
00:59:49,323 --> 00:59:52,092
Aristotle Papadopolous.

1122
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:55,262
My darling.

1123
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:59,533
I thought I had
lost you forever.

1124
00:59:59,566 --> 01:00:02,002
So many sleepless nights.

1125
01:00:02,036 --> 01:00:06,206
So long have I wandered
in a maze of despair.

1126
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:11,011
Uh, anybody want to tell me
what the fuck's going on here?

1127
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:13,814
Monaco.

1128
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:17,584
<i>A girl
who had lost her way,</i>

1129
01:00:17,618 --> 01:00:22,289
<i>turning tricks with wealthy
men at craps tables.</i>

1130
01:00:22,323 --> 01:00:26,560
<i>But when she met
a mysterious Greek man,</i>

1131
01:00:26,593 --> 01:00:29,229
<i>he taught her
there was more to life.</i>

1132
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:32,866
<i>A life of art,</i>

1133
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:37,905
<i>literature,
dance and passion.</i>

1134
01:00:37,938 --> 01:00:42,609
<i>She learned to appreciate
the finest things in life.</i>

1135
01:00:42,643 --> 01:00:45,212
<i>But when the cheap decking
aboard his mega yacht</i>

1136
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:47,181
<i>snapped
her beautiful Gucci heel,</i>

1137
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:52,286
<i>fate took another turn.</i>

1138
01:00:53,354 --> 01:00:55,389
<i>She was found by fishermen.</i>

1139
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:59,626
<i>She laid in bed for weeks,
and when she finally woke,</i>

1140
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,363
<i>she had amnesia.</i>

1141
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:06,900
Now, seeing your face,

1142
01:01:06,934 --> 01:01:11,572
and listening to your voice
so closely to my ear,

1143
01:01:11,605 --> 01:01:14,541
it all came rushing
back to me.

1144
01:01:14,575 --> 01:01:17,311
- You've cured me.
- Mmm.

1145
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:20,214
Can you put the hood
back on?

1146
01:01:20,247 --> 01:01:22,516
You got history
with this motherfucker?

1147
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:27,921
And if I'd known earlier
it was you who had my case,

1148
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:33,093
I would've ensured you were
treated like the Aphrodite you are.

1149
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:35,062
Thank you.

1150
01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:40,934
Have these two brought to Lucas and
Francesco in my torture chamber.

1151
01:01:40,968 --> 01:01:42,536
- [Aristotle] It is a fine...
- Torture chamber?

1152
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:45,272
- Did he say "cha-cha chamber"?
- No, motherfucker, he did not.

1153
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:48,175
Perhaps one day you'll learn

1154
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:52,679
that great men don't need to stoop
to vulgarity to express themselves.

1155
01:01:52,714 --> 01:01:54,314
I know how to express
myself, motherfucker.

1156
01:01:54,348 --> 01:01:55,682
- [Aristotle] Take them away!
- Believe me.

1157
01:01:55,717 --> 01:01:57,351
I have not begun
to express myself...

1158
01:01:57,384 --> 01:01:59,420
[Michael] Do we have
separate torture chambers?

1159
01:01:59,453 --> 01:02:01,588
- [Darius shouting, indistinct]
- [beeps]

1160
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:06,560
The final piece
of my master plan

1161
01:02:06,593 --> 01:02:11,565
to win justice
for Europe's atrocities.

1162
01:02:11,598 --> 01:02:15,969
Take it to the technology center
and have my yacht prepared.

1163
01:02:20,742 --> 01:02:21,942
[beeps]

1164
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:30,417
Come with me.
I have something to show you.

1165
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:39,026
[gasps]

1166
01:02:39,928 --> 01:02:43,130
The room we dreamed
of building together.

1167
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:46,033
Oh, Aris.

1168
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:52,139
You ever think that
maybe she's conning you?

1169
01:02:52,172 --> 01:02:54,208
What?

1170
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:57,144
I'm just saying, she's a con woman.
That's what con women do.

1171
01:02:57,177 --> 01:03:01,114
Con person? Person?
I don't know how you say that.

1172
01:03:01,148 --> 01:03:03,383
Can you guys come back later?
We're in the middle of a...

1173
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:05,252
You're gonna tell us
everything you know.

1174
01:03:06,788 --> 01:03:09,189
[both laughing]

1175
01:03:10,557 --> 01:03:12,727
Oh, my God.

1176
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,661
I'm not telling you
a motherf...

1177
01:03:15,429 --> 01:03:17,732
[groaning, screaming]

1178
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:21,668
So you never had a family?

1179
01:03:21,703 --> 01:03:24,739
You were

I don't know where those guys came from.

was Bobby O'Neill.

Probably Robert O'Neill.
That guy was mean.

What? What does that mean?
