Wh... Uh... Timmy wasn't a real OD.

176
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,000
He didn't actually die.

177
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,708
They brought him back.

178
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,375
Ja-jing!

179
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,041
You're both morons.

180
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,583
Which one of us is valedictorian, again?

181
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,541
President of every club
this shithole has to offer.

182
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm getting out of here. Off to claim
my place among the stars, bitch.

183
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,291
Woo! The witch lives!
Long live Sarah Fier!

184
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,458
Woo!

185
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,250
Woo!

186
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,541
Yeah!

187
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,708
Before tonight's game,

188
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,750
out of respect
for last night's tragic events,

189
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,000
Sunnyvale will host
a candlelight vigil for the victims.

190
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,625
All player, cheer and band attendance
is mandatory.

191
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,666
Oh, really? Come on!

192
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,375

209
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,333
I wanted to be here as a fan.

210
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,333
Our Sunnyvale Devils
and your Shadyside Witches

211
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,083
throwing down
some good old American football.

212
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,458
Instead I find myself here

213
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,625
as a husband,

214
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,833
a father, as a neighbor.

215
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,416
And, yes,

216
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,333
mayor of Sunnyvale.

217
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,791
And on behalf of all of the people
in my town,

218
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:26,875
I say all of Sunnyvale mourns with you.

219
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,416
Yeah, really looks like they give a damn.

220
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,791
The only Sunnyvalers who came
were the ones who had to.

221
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,583
The football team and the cheerleaders.

222
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,125
Our hearts are broken with grief.

223
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,250
Sam.

224
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,333
I didn't think you were coming.

225
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,958
I thought you quit band.

226
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, I did. Here.

227
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,666
What...

228
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,500
Is this my stuff?

229
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,625
Ding ding ding.

230
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,875
My family's been
in Sunnyvale for generations,

231
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,958
and now my brother is mayor

232
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,000
and I your sheriff.

233
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,541
We've prospered here.

234
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,791
And yet, I've seen you,
our neighbors in Shadyside,

235
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,291
suffer tragedy after tragedy.

236
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:21,458
It's easy in times like this
to drown in questions of why...

237
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,083
Why this happened.

238
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,666
But I know too well

239
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,000
there are no answers
that will provide relief.

240
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,875
There's no peace found in the past.

241
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,250
- Can we talk for a second?
- No.

242
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,500
You broke up with me! Remember?
So stop acting like I'm the bad guy.

243
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,625
Yeah, well, I'm not the one
who moved to Sunnyvale.

244
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,583
OK, you made the choice.
I just made it official.

245
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,458
My parents got divorced.

246
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,083
I didn't have a choice.

247
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,500
Oh, come on!

248
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,541
You just couldn't wait to start
your new fake life with your fake-ass mom!

249
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,000
I am half an hour away.

250
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,458
It might as well be the goddamn moon,
and you know it.

251
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,458
I don't know anything.

252
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,875
Yeah. Well, I do.

253
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,958
I know you were always too afraid
to tell anyone about us.

254
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,125
I know that.

255
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:15,166
And I know that douchebag out there
was squeezing your ass.

256
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,250
- You broke up with me.
- What's his name?

257
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,875
- You broke up with me!
- What's his name, Sam?

258
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,125
- The dude groping you.
- Stop. Stop!

259
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,250
- Touching you!
- Peter!

260
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,041
His name is Peter!

261
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,791
We must not fall into darkness.

262
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,833
We must look to the light.

263
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:37,250
Yeah!
What we should do is light a fuse

264
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,041
and burn down Shittyside.

265
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,333
What'd you say?

266
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,291
- You don't get it!
- No, no. I do.

267
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:47,500
There's not much of a future
in Shadyside with a lesbo.

268
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,166
Best case is what?

269
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,541
Dead on the mall floor
after a double shift,

270
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,875
or maybe, maybe if you're really lucky,
you're the one carrying the knife.

271
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,041
I said it ain't a tragedy
when it happens every week.

272
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,416
It's a joke.

273
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,083
Jesus. You're doing it again.

274
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,250
<i>Doing what?</i>

275
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,791
- "Welcome to the suck!" "Shit is doomed!"
- Shit is doomed!

276
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,416
<i>It doesn't have to be.</i>

277
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,416
- It's like you want to lose.
- At least I know who I am.

278
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,333
Stop being mad at me
for wanting a different future.

279
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,791
It's not your future
if you're pretending to be someone else.

280
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,916
Say that again, motherfucker!

281
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,958
Stop!

282
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,125
You little green prick!
Come here, you little bitch! Come here!

283
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,500
Suck it in...

284
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,875
- Pieces of shit!
- Yeah!

285
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,875
- They think they can do what they want!
- No!

286
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,291
They ruin our vigil,
then go waltzing back to their mansions,

287
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,416
like we're some reject pile
that they can step on!

288
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
No!

289
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:05,583
Well, we are not the reject pile!

290
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,500
- No!
- This shit ends tonight!

291
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,625
- Yeah!
- What are we gonna do?

292
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,333
We're gonna go kill those preppy assholes!

293
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,250
Yeah!

294
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:19,291
Kate! Kate! Kate!

295
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,583
Kate! Kate!

296
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,583
When I say Shady, you say side!

297
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,333
- Shady!
- Side!

298
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,083
When I say Shady, you say side!

299
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,750
- Shady!
- Side!

300
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,666
When I say Shady, you say side!

301
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,250
- Shady!
- Side!

302
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,041
Goddamn Sunnyvalers.

303
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,708
Yeah! Where are you going?

304
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,750
Guys! Come here! Come here!

305
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,541
- Shady!
- Side!

306
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,083
Woo!

307
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,458
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Hey, isn't that, uh...

308
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,250
Sam.

309
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,333
Where are you going, you pussies?

310
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,000
Sunnyvale sucks!

311
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,500
- Peter, stop! What are you doing?
- Chill out!

312
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,416
Open the door!

313
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:29,583
Open the door!

314
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,625
This is definitely a good idea, right?
Deena?

315
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,125
On three, OK?

316
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,541
- Are you sure?
- One, two...

317
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,208
- Deena!
- What?

318
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:44,833
Your nose!

319
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:53,250
Stop! Stop the bus!

320
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Whew.

321
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,541
Shit, are you alive?

322
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,875
Yeah, I'm alive. Yeah.

323
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:16,416
Sam! What... what are you doing?

324
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:21,875
Sam!

325
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Sam!

326
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,625
Sam!

327
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,541
Are you OK? Oh!

328
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:57,666
I'm so... I'm sorry.

329
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,333
Stay away from her, you bull dyke freak!

330
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,166
Sam, it's me. I'm here.

331
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,625
Did you... see?

332
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,500
What?

333
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,083
Oh shit!

334
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:20,166
OK, we should not be down here.

335
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,291
- Shut up, help me carry her!
- We need to leave, like ten minutes ago.

336
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,750
- We have to clear her airway.
- Quit it!

337
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,958
Hey! I got this. Chill out.

338
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,625
I got this.

339
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:35,125
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Three.

340
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,791
See? She's fine.

341
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,833
- Oh, my God!
- Oh. Ugh!

342
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:43,416
What the fuck?

343
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,583
- Deena Johnson?
- Yeah, two E's.

344
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,708
Wanna tell me what happened?

345
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,000
The car crashed.

346
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,000
Was it pursuing you?

347
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:14,875
Well, it was driving behind the bus.
Does that count as pursuing?

348
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:18,875
The driver said that before the crash
someone opened the emergency exit.

349
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,291
I don't remember that.

350
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,291
No?

351
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,416
He also saw you with the cooler.

352
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,916
Did anyone else see that?

353
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:31,166
Maybe you were just, um... goofing around.

354
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,333
Things got out of hand.

355
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:36,666
- Why don't you tell me what happened?
- I don't know.

356
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,166
I guess...

357
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,041
Sometimes accidents just happen.

358
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,666
We lost control, sir.

359
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,083
Freak accident.

360
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,875
Suck it, pig.

361
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,916
It was just an accident.

362
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,125
Alright.

363
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:54,000
Well, if you do think of anything,

364
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:55,625
give me a call.

365
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,625
I'm on your side.

366
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,666
Yeah, totally.

367
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,000
My car is totaled.

368
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,041
Well, Daddy will buy you a new one.

369
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,166
Shittyside trash.

370
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,166
You are all fucking... dead.

371
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,458
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Yeah?

372
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:21,000
Do it before Dad gets here,
he's gonna murder <i>you!</i>

373
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:25,041
You know the cops called him at work
about some accident last night?

374
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,250
Please get out of my room.

375
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,625
You get out of your room.
You've been in your bed all day!

I just don't understand what he was doing.

456
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:42,625
He was acting all shifty and shit.

457
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,541
Like going through the laundry.

458
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,833
You need to get some groceries, man.

459
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:51,708

465
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,333
he can come and prank us on our own turf.

- About your dipshit boyfriend.

494
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:10,750
- He threatened, "You're all fucking dead."
- That didn't mean anything.

495
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,708
Now tonight, he's stalking around,
messing with us.

496
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,166
He broke into the house
where Kate was babysitting.

497
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,750
No. Peter's been here.

498
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,958
You need to call him
and tell him to back off.

506
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:45,958

507
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,791

508
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,666

511
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,666
He has been with me all night!

512
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,416

- You're out of control!

513
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,500
You put me in the hospital!
Now you're here yelling at me...

514
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:17,958
OK. No, that was an accident.
Look, I got a nosebleed.

515
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:21,083

OK, first, go to hell.

521
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:38,791
Second, yeah.
Congrats on getting out of Shadyside, Sam.

522
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:42,958
All you had to do was suck it up,
literally, and swallow some Sunnyvale...

523
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:46,166
You know what?
I never want to see you again!

524
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,333
Great. Have a nice goddamn life!

525
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,166
Oh my God!

526
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:09,041
- Where'd you learn how to do this?
- Oh, a lot of people trade hacks online.

527
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,250
Nerd.

528
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,875
So, um...

529
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,916
...when'd you get into the fruit business?

530
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:18,750
What?

531
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,291
Um... The, uh... drugs.

532
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:25,416
Oh, that's just temporary.
Saving up to get out of here.

533
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,041
Take me with you.

534
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:36,958
Run!

535
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,875
Did they get back together?

536
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:51,000
<i>Tonight's </i>Unsolved Mysteries,

537
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,000
- Where are the keys? Do you have the keys?
- No!

538
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,416
Where... where are the keys?

539
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,458
Come on. The ambulance!

540
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,666
- No!

Look out!

00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:56,333
Come on!

543
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,875

00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,458
Deena! Come on! Deena!

- Hurry!

550
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,750
You have access to the mall.
You are still employed there, correct?

551
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:30,416
I'mma tell you again.
Somebody planted that.

552
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,083
Those ain't my cans.

553
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,250
You're right, Martin. These...

554
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:39,041
are actually my cans.

555
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,375
Why would I tag my own place of work?

556
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,291
Come on, man!

557
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,000
Martin, around here,
people show a little respect.

558
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,541
They call me Sheriff Goode.

559
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,583
Sheriff Goode?

560
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,250
More like Sheriff motherfucking Evil!

561
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,583
I'm telling you, it was him!

562
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,833
The psycho killer
my colleague shot dead, huh?

563
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,291
Yes! That's what we keep saying!

564
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,833
- What's wrong with you?
- Officer Kapinski.

565
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,041
You told me to come to you.

566
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:17,166
We should not be this close to
the police station in a stolen ambulance.

567
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,916
We're hiding in plain sight.

568
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,458
Yeah, just like Bundy.

569
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,875
Ted Bundy, when he was stalking
his victims, I mean.

570
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:30,666
OK, didn't he get caught though?

571
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:35,791
- Well, no. Well, yeah, but...
- Figure this out. I'm gonna take a leak.

572
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,416
Why do you know so much about killers?

573
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,416
Know thy enemy, right?

574
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:52,125
- You hang onto any of that candy?
- Yeah.

575
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,083
Then his mask came off.

576
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,125
And you saw him?

577
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,375
Yeah. Yeah, the mall killer, Ryan Torres.

578
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:09,958
That's Ryan Torres.

579
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,041
Yes!

580
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,125
Yes, that's him.

581
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:17,416
I know, but you guys must have made
a mistake or something. Look...

582
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,083
- I know what I saw.
- OK.

583
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:24,791
Let me get the right paperwork.

584
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,458
"Dead killer chasing..."

585
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,333

586
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:33,500
or <i>Night of the Living Dead?</i>

587
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:34,416
Wait.

588
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,750
- You don't believe us?
- This was a waste of time.

589
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:41,375
We've had prank calls, we've had reports
of skeleton mask copycats all weekend.

590
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:44,666

with a fucking razor blade!

Wait. What... A razor?

637
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:12,375
Yeah, for like old-timey shaving,
or in this case, I guess, slitting her...

638
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:15,416
Wrists. She slashed her wrists.

639
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,458
Was she singing something?

640
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:22,458

- I always liked this sweater.
- Yeah, I know.

00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,708
If you get blood on it, I'll kill you.

674
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:31,333

675
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,583
There are people trying to kill us.

676
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:38,250
Dead people,
if you believe my weirdo brother.

677
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:42,125
That's not what I meant.

678
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,125
Yeah, I know.

679
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,250
Look, I know I always give you shit
for pretending you're someone you're not,

680
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,375
but it's...

681
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:54,083
It's not really easy for me to...

682
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:58,875

- No.

684
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:11,958
Fine. I'm not gonna say
what I was gonna say.

685
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:13,083

686

Do you really believe that?

694
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:41,083
No one actually thinks
that this witch shit is real.

695
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:44,291
Yeah, it's something babysitters make up
to scare kids.

696
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:45,750
No, no. Just listen to me.

697
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:50,083
1666, Sarah Fier was hanged
for witchcraft, fact.

698
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:53,333
But ever since she was executed,
she's been possessing people,

699
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,958
turning them into killers,
to take revenge on the town.

700
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:59,000
- It's like the nursery rhyme.
- Yeah. Yeah.

701
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:03,083
"Before the witch's final breath,
she found a way to cheat her death."

702
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,833
"By cutting off her cursed hand,

703
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,916
she kept her grip upon our land."

704
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:14,666
"She reaches from beyond the grave

705
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:18,875
to make good men her wicked slaves."

706
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:20,500
Yes, exactly.

707
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:24,166
Don't you see what's happening to us?
This is all proof.

708
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,750
Shadyside isn't just
some hotbed for psychos.

709
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:29,666
All these massacres are connected
to Sarah Fier.

710
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,250
The witch's curse is real!

711
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:34,541
Fine. Let's assume that the witch
has been possessing people

712
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,875
for some sort of messed-up vendetta.

713
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:40,416
This isn't the same as the mall massacre.
Something different is happening to us.

714
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,750
Something way worse.

715
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:46,125
OK, we have two of her killers after us
and both of them are dead.

716
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,333
Why is she so mad at us?

717
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:49,416
I saw her.

718
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:53,166
Last night, I don't...

719
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,166
I don't know, you know.
I thought I hit my head...

720
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,291
It was...

721
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:01,875
It was her.

722
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,416
I saw the witch.

723
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:13,916
I can't believe you're wearing that.

724
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,208
Can't believe you're above it,

725
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:17,051
when we're in the middle
of the fucking woods

726
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,791
and dead maniacs are after us.

727
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,666
OK, so I fell out of the car...

728
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,625
here.

729
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,500
I was crawling,

730
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,916
and my nose was bleeding.

731
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:50,958
And then...

732
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,000
I feel something.

733
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:00,833
Chains?

734
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,666
Oh! Not just chains.

735
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,041
- Holy shit.
- Oh my gosh.

736
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:13,291
- No way.
- Oh!

737
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,208
Fier. It's her.

738
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,500
It's her grave.

739
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,750
Oh no, no. No!

740
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:28,541
This is bad! This is really bad!

741
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:31,208
No wonder the witch is pissed at us.
I'd be pissed too.

742
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:32,541
Sam disturbed her grave.

743
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:36,791
Now she's sending
her henchmen after us.

744
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:38,583
Henchmen?

745
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,000
As in every one of those sickos
on your wall is coming after us?

746
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:45,958
Did you hear that?

747
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,958
Hold up. Hold up.

748
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:54,583
She's mad
because we disturbed her grave, right?

749
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,375
Yeah. So?

750
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:59,416
So, let's un-disturb it!

751
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,875
Just put the bones back, rebury them,
and put her to rest!

752
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:04,583
No, that's so stupid!

753
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,708
That's genius!

754
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,125
Yeah! In... in <i>Poltergeist!</i>

755
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:13,125
Whatever.
Let's do it quickly so we can go.

756
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,166
OK.

757
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,833
Deena, Deena!
Find something to wrap her bones!

758
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,625
<i>You! It's you!</i>

759
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:49,291
<i>It's you!</i>

760
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:52,791
Your nose...

761
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:58,333
Guys?

762
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,375
I think there's someone in the woods!

763
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:13,041
<i>It's you!</i>

764
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,000
<i>It's you!</i>

765
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,791
We need to hurry!

766
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,500
There, there.

767
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:20,916
We're sorry.

768
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:22,583
Did it work?

769
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:26,666
Did it work?

770
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:42,666
- No!
<i>- It's you!</i>

771
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,041
Go, run!

772
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,666
Run! Run!

773
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,000
Go! Come on, go!

774
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,458
Start the car! Go!

775
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:01,500
- That was the Camp Nightwing Killer!
- That was a bust!

776
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:04,625
Yeah, maybe because
it's not like the movies, OK?

777
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:07,125
It's not as easy as putting bones to rest!

778
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:10,916
- It should've worked. It always works!
- Maybe it's her missing hand.

779
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,666
Who gives a shit? It doesn't matter.
Hey, how do I not die?

780
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,666
We! How do <i>we </i>not die!

781
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,041
And I'm looking at you, witch nerd!

782
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:20,750
- I... I don't know!
- They're not coming for us!

783
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,541
- They're coming for me.
- What?

784
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:28,166
- I saw her again...
<i>- It's you.</i>

785
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:31,666
The witch. She... I disturbed her grave.

786
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,833
- <i>It's you.</i>
- She wants me.

787
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:39,541
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Nightwing ran right by me.

788
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:43,541
I jumped out his way, it was like
he didn't even see me. He went for her.

789
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:47,250
Guys, no! Ruby attacked Simon.

790
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:50,916
Skull Mask came after us at home.
And while you guys were babysitting!

791
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:55,166
No, he didn't.

792
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,250
Skull Mask didn't care about us.

793
00:57:57,333 --> 00:58:00,250
He wanted this. Sam's blood.

794
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:02,541
- What the fu...
- Oh!

795
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:06,041
Yeah! From the crash
when Sam puked period!

796
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,666
It's <i>Jaws</i>, dude!

797
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,083
A shark smelling blood!

798
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:11,833
Kate's right!
When we found Skeletor,

799
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:15,458
he was all sniffy and weird with my shirt
like a perv in a pantie shop!

800
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:17,625
Yeah, but he came to our house too!

801
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,500
Deena...

802
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,958
Sam bled on her bones,
now the witch wants more of her blood!

803
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:29,000
OK, so what do they do in <i>Jaws?</i>

804
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:31,666
They didn't go skinny-dipping
with the goddamn bait.

805
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,750
She's not bait!

806
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:35,041
Yeah. She is.

807
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:38,583
Seriously, if we're right
and they're after her...

808
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,125
let's give these assholes what they want.

809
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:55,541
Alright, we have to decontaminate.

810
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,041
You can't have any of Sam's blood on you.

811
00:59:58,125 --> 01:00:00,458
Well, not much I can do about that.

812
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:05,958
Deena, you have to get clean too!
Not a single drop, OK?

813
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,875
Rub-a-dub-dub time!

814
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:09,791
Hey, wait.

815
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,083
I don't want to go in by myself.

816
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:26,125
Up, up, down, down.
Left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

817
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,791
Holy shit, your shoulder.

818
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:37,541
It's fine.

819
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:39,458
OK, well,

820
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,125
fine or not, we s... still need to cover it.

821
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:32,041
Do you really think
this is going to work?

822
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I do.

823
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:41,458
Josh...

824
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,708
Can you help me?

825
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,166
This is all my fault.

826
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:10,791
I'm sorry.

827
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:13,208
When I went to Sunnyvale,

828
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,333
I ran away from you.

829
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:19,583
Because you were, like...

830
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,708
this reminder.

831
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,250
I was scared of this.

832
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,208
Of us.

833
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,208
Of me.

834
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,291
And, like, tonight's been the first time

835
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:38,833
I've felt like myself in...

836
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:40,916
months.

837
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,208
It's been so long.

838
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:47,291
I forgot what that... what that felt like.

839
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,750
You make me feel...

840
01:02:58,916 --> 01:02:59,916

The killers go to the blood.

872
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:33,375
Then...

873
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:37,166
Smile, you son of a bitch!

874
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:44,166
Are you sure you want to do this?

875
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,250
See you on the other side.

876
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:46,916
<i>♪ You always hurt the one you love ♪</i>

877
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:51,625
♪ <i>The one you shouldn't hurt at all</i> ♪

878
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:55,833
Dude! She's here! I saw her!

879
01:06:55,916 --> 01:07:00,000
She was...
She was so sexy, but fucking crazy still!

880
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,416
She was doing it!
Following the blood trails!

881
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,166
It's working.
Skull Mask freak, three o'clock.

882
01:07:10,541 --> 01:07:14,500
<i>♪ You always hurt the one... ♪</i>

883
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:15,500
Ruby.

884
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,250
<i>♪...you love ♪</i>

885
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:21,000
<i>♪ The one you shouldn't hurt... ♪</i>

886
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:22,458
This is so dumb.

887
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:24,708
If this doesn't work, I will murder you!

888
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:36,500
They're all here.

889
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,416
<i>♪ So if I... ♪</i>

890
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,083
Go, go, go, go, go!

891
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,958
Come back from that, motherfuckers!

892
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,458
Oh!

893
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:11,583
Guys?

894
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,208
Holy!

895
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:18,708
Run! Run!

896
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:19,791
Go! Go!

897
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:29,416
Help me!

898
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:35,208
- They're coming!
- They're gonna keep coming!

899
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:36,291
We're fucked!

900
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,375
No, no! We are not fucked!

901
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:42,125
She's fucked. They're coming for her.

902
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:44,833
If we put Sam in the hall,
we end this now.

903
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:46,958
- You're a monster.
- I'm being reasonable!

904
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:48,583
We can't run anymore.

905
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:50,500
A bullet won't stop them, fine.

906
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,958
They're really strong.

907
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:55,750
But we just tried to goddamn explode them,
and that didn't work!

908
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,333
You're suggesting killing her.

909
01:09:57,416 --> 01:09:59,791
I mean, that's not exactly
what she's saying.

910
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:01,041
Oh, you're on her side?

911
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:04,208
You'd let us all die to protect her.
Look at this.

912
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:05,541
OK, all of this.

913
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:07,875
Dead, dead, dead!

914
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:10,125
This is the way.

915
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:12,375
It's the only way.

916
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:18,458
Sam's gotta go.

917
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:23,208
Are you kidding me?

918
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,666
Kate's right.

919
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:31,625
I don't want you guys to die for me.

920
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:36,083
I'm going.

921
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:39,875
I'm ending this.

922
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:41,208
No, you're not.

923
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:42,750
Are you crazy?

924
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,208
No.

925
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:51,458
No, Sam!

926
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:52,708
Sam!

927
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,000
Sam!

928
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,791
Let me go! Let me... Sam!

929
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,000
Let me go. Let me go!

930
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:19,708
Let me... Help me! Help!

931
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,083
We're letting her die!

932
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:32,000
We're killing her!

933
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,208
Please!

934
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,958
This is not your fault.

935
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:40,166
Please!

936
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,250
Please!

937
01:11:56,958 --> 01:12:01,208
- What... what... what is going on?
- You're not doing this alone.

938
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:03,226
There's another way.

939
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,166
C. Berman.

940
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:06,791
She's the key.

941
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:12,666
Camp Nightwing. Summer of '78.

942
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,083
Group of campers, brutal massacre.

943
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:17,208
There was one Shadyside survivor,
C. Berman.

944
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:21,500
"The still traumatized girl claims that
amidst the carnage she saw the witch."

945
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:25,291
Yeah, just like you.
So, if she survived, I'm pretty sure...

946
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:27,166
There may be a way for me to live too.

947
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:30,416
I got it! C. Berman!
9006 Brennan Way.

948
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,791
This has gotta be her!

949
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,291
Uh, 155-4747!

950
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:41,916
- No one's answering!
<i>- The Berman residence.</i>

951
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,500
<i>- I'm not home right now.</i>
- I need some help here!

952
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:47,375
<i>- Please leave a message after the beep.</i>
- No one's there!

953
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:50,500
Hello, my name is Deena Johnson.
I think you saw the witch.

954
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,375
This shit is not gonna hold!

955
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:56,958
We need to know how you survived!

956
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:59,916
Hey! We're being attacked, alright?
There are killers here!

957
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,541
If you're there, please pick up!
Please answer!

958
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:07,083
<i>- To record a new message, press one.</i>
- Fuck! No!

959
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:09,750
Help!

960
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,666
- Help us!
- Help!

961
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,500
She died.

962
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:23,166
She died.

963
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:26,083
What? No, she's alive.
That's the whole point.

964
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:28,458
Yeah, she... she survived, but...

965
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,458
but first she died.

966
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,263
"C. Berman was found
in the woods."

967
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:38,208
"Her heart had stopped
but local boy performed CPR."

968
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,583
What if this is it?

969
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:44,500
What if that's how she survived?
Her heart stopped.

970
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:46,583
She survived by dying.

971
01:13:46,666 --> 01:13:49,666
What is it? The fucking rhyme.
The fucking rhyme!

972
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,916
"She'll take your blood,
she'll take your head!"

973
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,416
- "She'll follow you..."
- "Until you're dead."

974
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,166
It's just like Kate said. OK?

975
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,791
The witch wants you dead.

976
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:01,583
So... we kill you.

977
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:06,541
And then, just like this C. Berman bitch,
we bring you back to life.

978
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:07,708
What are you saying?

979
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:15,416
Fuck it. I'm dying tonight
one way or another.

980
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,916
Let's try to bring me back.

981
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:30,000
Let's do it!

982
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:35,208
Let's Timothy this bitch!

983
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:41,750
A few months ago, my brother Timothy
had an unfortunate experience

984
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:45,375
in which he ingested too much
of a certain substance.

985
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,250
He was dead for two minutes.

986
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,333
But...

987
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:52,125
we got him back!

988
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:54,250
Kate.

989
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:56,875
It's time for your close-up.

990
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:04,833
You need to take these in order.
Pile one takes the edge off.

991
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:07,958
You're gonna feel like
you're being fucked by a unicorn.

992
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:12,666
Pile two is gonna bring
your core temp <i>way </i>down.

993
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,958
You may feel slightly sick.

994
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:19,458
You need to take a five-minute interval
between pile two and pile three.

995
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:22,583
That's really important, OK?
Pile three brings you down and out,

996
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:25,166
so take that "take five"
or it's all gonna go to shit!

997
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,541
- How many do we have?
- Tons. Like a thousand.

998
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:29,833
Wait. EpiPens?

999
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:32,375
Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.

1000
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:35,250
This is what brings her back.
This is Jesus!

1001
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,375
Sam's blood marks the spot.

1002
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,541
Remember half an hour ago,
when you wanted to murder me?

1003
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:56,458
You don't have to do this. You can leave.

1004
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,625
Remember when you decided
to sacrifice yourself for us?

1005
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:01,666
We're ending this together.

1006
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,791
Die well, my friend.

1007
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:09,375
We got back door patrol.

1008
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:12,625
Hey!

1009
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,625
I'll run interference up here.

1010
01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:34,250
OK, I got stock room.
You take the emergency exit.

1011
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:37,500
Whoa! No, no, no!
Splitting up is not a good idea at all.

1012
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:41,041
But, dude, listen to me.
I know that this is all fucked,

1013
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:42,958
but... we gotta do this.

1014
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,250
Kate,

1015
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,791
she's a crusher.

1016
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,333
She doesn't have time for most people.

1017
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,500
I know.

1018
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:56,333
She's being nice
because we're probably gonna die.

1019
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:57,541
No! OK, well...

1020
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:00,750
maybe we're gonna die,

1021
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:03,291
but Kate is not nice.

1022
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:07,000
She sees something in you.

1023
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,958
- So?
- So, see that in yourself, dude.

1024
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:16,291
We would not be this far
if it weren't for you.

1025
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,250
Now we have to keep those psychos
away from Sam.

1026
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:22,333
So go...

1027
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:24,250
...man up,

1028
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,166
and check that exit.

1029
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:33,875
Deena.

1030
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:35,708
Deena.

1031
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,166
What if we fuck up and just kill me?

1032
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:42,750
What if you can't bring me back?

1033
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:44,666
Listen to me.

1034
01:18:45,916 --> 01:18:47,083
When you left,

1035
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,333
I saw it all.

1036
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:49,708
My whole future,

1037
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:52,583
my whole life in Shadyside.

1038
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:55,000
A night shift, a day shift,

1039
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:57,250
and a million empty beer cans,

1040
01:18:57,916 --> 01:18:59,125
just like my dad.

1041
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:01,375
No way out.

1042
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:04,416
But tonight, even though we are in hell,

1043
01:19:05,416 --> 01:19:08,000
I feel like I have
another chance with you.

1044
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:10,583
And I'm not gonna lose you again.

1045
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:13,500
Because you, and we,

1046
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:15,083
are the way out.

1047
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:20,541
When this is all over,
I am gonna take you on a date.

1048
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:26,666
We're going to eat cheeseburgers
and listen to the Pixies,

1049
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:32,208
and make out and have
the best night of our goddamn lives.

1050
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:36,125
But right now, you've got to die.

1051
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:39,458
Now, look at me. Look at me.

1052
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:42,708
I am going to bring you back.

1053
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:34,583
Swallow it. Swallow it.

1054
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:36,500
Swallow it. Swallow it.

Come on!

1061
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:26,750
I'm so sorry.

1062
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:30,291
- It's OK. It's OK.
- I'm so sorry.

1063
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:35,083

- Huh?

1064
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:38,666
Look. Behind... behind you!

I need to die. I need to die.

1069
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:56,541
I'm gonna figure this out!

1070
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:02,041
Go, go!

1071
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:48,000

No!

1075

Finish it.

1076

No! No!

Are you doing it right?

1095
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:38,166
I don't know. I don't know.

1096
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:43,583
I don't think it's working.

1097
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:46,000
It has to work! It has to.

1098
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:49,000
It has to. Sam?

1099
01:27:49,083 --> 01:27:51,416
Sam?

1100
01:27:56,791 --> 01:27:58,041
Everyone's dead.

1101
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,666
Simon...

1102
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:04,000
Kate...

1103
01:28:04,625 --> 01:28:06,541
No. No, Sam!

1104
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:09,791
I will not let you do this.

1105

One, two, three.

1109
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:24,541
Come on, Sam.
Come on. Come on, Sam!

1110
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:26,833
One, two, three, four.

1111
01:28:26,916 --> 01:28:30,458
One, two, three, four.

1112
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:52,958
It's over.

1113
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:56,875
It's over.

1114
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:00,583
It's OK.

1115
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:03,583
It's over. It's over.

1116
01:29:11,875 --> 01:29:14,791
Interview with Deena Johnson.

1117
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:18,083
Sunday, October 2nd, 1994.

1118
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:19,583
Wanna tell me what happened?

1119
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:23,083
We were picking up Sam's prescription.

1120
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:26,541
And the lights went out.
It was pitch black.

1121
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:29,125
I couldn't really see anything.

1122
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:30,500
We ducked behind a counter.

1123
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:32,041
We hid until it was over.

1124
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:34,250
How'd you get that?

1125
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,083
I fell on some glass.

1126
01:29:38,166 --> 01:29:40,708
Fell on some glass.

1127
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:43,541
You had 15 stitches
in your shoulder.

1128
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:45,125
I fell on some glass.

1129
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:51,333
Sam, you look like a ghost.
Like you just came back from the dead.

1130
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:54,333
Shock, I guess.

1131
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:59,958
I'll tell you what the facts tell me.

1132
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:02,416
- The junkies...
- Kate and Simon?

1133
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,833
They weren't junkies.

1134
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:06,500
They were my friends.

1135
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:11,000
They're to blame for everything.
That feels too easy to me.

1136
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:13,875
But that's the story
this department will go with

1137
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:16,583
unless you can help me
to see it differently.

1138
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:21,125
Another Shadyside tragedy.

1139
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:24,500
An underprivileged overachiever
with bright prospects.

1140
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:31,666
A guy who's been supporting
his family alone since he was 15.

1141
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:37,208
Both succumbing
to the quick cash of drugs.

1142
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,125
Fits the narrative, right?

1143
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:44,208
Nice and neat.

1144
01:30:49,166 --> 01:30:51,250
You came here for my help.

1145
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:53,500
I should have listened to you. I'm sorry.

1146
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:56,208
I'm listening now.

1147
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:58,791
But there's nothing else to say.

1148
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:03,833
Do you want your friends
going down for this?

1149
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:04,958
No.

1150
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:07,416
But they're dead.

1151
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:13,583
Hey.

1152
01:31:13,625 --> 01:31:15,791
Urkel. Help me out?

1153
01:31:17,291 --> 01:31:18,291
Oh, OK.

1154
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:20,291
So I'm a bad guy because I'm in here.

1155
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:23,458
Then that makes you a bad guy, too,
little man.

1156
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:44,083
Let's go.

1157
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:51,875
I owe you.

1158
01:31:54,916 --> 01:31:57,500
Anything comes to you, call me.

1159
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:08,541
Prodigal son returns.

1160
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:10,208
Man, you ain't my family.

1161
01:32:15,208 --> 01:32:16,208
Sam!

1162
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:18,541
Samantha!

1163
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:23,333
So I guess I'll...

1164
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:26,000
see you tomorrow?

1165
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,500
No.

1166
01:32:38,416 --> 01:32:39,416
See you tonight.

1167
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:52,708
Come on!

1168
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:03,803
<i>More death in Shadyside.</i>

1169
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:07,416
<i>A drug-fueled night of violence
leaves a trail of bodies.</i>

1170
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,958
<i>Melissa, give us a recap.</i>

1171
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:11,583
<i>There are
three dead at East Union Medical...</i>

1172
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:14,666
I, uh... I wanted...

1173
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:17,166
I wanted to give you this the other day.

1174
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,500
- But, uh...
- What is this?

1175
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:20,750
Um...

1176
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:23,333
- A mixtape?
- Yeah.

1177
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:25,916
But you don't have to open it right now.

1178
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,208

01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:14,541
<i>Did you touch the bones?
Did you see her face?</i>

1203
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:16,666
- No. It's over.
<i>- Over?</i>

Yeah, but, uh...

<i>It's never over.</i>

1207

We ended it.
