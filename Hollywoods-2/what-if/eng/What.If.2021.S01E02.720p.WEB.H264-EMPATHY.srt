1
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:42,991
<i>Time.</i>

2
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,450
<i>Space.</i>

3
00:00:49,158 --> 00:00:50,158
<i>Reality.</i>

4
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:54,866
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

5
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:04,241
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

6
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:10,241
<i>where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

7
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,783
<i>creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.</i>

8
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:21,075
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

9
00:01:23,408 --> 00:01:26,575
<i>I am your guide
through these vast new realities.</i>

10
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:31,658
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

11
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:36,658
<i>"What if?"</i>

12
00:01:46,783 --> 00:01:51,158
<i>The galaxy, to your eyes,
a hundred billion points of light.</i>

13
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,950
<i>But where you see light, I see worlds
and the countless stories that fill them.</i>

14
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:02,283
<i>But in a Multiverse
of infinite possibility,</i>

15
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:09,533
<i>is your destiny determined by your nature
or by the nature of your world?</i>

16
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,950
Drop it! Drop it now!

17
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,950
Who are you?

18
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,241
Identify yourself.

19
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:36,200
Who, me?
I am just an ordinary junker.

20
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:38,783
But there is one name you may know me by.

21
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:46,075
Oh, my. Star-Lord!

22
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:48,616
I'm a huge fan of your work.
What are you doing here?

23
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,783
That was not the reaction I was expecting.

24
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,450
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Stop! Show some respect.

25
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:59,450
This is the Star-Lord, legendary outlaw.

26
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,991
Steals from the powerful
and gives to the powerless.

27
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:04,533
Should we be bowing?
I feel like we should be bowing.

28
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:06,616
I mean, unless we should be kneeling.

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,700
- Neither is necessary.
- Please.

30
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:11,991
- You are a lord.
- It is not an official title.

31
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,075
Nor is it one I am comfortable with.

32
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,825
Of course you would be humble.
Classic Star-Lord.

33
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:20,408
I almost wish I didn't have
to take that from you.

34
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,075
Surely something this powerful
is better off in my hands.

35
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,033
It's just that my boss, Ronan,
super, super intense.

36
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:29,116
But I could be convinced
to make a career change.

37
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,075
Appreciate the interest,
but we're all staffed up.

38
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,866
Oh, totally. Totally get it.
But at least now I get to spar with you.

39
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,366
I guess if that's really what you want.

40
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,491
Oh, it shall be the honor of my life.

41
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:44,700
- Oh. Uh, should I not use the gun?
- Go ahead.

42
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:45,866
- Really?
- Please.

43
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,991
No, it's not a problem.

44
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:48,450
- I'll get rid of it.
- It's okay.

45
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,116
- You sure?
- Go ahead, use the gun.

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,866
That is so generous of you.

47
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,575
- Ready?
- Oh, yes.

48
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:54,741
Oh.

49
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,658
You do not disappoint, my lord.
So nimble, so spry.

50
00:03:58,741 --> 00:03:59,825
I'm right here. Hit me.

51
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,700
- Oh. My Lord! I didn't mean to...
- That is what we're here for.

52
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:05,575
Do it again. But this time, faster.

53
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:06,908
- Harder.
- Really?

54
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:09,491
I barely moved. Hit me.

55
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,408
Classic Star-Lord.

56
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,950
Now I almost feel bad.

57
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,491
Well, I have hired worse.

58
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:42,116
Freeze, Ravager.
We have you outnumbered.

59
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,575
It would appear,
but a Ravager never flies solo.

60
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:57,950
I said, "A Ravager never flies solo."

61
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,616
Uh, is that some kind of catchphrase?

62
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:16,866
You had me worried for a second.

63
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,450
- Who's the Sleeping Beauty?
- A new recruit. He was after this as well.

64
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,158
Mmm-hmm.

65
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:24,491
Thermal signature's off the charts.

66
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,908
You know, if we wanted
to have some real fun,

67
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:28,116
we'd make like the old days

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,283
and sell this bad boy
to the highest bidder.

69
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,408
If we made like the old days,
you'd only have half of your teeth.

70
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:37,950
Besides, wouldn't you rather use it
to jump-start

71
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:41,616
the Krylorians' dying star,
save their system from extinction?

72
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,575
You know as well as I,
no treasure is worth as much

73
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,616
as the good that can be done with it.

74
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,533
Ah. That's my boy.

75
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,533
<i>Though our hero's destiny
might lie in the stars above,</i>

76
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:06,158
<i>the beginning of his journey
was much more down-to-earth.</i>

77
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,575
I am tired
of living in a bubble.

78
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:11,033
There's an entire world out there, Baba.

79
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:14,991
Yes, one of war, violence, hatred.

80
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:18,408
That world has nothing to offer Wakanda.

81
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,658
There must be more. But we must be
brave enough to search for it.

82
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,700
I do understand, my son.

83
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,700
Though the blood of a king
runs through your veins,

84
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:30,241
it is pumped by the heart of an explorer.

85
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:34,116
But as someone who has ventured out
into the greater world,

86
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,741
let me assure you,

87
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:40,783
all you will find there
is destruction and pain.

88
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:44,575
Those people do not understand
our way of life.

89
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,075
<i>What you call destiny
is just an equation,</i>

90
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,616
<i>a product of variables.</i>

91
00:06:55,533 --> 00:07:00,158
<i>Right place, right time,
or in some instances,</i>

92
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:03,116
<i>the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

93
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,366
<i>As fate would have it,
at that very moment,</i>

94
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,366
<i>a Ravager spacecraft was arriving on Earth
to abduct the spawn of the Celestial, Ego.</i>

95
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,366
Cool.

96
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,366
<i>But in this universe,</i>

97
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,991
<i>Yondu outsourced the assignment
to his subordinates.</i>

98
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:22,616
You morons grabbed the wrong kid.

99
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Uh-uh. Not so fast, Captain.

100
00:07:24,783 --> 00:07:28,408
Two see holes, two hear holes,
one eat hole.

101
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,658
Everything checks out.

102
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,491
Does this really look like
Peter Quill to y'all?

103
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:35,158
Sure. I don't know.
All humans look alike to me.

104
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:38,450
The cosmic readings where he was took
nearly broke our dial.

105
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:42,491
If there was anything not from that planet
on that planet, it's there.

106
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:46,033
Well, my home is built
on an ancient Vibranium meteorite.

107
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,825
You sure don't seem too freaked out
about all this, kid.

108
00:07:48,908 --> 00:07:50,991
What you doing out there
all by yourself anyway?

109
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:54,116
- Exploring the world.
- Sounds fun.

110
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,991
But why stop at one world, huh?

111
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,866
When we can show you all of them?

112
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:29,658
- Ravagers!
- Ravagers!

113
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:32,783
Star-Lord, if you had
to pick a favorite...

114
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:34,450
Really, I could not say.

115
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:37,741
I know, I know, so many heists,
so many planets saved.

116
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,158
Still, you must have one.

117
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,908
How could you choose just one?

118
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:43,700
Oh! What about the Central Bank heist
of Tarnax IV?

119
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:45,825
Never hurts to hurt a Skrull, right?

120
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:50,491
That job paid for Kraglin's teeth.

121
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:52,908
How about when you armed
the Ankaran resistance?

122
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,366
Oh, man. Barely made it out of that one.

123
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,700
How exactly did you stop Thanos,
the Mad Titan,

124
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:01,408
from decimating half
of the universe? Oh, no.

125
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:03,533
I'm a big enough man
to admit when I'm wrong.

126
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,366
T'Challa here showed me
there was more than one way

127
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,158
to reallocate the universe's resources.

128
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:12,241
Sometimes the best weapon
in your arsenal is just a good argument.

129
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:13,825
Aye, aye, Commander.

130
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:16,991
Although I still assert
my plan was not without its merits.

131
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,200
- Here we go.
- Please.

132
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,741
Pretty sure it's still
just genocide, big guy.

133
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:24,408
And I'm pretty sure it's efficient.

134
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:32,533
Your money is no good here.

135
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:35,533
- Please.
- No, seriously. We only take cash.

136
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,950
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh... I have cash.

137
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,325
Wait. You are the Star-Lord.

138
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:42,575
You saved my home world
from a Kree invasion.

139
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:45,075
- All in a day's work.
- No, it took several days.

140
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:48,616
Six, in fact. Let us take a picture
to send to my wife and daughter.

141
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,825
I would prefer...

142
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:54,616
Oh, we should take another one.
You look terrible. I look great.

143
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,908
- I'm sure it's fine.
- No, I insist.

144
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,351
- It is a truly awful picture of you.
- I don't know.

145
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:03,908
He looks pretty good
from where I'm standing.

146
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:05,241
Nebula.

147
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:06,408
Hey, Cha-Cha.

148
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,616
Pretty valuable loot you got here.

149
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,491
The big guy know you have this?

150
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:13,825
You mean your father?

151
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:17,158
He's lucky I call him the big guy.

152
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,616
You know, he gardens now.

153
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
You should talk to him.
He really has changed.

154
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:21,950
The past doesn't.

155
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,200
You still wear your past around your neck.

156
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:26,575
You ever think of going back?

157
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,200
Not much to go back to.

158
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:32,825
When I was young, Yondu attempted
to return me to Wakanda...

159
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:34,908
but it had been destroyed.

160
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,616
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,825
Just another senseless war.

162
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:44,616
<i>Baba warned that was all humans know.
Turns out he was right.</i>

163
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,700
You lost your home,
and now you save everyone else's.

164
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:49,241
That's the name of this tune, huh?

165
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,033
Something like that.

166
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:54,658
Well, then, do I have a job for you.

167
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:59,825
They're called the Embers of Genesis.

168
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:02,533
Nutrient-rich cosmic dust
from an ancient supernova

169
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:05,283
with the power
to terraform entire ecosystems.

170
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,658
With one ounce,
you can heal a dying planet in minutes.

171
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:10,616
And with a payload
the size we're talking...

172
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,741
We could feed billions of people
on millions of worlds,

173
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:15,950
and eradicate hunger across the galaxy.

174
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:19,241
Don't tell Captain Genocide over here.
You might spoil his fun.

175
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:20,991
New guy's pretty funny.

176
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:23,533
- I thought you work alone, daughter.
- Wait, wait, wait.

177
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,575
You mean she's your offspring?

178
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:27,616
- Adopted.
- It's a long story.

179
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,116
I've been trying
to get them into counseling.

180
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,075
- So who's the mark?
- Taneleer Tivan, also known as...

181
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:35,158
The Collector?

182
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:38,741
As in the most ruthless kingpin
in the intergalactic underworld?

183
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:40,676
- Wait, I thought that was you.
- It was.

184
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,783
But when I went straight,

185
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:44,408
Tivan saw an opening
and filled the power vacuum.

186
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:46,991
We can all agree
the Collector is dangerous.

187
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:49,700
FYI, the Collector does not offer dental.

188
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:53,241
This is suicide, T'Challa.
Not even I can get through his defenses.

189
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:57,700
You dig? This maniac won't do you
the kindness of killing you.

190
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,950
He'll dissect you for a science project,

191
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:02,908
frame whatever's left
and hang you up on the wall.

192
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:05,616
So should I mark you down as undecided?

193
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,533
So long as the Collector's involved,
we are not.

194
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:22,241
You may be the soul of this ship,
but I am still the captain.

195
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,616
We are Ravagers.
We do not back down from a fight.

196
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,825
No, no. We steal from the rich
and give to the poor,

197
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:31,700
just like that earthling
folk hero of yours, right?

198
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:33,325
- Robin Leach.
- Robin Hood.

199
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,533
Whatever. That's our racket.

200
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,700
We've been picking pockets
for loose coins.

201
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:42,116
If we truly want to change the galaxy,
accomplish all we set out to do,

202
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,783
then it's time we robbed the bank.

203
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:49,908
Oh, jeez. Never have been any good
at saying no to you, kid.

204
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:54,825
The Collector's got a famous kink
for exotic flora and fauna.

205
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,658
The Embers will be housed
with the rest of his conquests, here.

206
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:00,616
A museum that doubles
as his base of operations.

207
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,616
A mining colony in a severed head
of an ancient celestial being.

208
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:09,200
He's got the Black Order
doing security.

209
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:12,991
Take it from me, they're bad news.
How do you plan on sneaking past them?

210
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,908
I don't. I'm gonna knock
on their front door like a lady.

211
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:20,075
My Lady Nebula. Captain Udonta.

212
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:22,658
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

213
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:24,366
<i>Yondu and I will pose as sellers</i>

214
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,991
<i>looking to unload that orb
you recovered on Morag.</i>

215
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:29,158
<i>But really, it'll be T'Challa inside.</i>

216
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,866
Our head of security, Proxima Midnight.

217
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,241
Looks like they got an exhibit
running the museum.

218
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:35,908
Hold it. Security scan.

219
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:40,616
And that is when
you cause the distraction.

220
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:45,575
Stop. I thought we were faking it.

221
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,408
Yeah, well, try calling me
Captain Genocide again, new guy.

222
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:53,241
Captain Genocide...

223
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:56,783
<i>The Ravagers will start a riot,
drawing the attention of the Black Order.</i>

224
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:58,200
We have a situation.

225
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:00,825
All units report to our position.

226
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:04,241
<i>Now, Yondu and Nebula
are free to distract the Collector,</i>

227
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:06,366
<i>so that I can search for the Embers.</i>

228
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:14,616
Amazing.

229
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,491
I have no notes. A perfect plan.

230
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:19,158
What could possibly go wrong?

231
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:24,075
I present to you,
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

232
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:26,116
Oh, my dearest Nebula.

233
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,283
Aren't you a sight for sore...

234
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:31,741
Eye. Forgive me,
I couldn't help myself.

235
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:34,825
Hey, you, creep-show.
If it's all the same to you,

236
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,533
I'd just as soon get on with it.

237
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:38,075
All business?

238
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:43,241
And to think I'm old enough to remember
when the Ravagers used to be fun.

239
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:46,533
What can I say?
We went straight and I got square.

240
00:14:46,616 --> 00:14:49,616
Hey, if you boys are done gossiping,
I brought what you asked.

241
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,533
Ugh.

242
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:01,366
The collection is much bigger
than I anticipated.

243
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:06,283
All this suffering, and for what?

244
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,950
My guess, he's compensating
for something big.

245
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,950
Or small, if you catch my drift.

246
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,908
You are quite articulate for a duck.

247
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:16,908
That, sir, is very close-minded.

248
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,200
You know, I, um...
I'm looking for something.

249
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:21,825
The Embers of Genesis.
Do you know where I can find them?

250
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,491
Cosmic flora, down the hall.

251
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:26,575
Take a Louie at the Frost Giants,
a hard Ralph at the Kronans.

252
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:30,200
You'll see a sign for Elvish literature.
Ignore that, total snooze.

253
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:31,366
Screw it.

254
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,158
Give me the tour.

255
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:40,366
You know what they say,
"When you're out of luck,

256
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,616
"always go duck."

257
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,450
- I'm pretty sure no one says that.
- Oh, they say it.

258
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:45,884
- Really?
- Totally.

259
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,325
The Ravagers?

260
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:00,991
It's a diversion.
Sound the alarms, lock down the building.

261
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,158
The flashy flash.

262
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:11,950
You always know how to bring the fun.

263
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:13,908
Hold on, I need to hydrate.

264
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,033
- We have to go.
- Where are you going? Come back.

265
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:23,533
Are you crazy? Happy hour just started.

266
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,908
It... It cannot be.

267
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:08,283
<i>My son, T'Challa, Crown Prince of Wakanda,</i>

268
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:12,033
<i>was abducted from Earth
by an alien spacecraft.</i>

269
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:15,783
<i>If you have any information
regarding his whereabouts,</i>

270
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:19,575
<i>we ask that you respond
to this homing beacon.</i>

271
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:22,741
<i>- And T'Challa...
- Baba.</i>

272
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,741
<i>...if you are out there,</i>

273
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:30,533
<i>you're one bright burning light
in the night sky of billions,</i>

274
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:35,616
<i>and we will search every last
one of them until we find you</i>

275
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,408
<i>on this plane or the next.</i>

276
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,700
Oh, Cha-Cha, I hope you can understand,

277
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:53,783
I had a debt with the Collector
and you were the payment.

278
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:03,908
Oh, T'Challa, now it's time
for one of your great escapes.

279
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,450
You okay, kid?

280
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:06,950
You lied to me!

281
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,325
I was protecting you.

282
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:11,741
Are we talking about the mission?
Or is this "family stuff"?

283
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,116
You told me
my homeland had been destroyed.

284
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,366
My family killed.

285
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,700
How is that protecting me?

286
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:18,866
Whoa. Guess it's family stuff.

287
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,283
Sometimes you need to hear a lie
to see the truth.

288
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,950
You're just like me, T'Challa.

289
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:29,575
I am nothing like you.

290
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,991
You're an explorer, Star-Lord.

291
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:38,325
And for people like you, like us,
the past ain't nothing but a prison.

292
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,533
You don't belong down there with them.

293
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:45,200
You belong up here with us,
with your family.

294
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:46,908
You are not my family.

295
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:50,075
You never were.

296
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,991
Damn, that hurts.

297
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,491
The Collector is ready for you.

298
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:13,825
I must apologize for all that
awkwardness back there with Nebula.

299
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:15,783
I simply abhor drama.

300
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:18,866
Your outfit
would suggest otherwise.

301
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,491
What is it you want with me, Tivan?

302
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:23,241
There is a blank wall in the commissary

303
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:26,866
that I just haven't been able
to find the right piece for.

304
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,991
I am just an ordinary human,
hardly a work of art.

305
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:35,450
Ah. I must admit now that
I see you in the flesh, you are.

306
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:40,533
Are you sure you can't fly or shoot
lasers out of your eyes or something?

307
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:43,200
Let's go a few rounds
and you can find out.

308
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,408
Pass. I prefer you in the cage.

309
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:46,616
Where I come from,

310
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,450
history has never looked kindly
on those who lock men in cages.

311
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:52,908
Maw, make a note.

312
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,075
It appears he does
have a super power after all.

313
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:59,491
He can bore someone to death
using only his sanctimony.

314
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,408
Let's not waste the wall space.

315
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,866
Dissect him
and strip his remains for parts.

316
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,116
Daughter of mine.

317
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,700
How could you do this to us?

318
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:17,783
To my best friend, T'Challa.
You are the worst.

319
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:25,075
But then again,
there are two sides to every story.

320
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,616
Relax, new guy. I'm here to rescue you.

321
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,408
Not like you to change your mind.

322
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,325
Oh, I didn't. This was always the plan.

323
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,658
<i>I told T'Challa that the Collector
was after him right from the jump.</i>

324
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:36,741
- What is this job?
- More of a ruse.

325
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:38,908
You see, I have this debt
with the Collector

326
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:40,366
and, well, he's come to collect.

327
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,575
- And what does he want?
- In a word, you, Cha-Cha.

328
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:47,116
I had no idea about that Wakandan ship.

329
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,991
All I knew was that we had an opening
to settle my debt with the Collector,

330
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,325
and steal the Embers
right out from under him.

331
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:56,450
So, all of this
has been a triple-cross?

332
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,533
What? Classic Star-Lord.

333
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:01,075
Hey, it was T'Challa's idea
to keep you in the dark.

334
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:04,075
'Cause he knew I would never
let him walk into a trap.

335
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:05,325
Look where we ended up.

336
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:06,408
All a distraction,

337
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:10,991
providing me the necessary cover
to obtain this, the Embers of Genesis.

338
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,450
Hot damn. You guys are good.

339
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:16,301
- What about T'Challa?
- Not to worry.

340
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:19,866
He's keeping his escape plan
close to his chest.

341
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,590
No, not like that, Carina.

342
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:24,575
Even by a slave standard, you are foolish.

343
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:46,241
I liked that thing you said
about not locking people in cages.

344
00:21:46,325 --> 00:21:48,658
Thank you. I am forever in your debt.

345
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:55,241
<i>The prisoners have
escaped. All units to sector seven.</i>

346
00:22:01,658 --> 00:22:04,908
What kind of being leaves a party
without saying goodbye?

347
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,283
Something tells me
this happens to you a lot.

348
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:16,575
Packs quite a wallop, does it not?

349
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:19,658
I hacked it off the carcass
of a terribly chatty Kronan.

350
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:21,741
Of course, if that's not your style,

351
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:24,783
there's plenty more
we can play with. Observe.

352
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:32,700
A dagger forged in dark matter
taken from the ruler of the Dark Elves.

353
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:37,241
Or perhaps you prefer something
a touch more elegant?

354
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:44,200
Oh. That woman had taste!

355
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:48,575
A necrosword, courtesy
of the Asgardian Goddess of Death.

356
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:54,741
Whoa.

357
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:05,658
- Run!
- We were running.

358
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,908
Okay, we'll run faster.

359
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:20,450
- Get to the ship.
- Are you crazy?

360
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,158
- You'll never take them yourself.
- Not crazy...

361
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:26,783
Mad.

362
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:00,783
A pity.

363
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:04,700
You abandoned your home and family,

364
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:07,991
and now, your new family
has abandoned you. Karma.

365
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:11,825
Maybe you haven't heard,
a Ravager never flies solo.

366
00:24:15,825 --> 00:24:19,033
Yondu, sweet! Now it's a party.

367
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:23,200
Ain't no way in hell
I was going to leave here without my kid.

368
00:24:57,658 --> 00:24:59,325
Eat this.

369
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:26,241
Let's go. Punch it!

370
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:32,075
- What about Yondu and T'Challa?
- I'm sure they're doing fine.

371
00:25:45,658 --> 00:25:47,908
- Okay, any ideas?
- Sticky fingers.

372
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:49,033
Could work.

373
00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:51,033
- Who's the glue?
- You are.

374
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,700
- Because you lied to me.
- Fair point.

375
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:03,325
Is that all you got?

376
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,700
You think this can contain me?

377
00:26:19,783 --> 00:26:23,783
Cute. No matter where you go
or how far you hide,

378
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:28,033
there is not a corner
in this galaxy beyond my grasp.

379
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:30,741
Sure, sure. Whatever. Cool story.

380
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:34,908
I trust you'll know what to do with this.

381
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:37,575
Oh, I have some ideas.

382
00:26:37,658 --> 00:26:40,033
Carina, can I have my bracelet now?

383
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:42,658
No touching, Carina. No!

384
00:26:43,491 --> 00:26:47,491
No, no, no, no. Stay. Stop!

385
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:51,158
Stop and think. I took care of all of you.
I put a roof over your heads.

386
00:26:51,283 --> 00:26:53,200
Oh. Karma.

387
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,366
We're never getting
out on foot.

388
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,325
Then we'll take to the skies.

389
00:27:11,616 --> 00:27:15,158
<i>All crew members present
and accounted for by some miracle.</i>

390
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:17,866
Then I will see you
at the rendezvous point.

391
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,450
<i>Copy that, Cha-Cha.</i>

392
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:24,075
Looks like we've got a stowaway.

393
00:27:24,158 --> 00:27:26,866
You always did have
a soft spot for runaways.

394
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:32,033
- Look, T'Challa, I just wanted to say...
- There's no need.

395
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:35,283
I was the one who told you
I wanted to see the world.

396
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:38,491
All you did was show me the universe.

397
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:43,116
Oh, yeah.
She really is a beaut, isn't she?

398
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,075
I've always
felt at home up here.

399
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:50,075
But now, knowing everything,
I'm not quite sure where I belong.

400
00:27:50,158 --> 00:27:53,408
Seen a lot of space travelers
in my day, kid.

401
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:55,825
And if I've learned anything
from watching you,

402
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,533
on any planet, among any people,

403
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:03,658
there ain't no place in this galaxy
where you don't belong.

404
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:08,325
Where you want to be,
that's the question, isn't it?

405
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,866
You're just gonna have to follow
your heart on that one, Mr. Star-Lord.

406
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:39,283
<i>- Baba.
- My son, my son.</i>

407
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:43,241
I knew you would find your way home to us.

408
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:44,991
I'm sorry it took me so long.

409
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:48,158
Let me introduce you
to the family I made along the way.

410
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:50,283
Uh, you must be T'Challa's father.

411
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:54,616
Uh, pleased to meet you, sir.
Your son is a galactic hero.

412
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,825
My friend, that sounds
an awful lot like genocide.

413
00:28:57,908 --> 00:29:00,616
- No, no, no. Because it's random.
- Uh-huh.

414
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,158
And I might add, efficient.

415
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,491
Dad!

416
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:07,158
I mean, if you really wanted
to put a label on it,

417
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:08,700
T'Challa and I are best friends.

418
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:10,325
Oh, yeah, jump points are the best.

419
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:12,825
They make your face all scrambly,
but they're a lot of fun.

420
00:29:12,908 --> 00:29:18,783
I am still wondering how exactly
my son came to be in your spaceship.

421
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,825
Funny story, Your Highness.
You see, I took this job...

422
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:25,866
I was lost, Baba. Yondu found me.

423
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,283
<i>And from one family reunion
to another...</i>

424
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,450
<i>I saw your eyes</i>

425
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:41,741
<i>And you made me smile</i>

426
00:29:41,825 --> 00:29:43,408
Uh, sorry. We're closed.

427
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:48,200
What, Peter? Can't spare
a little time for dear old Dad?

428
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:50,533
<i>Too bad this might spell
the end of the world.</i>

429
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:53,116
<i>But that's a story for another day.</i>

430
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,158
<i>I was falling in love</i>
