1
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,380
<i>Time.</i>

2
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,963
<i>Space.</i>

3
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,756
<i>Reality.</i>

4
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:55,339
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

5
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:01,068
<i>It's a prism...</i>

6
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:04,688
<i>of endless possibility.</i>

7
00:01:06,922 --> 00:01:10,672
<i>Where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

8
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:16,172
<i>creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.</i>

9
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:21,381
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

10
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:26,757
<i>I am your guide through
these vast new realities.</i>

11
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:29,263
<i>Follow me</i>

12
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:31,731
<i>and ponder the question...</i>

13
00:01:35,423 --> 00:01:36,882
<i>"What if?"</i>

14
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:45,215
<i>We have watched
how one moment, one choice,</i>

15
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:47,090
<i>can ripple across space and time,</i>

16
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:51,673
<i>giving birth to new stories,
heroes, whole universes.</i>

17
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:53,798
<i>But what if it's the wrong choice?</i>

18
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:58,799
<i>What if the best of intentions
has very... strange consequences?</i>

19
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,466
Evening, handsome.

20
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:11,133
This? I just pulled it out of the dryer.

21
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,508
Whereas you, stunning.

22
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,674
I'm only going for dessert.
You promised me crème brûlée.

23
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:21,333
I suspect we can do
a little better than that.

24
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:26,758
<i>Just let me hear it.</i>

25
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:28,924
Come on, I know you prepared something.

26
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:31,300
You wouldn't just wing it. It's just me.

27
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,325
Okay.

28
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,574
"Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen, fellow doctors..."

29
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:38,425
No. No. Stop. I'm already asleep.

30
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:41,959
Come on, cut the preamble.
Just get straight to the heart of it.

31
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,425
But all I said was, "Good evening."

32
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:47,134
I think you should just rush the podium
like a contestant on <i>The Price is Right.</i>

33
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:51,050
Screaming and high-fiving,
and cheering, and something crazy.

34
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:52,425
<i>Price is </i>what?

35
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,842
- We need to celebrate this.
- We are.

36
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,675
You performed a radical hemispherectomy.

37
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:02,884
- Successfully.
- Well, that was the plan.

38
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:06,301
Yeah, well,
I would call that quite remarkable.

39
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:09,385
Well,
I would say the same about you.

40
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:18,760
Stephen!

41
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:26,926
We're okay. You're okay.

42
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:51,219
No. No, no, no, no.
Christine. Come on! Christine!

43
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:57,719
<i>In this universe,
Stephen Strange didn't lose his hands...</i>

44
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:00,844
<i>...but his heart.</i>

45
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:07,844
<i>Grief-stricken, Strange sought answers
across the world and in the mystic arts.</i>

46
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:13,970
"The Eye of Agamotto,
cradle of the temporal singularity

47
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:19,512
discovered by Cagliostro,
manipulation and alteration of timelines."

48
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:25,887
- Time travel.
- What are you doing?

49
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,720
Tinkering with time can weaken
the very fabric of the universe.

50
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,137
We protect reality. We don't threaten it.

51
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,512
<i>And when the threat came</i>

52
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,095
<i>and The Ancient One was lost,</i>

53
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,970
<i>Stephen Strange stood tall.</i>

54
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:47,263
<i>The man of science
became the Sorcerer Supreme.</i>

55
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:50,638
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

56
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:52,679
<i>Yet despite all he'd gained,</i>

57
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:56,179
<i>Stephen Strange could not
let go of the past.</i>

58
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:04,221
Sorry, but this is now
my favorite T-shirt.

59
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,554
Then I'm gonna
have to take it back.

60
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,054
I'd like to see you try.

61
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,179
I see we switched to the cheap stuff.

62
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,305
How long has it been?

63
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,680
Two years, tonight.

64
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,722
What are you doing up?

65
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:26,347
Needed the little sorcerer's room.

66
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,430
What are you doing?

67
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,514
Well, I'm going to start the kettle.

68
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:38,347
I suggest you join me
before you do something... reckless.

69
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,431
Evening, handsome.

70
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:11,306
Something wrong?

71
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,556
I, I think I might have just
had a mild cardiac event.

72
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,306
A heart attack, Doctor?
Well, buck up, Strange.

73
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,140
You promised me crème brûlée.

74
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:24,474
Say the word, Christine,
and I will give you the world.

75
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:29,182
<i>Let me hear it.</i>

76
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:32,099
<i>Come on, I know you prepared
an acceptance speech for tonight.</i>

77
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,599
I haven't. I'm gonna wing it.

78
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:36,349
I'm gonna run up to the podium
like a game show contestant.

79
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:38,599
Cheers and screams, high-fives.

80
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:41,599
Seriously? Are you teasing me?

81
00:06:41,682 --> 00:06:43,849
Okay. No, you said it.
You have to do it now.

82
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:45,641
Only if you're by my side.

83
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:49,057
Wait a sec.
Have you ever even seen a game show?

84
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:51,507
No. But there's a first
time for everything.

85
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:54,245
What?

86
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,706
I don't know.
You're being delightful.

87
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,100
I must owe someone a muffin basket
for this personality shift.

88
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:01,272
Maybe...

89
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:04,165
Maybe you make me happy.

90
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:08,308
Well, this is shaping up
to be a night to remember.

91
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:24,017
No, no, no!
Not again. No! Christine!

92
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:38,059
Evening, handsome.

93
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:39,559
Your chariot awaits.

94
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:49,351
We missed our turn.
Isn't the bridge that way?

95
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,184
Taking a different route.

96
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:53,226
It's okay. We'll be fine.

97
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:55,809
Stephen!

98
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,934
You're getting an award.
This whole party is for you.

99
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:06,685
Let's stay in.
We'll order pizza and crème brûlée.

100
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:09,477
No. I am not getting grease
on this dress, okay?

101
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,019
We'll go, we'll dance.
I promise you, we will have a good time.

102
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:16,769
No.

103
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:21,394
Pizza. You're a genius.

104
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,186
<i>We're hearing reports
of numerous casualties,</i>

105
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,436
<i>including the death
of one Dr. Christine Palmer.</i>

106
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,978
<i>Palmer, an emergency
and trauma specialist...</i>

107
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:55,853
Stephen. Something wrong?

108
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,553
Why does this keep happening?

109
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:01,103
Aren't we allowed to be happy?

110
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:04,728
Maybe I should drive. Yeah?

111
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:07,645
Hey, are you okay? Do you wanna talk?

112
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:11,229
Maybe put on some music?

113
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:13,021
I only want you.

114
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:15,562
You're the only thing that matters.

115
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:47,855
No!

116
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:02,813
Good evening, Dr. Strange.

117
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:04,688
Are you having car trouble?

118
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,563
Why are you here?

119
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:08,980
To help you.

120
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:11,397
This is where it starts for you.

121
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:14,438
With the death of Dr. Christine Palmer.

122
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:20,189
So overwhelmed by loss,
you will seek answers in the mystic arts.

123
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:21,273
In me.

124
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:23,231
Help me bring her back.

125
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:26,898
I'm sorry, but I can't. No one can.

126
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:30,189
Her death is an Absolute Point in time.

127
00:10:30,273 --> 00:10:31,731
Absolute?

128
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:34,273
Unchangeable. Unmovable.

129
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:38,064
Without her death, you would never
have defeated Dormammu

130
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:40,064
and become the Sorcerer Supreme,

131
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:42,689
and the guardian of the Eye of Agamotto.

132
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,481
If you erase her death,

133
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:47,689
you never start your journey.

134
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,398
I'm creating a paradox.

135
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:54,024
You're risking the universe.
You cannot reverse an Absolute Point.

136
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:56,524
Nothing is impossible.
You taught me that.

137
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:58,690
I only require more power.

138
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:03,399
The greatest sorcerers of the past
could not reverse an Absolute Point.

139
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:04,774
You don't know that.

140
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:07,149
Books have been lost.
Libraries destroyed.

141
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,482
Stop torturing yourself, Stephen.

142
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:11,732
There is no hope here.

143
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:13,290
Christine is gone.

144
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:15,339
You cannot save her.

145
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:17,607
No.

146
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:24,775
Stephen, this path only leads to darkness
and the end of this reality.

147
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:29,941
Please do not do this,
or I will be forced to stop you.

148
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,650
You'd have to find me first.

149
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,733
Excuse me. Hello, excuse me.

150
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:55,775
I'm looking for the
Lost Library of Cagliostro.

151
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,109
Library?

152
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:05,109
Hello? You know, books?
Reading? Knowledge?

153
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,442
Hey. Hey! I'm talking here.
Where are you going?

154
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:31,734
No door. Clever.

155
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:35,527
Hello?

156
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:39,777
Anyone home?

157
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:50,735
Quite the welcome.

158
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:15,319
You have to be the strangest-dressed
sorcerer I've ever seen.

159
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:18,153
Yeah, it's Armani.

160
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:20,986
I've come here for Sorcerer Cagliostro.

161
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:24,444
According to legend, he knew how to break
an Absolute Point in time.

162
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:26,569
Where can I find Cagliostro?

163
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:31,944
Well, maybe here, maybe there.
Maybe nowhere.

164
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:36,361
Wonderful. You're a cryptic.
Please tell me you're not Cagliostro.

165
00:13:36,444 --> 00:13:40,820
The name's O'Bengh,
librarian for the books of Cagliostro.

166
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:44,570
Come, this way, Sorcerer Armani.

167
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:46,112
No, it's Strange.

168
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:49,237
Not any stranger than any
other name in this world.

169
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:56,737
<i>The lost books.</i>

170
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:00,695
How long will you be
staying here?

171
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:03,070
As long as it takes.

172
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:14,071
Okay. Transmutation,
telekinesis, teleportation.

173
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:17,905
Interesting. Time manipulation. Bingo.

174
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:24,405
"The power required to break
an Absolute Point in time is immense,

175
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,071
and nigh impossible to obtain."

176
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:29,155
Yeah, no doy.

177
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:34,321
"Gain the power through
the absorption of other beings."

178
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:35,946
Absorption?

179
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:40,696
Here we go.

180
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,447
My name is Dr. Stephen Strange.

181
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:56,739
I brought you here because...
I need to borrow your powers.

182
00:14:56,822 --> 00:14:59,597
Do you mind sharing a tentacle or two?

183
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:01,772
Please?

184
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:04,889
No!

185
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:15,364
What happened?

186
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:18,823
Mystic beings do not bargain.

187
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:21,198
Their powers are
not meant for man.

188
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,573
The Library isn't enough.

189
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,407
Those beings have what I need.

190
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:29,948
Is she worth the pain?

191
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:35,157
A man does not suffer like this
for his own glory.

192
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:38,615
Every moment of it.

193
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:44,365
There is a fine line
between devotion and delusion.

194
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:49,698
Love can break more than your heart.
It can shatter your mind.

195
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:55,616
And in which book did you read that?

196
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:57,719
No book, Armani.

197
00:15:58,844 --> 00:16:00,390
Life taught me.

198
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:06,283
Maybe O'Bengh's right.

199
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,033
If they won't surrender their power,
I'll take it.

200
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,824
Let's start small.

201
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,534
All right, what's next?

202
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:32,034
Nice cape.

203
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,200
But I draw the line at bugs.

204
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,742
More.

205
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,576
<i>He's on the wrong path.</i>

206
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,160
I could warn him, intervene,

207
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:31,036
but the fate of his universe is not worth
risking the safety of all others.

208
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:34,494
Besides, I doubt he'd listen.

209
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:38,369
Hello?

210
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:41,202
Who's that?

211
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:08,453
Time to meet an old friend.

212
00:18:14,578 --> 00:18:16,620
Hello again and goodbye.

213
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:52,829
O'Bengh, what happened to you?

214
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:56,246
Time, Sorcerer Armani.

215
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:01,038
Put that away.

216
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:04,954
You used magic to remain frozen
for centuries.

217
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:07,788
I chose to live.

218
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:11,497
But I can reverse this.
You will live longer, forever.

219
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
Hush!

220
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:14,205
Even in our world...

221
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,872
death is part of the plan.

222
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,130
I can't accept that.

223
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,889
I know, I know.

224
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:29,914
But... maybe the other... Strange will.

225
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:31,789
Other?

226
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,747
Can't you see?

227
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,039
You are only half a man,

228
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,164
living half a life.

229
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:48,623
<i>It was true. He wasn't alone.</i>

230
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:52,623
<i>He wasn't even the only Dr. Strange
in this universe.</i>

231
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:56,165
Well, I'm going to start the kettle.

232
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:59,665
I suggest you join me before
you do something... reckless.

233
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:08,513
You're right.

234
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:11,230
Enough living in the past
for one evening.

235
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,166
What was in that whiskey?

236
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,167
- Hello, Stephen.
- No... Wait a minute. You're...

237
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,375
Dead? Yes!

238
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,750
So, this must be...

239
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,958
A psychic impression
sent through a splinter in reality?

240
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,083
Yes. Just think of me as an echo.

241
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:05,167
Well, I was gonna say that
this must be the end of the world.

242
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,515
That, too.

243
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:08,732
You always were
a perceptive one.

244
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,667
But I fear we don't have much time.

245
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,167
Then who's causing this?

246
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,125
Well, you are.

247
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,333
How?

248
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:19,875
When Dr. Strange, you, used The Eye

249
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,750
and vanished into the past,
I couldn't follow.

250
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:26,418
<i>I drew upon the power
of the Dark Dimension</i>

251
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:30,209
<i>to split the timeline, to split you.</i>

252
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:32,209
I'm looking for the
Lost Library of Cagliostro.

253
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:34,043
Enough living in the past for one evening.

254
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,376
Allowing for two of
your possible timelines

255
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:39,376
to occur in one universe.

256
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:40,793
Two timelines?

257
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:43,543
I doubt that's the simplest
or smartest thing to do.

258
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:45,418
Exceedingly dangerous, actually.

259
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:47,959
And now I have an evil twin?

260
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:50,168
More like misguided.

261
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:54,709
If the other Strange succeeds in reversing
an Absolute Point in our universe...

262
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,168
You mean saving Christine.

263
00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:58,169
You cannot save her, Stephen.

264
00:21:58,252 --> 00:22:02,419
The resulting temporal paradox
will destroy this universe.

265
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:04,252
Our time is running out.

266
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:08,460
I fear the only sorcerer strong enough
to stop Dr. Strange is...

267
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,127
you, Dr. Strange.

268
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,169
Okay. Wait. So...
the fabric of reality is breaking,

269
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:22,127
and only you can stop it
because you are causing it.

270
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,627
Let's be honest,
we've been through weirder.

271
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,460
But do you want to stop him?

272
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,045
Weren't you in love with this Christine?

273
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:31,586
I... I think I have to.

274
00:22:32,836 --> 00:22:34,503
At the very least, to save you.

275
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,170
The Guardian Vishanti
heavy-duty protection spell.

276
00:22:40,253 --> 00:22:42,086
Knowing me, I'll need it.

277
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:44,878
How would you find him?

278
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:50,503
He's found me.

279
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:54,295
- That's not great.
- Nope, it's not.

280
00:22:55,711 --> 00:22:56,920
Good luck!

281
00:23:14,296 --> 00:23:15,412
Hello?

282
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,129
Hello?

283
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:30,254
Where am I?

284
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:37,172
The question is,

285
00:23:37,922 --> 00:23:39,297
when are you?

286
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:42,172
Do not be frightened, old friend,

287
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,672
for we are one and the same.

288
00:23:48,547 --> 00:23:50,630
What happened to you?

289
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:52,463
I needed you alone.

290
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:55,213
No need for Wong or The Ancient One.

291
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:56,630
They wouldn't understand.

292
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,588
They never knew her.

293
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:05,130
We knew her. We loved her.

294
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:09,047
You can't bring her back.
The world out there is breaking.

295
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,643
Don't you dare lie to me.

296
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,297
I am you!

297
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:23,548
How many nights did we sit
in the Sanctum Sanctorum,

298
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,048
Time Stone in the palm of our hand,

299
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,131
knowing we could go back,
gathering the courage?

300
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:31,923
Well, I had the courage.

301
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:36,589
I spent centuries,
sacrificed everything for Christine.

302
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:40,956
And now can you save her?

303
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:42,764
No, Stephen.

304
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,382
We can.

305
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:53,132
Our powers are diluted, split between us.

306
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:58,465
But once we become whole again,
we can save her.

307
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:59,674
We can't.

308
00:24:59,757 --> 00:25:01,810
You don't believe it's possible.

309
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:03,531
But you will see.

310
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,590
The Ancient One warned us.

311
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:08,507
If we save Christine,
we destroy the world.

312
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,645
I told you, she
doesn't understand.

313
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,281
We love Christine.

314
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,257
This isn't love. Look at this.

315
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,883
This is arrogance.
This is our need to fix everything.

316
00:25:18,966 --> 00:25:21,716
It's what drove us to study
the mystic arts in the first place.

317
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,091
And look where we are.

318
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,633
Deranged.

319
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:27,258
I will be whole again.

320
00:25:27,341 --> 00:25:30,966
No. Your marbles are long gone.

321
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,383
The world, however,
still stands a chance.

322
00:25:35,758 --> 00:25:38,300
You can't save her. She's dead.

323
00:25:56,884 --> 00:25:58,092
You need to let go.

324
00:25:58,176 --> 00:26:01,926
I've gone too far to turn back now.

325
00:27:55,562 --> 00:27:57,370
It's so good to see you.

326
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:04,880
Christine?

327
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:08,388
Stephen, you promised me crème brûlée.

328
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:11,305
I know.

329
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,721
We can be together again.

330
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:19,555
Stephen, I love you.

331
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:28,013
I love you.

332
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:32,805
I wish that was true. But you're...

333
00:28:32,888 --> 00:28:34,471
You're not her.

334
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:57,789
You can't do this.

335
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:00,372
But we must.

336
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:01,556
No.

337
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:07,514
No!

338
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:55,474
Christine?

339
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:57,638
<i>Christine.</i>

340
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,215
What?

341
00:30:00,183 --> 00:30:01,724
It's me, Christine.

342
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:06,349
My God. What's happening?
What's happening?

343
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:09,849
I brought you back. I saved you.

344
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,183
No, this is... This...
This isn't real! This is...

345
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:15,058
No, this is a nightmare!

346
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:17,582
No, no! Leave me!

347
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:20,975
- No. I can fix this.
- No! My God! My God! No!

348
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,559
Get away! Don't touch me!

349
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:24,642
Christine.

350
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:26,100
- No!
- Christine.

351
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:27,767
- No!
- No!

352
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,434
No! This wasn't supposed to happen.

353
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:33,975
- Stephen. No. Stephen.
- No. No.

354
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,725
What is going on?

355
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:39,392
No!

356
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:49,350
You... You can stop this.

357
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:52,518
Please, fix this.

358
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,601
The same way you fixed Christine?

359
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:56,768
- What?
- I was wrong. I...

360
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:57,851
You were warned.

361
00:30:57,935 --> 00:30:59,393
I know. But the world!

362
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:02,893
The world shouldn't pay for my arrogance.

363
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:06,060
I read about you. Sensed your presence.

364
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:08,643
You're a god. You can undo this.

365
00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:11,643
I'm not a god. And neither are you.

366
00:31:11,726 --> 00:31:16,435
Then punish me.
Not the world, not Christine.

367
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:20,185
Honestly, if I could fix this,
if I could punish you instead, I would.

368
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:21,810
But I can't interfere.

369
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:24,227
You, more than anyone else,
should understand that

370
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:29,352
meddling with time and events
only leads to more destruction.

371
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:31,936
No. No!

372
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:33,436
What?

373
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,436
I didn't mean for this to happen!

374
00:31:58,062 --> 00:32:00,770
Christine. No.

375
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:02,520
I'm sorry.

376
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,353
Stephen.

377
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:08,687
What did you do?

378
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:13,353
No, no, no, no, no.

379
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:20,812
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

380
00:32:21,687 --> 00:32:24,895
<i>I am so, so sorry.</i>

381
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:31,954
<i>One life, one choice, one moment</i>

382
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:35,271
<i>can destroy the entire universe.</i>
