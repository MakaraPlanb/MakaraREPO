Before Voleth Meir showed me
her true self, she came to me as a girl.

the gaping wound in your heart,

43
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,620
the thing that makes you feel hopeless,
and she plunges her finger into it

44
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,870
and makes it hurt so badly,
you'd do anything.

what's going on,

170
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,160
please tell me
you're making a hangover cure.

171
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,080
Because my head feels like it's lodged
between the buttocks

172
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,040
of a fat and sexually rageful goat.

173
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,250
What are we doing?

174
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,410
Voleth Meir is a parasite. We need
to remove her without killing the host.

175
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,750
Oh, the Deathless Mother again.
Please, do go on.

176
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,870
A spell from the extraction
or separation family would do it.

177
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,700
Yes, it would.
If you had your magic, which you don't.

178
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,200
If I had my fucking magic.

179
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,410
Instead, I'll have to make do with
whatever I find in a witcher laboratory.

180
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,910
Like this.

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,790
Oh yay! A little stone.
You've saved us all.

182
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,870
Active jasper.

183
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,830
Provider of warmth, energy, balance.

184
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,500
Golden oriole.

185
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,200
Golden what? Areola?

186
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,240
Pretty sure that's got
something to do with nipples.

187
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,120
Neutralizes effects
of poisons in the blood.

188
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,400
- But I'd make everything about nipples...
- Possession's like poison... Jaskier!

189
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,620
I pulled Ciri into this mess, and I'll do
everything I can to get her out of it.

190
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,040
Tell me what to do.

191
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Find Geralt.

192
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,500
- Give him the jasper.
- What for?

193
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,080
It helps turn wrongs into rights.
He'll understand.

194
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,950

Why is she so important to you, Fringilla?

- She's my friend.
- No.

that you are a valuable leader.

661
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,580
And the North will,
no doubt, take the bait.

662
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,950
And as chaos descends upon the Continent,

663
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,120
we will be focused on getting the girl.

we welcomed them as peers,

instead of seeing what they really were.

And it led to a mass grave

There is a girl,

I...

708

When you sacrificed yourself for Ciri.

709

A sacrifice I'd make again.

In a heartbeat.

I don't forgive you, Yennefer.

I know I've hurt you.

713
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,450
Yet I can't help but wish
it could begin again.

714
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,120
Use your knowledge of magic
to train the girl.

715
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,910
You're the only person
who's helped her control her powers.

716
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:26,660
As if I'd trust anyone else with her.

717
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,790
Villentretenmerth told us
we were made for each other.

718
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,580
Destined for each other.

719
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,870
And that nothing would come of it

720
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,700
because destiny alone isn't sufficient.

721
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:44,370
Something more is needed.

722
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,250

what Voleth Meir wanted from you.

733
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,040
What?

734
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,370
She's been here since the Conjunction.

735
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,700
We knew that.

736
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,080
We've always assumed
she was from another sphere.

737
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,040
Is that where I portalled us?

738
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:16,870
Another sphere?

739
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,910
Those monoliths that you shatter,

740
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,450
the ones that pull new species of monster
through every time you scream,

741
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,580
those could be gateways to other spheres.

742
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,750
My scream woke Voleth Meir.

743
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,250
That's why she wanted me.

744
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:31,910
She wanted to go home.

You were the key to her future.

What I can't figure out, though,

747
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,120
is when did Nilfgaard realize
that you were the key to theirs?

748
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,910
They knew before anyone else.

749
