Hmm.

How did it break?

12
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,790
She does that to things.

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,830
If what you say
about that girl's power is true,

14

you can't help her.

Ah, I'll find my own weapons.

What I mean is,

17
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,700
Ciri needs more than you can give her now.

18
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,700
I swore to protect her!

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,790
Nenneke,

20
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,950
I will not sit back and wait

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,160
for something worse than a rogue mage
and his agenda to happen to her.

22
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,450
Do you believe
Yennefer means to harm the girl?

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,450
I <i>wish </i>Yennefer knew
of the balance you spoke of.

More than you know, I wish it.

But I learned my lesson
about Yennefer and wishes.

Sometimes, we assume the worst

The woman who lives here,
she took me in. She was kind to me.

The dream,

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,750
when I first heard your name,

was in this house.

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,580
Same day Geralt found me.

39
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,000
That's why the portal took us here.

You don't sound sure, Yennefer.

If Nilfgaard's got him, if...

64
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,000
they'll have kept Geralt alive
to help track you down.

- Where?

68
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,910
I've fantasized about going back.

69
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,500
Finding the Black Knight
and shoving my sword through his throat

70
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,950
until his feathers are soaked in blood.

71
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,790
Geralt wouldn't want me to go.

72
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,910
He'd want me to avoid danger.

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,450
Geralt will hold out as long as he can.

74
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,830

Yeah, I know. I'm as surprised as you are,

She risked her life for me.

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,250
I always knew
there was some deeper feeling for me

355
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,120
beneath all that rage and... hair.

356
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,620
- She's got a lot of hair, that woman.
- What was her angle?

357

Not an attractive one.

then how did she magically disappear
into thin air

367

when she was imprisoned
in the whorehouse?

Tell me exactly what happened in Oxenfurt.

369
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,080
When the Redanian guards grabbed her,

370
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,950
she muttered something about forests,

371
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,330
and mothers, and huts,

372
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,500
and then she just
sort of disappeared,

373
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,950
- so...
- "Turn your back to the forest, hut, hut"?

374
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,450
"Turn your front to me, hut, hut."
Yeah, that's what she said.

375
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,540
She's in league with the Deathless Mother.

376
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,450
Well, <i>she </i>sounds like a hoot.

Who is the Deathless Mother, Geralt?

379
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,290
The first witchers
were hired to imprison her.

380
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,160
They entombed her in her hut.

381
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,000
But someone's gone and opened up the door.

382

489
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,830
No, no, I said I would call you
when she was ready.

490
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,250
I need to know everything
about the girl. Now.

491
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,080
You told him.

492
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,200
This knowledge, it cannot be ours alone.
There is too much at stake.

493

Look, this is important.

494

This is why I didn't want to tell you.

This isn't a game, Tissaia.

500

If what she says is true,

501
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:20,160
this child has the potential
to end all war.

502

An emperor arriving tomorrow

530

I brought in the elves to fight for us,
but they... have had a change of heart.

531

So the elven birth has helped our cause,
not threatened it.

532
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,830
Tissaia was right.

I should have stood up for you

I'm sorry.

545

Let's be honest.
Whatever is brewing out there,

546
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,370
the Brotherhood needs
reinforcements in here.

If you were to return,

548
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,160
you'd need to plead your case.

549

Apologize, as well.

550
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,700

Of course.

552
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,910

any impact there at all, my dear.

654
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,000
- something?
- Hmm.

655
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:14,080
There are some... unknown variables
in Aretuza.

656
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,910
Tissaia knows of the girl's existence.
I'm certain.

657
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,200
But she keeps the information
very close to her chest.

658
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,080
Even from Vilgefortz,

659
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,540
whom she helped install
and, uh... obviously cares for. <font color="#ff00ff">[SCOFFS]</font>

- Who?
- The new leader of the Brotherhood.

661

How long that will last
is anybody's guess.

662
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,500
Tissaia acts detached,

663
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,160
but she lets relationships
cloud her judgment.

664

you'd be betting with my money.

Not bad news, my lord.

670
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,450
Bedlam.

671
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,250
And if our goal is
to destabilize the Continent,

672
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,540

Yes, well, let's hope so,
