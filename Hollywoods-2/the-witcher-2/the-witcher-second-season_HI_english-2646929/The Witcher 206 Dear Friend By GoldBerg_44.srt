<font color="#138ce9">CIRI:</font> I'm sorry. About Roach.
About all of this...

169
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,950
<font color="#138ce9">GERALT:</font> Don't be. I'm proud of you, Ciri.

170
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
What you did back there was courageous.

171
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,620
<font color="#138ce9">CIRI:</font> I had that feeling again

172
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,830
when the chernobog came for me.

173
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
The pull.

174
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,580
But I... I don't think it wanted to hurt me.

175
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,660
It didn't want to hurt you?

176
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,200
Hmm. <font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

177
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,120
<font color="#138ce9">CIRI:</font> If the monsters are coming

<font color="#138ce9">GERALT:</font> It's not that simple.

179
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,620
Geralt?

180
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,200
When the Knight caught me,

181
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,160
all I could feel was fear.

182
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,950
I was... I was so scared.

183
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,660
But I also felt...

184
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,910
anger.

185
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Later, there were also some men
from Cintra who found me.

186
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,700
They were going to take me to the Knight
to collect a reward.

187
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,790
But I... I wasn't scared that time.

188
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,580
I just... I knew what could happen.

189
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,290
You screamed.

190
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,660
I killed them, Geralt.

191
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,000
How many were there?

192
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Four.

193
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,870
Only four?

194
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,910
You've got some catching up to do.

195
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,790
<font color="#138ce9">CIRI:</font> So, what now?

196
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,500
<font color="#138ce9">GERALT:</font> Good question.

197
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,660
I'm hoping we'll find our answers there.

198
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,290
Melitele.

199
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,370
Goddess of fertility and harvest.

200
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,330
I'm impressed.

201
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,450
I do, in fact, read.

202
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,660
The graduates of the temple school

203
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,580
are known to become midwives,
historians, healers...

204
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,660
And witchers.

205
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,790
Vesemir sent me here
when I was about your age.

206
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,410
It's where witchers learn to do signs.

207
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,830
Yes. I, too, was once a child.

208
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,700
<font color="#138ce9">WOMAN:</font> Blessings. Good morrow.

209
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,080
Where is she taking those?

210
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,910
Don't worry. We're safe.

211
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,290
There's no fighting here. No politics.

212
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,450
The temple is known for its neutrality.

213
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,660
The temple is

214
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,750
what you make of it.

215
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,870
But, yes,

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,040
some find it more... giving than others.

217
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,950
I have missed you.

218
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,910
I have missed you too, Nenneke.

219
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Now,

220
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,580
who are you?

221
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,870
I think we can, at the very least,

222
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,000
start to guide you
in the art of controlling your Chaos.

223
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
What's that?

224
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,410
It's the feeling inside.

225
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,870
The feeling you can't control.

226
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,910
Like...

227
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,000
the Daughter of Chaos?

228
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,750
Where did you hear that?

229
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,330
Ciri,

230
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,450
the questions you are asking

231
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,870
require knowledge
that's been lost to time.

232
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,040
And knowledge like that

233
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,330
is usually lost for a reason.

234
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,580
Are you sure you're ready?

235
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,410
Whatever... gave me this Chaos,

236
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,950
hiding from it won't fix it.

237
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,540
I'm ready for the truth,
whatever it takes.

238
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,830
That spirit. <font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

239
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,200

240
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,750
- <font color="#ff00ff">[CHUCKLES]</font>
- Geralt?

241
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,910
Ask him

242
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,620
to tell you about the Aardincident.

243
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,040
It nearly destroyed
the very office we are sitting in.

244
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,910
Ah! This is Jarre.

245
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,870
One of our best students.

246
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,370
Pleasure to meet you, milady.

247
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,250
Mi-magical lady.

248
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,370
- <font color="#ff00ff">[CIRI CHUCKLES]</font>
- Whatever it takes.

249
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,700
Ah, Jarre, take Ciri to the library.

250
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,040
She's in dire need of the orbuculum.

252
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,370
<font color="#ff00ff">[WHISPERS]</font> Help me.

253
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,500
Hmm.

254
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,250
Now that you've had a chance
to speak with her, what do you think?

255
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,910
I don't see any side
upon which you are not entirely fucked.

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,040
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

257
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,790
She's a princess.

258
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,450
Kingdoms will want her for her status.

259
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,160
Nilfgaard already does.

260
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,000
You know how many have been killed
in pursuit of her?

261
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,000
Thousands, yes, I know.

262
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,700
And if she has Elder blood,

263
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,330
she's a fucking tinderbox.

264
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,700
By all means, go on.

265
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,580
You said she recited Ithlinne's Prophecy
during one of her episodes.

266
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,120
Yes, but I won't let what may
or may not be folklore dictate my path.

267
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,910
What does she know of the Wild Hunt?

268
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,580
She believes what most people believe.
What are you driving at, Nenneke?

269
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,290
She's a Child of Destiny.

270
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,370
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

271
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,080
There are forces at play
larger than we know.

272
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,290
You are a part of her,

273
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,450
she a part of you.

274
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,000
But it's not enough.

275
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,330
I know.

276
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,580
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

277
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,330
What can I do?

278
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,330
I taught you

279
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,950
in all things...

280
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,120
- balance.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

281
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,500
Find what is missing in the girl.

282
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,910
Then, maybe,

283
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,160
you stand a chance of helping her.

284
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,750
- <font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>
- Hmm?

285
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,540
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

286
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,830
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

287
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,200
I hope training is going well.

288
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,830
Our people have lived
in the mountains long enough.

289
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,250
They know how to kill.

290
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,080
They know how to defend.

291
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,700
Can they learn how to kill first?

292
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,830
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

293
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,000
Imagine a time when we can return

294
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,870
to valuing... beauty.

295
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,750
The land, and life.

296
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,410
Death is a part of life.

297
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,750
Perhaps that is the cost
of getting our land back.

298
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,290
Do you believe it will happen?

299
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,290
Something's shifted in the air, Francesca.

300
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,700
Since that soldier arrived.

301
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,500
- I know.
- Everything feels more vulnerable.

302
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,120
Including Fringilla.

303
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,870
I'm taking care of it.

304
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,870
I was skeptical,

305
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,040
I'll be the first to admit, but...

306
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,330
I'm not here to tell you what to do.

307
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,450
I'm here to ask what you need of me.

308
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,750
I will greet
the elves who arrive on boats.

309
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,950
I will train them in human warfare.

310
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,040
I'll don Nilfgaardian armor
if it's what's important.

311
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,370
Whatever you need.

312
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,870
I need you to stay by my side.

313
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,750
I will.

314
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,080
By our side.

315
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,200
Where you belong.

316
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,950
She is what's most important now.

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,450
Stable.

322
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
But shaken.

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,790
What I can't figure is,

324
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,290
what would a mage want with Vesemir?

325
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,290
Well, why don't we ask the expert?

326
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,370
What business
could one of your kind have here,

327

328
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,950
That bastard is not one of <i>my</i> kind.

329
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,290
Oh, fuck me. I was only poking.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

330
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,620
Fire magic is off-limits for us.

331

Whoever he is,
he's not working for the Brotherhood.

332

If you say so.

333
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,290
And I don't think
Vesemir is what he was after.

334
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,200
Well, at least he left empty-handed.

507
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,290
did you survive in Sodden?

508
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,870
I almost didn't.
I'm one of the lucky ones.

509
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,410
Depending on your definition of luck.

510
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,120
Well, Geralt says you're
the most powerful mage he's ever known.

511
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,750
Well, that's nice of him.

512

Of course not.

515

516
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,160
But what about you?

517
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,790
I crossed paths with another of your, uh...

518

519
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,540
He told me what happened at Aretuza.

520
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,250
Is that why you're here?

521
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,450

522
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,620
Yes.

It's been a difficult few months.

524
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,290
But things finally seem
to be turning a corner.

525
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,120

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,370
Perhaps we were meant to find each other.

529
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,580
Um...

530
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,830
I'm going to go to bed.

531
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,580
Maybe I can...

532
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,700

- What kind of trouble?

A mage. I don't know who he was.

He could want Cirilla
to have a legitimate claim to Cintra.

- Unrelated facts.
- Hmm. Yes.

God, it's probably pure coincidence

that Emhyr wants the princess
with the secret power to shatter monoliths
