All curses have cures. What did she say?

329
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
She screamed something about

330
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,000
love and blood.

331
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,750
I don't remember.

332
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,160
I'll be honest.

333

340
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,540
After the Battle of Sodden, the...

341

countryside is a dangerous place.

342
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,080
Hungry soldiers, deserters...

343
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,160
Not reason enough for an entire village
to leave their homes.

345
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,790
when the Wild Hunt's
riding over the horizon.

346
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,200
I saw them myself.

347
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,910
Just last week.

348
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,660

across the southern sky.

349
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,750

351
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,830
My grandfather saw them
just before Cintra fell.

352
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,290
Her grandfather was a drunk.

353
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,250
He saw a lot of things.

I'm simply saying,
the North and South at war,

355

when they should be hibernating,

356
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,450

357

Maybe it's the end of days.

I feel like I could...

834
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:15,290
burn the whole world.

835
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:19,250
I wouldn't mean to.

836
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,540
Just...

837
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,450
It just makes me feel so afraid.

838
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,250
All the time.

839
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,250
Fear is an illness.

840
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,620
If you catch it
and you leave it untreated,

841
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,950
it can consume you.

842
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:41,660
How do you treat it?

843
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,200
You face it.

844
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,450
Facing your fear is not easy.

845
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:49,370
But I am here for you.

846
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,700
I won't let anything happen to you.

847
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,160
All right.

Cut what you need, and get moving.
We need to reach Cintra by dawn.

851
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:23,910
Look at them.

852
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:27,200
You're leading them
to a salvation that doesn't exist.

853
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,700
How long before they turn on you?
