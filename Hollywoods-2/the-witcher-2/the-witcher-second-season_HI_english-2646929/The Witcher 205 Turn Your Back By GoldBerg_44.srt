347
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,950
I need to show you something.

348
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,870
When the Conjunction happened,

349
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,660
it wasn't just the elves, humans, dwarves.

350
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,160
Spheres of beasts collided too.

351
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,330
Mages weaponized monsters.

352
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,370
Tried to conquer the lands with them.

353
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,330
Fucking idiots.

354
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,370
Of course,
the monsters destroyed everything.

355
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,080
Then, 300 years ago,

356
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,950
mages weaponized men.

357
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,620
Mutated them with elixirs.

358
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,790
Made them faster. Stronger.

359
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,160
Brutal enough to kill the beasts.

360
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,040
The witchers saved humanity
from extinction.

361
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,540
Do you know why
there are fewer of us each winter, Ciri?

362
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,950
Because when Kaer Morhen was destroyed,

363
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,080
so was the mutagen
that allowed us to make new witchers.

364
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,750
But I think you can help.

- Well, think about it.

419
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,120
Monsters didn't exist
on this plane before the Conjunction.

420
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,700
All species were separated
on different spheres

421
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,910
till those spheres merged into one.

422
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,370
A Conjunction like that
would've required two things.

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,950
A massive surge of energy

424
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,080
and... and conduits to channel it.

425
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,120
Now, what if
the monoliths aren't points of impact?

426
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,330

Because I am sick of feeling lost.

501

Everything I was told my whole life

502

was a lie.

503
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,410

509
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,750
you mean like you did with the myriapod?

510
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,950
Slightly less scientific than that.

511

No. It just requires
that we trust each other.

So who are you?

810
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,910
I am Commander Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach.

811
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,580
Who the fuck are you?

812
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,660
<font color="#138ce9">FRINGILLA:</font> Cahir!

813
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:18,830
Welcome home.

814
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:21,830
Good to see you alive.

00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,200

818
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,500
<font color="#138ce9">MAN:</font> This is bullshit.
I saw her go in the door.

819
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,200
Oh, shit.

820
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,700
You can't do this.
We've earned that reward.

821
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,290
You wouldn't even have
that traitorous mage if it wasn't for us.

<font color="#138ce9">SOLDIER:</font> Reward's already been claimed.

826
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,750
Now fuck off!

827
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:02,450
All right, all right!

828
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,000
<i>You're running out of time.</i>

829
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,040
Get your fucking hands off me.

830
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,410
I'm gonna take pleasure in your execution.

831
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,830

<i>You know the words.</i>

835
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,910
<i>Say them!</i>

836
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,790
Behold the mother of forests,

837
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,620
the Deathless Mother nesting in dreams.

838
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,580
Turn your back to the forest, hut, hut.

839
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,620
Oh!

840
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,410
- Yennefer!

841
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,410
Peeping Toms get the clink.

842
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,250
Gentlemen! Uh...

843
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,910
<font color="#138ce9">OLD WOMAN:</font> So good to see you again.

844
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,870
All alone in a world that hates you,

845
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,290
with no way to protect yourself.

846
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,080
How delicious.

847
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,120
I managed.

848
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,410
And yet you're here.

849
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,370
I'm not stupid.
I meant what I said before.

850
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,080
I'm done dealing in debts.

851
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,120
I want to make a trade.

852
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,540
I know what you want.

853
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,580
All that wrath
and righteous anger raging inside you.

854
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,000
I can smell your desires
like rotting meat.

855
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,330
But I'm not here to grant wishes.

856
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:32,330
I'm simply a guide
to get you exactly what you deserve.

857
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,790
Just ask your friends.

858
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:36,410
I deserve to survive.

859
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,450
I've earned it. I deserve access to Chaos.

860
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,250
I know how you can get it.

861
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,910
How you can steal it.

862
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,200
<font color="#138ce9">YENNEFER:</font> Steal what?

863
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,200
Me.

864
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:54,080
And who are you?

865
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,870
I'm the key
to you getting your power back.

866
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,540
And a great deal more than that.

867
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
All you have to do
is deliver me to the right lock.

868
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,200
A shattered black door
just outside Cintra.
