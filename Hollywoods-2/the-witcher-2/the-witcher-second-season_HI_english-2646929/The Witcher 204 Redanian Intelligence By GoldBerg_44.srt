So, Geralt said you saved his life.

167

He found himself in my kingdom a time ago.

168
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,870

When Geralt told me what Triss had done
for him, I invited her here.

181
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,200
I brought her here for you.

No one knows his proclivities.
No one knows anything about him.

Where he is. What he wants.

helping me, helping us,
helping us make this right.

I was at the great oak Bleobheris

The Seat of Friendship,
the druids called it.

no matter their race, their creed...

it is that sometimes,
legends can be intoxicating.

00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,750
Well, Sandpiper,

675

Some wounds cannot be healed.

in the creation
of the first witcher mutagens.
