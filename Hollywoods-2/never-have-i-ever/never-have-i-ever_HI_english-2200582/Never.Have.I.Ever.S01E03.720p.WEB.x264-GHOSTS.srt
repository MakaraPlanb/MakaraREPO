that turns your phone into a gun?

166
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,650
Then you can kill the Nazis with your gun.
Bam. War is over.

167
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,570
So, like, how would your app
turn your phone into a gun?

168
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,865
Same way Transformers work.
You just push a button, and it does it.

169
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,701
-Okay. Good idea, Trent.
-Thank you.

170
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,495
Since we are brainstorming,
I actually have some ideas, too.

171
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,122
Awesome. Let's see what you got, Lil' D.

172
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,376
[McEnroe] <i>Holy shit!</i>
<i>Did Paxton H-Y just give her a nickname?</i>

173
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,544
<i>You don't do that</i>

174
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,797
<i>unless you plan on referring</i>
<i>to that person a ton in the future.</i>

175
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,051
Speaking of D's, did you see Zoe's Insta?

176
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,637
She posted a Boomerang
of her doing jumping jacks.

177
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,847
-Shut up.
-Whoa.

178
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,891
Whoa.

179
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,017
Dude, let me see.

180
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,727
Wow.

181
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,271
[Trent] That bouncing's mad hypnotic, yo.

182
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,649
We're redoing my acrylic gels.

183
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,820
I prefer a round square, and maybe
a tasteful ombre in neutral pinks.

184
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,071
Fab, what would you like?

185
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:09,989
Um...

186
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,283
Clear nail polish, please.

187
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,118
Oh, come on. Try some fun nail art.

188
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,497
I saw a girl who had ice-cream cones
with sassy faces.

189
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,541
Uh, all right. Can I get little computers?

190
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,126
No. That's ugly.

191
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,047
[sighs] Try something girly,
like a flower or a cute bird.

192
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,173
What's your favorite bird?

193
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,090
Um...

194
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,843
I guess a chicken?

195
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,178
[woman sighs]

196
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,349
Okay. So how's that group project coming?

197
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,558
It's fine.

198
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,394
Eleanor and I got stuck
with this annoying kid, Ben,

199
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,772
and this other girl, Eve.

200
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,023
Uh-oh.

201
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,025
Sounds like someone has a crush.

202
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,818
What? No, I don't have a crush.

203
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,532
[McEnroe] <i>As a scientist, Fabiola was used</i>
<i>to a clear-cut, data-driven life.</i>

204
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,202
[robot] <i>Hello, Fabiola.</i>

205
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,371
And hello to you, Gears Brosnan.

206
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,001
<i>Which is why she was struggling</i>
<i>with these new complicated emotions.</i>

207
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,588
Oh, yeah? I mean,
any time I liked a boy in high school,

208
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,923
I always called him annoying.

209
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:10,967
Ew.

210
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,134
I don't have a crush on Ben.

211
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,595
He gets out of gym,
because he has a personal trainer.

212
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,474
Okay. Then which of the boys
in your class do you like?

213
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,475
[scoffs] No one.

214
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,147
I guess I technically have a boyfriend
named Alex Gomez.

215
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,942
What? Oh, my God, Fab!

216
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,902
-[chuckles]
-I'm so happy.

217
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,654
I've been dying for you
to have a boyfriend.

218
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,906
Boyfriends are what high school
is all about.

219
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,909
Wait. He is human, right?
He's not a robot?

220
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,828
[whispers] He's human.

221
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,414
[whispers] Yes.

222
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,374
[sighs]

223
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,920
What would you like to watch, Devi?

224
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,716
I found a Bollywood movie about a princess
who falls for a lowly street sweeper.

225
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,050
It's only seven hours long.

226
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,177
No, man. We're watching <i>Riverdale.</i>

227
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,056
Buckle up for some steamy teen romance.

228
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,809
[swallows]

229
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,145
These are high schoolers?

230
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,773
And their parents are okay with them
taking showers together in their homes?

231
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,027
Yeah, Kamala.
Welcome to American teen soaps.

232
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,362
The actors are also older than Mom.

233
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,117
Can I ask you a question?

234
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,035
Hmm.

235
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,871
What does it mean if a guy
is suddenly really nice to you?

236
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,333
Like, he chooses you for a group project,
and he gives you a nickname.

237
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,668
Sure the nickname is weirdly masculine,

238
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,379
but does it mean he wants
to be your boyfriend?

239
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,342
[exhales] Why are you asking me?
I don't know anything about boyfriends.

240
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,218
Did someone say
that I know about boyfriends?

241
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,220
I don't know who else to ask.

242
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,556
Mom married Dad. She never dated anyone.

243
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,474
Nor will I.

244
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,517
My first boyfriend will be my husband,

245
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,019
so I'm the wrong person to ask.

246
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,312
-[eats popcorn]
-Fine.

247
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,314
Sorry I brought it up.

248
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,982
I'm gonna get a drink.

249
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,196
[Kamala] Wait.
Is this also a murder mystery?

250
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,781
What is this show?

251
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,743
[Devi] Oh, my God!

252
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,539
Scram! Get out of my dad's garden,
you lousy coyote.

253
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,792
[western music plays]

254
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,754
[McEnroe] <i>Devi didn't consider herself</i>
<i>a particularly spiritual person,</i>

255
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,841
<i>but she couldn't deny that there was</i>
<i>something spooky going on here.</i>

256
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,261
<i>She felt as if she'd met</i>
<i>this coyote before,</i>

257
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,138
<i>as if they understood each other.</i>

258
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,813
<i>And then suddenly,</i>
<i>she knew exactly who this coyote was.</i>

259
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,772
Dad?

260
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,612
<i>After the supernatural occurrence</i>
<i>in her backyard,</i>

261
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,323
<i>Devi decided to search for answers</i>
<i>on the internet.</i>

262
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,533
[Paxton] Whoa.

263
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,617
It looks so good.

264
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,537
You killed it.
Like, it looks professional.

265
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,247
Thanks, Big P.

266
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,498
What?

267
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,209
'Cause earlier you called me Lil' D?

268
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,753
Oh, I did? Weird.

269
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,632
So... I just wrote out
the mission statement and pitch

270
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,468
explaining to shareholders
how Bunkr will link Londoners

271
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,054
with available bomb shelters
during the blitzkrieg.

272
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,890
Trent, did you do the logo?

273
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:05,975
Yeah.

274
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,393
Whoop-pa!

275
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,562
-The B stands for Bunkr.
-Nice.

276
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,147
Totally.

277
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,898
I'm just concerned it's a little simple.

278
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,943
Maybe we could add a person
hiding inside the B.

279
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,487
Nah. That sounds busy. I like mine.

280
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,823
It was really cool of you to do
so much of the work.

281
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,950
And for what it's worth,
I did come up with a slogan.

282
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:23,993
That's great.

283
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,036
That's like ten percent of our grade.
What is it?

284
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,455
All right. Check me out.

285
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,249
"Bunkr. Just open up the app
by clicking on the icon.

286
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,335
Put in your address, and you'll find
a bunker in your neighborhood...

287
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,712
if one is available.

288
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,088
Bunkr."

289
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,549
[laughs] Yo, that slogan sucks.

290
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,010
Slogans are supposed to be short and sexy.

291
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,470
Like, "Live más."

292
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,846
Shut up, dude. It's good.

293
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,931
It's good if you wanna repeat
the class a third time.

294
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,476
Just let Devi write it.
She's the smart one in the group.

295
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,311
No. It was good, Paxton,

296
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,855
but maybe I'll just take a quick pass
over your guys' section.

297
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,523
Make sure
everything flows well together.

298
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,901
Yeah, whatever.
Just as long as we're done.

299
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,528
Yo, you still game
for the kickback this weekend?

300
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,905
Oh, hell yeah. I'm there.

301
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,032
It's gonna be sick.
My parents are out of town.

302
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,825
My cousin will
take me to BevMo to get booze.

303
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,368
You're having a no-parents party?

304
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:07,953
Uh...

305
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,456
I don't know if I'd call it that,
but yeah, it's gonna be fire.

306
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,041
Basically, everyone I know is invited.

307
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,375
Which reminds me--

308
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,710
To keg, or not to keg?

309
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,086
[Trent] That is the question.

310
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,546
[McEnroe] <i>Devi thought to herself:</i>

311
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,465
<i>if everyone Trent knew was invited,</i>

312
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,843
<i>and Trent, technically, knew her,</i>
<i>then wasn't she invited?</i>

313
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,847
<i>This kickback was the perfect chance</i>
<i>to show Paxton that she could be cool</i>

314
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,599
<i>and get sex back on the agenda.</i>

315
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,393
Jewber's a good idea. You guys are crazy.

316
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,479
A ride-sharing app to help
the Jews escape the Nazis?

317
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,563
[chuckles] It's brilliant.

318
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,856
No, it's not.

319
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,943
It's an app that tells a stranger
the exact location of a Jewish person

320
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,569
and sends a car to round them up.

321
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,781
Whatever. It's a good idea
from the smartest person in the room,

322
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,242
and you're all hating on it
'cause you are anti-Semitic.

323
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,118
I actually am Jewish.

324
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,036
Oh.

325
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,996
You're fine, but you guys suck.

326
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,499
You're totally useless
without your Commander in Dork.

327
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,502
Devi is no dork.
She's a trailblazing Indian diva

328
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,504
that marches to the beat
of her own drummer.

329
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,799
[chuckles] Last Halloween, she did
a couple's costume with a librarian.

330
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,843
That is pretty classic dork behavior.

331
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,930
Oh, yeah? Would a dork be sleeping
with Paxton Hall-Yoshida from school?

332
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,181
Uh-huh. Yeah, right.

333
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,099
It's true.

334
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,477
Devi V and Paxton H-Y are plundering
each other's bods on the reg.

335
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,562
Sure. Whatever.

336
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,648
Look, I'm gonna go do the project
on my own, like I wanted to before.

337
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,441
You guys will just have
to like what I make.

338
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,027
[phone chimes]

339
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,904
Oliver's here.

340
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,532
We're going to sit in his hot tub
and sing at each other.

341
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,449
Bye, queens.

342
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,786
I should get going, too.

343
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,873
Oh, I like your nails.
Those chickens are cute.

344
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,124
Thanks.

345
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,501
Uh, before you go, I wanted to ask.

346
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,088
A couple of my friends
and I are going to a fundraiser

347
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,340
for a queer youth center this weekend.

348
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,135
It should be cool, if you're interested.

349
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,888
Why would you invite me to that?

350
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,557
Because I thought you might be into it.

351
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,851
Why didn't you invite Eleanor and Ben?

352
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,770
I don't know. They were sort of... a lot.

353
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,815
-And I thought maybe--
-I think you have the wrong idea about me.

354
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,532
So I'm going to my first party.

355
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,492
Well, that should be fun.

356
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,286
Which brings me to my question.

357
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,247
Do you mind going to the store
and buying me a thong?

358
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,666
-What?
-My mom won't buy them for me.

359
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,002
Just like a simple red lace thong

360
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,504
with a rhinestone phrase on the front
that says "do me."

361
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,008
I will <i>not</i> be buying you
a tacky-ass thong.

362
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,844
Fine. I'll just cut the cheeks out
of my normal underwear. Whatever.

363
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,513
What matters is, is that life is good now,

364
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,975
and I can basically forget about
all that bad stuff that happened before.

365
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,977
Well, forgetting is not the goal.

366
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,897
We're trying to process
all that's happened to you,

367
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,690
especially losing your father.

368
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,776
I am processing.

369
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,153
In fact,
I talked to my dad the other night.

370
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,698
Okay. You used the grief journal.

371
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,659
No. He came to me as a coyote.

372
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,453
Excuse me?

373
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,081
Are you gonna be weird about this?

374
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,999
Because if you are,
I'm not gonna talk about it.

375
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,044
You know, this is a safe space. Go ahead.

376
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,629
Okay. Well...

377
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,423
the other night,
there was a coyote in my backyard,

378
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,967
and it was legit my dad.

379
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,343
He was in my dad's garden,

380
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,844
picked up my dad's tennis ball,

381
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,930
plus, his eyes...

382
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,432
It was just him!

383
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,478
That is a beautiful thing.

384
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,604
[Dr. Ryan] Hmm?

385
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,106
And going forward,

386
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,818
you might see your dad as a butterfly,

387
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,362
or a bird, or a gentle breeze, or--

388
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,446
No. Dr. Ryan, 

389
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,783
I didn't see him metaphorically
with my heart or some shit.

390
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,995
My eyes saw my father's soul
in the body of a coyote.

391
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,123
Okay.

392
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,292
Well, if you see that coyote again,

393
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,169
I want you to talk to him.

394
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,839
Tell him what you're feeling, hmm?

395
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,174
-I will.
-Good girl.

396
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,386
So... if you're not gonna buy me a thong,

397
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,888
do you have any alcohol in here
that I could take to the party?

398
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,140
Out.

399
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,312
Hey, Mom. Sorry to interrupt,

400
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,441
but I actually have a chore of my own
that I have to do.

401
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,359
We didn't finish our project,

402
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,611
so now I have to go back to Trent's house.

403
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,030
I'm super bummed.

404
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,573
This project is not yet done?

405
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,825
Have you partnered with stupid people?

406
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:15,743
Mom, I told you.

407
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,953
The guidance counselor says
that parents aren't allowed

408
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,121
to use the S-word anymore.

409
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,290
This is why
the American school system is failing,

410
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,375
because everybody is treated
like they're special

411
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,836
when most of them should just drop out
and learn a trade.

412
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,380
Maybe if America had
more air traffic controllers,

413
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,798
we wouldn't be in debt to China.

414
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,843
Is your rant over, or can I go to Trent's?

415
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,763
Yeah, it's fine.
Take him a box of See's Candies.

416
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,930
Not the clusters.

417
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,183
Those are for my work associates.

418
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,060
No one in America does that, Mom.

419
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,812
Again, that is why China is beating us.

420
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,356
No child of mine shall go
to someone's house in the evening

421
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,901
without taking a delicious box
of confections for the parents.

423
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,331
Wait. Are you watching <i>Riverdale?</i>

424
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,250
Yes. I had to start from the beginning
to understand their journeys.

425
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,837
What's so interesting about this show
is everyone has different backgrounds,

426
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,255
-but they're all hot.
-Cool.

427
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,132
Well, I'm gonna go study
at a friend's house.

428
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,926
That's why I borrowed
your thigh-high boots.

429
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,552
I don't understand the correlation.

430
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,970
-Why would you--

to stand up to your parents.

00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,180
Oh, hey. What are you doing here?

445
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,432
Did you forget your calculator
or something?

446
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,144
Whoa! Devi, you came.

447
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,187
And you brought California Brittle.

448

449
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,985
-Do you want a drink?
-Oh, yeah.

450
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,445

451
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,072
Do people call it that?

452
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,532
Yeah, I think they do.

453
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,367
Are you not having one?

454
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,829
No. I don't drink during swim season.
You gotta keep the body right, you know?

455
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,038
Yeah, totally.

456
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,082
If I had your body,
I'd treat it right too.

457
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,169
I'm so sorry.
That was such a weird thing to say.
