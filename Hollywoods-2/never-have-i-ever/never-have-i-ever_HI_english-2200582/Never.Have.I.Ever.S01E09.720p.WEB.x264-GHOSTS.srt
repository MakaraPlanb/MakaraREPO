00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,616
Aravind? We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow morning.

7
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,620
Devi, why are you screaming at your uncle?

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,874
-Uh, cause he scared the crap out of me.
-[chuckles]

00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,709
[Devi] What are you doing here,
Aravind Periyappa?

10
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,794
Currently, I'm looking for mustard.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,922
He's also here to be the male chaperone
for Prashant's visit.

12
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,633
Hey, let me help you. You come. Sit, sit.

13
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,386
You must be so tired after driving
all the way from San Jose.

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm sorry if I frightened you,

15
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,224
but you left the spare key under the mat.

16
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:03,188
And as the owner of the number two
home security company in San Jose area,

17
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,774
I must say your house
is very easy to break into.

18
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:10,779
I know, Aravind. You try and sell me
a security system every visit.

19
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,864
What if Prashant came here tomorrow,

20
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,076
and found everyone chopped up
into little pieces by a murderer?

21
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,787
That would leave him
with a very bad impression of our family.

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,790
Hey, why did you have to use a spare key?
Why didn't someone let you in?

23
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,502
Kamala was asleep. I could hear
her beautiful snoring from upstairs,

24
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,544
and Devi just got home.

25
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,088
Where were you?

26
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,256
And what are you wearing?

27
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,050
Uh...

28
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,802

I think it's okay.

00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,978
The worst criminal in our neighborhood

34
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,147
is the lady who watered her lawn
during the drought.

35
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,817
I reported her,
and she's been punished accordingly.

36
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,985
All right. It's very late.

37
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,404
I want to be fresh to meet
Kamala's future husband tomorrow,

38
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,906
so let's all get some sleep.

39
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,575
I don't know if I can fall asleep
in a house

40
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,870
where a burglar can walk in at any time
and murder me,

41
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,540
but I will do my best.

00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,833

she almost forgot
a much more exciting new memory.

Maybe you would benefit
from a different approach.

[McEnroe] Oh, that dress?

68
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,796
It's currently sitting in the back
of Paxton's Jeep, soaked in pool water.

Yeah. I can't wear that.

today is Kamala's day,

any of the usual Devi nonsense.

that memory off, but there it was again.

Of all days,
today she needed to be normal.

95

So she had no choice but to shove
that memory back down

I wasn't doing anything.

She gets to be on her phone.
How come you're not yelling at her?

Don't bother your cousin, sweetie.
She doesn't need any extra pressure.

00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,896
I just googled the price.
Wow, that's valuable.

173
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,815
Now you really need
a home security system.

174
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,817
Why don't I put that somewhere safe?

175
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,403
-I can take it to your room, Kamala.
-Thank you, Devi.

176
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,990
Don't take too long, and don't waste
your time looking for your phone.

177
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,283
It's very well hidden.

178
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,161
Prashant, you must be hungry.

179
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,370
Please come, sit.

180
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,544
Steve? Oh, my God!
You scared the crap out of me.

181
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,339
You almost made me drop
this expensive-ass beaver!

182
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,590
Nature's engineer?

183
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,467
Did he give that to her?

184
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,969
Yeah, but what are you doing here?

185
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,096
I'm rescuing my love
from sexual slavery.

186
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,682
It looks like you're just reading
an Indian hair magazine.

187
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,559
Shouldn't you like storm down
and get her?

188
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,938
I was going to, but I didn't know
how big Prashant was,

189
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,981
and also, I'm scared of your mom.

190
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,902
Okay. It doesn't seem like
you'll be storming anywhere.

191
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,238
You just stay here, and I'll get Kamala.

192
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,369
I thought I came to America
for the great education,

193
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,038
but I think my favorite part
might be the ice cream.

194
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,957
There are so many flavors here.

195
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,875
Way more than just pistachio.

196
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,379
My favorite part is that traffic
is separated into two directions.

197
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,505
It's adorable.

198
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,298
That took long enough.

199
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,051
Sorry. I was busy trying
to find the perfect spot

200
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,928
for the crystal beaver in Kamala's room.

201
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,098
In fact, I think she should check out
where I put it.

202
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,308
-No, that's okay. I trust you.
-You shouldn't.

203
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,769
You should really see the beaver
for yourself.

204
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,021
You're never gonna believe
where it ended up.

205
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,898
A shelf? A table?

206
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,192
-Now I'm curious. Can I go see?
-No!

207
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,196
Kamala should be alone
with the crystal beaver

208
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,532
and figure out what the future holds
for the two of them.

209
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,286
Okay. I guess I'll go look.

210
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,704
[exhales]

211
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,915
[Prashant]
So, Uncle, you're a security system...

212
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,333
What are you up to?

213
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,003
I thought we said no Devi nonsense.

214
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
[Aravind] ...in the south San Jose area.

215
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,881
Nalini, please calm down.

216
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,719
I will not calm down when this child
insists on being such a headache to me!

217
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,886
Oh, my God. Dad!

218
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,555
Devi is not a headache.

219
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,016
The concert starts in 30 minutes.

220
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,853
So let's stop yelling at each other
and look for the sheet music together,

221
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,106
and when we come home later,
I will fix this.

222
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,151
Kanna, please go upstairs and check again.

223
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,444
Upstairs!

224
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,905
Yeah, yeah. Take your time going up!

225
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,575
[McEnroe] Okay, keep it together, Devi.

226
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,994
You don't need to go back there.
Stay in the present.

227
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,456
I'm sure whatever your Uncle Aravind
is saying is really interesting.

228
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,373
Focus.

229
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,791
[Aravind] What people don't realize

230
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,669
is that most home burglaries
happen during the daytime.

231
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:33,341
That's why I recommend clients live
as far north on their blocks as possible

232
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,800
where days are shorter.

233
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,473
-Hello, Kamala.
-Oh, my God. Steve?

234
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,934
Why are you here?

235
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,687
Because you shouldn't be bought and sold
by your family like a prized calf.

236
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,733
That's not what's happening here,
and that also feels a little racial.

237
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,693
I want a chance to make my offer.

238
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,695
Let me start by saying
I don't have a ring.

239
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,280
No, no, no. Get up.

240
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,658
I don't want to marry you.

241
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,618
But you want to marry
that stranger downstairs?

242
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,119
No, I don't want to marry anyone!

243
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,081
[sighs]

244
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,501
Oh, Steve, you're so sweet,

245
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,379
and handsome,
and surprisingly good at mini golf,

246
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,048
and I appreciate you being
my first boyfriend, but--

247
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,091
Oh, no.

248
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,469
Did I just talk you into
breaking up with me?

249
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,555
Sorry, but I think you did.

250
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,850
So, Uncle tells me
you're a dermatologist, Auntie.

251
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,062
She is. 
We have a lot of doctors in the family.

252
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:32,066
Cousin Manju started
her cardiology residency at 18.

253
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,402
Devi, you have some catching up to do.

254
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,530
Well, Cousin Manju is also
a 28-year-old virgin.

255
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,614
So, I'm good.

256
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,282
[laughs]

257
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,826
[laughs]

258
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,496
[McEnroe] The day was turning around.
Forget those pesky flashbacks.

259
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,582
Devi had reined in her brain
and was being charming as hell.

260
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,252
So, Devi, what are you into?

261
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,296
Oh, this young lady
is a very talented musician.

262
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,924
Devi, why don't you play something
on your harp?

263
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,970
[dramatic music playing]

264
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,516
[Aravind] Devi. Hello?

265
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,394
Don't leave us music lovers waiting.

266
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:12,106
Devi is, uh, actually taking 
a little break from the harp right now.

267
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,650
Kanna, why don't you
just help me clear the table?

268
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,776
I don't know about you,

269
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,362
but now all I can think about
is hearing some harp.

270
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,744
[whispering] What's wrong with you?
You're acting so strange.

271
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,121
I'm fine.
I think I'm having low blood sugar.

272
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,873
I don't see how. You ate five samosas.

273
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,625
I'm sorry.
I'm just under a lot of stress right now.

274
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,086
How are your legs? Can you feel this?

275
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,922
-Yes, and it hurts! Stop pinching me.
-Okay.

276
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,883
My legs are fine. Everything's fine.

277
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,217
Okay. Good, good.

278
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,720
I just don't want Prashant
to tell his family that we're weird.

279
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,848
Okay, look. You go back in there.
You talk to him.

280
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,850
I'm gonna go see
what's taking Kamala so long.

281
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,436
No, Mom, wait!

282
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,189
No, it's not because you're bad at sex.

283
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,858
-Oh, God.
-[door closes]

284
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,653
Kamala, what is your boyfriend doing here
when your future husband is here?

285
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,156
-How did you know that I had a boyfriend?
-It's pretty obvious.

286
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,950
All the sneaking around,
all the whispered phone calls.

287
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,369
I also saw him fall off the roof
a couple of mornings ago.

288
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,580
I'm so sorry, Kamala. I tried to stop her,

289
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,665
but she shot up here
like a frigging panther.

290
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,875
I have let you down, Auntie.

291
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,795
You welcomed me into your home,
and I've been lying to you.

292
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,546
[McEnroe] Devi felt bad for her cousin.

293
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,800
She knew the storm that was
about to be unleashed on her.

294
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,968
This was gonna be a bloodbath.

295
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,970
It's okay. I understand.

296
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,307
Huh? You understand?

297
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,518
You have literally never said that
to me before.

298
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,727
Devi, please.

299
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,605
[Nalini] All I'm saying is

300
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,525
I know there are some real hunks
on the Caltech campus.

301
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,485
I've watched Big Bang Theory.

302
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,736
So you're not mad?

303
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,862
Of course not.

304
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,280
What the hell is going on here?

305
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,699
Look, no one is forcing you
to do anything.

306
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,828
All a family can do is just point you
in the right direction.

307
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,247
-What if I'm the right direction?
-You're not.

308
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,416
Okay, we need to get him out of here
before Prashant or Aravind see him.

309
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,085
Uh, he can go back out the window.

310
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,420
No, no, he can't. It's too risky.

311
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,923
Aravind might just hear him
clomping around on the roof.

312
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,217
Then he'll have to go out the front door,

313
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,885
but we'll need a distraction.

314
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,303
Devi?

315
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,017
Yeah, I can do that.

316
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:13,978
Get up.

317
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,774
Prashant, I noticed that you carry
your cell phone in your front pocket.

318
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,985
Is that because you do not wish
to have any children?

319
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,822
Hi. Would either of you care
to have your chai in the living room?

320
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,073
Oh, God, yes.

321
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,410
Uh, no, thank you. I prefer to lift my tea
from dining table level.

322
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,704
But wouldn't rather sit
in a more comfortable seat?

323
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,038
No.

324
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,874
Okay.

325
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,125
Um...

326
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,508
What if I played my harp for you?

327
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,470
Really? How wonderful!

328
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,767
[tuning harp]

329
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,561
Sorry. It's been a minute.

330
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,313
I just need to tune this thing.

331
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,231
It's fine. Take your time.

332
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,026
[tuning harp]

333
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,779
[Prashant] Are you okay, Devi?

334
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,615
You don't have to play
if you don't want to.

335
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,451
Maybe we should wait
until Kamala and Nalini come back.

336
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,161
What's taking them so long?

337
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,497
No, it's fine. I'm ready.

338
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,424
[playing song]

339
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,807
Kanna, look what I got you. It's a harp.

340
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,226
Harp? I wanted a guitar.

341
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,437
[Mohan] No, you don't. Come here.

342
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,941
Any idiot can play the guitar.
It only has six strings.

343
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,692
How many strings do you see here?

344
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,903
-A million.
-Exactly.

345
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,448
[Mohan] See, this is an instrument
for a real musician.

346
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,909
You're far too special
for a stupid guitar.

347
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,702
Prodigy.

348
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,081
[McEnroe] Hey, this is kind of
a breakthrough.

349
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,708
Devi is playing the harp again?

350
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,585
Maybe she's all better now.

351
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,922
Shall we go?

352
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,058
[door closes]

353
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,184
Goodbye, Steve.

354
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,144
I'm sorry if I've hurt you.

355
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,312
You did.

356
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,653
Is Devi home?

357
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,915
[song ends]

358
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,167
[Ararvind and Prashant clapping]

359
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,962
How wonderful! You're very talented, Devi.

360
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,798
Prashant, we should set her up
with your little brother.

361
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,759
Your brother Arun, not the one
who works at Massage Envy.

362
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,302
[Nalini] Hello, everyone.

363
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,888
[laughs] Here is Kamala.

364
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,474
I'm just gonna steal Devi for a second.

365
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,395
Did you get rid of Steve?
How hard did he cry?

366
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,649
Paxton?

367
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,776
There are more boys
coming and going in this house

368
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,236
than the GameStop at the mall.

369
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,613
Look, I can go. It seems like a bad time.

370
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,992
-You just weren't responding to texts.
-Don't go, Paxton.

371
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,579
You haven't returned Devi back her dress
that she took off in your car.

372
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,583
Okay, I did take off my dress
and leave it in his car,

373
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,544
-but not in the way you think I did.
-Don't even try.

374
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,505
I cannot believe you
because you keep lying to me.

375
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,550
She's telling the truth, Dr. Vishwakumar.
She fell in the pool at the party,

376
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,968
so I gave her a change of clothes.

377
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,720
-[Nalini] A party?
-Oh, shit.

378
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,431
[sarcastically] Thank you so much, Paxton,
for clearing that up.

379
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,062
So, not only did you disobey me
by going to this party last night,

380
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,647
you were so sober, you fell into the pool,

381
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,858
and then did God knows what
with this boy in his car.

382
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,568
All we did was kiss.

383
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,861
You what?

384
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,947
[McEnroe] Paxton,
these are very unforced errors.

385
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,742
Oh, Devi, this is just terrific.

386
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,410
Great decision making.

387
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,412
Why don't you just
let this idiot knock you up?

388
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,500
Maybe Princeton will allow you
to raise a little baby in your dorm room.

389
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,793
He's not an idiot.

390
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,546
Oh, I'm sorry. Is he an honors student?
I had no idea. My apologies, Paxton.

391
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,049
[McEnroe] Even though Nalini
was talking out of frustration

392
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,258
more than anything else,

393
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,053
Paxton was stung by these little digs
at his intelligence.

394
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,513
-I'm gonna go.
-Mmm.

395
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,974
You must have a very busy day
returning dresses to other smart girls

396
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,893
whose futures you're trying to ruin.

397
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,894
Mom, stop.

398
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,437
What was that?

399
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,106
I barely did anything.

400
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,316
I kissed one boy one time.

401
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,777
Meanwhile, the guy
Kamala's having sex with

402
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,862
just broke into our house,
and you don't even care.

403
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,158
Well, I'll say it again. I'm not surprised
someone has broken into this house.

404
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,869
This seems like
a very private conversation.

405
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,872
[Kamala] Prashant...

406
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,752
I am so sorry.

407
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,882
I was seeing someone,

408
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,968
and he did kind of
just break into the house.

409
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,346
Was it the guys who was climbing
the tree outside when I arrived?

410
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,722
I thought he was the landscaper.

411
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,349
Yes, that was Steve.

412
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,184
So this was all a waste of time?

413
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,436
Wow. I feel like I'm being pranked.

414
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,064
No. No, I would never prank you.

415
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,190
I hate pranks.

416
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,485
I don't understand why America has
a national holiday to celebrate them.

417
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,822
I agree. April Fools' is way scarier
than Halloween.

418
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,781
[chuckles softly]

419
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,244
Look, Prashant,
I am so sorry this happened,

420
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,789
but I promise you
I'm not with Steve anymore.

421
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,961
But also... I don't think I'm ready
to get engaged today.

422
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,172
[laughs] Well, that is very clear.

423
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,757
That doesn't mean I won't ever be.

424
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,094
This all just feels so strange
at the moment.

425
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,013
I know. It's weird for me too.

426
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,724
To be honest, I'm actually relieved

427
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,268
you aren't some Goody Two-shoes
who does everything you're told.

428
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,437
It makes you more interesting.

429
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,481
-You think so?
-Definitely.

430
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,317
Every other Indian girl
I've been set up with

431
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,902
has tried to act like my mother.

432
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,862
[laughs] Yes. What is that about?

433
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,365
I don't know, but I'm certainly not trying
to go to bed with my mother every night.

434
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,034
[both laugh]

435
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,079
I know you just had another man
climbing on you roof,

436
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,499
so maybe I'm an idiot for saying this,
but I can't help it.

437
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,002
I kinda like you.

438
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,129
I kinda like you too.

439
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,215
And your family is very...

440
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,050
entertaining.

441
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,136
What if we just kept this between us?

442
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,722
Took things slow.
Just got to know each other.

443
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,185
Are you saying you don't want
my uncle around every time we talk?

444
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,853
I'd prefer if he were not.

445
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,188
I would too.

446
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,648
-[both laugh]
-[door opens]

447
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,775
Two secret boyfriends
have entered this house

448
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,945
during a lunch
to decide this family's future.

449
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,447
What is it when I'm not here?
Three secret boyfriends?

450
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,574
This household is out of control!

451
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,659
It's not out of control.

452
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,495
I'd argue it's too under control.

453
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,455
Devi, do not talk back to your uncle.

454
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,209
The lack of discipline and respect here
is astounding to me.

455
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,671
When you return to India,
this behavior will be put to bed!

456
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,214
We're going to India?

457
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,716
Can't we vacation in Aspen
like Ben's family?

458
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,343
It's the playground
of the rich and famous.

459
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,805
[laughs] You're not just going on vacation
to India, young lady.

460
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,891
Mom, what is he talking about?

461
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,396
Sweetheart, your uncle and I have been 
talking for the past month or so

462
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,983
about how hard it's been for us here,
especially with family being so far away--

463
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,777
Oh, my God. You want us to move to India?

464
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,153
I...

465
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,326
I think it would be better for us.

466
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,414
-I need to go to my room.
-[Nalini] Devi...

467
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,457
Aravind.

468
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,336
-Devi, listen to me.
-No, I don't want to.

469
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,131
Look, I'll know it'll be a big change,
but I think we need it.

470
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,925
Look, I feel like a stranger here,
and I don't have a support system,

471
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,469
and frankly, without your father around,
I just...

472
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,347
I just feel like I'm really struggling
to raise you.

473
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,433
[sentimental music playing]

474
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,109
[sighs]

475
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,361
[Nalini] You are too easy on her.

476
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,988
No, I'm not.
I have a different approach.

477
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,198
Okay, great. Then why don't you raise her?

478
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,327
Because I give up. I am done.
She's too headstrong and doesn't listen.

479
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,370
Whoever this child is,
I am through with her!

480
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,664
-[Mohan] Nalini--
-[Nalini] No, that's your child.

481
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,750
She's no daughter of mine.

482
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,007
I understand you're struggling
to raise me.

483
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,426
You're struggling to raise me
'cause you don't like me.

484
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,221
What? Don't like you? That's not true.

485
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,058
I heard what you said the night Dad died.

486
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,143
You said I wasn't your daughter.

487
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,481
I know I'm just a burden to you.

488
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,149
So you can go to India alone.

489
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,318
Or maybe take Kamala with you.

490
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,487
She's the daughter you actually wanted.

491
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,323
Devi, that's not fair.

492
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,949
[crying] What's not fair

493
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,994
is that I lost the only parent
that actually cared about me.

494
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,875
I wish you were the one
that died that night.

495
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,794
[door slams]

496
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,508
[harp music playing]
