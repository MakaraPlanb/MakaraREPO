00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,306
[McEnroe] The day after the hottest guy
in school calls you out

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,142
for lying about having sex with him,

4
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,727
you're gonna wanna keep a low profile,

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,311
which according to Devi

6
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,856
meant dressing like
a celebrity leaving LAX.

7
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,359
Since the whole school now knew
what a psycho liar she was,

8
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,404
Devi felt like her only move
was to be completely invisible,

9
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,281
perhaps until graduation.

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,366

[school bell rings]

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,680
[McEnroe] Her plan worked pretty well
for a few days.

14
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,059
That is until she assumed 
Eric Perkins could remain upright

15
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,602
for the length of a hallway.

18
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,983
That's where I get
all my frigging vitamins.

00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,234
[chortling]

20
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,113
Coyote Girl.

21
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,990
I know your secret.

22
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,076
[school bell rings]

23
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,744
You have a hot cousin.

24
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,412
I saw her drop you off yesterday.

25
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,039
You think she'd be into me?

26
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,418
Um, she's kind of in
an arranged marriage sitch.

27
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,961
Just ask her anyway.

28
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,463
[McEnroe] For the first time,

29
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,508
Devi was relieved to hear someone
praise Kamala's appearance

30
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,052
because it meant Trent did not know 
her real secret.

31
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,012
In fact, no one seemed to know.

32
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,140
Holy shit! 
Paxton didn't tell anyone she lied!

33
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,017
Why? Was he protecting her?

34
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,061
Did he care about her? Was he in love?

35
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,604
[low murmuring]

36
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,149
Nope, he'd just forgotten about her.

37
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,317
[Zoe] Yes.

38
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,153
-Yeah, definitely.
-You have to wear it 24/7.

39
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,613
-Okay.
-[speaks indistinctly]

40
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,614
Yes.

41
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,538
Hey, ladies. What's a-poppin'?

42
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,790
Seat's taken.

43
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,210
Don't hate me. I got cheese fries
and chili fries for the table.

44
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,547
Jonah? Since when are you guys friends?

45
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,007
Since a couple of days ago
when we became inseparable.

46
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,717
[McEnroe] After coming out to Eleanor,

47
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,428
Fabiola was still struggling
with how to tell her family.

48
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,559
Luckily for her, Jonah was struggling
with the same thing.

49
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,521
Jonah's been a really good friend to us,

50
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,149
and definitely hasn't yelled at us
for no reason.

51
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,692
I didn't yell at you guys.

52
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,110
[McEnroe] Yeah, she did.

53
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,572
Trust me. Whatever you guys have going on,
my shit's bigger, okay?

54
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,198
I have the bigger shit!

55
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,827
Okay. I guess it's fair
to call that a yell.

56
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,329
I'm sorry. I've been going through a lot.

57
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,333
We know. We saw Paxton and Zoe
sharing a big cookie at lunch.

58
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,252
It's pretty obvious you two are over.

59
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,129
[McEnroe] Because they were already
mad at her,

60
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,757
Devi chose not to tell them
she'd lied about Paxton deflowering her.

61
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,011
The truth was she was more flowered
than a Rose Parade float.

62
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,762
It's true. I was dumped.

63
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,307
So shouldn't you guys
cut me a little slack?

64
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,309
I don't think we can.

65
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,896
Your instability makes this friendship
feel unsafe for all of us.

66
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,358
Jonah, this is an A, B, C conversation,
so can you get your D out of here?

67
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,943
[Fabiola] Hey, don't be rude to Jonah.

68
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,571
While you were all wrapped up
in your Paxton stuff,

69
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,281
we've had some serious drama go down.

70
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,868
Yeah, and Jonah's been our safe harbor
in this chaotic life storm.

71
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,870
Okay. Maybe I've been distracted,

72
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,872
but I'm here for you guys.

73
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,249
Let me be your harbor master.

74
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,168
What's up?

75
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,045
You don't have to tell her
if you're not ready.

76
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:37,008
It's just I had sort of
an important realization recently, and--

77
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,469
Oh! You finally figured out
you're a Gryffindor like me?

78
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,055
No. I'm obviously Ravenclaw, like Eleanor.

79
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,765
[McEnroe] They're all Hufflepuff.

80
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,558
So, what is it?

81
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,477
I'm...

82
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,439
-gay.
-What?

83
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,275
You're... gay?

84
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:55,985
Yeah.

85
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,404
This is huge.

86
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm so happy for you!

87
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,492
Oh, my God.
So much of you makes sense now.

88
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,620
Like, when you said your ideal man
was James Corden in Cats.

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,121
Congratulations.

90
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,042
Oh! That's why Jonah's
been such a big help.

91
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,755
Because he's a socially progressive
young man.

92
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,840
No. You're correct.

93
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,634
I'm a baby Buttigieg.

94
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,679
I hate that I missed out on this moment.

95
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,805
Let me make it up to you.

96
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,390
No, it's okay.

97
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,392
I'm just glad Jonah was there.

98
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,146
No. I'm gonna make it up to you.

99
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,024
[McEnroe] Devi realized
for the first time

100
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,277
that if she didn't step up
her friend game,

101
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,571
she could lose Fabiola and Eleanor. 
Then she would have no one.

102
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:45,243
So, she decided to host a classic-gang,
girls-only, Jonah-free sleepover.

103
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,331
All right, gals. How we doing?

104
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,167
-Everyone having fun at my slumber party?
-Absolutely.

105
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,879
I can't believe you rented Chicago
and let me sing the whole way through it.

106
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,049
I really enjoyed programming
your family's universal remote.

107
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,760
Of course. Tonight is about you guys.

108
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,388
So, what do you say we crank this party up

109
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,640
and practice some
alcohol-based party games?

110
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,850
Is it real?

111
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,436
No. It's kombucha
mixed with apple cider vinegar.

112
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,314
It's great training for looking cute
while drinking something gross.

113
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,149
Isn't this great, guys?

114
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,651
The OG crew hanging out.

115
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,112
Just the original Fab Three.

116
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,071
[phone dings]

117
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,199
Oh, my God. Fab, you have to see this.

118
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,535
Jonah is on stage at Rocky Horror.

119
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,746
He looks amazing in fishnets.

120
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,374
Hey, I know Jonah pays attention
to you guys and smells really good,

121
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,294
but other than that,
I don't get why he's so great.

122
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,171
He's really wise.

123
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,215
He told me a bob haircut
would allow me to play a child

124
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,967
or an adult professional woman.

125
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,970
And he has really great insight
on that thing with your mom.

126
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,430
What thing with your mom?

127
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:52,810
We saw her. She's been living here,
working at a Mexican restaurant in Encino.

128
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,897
The postcards were nothing but a charade.

129
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,025
What? Oh, my God. What did you say to her?

130
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,777
Nothing. I ran away.

131
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,654
She called and texted,
but Jonah said that I should ignore her

132
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,240
because she's a liar
who committed postal fraud.

133
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,827
Yeah. He thinks we need
to keep toxic people out of our lives.

134
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,372
When he said that,
he was talking about you,

135
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,664
but I think it applies here too.

136
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,626
Well, some might say
Jonah is a little toxic...

137
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,504
specifically towards 
life-long female friendships.

138
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,505
That's not the point.

139
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,800
I think you should talk to you mom
and find out why she's here.

140
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,760
Yeah, I miss her.

141
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,846
But she's gonna have to do more
than send weak apology texts

142
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,848
if she wants to get me to talk to her.

143
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,226
[McEnroe] And just like that, 

144
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,271
Devi knew how she could prove
that she was a true friend of Eleanor's.

145
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,442
This table looks like trouble.

146
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,819
Are we doing margaritas,

147
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,154
or do you guys have to take
a driver's test later?

148
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,364
[laughing]

149
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,243
Let me give you guys a sec to decide,

150
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,869
and I'll be right back.

151
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,539
-Devi?
-Hi, Ms. Wong.

152
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,208
Wow. I almost didn't recognize you.

153
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,210
You really grew into your eyebrows.

154
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,003
Thank you.

155
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,839
Did Eleanor send you here?

156
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,882
No, I came on my own.

157
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,592
I thought maybe I could help.

158
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,095
You know, I felt so terrible.

159
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,140
I wanted to explain everything to her,
but then she ran out the door.

160
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,642
Yeah, she's pretty upset.

161
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,394
But I know she loves you,

162
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,937
and she wants you in her life.

163
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,022
I just think you might need
to do a little bit more

164
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,441
than calling and texting.

165
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:23,985
Like what?

166
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,654
You're an actress.

167
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,698
Why not give her the old razzle-dazzle?

168
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,950
Rent out a black box theater

169
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,035
and perform a one-woman show
dedicated to her.

170
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,165
No. I meant more like talk to her...

171
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,624
in person.

172
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,876
Oh.

173
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,296
Great note. I can do that.

174
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,756
You know, Eleanor is lucky
to have a friend like you.

175
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,925
Thank you.

176
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,636
[McEnroe] Devi was feeling
pretty proud of herself.

177
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,389
She had been a really good friend
to go behind Eleanor's back

178
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,975
and insert herself
into their family drama.

179
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,102
-Cheeto, Eleanor?
-Thank you, Devi.

180
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,396
[McEnroe] Not the last time
she's gonna be saying that.

181
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,275
And now it was time to come to the rescue
of her other best friend.

182
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,318
You okay, Fab?

183
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,446
I'm just really scared
to tell my family I'm gay.

184
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,115
Why? Aren't they liberal?
I know you mom drives a hybrid.

185
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,367
Yeah, but she's already disappointed
I'm not girlier.

186
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,077
I found a vision board she made
for my life.

187
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,747
It includes a Tuscan wedding
to Michael B. Jordan.

188
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,458
Okay, but, like,
who wouldn't want to get married

189
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,210
to Michael B. Jordan in Tuscany?

190
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,462
Me. I don't want to.

191
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,506
Right. Right, right, right.

192
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,965
You're gay. I get it.

193
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,469
I just think maybe you need
to give her a chance to prove you wrong.

194
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,847
I know, but right now,
she's organizing the PTA bake sale,

195
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,182
and she's already stressed out.

196
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,559
Fab, tell her whenever you're ready.

197
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,937
But I have a good feeling about your mom.

198
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,940
And my instincts for parent stuff
are usually pretty dead on.

199
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,943
Hello! Hi, girls.

200
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,985
Hello, Eleanor.

201
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,072
Mom, what are you doing here?

202
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,116
Devi said that I should come
and speak to you in person.

203
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:00,373
So you thought you would just show up
in the middle of the day at my school?

204
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,167
Yeah. I thought it could be like
a fun study break.

205
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,336
Look. I brought tacos.

206
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,796
[scoffs]

207
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,549
Eleanor, wait!

208
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,053
What did you do?

209
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,349
Eleanor, come on.
Please stop running away from me,

210
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,935
even though it's a very cinematic way 
to emote.

211
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,228
How long have you been in LA?

212
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,231
I've been here for two months.

213
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,900
Two months? Why didn't you call me?

214
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,068
Honey, I can explain.

215
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,072
I didn't call you
because I didn't want to see you.

216
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,323
I'm about to run again.

217
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,659
What I meant to say was
that I didn't want you to see me,

218
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,411
because I'm a failure.

219
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,624
I was fired from the cruise.

220
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,919
I was dumped in Jamaica
with nothing but my suitcase

221
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,213
and another woman whose husband
had fallen off the ship.

222
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,923
Oh, Mom.

223
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,925
When I got back here,

224
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,636
I just wanted to book something else
before I tried to see you again.

225
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,556
I didn't want you to see me
as an out-of-work actor mom.

226
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,851
I wanted you to see me
as a forensic scientist on Bosch.

227
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,061
I don't care what your job is.

228
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,688
I just want you in my life.

229
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,649
Dad and Sharon try,
but they don't really get me.

230
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,860
Sharon took me to see Spamalot.

231
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,653
Sweetie, no.

232
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,488
I've just really missed you.

233
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,532
I've missed you too,

234
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,742
but I'm here now.

235
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,621
And if you'll let me,
I want to be the mom that you deserve.

236
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,040
I'd like that too.

237
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,917
[sentimental music playing]

238
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,381
Starting right now.

239
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,842
Why don't we bake cookies for the PTA?

240
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,346
And I'm not talking about
director Paul Thomas Anderson.

241
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,849
His publicist doesn't accept baked goods.
I've tried.

242
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,310
Wow. I don't think
we've ever baked together.

243
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,395
I know. It'll be so special.

244
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,689
Oh, shoot. Where are we gonna do it?

245
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,608
I'm living with four 19-year-olds,

246
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,485
and I'm using the oven
as my closet right now.

247
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,445
You can make them at my house.

248
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,371
[Ms. Wong] Devi, thank you again
for letting us borrow your kitchen,

249
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,414
and for letting me use
your washing machine.

250
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,209
The one in my building
smells like an old person's mouth.

251
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,586
I'm just happy
to see you and Eleanor together again.

252
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,005
Did you hear?
She got a part in the school play.

253
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,548
Oh, my God. Really?

254
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,592
It's not a big deal.

255
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,261
Yes, it is! I'm so proud of you.

256
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,347
Another thespian in the family.

257
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,808
You know,
we're practically the Barrymores.

258
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,643
Ooh! Or the Fannings.

259
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,480
Yeah. I guess you'll have to stick around
and help Eleanor through rehearsals.

260
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,440
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

261
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,151
I thought about giving Broadway
another try,

262
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,569
but it's not what it used to be.

263
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,488
Okay, so catch me up.

264
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,490
What's the goss? Who are we dating?

265
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,617
Are we coupled up? Are we singies?

266
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,412
I have a boyfriend. His name is Oliver,
and he's on the tech crew.

267
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,579
Good girl.

268
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,957
Smart to date a techie
and not a fellow actor.

269
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,167
Less of an ego battle that way.

270
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,545
I know! He really lets me shine...

271
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,380
by aiming a spotlight on me.

272
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,215
So you know who's a cutie?

273
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,134
That boy that came
to the restaurant last week.

274
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,593
He had a sexy name.

275
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,512
Sexton, Six-Pack...

276
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,014
Paxton! Devi knows all about him.

277
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,558
[whispers] They used to be lovers.

278
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,475
[gasps]

279
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,604
Yup. Paxton and me, totally happened.

280
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,106
No, I love it.

281
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,315
Good for you, Devi.

282
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,944
You know, I've been known
to punch above my weight too.

283
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,487
Nathan Lane.

284
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,490
So, Fabiola, what about you?

285
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,326
There must be some pretty girl
you have your eye on at school.

286
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,371
-Eleanor, you told her?
-No, I swear.

287
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,998
No, she didn't say anything.

288
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,374
I have excellent gaydar.

289
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,126
I dated Nathan Lane for three years.

290
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,838
Okay, yeah. It's true,
but could you not tell anyone?

291
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,215
I've only come out to these guys
and my robot.

292
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,800
I haven't told my family yet.

293
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,926
Of course, sweetie.

294
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,720
You guys are my girls.

295
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,348
Whatever happens in this gab sesh...
stays in the gab sesh.

296
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,267
Mmm!

297
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,023
Almond butter fudge?
Are you trying to kill someone?

298
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,649
No tree nuts.

299
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,777
Get this out of my bake sale.

300
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:58,986
I'm on it.

301
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,239
Hello, everybody.

302
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,824
Cupcakes are here.

303
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,701
Elise!

304
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,786
Mwah!

305
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,037
Store-bought?

306
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,539
Everyone else's mom went hella homemade.

307
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,418
Oh, I'm sorry. I was too busy saving
my patients' lives from melanoma.

308
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,337
You think Mrs. Fields could do that?

309
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,756
[gasps] Mom, you made it!

310
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,469
[McEnroe] Looking on
at this gorgeous maternal scene,

311
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,346
Devi couldn't help but feel proud.

312
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,682
Unfortunately, not everyone was
as happy to see Joyce.

313
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,600
Hello, ladies.

314
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,101
Hello, Joyce.

315
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,103
We didn't know you were back in town.

316
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,480
[McEnroe] You see, ten years ago,

317
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,066
Joyce had offered to take the girls
to a carnival,

318
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,818
but she left them with the face painter

319
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,612
when she got a last-minute audition
for NCIS.

320
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,697
She thought she could land the role
and be back

321
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,574
by the time the painter was done.

322
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,409
She was wrong on both accounts.

323
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,332
So, Joyce, to what do we owe
your sudden return?

324
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,834
Well, as you know,

325
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,628
I've been traveling for years
doing musical theater,

326
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,631
but it finally occurred to me
that I have to be in LA,

327
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,676
because LA has the one thing
no other town has:

328
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,594
Hollywood.

329
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,972
I'm an actor.
I have to be where the jobs are.

330
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,183
And also, of course,
where your daughter is.

331
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,020
Of course. Well, that goes without saying.

332
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,647
I've missed Eleanor terribly...

333
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,357
and your girls too.

334
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,360
I was so excited that I got to hang out
with them yesterday.

335
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,195
You hung out with them yesterday?

336
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,281
Yeah. We had a fun gal hang.

337
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,533
We baked cookies, we gossiped.

338
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,953
I got to know 
all about their high-school love lives.

339
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,746
Love lives? No, no, no.

340
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,624
They're too young for love,
and frankly, to have a life.

341
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,502
I know. They've grown up so fast.

342
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,963
I can't believe they have boyfriends
and girlfriends already.

343
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,256
[Elise] Excuse me?

344
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,549
Who has a girlfriend?

345
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,551
Nope. Nobody has a girlfriend.

346
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,011
So who has a boyfriend?

347
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,596
[Joyce] Eh, eh, eh.

348
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,141
I promised I wouldn't say anything
that I was told at the gab sesh.

349
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,228
Does Devi have a boyfriend?

350
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,731
Which is interesting 
because Devi is forbidden from dating

351
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,608
until she's old enough to rent a car.

352
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,859
Who is it?

353
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,403
Is it Frank with the receding hairline?
I knew it.

354
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,947
The crossing guard? No.

355
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,198
Then tell me. Who is it?

356
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,951
Nalini, calm down.
She's not with Paxton anymore.

357
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:15,289
Paxton? Mr. Cheekbones from the hospital?
The one I caught in your bed?

358
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,499
You found him in her bed?

359
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,711
So you did know they were having sex?
I'm confused.

360
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,712
-No.
-What?

361
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,089
What? That Devi is having what?

362
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,383
No, I didn't. I didn't have sex.

363
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,301
I was lying.

364
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,387
Paxton was never my boyfriend,
and we never did anything.

365
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,765
Yeah, yeah, she never did anything.

366
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,808
She's as pure as the driven snow.

367
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,728
No, really. I never kissed him or anyone.

368
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,146
I lied to everyone, okay?

369
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,190
I'm a big virgin fraud.

370
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,239
Well, that was an emotional ride.

371
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,283
Where shall I set up my cookies?

372
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,287
Devi, we're leaving.

373
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,331
[dramatic music playing]

374
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,462
I do not completely understand
what happened today,

375
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,673
so I'm just gonna blame Joyce for it.

376
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,049
But just to be clear,

377
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:12,054
you are not to have any sexual contact
with boys,

378
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,305
even in the lies you tell.

379
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,016
I promise you don't have anything
to worry about.

380
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,476
I better not.

381
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,107
[McEnroe] The day was an epic fail.

382
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,274
Thanks to Devi,

383
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,070
Eleanor's crazy mom almost blabbed
that Fabiola was gay,

384
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,280
and her friends knew she was a liar.

385
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,617
The first "F" she'd ever gotten
was on this test of friendship.

386
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,247
Wow, Mom. You almost sold everything.

387
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,458
Not too shabby for an event
that kind of got off to a rocky start.

388
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,545
Yeah. I just feel bad for Eleanor.

389
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,880
He mother is such a flake. [laughs]

390
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,466
We should feel really lucky
that we're just a normal family.

391
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,011
What do you mean by normal?

392
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,847
Well, just that we're like...
mmm, regular.

393
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,975
We're not causing scenes everywhere.
We aren't embarrassing.

394
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,187
I don't know. Some things about me
may be embarrassing to you.

395
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,107
No, I'm not embarrassed by your robots
or by your weird clothes.

396
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,068
Okay. Does seem like
you had those locked and loaded.

397
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,987
No, no, no,
I love those things about you.

398
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,488
I love everything about you.

399
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,700
You promise?

400
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,201
Of course.

401
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,661
Where's this coming from?

402
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,167
I'm gay.

403
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,630
Oh, God. You're not saying anything.

404
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,174
You're disappointed.

405
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,134
-I knew you would be--
-Fabiola...

406
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,635
Now you're making that face you make

407
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,763
when the waiter says they're out
of the entree you ordered.

408
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,014
No. Fabiola, calm down.

409
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,058
[stammers] I am not disappointed.

410
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,562
You just hit me with something really big,
and I'm trying to process.

411
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,980
Please, sit.

412
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,322
Uh...

413
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,825
I don't know what to say.

414
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,455
Have you been trying to tell me this
for a while?

415
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,876
Kinda, but I didn't know how.

416
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,377
Oh.

417
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,298
That must've been really hard.

418
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,343
Oh, honey, I love you,

419
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,305
and there is nothing
that you could ever tell me

420
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,723
that would change that.

421
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,934
I just want you to be happy.

422
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,644
Really?

423
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,354
You're okay with that?

424
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,898
Come here.

425
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,700
Wait. Is that why you called
that weird family meeting about AP Latin?

426
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,537
-Yeah.
-So you can switch back to French?

427
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,330
Oh, thank God!

428
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,290
Our Marseilles trip is still on.

429
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,292
[knock at door]

430
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,461
Hey, is the bake sale over?

431
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,171
Yes, I'm sorry, it is.

432
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,591
Cool. I heard you could get the things
that didn't sell for free.

433
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,593
Who said that, Eric?

434
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,179
I don't know. Can I have them?

435
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,473
Fine.

436
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,310
[school bell ringing]

437
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,311
[Devi] Hey, guys.

438
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,232
So what was that yesterday?

439
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,526
You didn't make love
to Paxton Hall-Yoshida?

440
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,569
You lied to us?

441
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,904
Technically, I didn't lie.

442
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,032
You assumed I had sex with Paxton,
and I didn't correct you.

443
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,033
That's lying.

444
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,536
Yes, Jonah. I see that now.

445
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,997
Why didn't you tell us the truth?

446
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,375
Well, to be fair, it did seem like
it was gonna happen eventually.

447
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,461
So I guess I was just really telling you
a future truth.

448
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,964
Hey, you're being
really sketchy right now.

449
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,424
I know I am.

450
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,217
Ugh. I'm sorry.

451
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,845
I get it if you want to replace me
with Jonah.

452
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,805
What?

453
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,473
I've been a really shitty friend,

454
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,226
so I understand
if you prefer Jonah's company over mine.

455
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,314
Devi, we don't want to replace you
with Jonah.

456
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,234
Yeah. Also, Fab and I are allowed
to have more than one other friend.

457
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,612
And I honestly can't commit full time
to this group

458
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,363
because I have
a very demanding social life.

459
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,743
But because of me,
Ms. Wong almost outed you to your mom.

460
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,287
I ended up coming out to her anyway.

461
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,789
And it actually went okay.

462
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,625
Really? That's awesome.

463
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,921
You guys, I'm really sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.

464
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,007
I guess the lie sounded better
than my real life.

465
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,592
They always do.

466
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,762
That's why on my acting resume I say
I know how to ride a motorcycle.

467
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,430
Makes me sound more mysterious.

468
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:27,017
But what happens if you get a part
where you have to ride a motorcycle?

469
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,396
Listen, I just want you both to know
that I've really learned my lesson

470
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,523
and I promise to be a better friend
from now on.

471
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,819
So no more weird lies about your sex life.

472
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,072
Yeah, definitely.

473
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,823
No more of those.

474
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,243
[sentimental music playing]

475
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,998
I thought we all agreed
we are gonna be off-book today,

476
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,209
but if you need your scripts,
you need your scripts.

477
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,710
I can't learn your lines for you.

478
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,965
Mr. Schleicher, allow me
to introduce professional working actress

479
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,425
and Equity member, Joyce Wong,

480
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,719
also known as my mother.

481
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,554
Nice to meet you.

482
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,014
Pleasure is all mine.

483
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,600
Would it be okay if she sat
in our rehearsal today?

484
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,395
She's the reason I started acting
in the first place.

485
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,439
Of course. I love an unannounced parent...

486
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,900
especially one with acting credentials.

487
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,404
You must be so proud of your daughter,
our youngest lead actor ever.

488
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,030
The lead?

489
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,659
-Oh, my goodness! How wonderful!
-[Mr. Schleicher] Yeah.

490
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,160
Okay. Why don't we get started?

491
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,163
Everyone get up on stage. Let's pick up
where we left off in scene seven.

492
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,876
[Mr. Schleicher] Okay, Tom,
take it from your line.

493
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,503
[Tom] I'm going to the movies.

494
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:41,258
[in Southern accent]
That's right. Go to the movies. Go.

495
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,927
Don't think about us:

496
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,346
a mother deserted,

497
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,100
an unmarried sister who's crippled
and has no job.

498
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:56,315
Don't let anything interfere
with your selfish pleasure.

499
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,861
[Mr. Schleicher] Amazing, Eleanor.
Better than Katharine Hepburn.

500
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,116
[phone chimes]

501
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,746
[McEnroe] What the hell was this?

502
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,874
Paxton was texting her...
to go to his house?

503
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,126
[Fabiola] Devi, help. We got a situation.

504
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,962
Eleanor's mom is gone. She left this note.

505
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,924
"My Darling Eleanor..."

506
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,260
[Joyce] I wanted more than anything

507
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,721
to be able to stay here with you
in California.

508
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,724
But I know that to live my life
without regrets,

509
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,101
I need to give Broadway one more shot.

510
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,312
Please forgive me.

511
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,606
Love, Mom.

512
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,609
Oh, my God.

513
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,362
Eleanor's freaking out. She quit the play.

514
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,948
-What?
-She said she's giving up acting forever.

515
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,159
And now she's in the drama room
having a meltdown.

516
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,118
We have to help her.

517
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,247
I'm gonna grab her lavender oils,
and I'll meet you in the drama room.

518
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,167
Maybe you can play Laura Linney reading
