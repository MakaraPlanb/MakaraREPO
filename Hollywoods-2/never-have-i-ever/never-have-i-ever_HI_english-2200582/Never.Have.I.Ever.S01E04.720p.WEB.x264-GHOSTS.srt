00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,973
[McEnroe] It had been a week
since Devi's violent encounter

2
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:15,890
with the coyote,

3
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,602
but Paxton's words from the hospital
were still echoing in her mind.

4
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,354
That's why it's cool we're friends.

5
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,939
Of course he had friendzoned her.

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,150
She thought a wild animal was her dad.

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,570
As much as Devi wanted to be a chill girl 
that you could have sex with,

8
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,989
she knew the truth:
she was a weird loser,

9
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,407
and a member of the UN, 

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,576
and today was certainly
not gonna change that.

11
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,493
[sighs]

12
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,871

14
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,238
[song stops]

15
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,201
Are you Princess Jasmine?

16
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,287
No, but thank you. She is very beautiful.

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,497
Ariel's prettier.

18
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:21,873
Where's Aladdin?

19
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,041
I don't have an Aladdin,

20
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,959
because he just wants to be friends.

21
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,586
Okay...

22
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,881
Hi. Can I have two black coffees
and one large hot chocolate?

23
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,424
But can you write latte on the cup?

24
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,967
I want people to take me seriously.

25
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,305
Oh, can my daughter take a photo with you?
You look so amazing.

26
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,473
No, thanks.

27
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,558
She'd really love to put it
on her Instagram.

28
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,143
[chuckles] It's so cultural.

29
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,771
I don't really feel at home right now
in my choice of clothing.

30
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,148
I mean, usually I don't,
but especially today.

31
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,776
She's just a little girl.

32
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,778
Okay, sir, you don't have
to say it like that.

33
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,196
I just don't want to take a photo.

34
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,740
Also, why do we have to commemorate
everything on social media?

35
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,659
Hmm? Why can't we just live in the moment?

36
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,744
You were on Twitter
the entire time you were in line.

37
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,665
You tweeted a "thank you" to a Target ad
telling you to have a happy Labor Day.

38
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,167
-[sighs] Fine. Let's just take the photo.
-Go.

39
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,085
[sighs]

40
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,379
-[camera clicks]
-Okay.

41
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,756
You want any doughnuts with that?

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,884
Yeah, Ira, I do, but I'm fasting today.

43
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,802
Oh.

44
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,053
Is it Ramadan?

45
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,222
[McEnroe] No, it's not, Ira.

46
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,391
Today is Ganesh Puja.

47
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,269
♪ Check out the ammo
Protect the arsenal ♪

48
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,358
[McEnroe] Looks like an ad
for India, right?

49
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,236
Or at least the middle
of an Indiana Jones movie, but it's not.

50
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,280
This is Ganesh Puja, baby.

51
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,741
Ganesh Puja is a Hindu holiday
celebrating Lord Ganesh,

52
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,286
and a time to share warm moments
with family.

53
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,496
Speaking of warm moments with family, 

54
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,415
let's check in with the Vishwakumars.

55
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,500
Mom, this sari is so uncomfortable.

56
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,294
Why does it itch so much?

57
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,130
Itchiness of saris
is a rite of passage for Indian women.

58
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,047
Deal with it.

59
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,717
Why can't I just wear kurta and jeans
like I normally do?

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,970
Then I don't have to get half naked
every time I need to go to the bathroom.

61
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,930
Devi, you're of age now.

62
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,682
Half sari is more appropriate.

63
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,809
Ew, Mom. Don't say "of age."

64
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,936
It makes me sound like a girl
in a douche commercial.

65
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,230
-What is douche?
-OK, everyone stop talking about douche.

66
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,357
Lord Ganesh doesn't need
to see my daughter

67
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,735
in ripped jeans
and a "Fries Before Guys" t-shirt.

68
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,570
[McEnroe] Nalini was a little on edge.

69
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,488
This was the first puja they had gone to

70
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,575
since Mohan's untimely death
and Devi's paralysis.

71
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,870
Last week, Mrs. Iyengar asked
if we were going to show up at puja,

72
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,956
or whether we, quote,
"had too much going on."

73
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,042
I could just hear the pity in her voice.

74
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,670
Too much going on, for Ganesh Puja?
That bitch.

75
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,172
-Whoa.
-Auntie, you must calm down.

76
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,050
Why does the Hindu Association
have to have puja at my high school?

77
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,176
It's so low-rent.

78
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,678
Ben Gross's bar mitzvah
was at the Dolby Theatre.

79
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,263
They have the Oscars there.

80
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,015
Jewish people know how to save.

81
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,725
Us, Indians, we get a little bit of money,

82
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,061
we go straight to Home Depot
to buy a cement fountain.

83
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,063
We're just obsessed with fountains.

84
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,481
Oh, I love a fountain.

85
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,483
[sighs] Anyway, Devi,

86
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,236
you know Sanchiti Bhattacharyya
will be at puja, right?

87
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,571
You remember
her useless white husband Ron?

88
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,157
Turns out,
he's not that useless after all.

89
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,495
He runs the most exclusive
college counseling company in LA.

90
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,289
Ninety percent of their kids 
get into Ivy Leagues.

91
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,582
And they are so elite,

92
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,293
they don't even
count Cornell and Penn as Ivies.

93
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,088
-He's so successful, he has his own Tesla.
-[car beeps]

94
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,631
I Zillow-ed his house.

95
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,508
Do you want to know
what the Zestimate was?

96
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,593
One point eight million dollars!

97
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,055
-Whoa. He loaded.
-Yes, he is.

98
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,224
Now, Ron doesn't take many kids, so...

99
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,269
if you want to go to Princeton,
you know what you need to do.

Winning over old-ass teacher types
is my super power.

102
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,608

104
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,704
Oh, god. Aunties approaching.

105
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,205
Don't look.

106
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,665
Where? Where should I not look?

107
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,250
[Devi] Damn it, Kamala.

108
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,296
[McEnroe] Aunties are older Indian women
who have no blood relationship to you,

109
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,590
but are allowed to have opinions
about your life and all your shortcomings.

110
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,676
You have to be nice to them
because you're Indian.

111
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,178
It's so good to see you, and Devi,

112
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,097
what a relief to see
you're no longer a cripple.

113
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,390
[woman] What a miracle.

114
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,891
I prayed for her every day.

115
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
I said, "No matter why you have chosen
to curse them,

116
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,439
please cure her as a reward
for my virtue."

117
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,899
[sarcastically] Thank you.
I'm sure your prayers did it.

118
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,819
Yes. Thank you for thinking of us.
How is Arjun?

119
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,322
You know Arjun.
He just installed a home theater.

120
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,700
Two rows of seats.
Dolby 5.1 surround sound.

121
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,368
Popcorn machine coming soon.

122
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,455
Sunu, they don't care 
about your stupid home theater

123
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,248
with all they've been through.

124
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,959
I know exactly how you feel.

125
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,420
My husband, Pradeep,
had testicular cancer.

126
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,088
I'm so sorry for your loss.

127
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,340
Oh, no. He's fine.

128
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,258
It was stage one. They caught it early,

129
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,552
removed his testicle,
and now he's running the 10K.

130
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,847
[sarcastically] You're right.
Our situations are so similar.

131
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,392
Uh, you know my niece, Kamala, right?

132
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,978
Getting her doctorate at Caltech,
soon to be engaged...

133
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,605
to an engineer.

134
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,398
The boy's parents have two Mercedes.

135
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,192
-Two Mercedes?
-Lucky.

136
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,779
[McEnroe] As the aunties praised her,
Kamala had a sinking feeling.

137
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,197
She didn't want to get married,

138
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,740
but she put on a happy face

139
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,367
like I did at the trophy ceremony

140
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,162
when I lost the French Open
to Ivan Lendl in 1984.

141
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,622
I'm gonna go find Ron.

142
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,957
[sarcastically] Okay. I'll just stay here
and kill myself.

143
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,838
["Nagada Sang Dhol Baje" playing]

144
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,560
[McEnroe] Even though Devi was Indian,

145
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,022
she didn't think of herself
as Indian Indian like these girls,

146
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,690
which is a whole other thing.

147
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,110
So sometimes she felt
a little out of place.

148
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,277
They seem cool here,

149
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,739
but can you imagine how dorky
they would look doing this anywhere else?

150
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,825
That's my sister, Preethi.

151
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,244
Her Bollywood dance group
was in the Macy's Day Parade

152
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,496
on a float sponsored by Ziploc.

153
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,206
So who looks dorky now?

154
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:59,168
[McEnroe] Damn, Devi. Preethi's sister
really schooled you. Read the room.

155
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,421
[song continues]

156
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,472
-[Devi] Harish.
-Devi, hey.

157
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,016
I was hoping I'd see someone cool here.

158
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,769
Do you know if anyone like that is coming?

159
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,146
[scoffs] Ouch, burn.

160
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,647
So why are you at this lame-fest?

161
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,608
Shouldn't you be at Stanford, like,
playing frisbee with a computer?

162
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,985
I actually really wanted to come.

163
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,570
To Ganesh Puja?

164
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,531
At a public high school in the Valley?
Are you insane?

165
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,033
Tell me the truth.
Did they send you home on medical leave?

166
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,035
Are you suicidal from Accutane?

167
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,162
[laughs] No.

168
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,330
Look, I know
I used to clown on this every year,

169
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,416
but the truth is, I kinda miss puja.

170
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,750
Are you kidding?

171
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,253
When I get into Princeton,
I'm never coming back.

172
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,755
I'm gonna be an atheist,
who eats cheeseburgers every day

173
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,132
with my white boyfriend.

174
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,633
I thought I'd be that way too,

175
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,594
but it was different
when I went to college.

176
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,721
My roommate, Nick, is Native American,

177
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,723
and he's so into being Native American.

178
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,892
At first, I was like,
"You're away from your parents.

179
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,728
You don't have to pretend
to care about your ancestry or whatever."

180
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,355
But then he took me
to their campus powwow.

181
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,858
No one was standing in the corner
making fun of it.

182
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,360
They were dancing and chanting,

183
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,738
and having a great time,
and it made me think,

184
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,741
"Why do I think it's so weird
and embarrassing to be Indian?"

185
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,159
[sarcastically] Where do I start?

186
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,995
How about every single thing
my mom has ever said and done?

187
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,831
I just thought, "Am I gonna be
this insecure Indian guy,

188
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,333
who hates doing Indian things?"

189
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,710
'Cause that's its own identity.
It's just a shitty one.

190
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,463
Well, that's definitely not my identity.

191
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,006
I love being Indian. [scoffs]

192
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,925
[McEnroe] Real convincing, Devi.

193
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,052
I look more comfortable being Indian.

194
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,977
You need to spread Mohan's ashes.

195
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,230
I spread my mother's in the fountain
at the Bellagio.

196
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,648
She was a gambling addict.

197
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,650
That's very touching, um...

198
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,276
I just haven't had the time.

199
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,112
You know he cannot get into heaven
until you accept his death?

200
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,364
Oh.

201
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,449
I meant to ask you. Later today,

202
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,619
you think you can look at a few skin tags?
They're under my left breast.

203
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,747
I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah.

204
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,833
["Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna" playing]

205
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,169
I'll find you later.

206
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,007
[song continues]

207
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,138
[McEnroe] This is Pandit Rajakrishnan,

208
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,307
but everyone calls him Pandit Raj.

209
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,687
He's the community spiritual leader
and also really knows how to work a room.

210
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,690
Now, everybody repeat after me.

211
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:31,070
[chants in Sanskrit]

212
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,574
Just kidding.
[chuckles] We'll do something easier.

213
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,785
[McEnroe] I like Pandit Raj.
He's got a good energy.

214
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,911
[Pandit] Come forward.

215
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,705
Have you spoken to Ron yet?

216
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,665
I've spent all morning kissing up
to Sanchiti.

217
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,750
I even told her
I would Botox her armpits for free.

218
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,294
Not yet. I can't find him.

219
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,087
You can't find
the one middle-aged white man

220
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,006
in a group of 500 Indian people?

221
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,133
Come forward.
We are ready for the next group.

222
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,218
-Give it to Pandit Raj.
-[Pandit] Nalini.

223
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,344
Thank you.

224
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,597
Pray you get into Princeton.

225
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,932
Don't waste your prayers
on stupid things like world peace.

226
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,144
[McEnroe] Praying had always been hard
for Devi.

227
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,187
It was so easy to get distracted.

228
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,232
First, she would start praying
for the health of her mom and cousin,

229
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,693
but then would veer off, 
thinking about homework,

230
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,988
or how in this kneeling position,
she could smell her deodorant.

231
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,866
So she really had to focus
on what she wanted:

232
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,702
an acceptance letter
from the college of her dreams...

233
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,079
[squeals and cheers]

234
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,789
[Nalini] Princeton!

235
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,252
...a sudden maturing
in certain areas of her body...

236
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,049
Hey.

237
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,676
...unexpected overtures
from certain people at school...

238
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,802
I think I love you.

239
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,974
...and hearing her mother say
the thing she most longed for.

240
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,434
I'm so proud of you.

241
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,729
And you can get your septum pierced.

242
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,731
But this year was different.

243
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,566
She didn't want her usual things.

244
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,443
[laughs] Don't miss.

245
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,362
[Mohan] Ah!

246
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,572
[laughs] In your face.

247
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,407
She wanted something else.

248
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,371
[chanting]

249
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,665
Have tika.

250
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,377
[McEnroe] Meanwhile, Kamala knew 
what exactly she was praying for.

251
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,714
For her fiance, Prashant, to fall in love
with someone in his doctorate program

252
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,508
at the University of Chicago,

253
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,510
and for their engagement to be over.

254
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,846
You do not wish to be married?

255
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,101
[McEnroe] Damn, Pandit Raj.
That's spooky as hell. You're good.

256
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,815
Your hair is so black.

257
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,360
When my sister's husband died,
she stopped coloring her hair.

258
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,279
Well, I didn't want
to let myself go completely.

259
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,948
Mohan wouldn't have wanted that.

260
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,158
You just don't want to give people
the wrong idea.

261
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,954
What idea? That I love my husband less
because my roots aren't showing?

262
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,706
Let's go inside.

263
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,040
I heard Roopa got fat.

264
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,343
[McEnroe] Bingo! White guy.
College counselor Ron.

265
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,220
Go get him, Devi.

266
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,975
Hey, are you Ron Hansen-Bhattacharyya?

267
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,226
Yes.

268
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,895
It's so nice to meet you.
My name is Devi Vishwakumar.

269
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,814
I'm a student
at this high school, actually.

270
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,815
Oh, cool.

271
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,359
Sherman Oaks High
is a good Ivy feeder school.

272
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,070
Although the college counselor Susan
is a joke.

273
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,030
Yeah. She's also the lunch lady.

274
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,616
-So, she's got a lot on her plate.
-Hmm.

275
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,370
I just wanted to say how interested
I would be in procuring your services.

276
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,913
Your stats are amazing.

277
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,915
Well, I don't know. I mean, I...

278
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,587
only got 28 kids into Ivies last year,
but I wanted 30.

279
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,297
The other two went to MIT,

280
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,090
but you can't win 'em all.

281
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,594
Well, I guess I can't relate
because I do win 'em all.

282
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,764
I'm in all AP classes
and got a perfect score on my PSAT.

283
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,099
[McEnroe] Great segue, Devi. Effortless.

284
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,435
All while volunteering
at the kidney dialysis center.

285
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,561
When I'm not doing that,

286
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,480
I read Vietnam vets
their Bill O'Reilly books.

287
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,401
Okay, look... I can say this
because I married an Indian woman

288
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,570
and am a proud member
of this vibrant community.

289
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,907
But schools don't want
another Indian try-hard,

290
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,159
who is president
of the padded resume club.

291
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,076
What? [scoffs]

292
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,120
Renal failure is what keeps me up 
at night.

293
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,456
Colleges want kids with unusual stories.

294
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,832
I had this kid.

295
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,627
He got into a car crash.
He was dead a full 30 seconds.

296
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,922
He said god told him to go to Yale.
It worked.

297
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,550
Uh, I outgrew a nut allergy,
so that's something.

298
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,638
-I actually know who you are.
-You do?

299
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,265
You're the girl whose dad died 
in front of her at a concert

300
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,725
and became paralyzed.

301
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,394
[McEnroe] Devi couldn't believe
that the major trauma of her life

302
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,648
could be reduced to a single sentence,
but there it was.

303
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,399
Yeah. What about it?

304
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,654
That story is freaking amazing.

305
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,782
You have the golden ticket.
If you're willing to talk about it,

306
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,659
I bet I can get you
into any school you want.

307
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,620
But Devi didn't want to use the story
of her father's death

308
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,541
as a way to make herself more interesting
to a bunch of admission committees.

309
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,209
No, I'm not gonna do that.

310
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,837
Well, without it, I don't get your angle.

311
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,589
To be honest,
I don't see how you would be different

312
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,466
than any other Indian kid
applying to college.

313
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,718
I'm not like any other Indian kid,

314
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,929
and I'm not interesting
just because my dad died.

315
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,514
Then what makes you interesting?

316
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,932
Oh, I don't know, Ron.

317
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,476
Maybe it's my perfect grades
or my killer test scores.

318
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,937
Or maybe it's my bitchin' personality

319
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,772
or my insane PowerPoint skills.

320
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,942
I don't need some washed-up white dude,
who leases a Tesla

321
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,111
telling me what makes me special.

322
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,947
Leasing is still a financial commitment!

323
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,491
And my monthly payment is quite high!

324
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,369
[Kamala] Oh, look, an open table.

325
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,537
No, no. Come, come.

326
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,333
Hey, kids, move.

327
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,543
Just take your slime and go.

328
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,961
Come on. People are still eating.

329
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,174
Why could we not sit there?

330
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,634
That's Jaya Kuyavar.

331
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,888
She came from Chennai,
went to UCLA for her doctorate,

332
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,973
parents found her a nice boy
back home to marry.

333
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,808
Then she ran off with an American man.

334
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,226
-A Muslim.
-[Kamala gasps]

335
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,395
Parents never spoke to her again.

336
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,646
Did they come for the wedding?

337
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,024
Are you out of your mind?
You heard me say he was a Muslim.

338
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,400
I feel bad for her.

339
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,527
-We should sit with her.
-Mm-mm.

340
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,945
Can't risk it right now.

341
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,780
We're already borderline outcasts.

342
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,116
Devi, what did you do?

343
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,244
I heard from half a dozen aunties
that you yelled at college counselor Ron,

344
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,704
and made fum of his electric car!

345
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,747
He deserved it.

346
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,333
He said I'm just like any other Indian kid
applying to college.

347
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,959
It was so offensive!

348
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,502
So disappointed in you.

349
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,047
[sighs]

350
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,634
-I'm gonna eat somewhere else.
-Please go.

351
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,601
Is this yours?

352
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,853
-Oh, thank you so much!
-Yeah.

353
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,229
You left it on the table.

354
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,357
The table you were sitting at
after you and your aunt

355
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,858
made a beeline to get away from me.

356
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,818
No, we weren't trying to avoid you.

357
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,280
You seemed so popular, we didn't want
to take up seats for your friends.

358
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,782
Oh.

359
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,618
Sure.

360
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,455
Hey, um... I need a break
from these aunties.

361
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,875
You want to go check out
the vending machines? My treat?

362
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,126
Okay.

363
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,633
Yeah, so basically, I'm the Hester Prynne
of the Indian community

364
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,968
in the San Fernando Valley.

365
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,303
I wish I had
a less ninth-grade-book analogy for it,

366
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,472
but it's accurate.

367
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,808
So you're ultimately very happy
with your decision

368
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,351
even though you got divorced?

369
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,560
Of course not.

370
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,520
[sighs] No.

371
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,521
I mean look at me.

372
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,732
My closest Indian friend
is a woman I met seven minutes ago.

373
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,069
No. I wish I had just listened
to my family

374
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,612
and married the guy that they chose.

375
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,781
Then maybe I wouldn't be divorced.

376
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,950
You know, my kids ask
about their grandparents,

377
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,577
and...
[sighs] I don't know what to tell them.

378
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,912
Maybe they'll get over it.

379
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,665
Do you have a sibling,
who could have a drug problem

380
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,750
or go to community college?
That would help.

381
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,628
No, I got two brothers,
both neurosurgeons,

382
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,132
had a double-arranged wedding
with millionaire Hindu sisters.

383
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,049
Oh. [laughs]

384
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,802
As my cousin would say,
"That sucks a fat one."

385
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,262
[chuckes] Yeah, I agree.

386
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,725
[sighs] Anyway, I think I'm going
to head out.

387
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,019
You know, these things
aren't really that fun

388
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,687
when everyone is whispering about you.

389
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,773
But hey, good luck on your engagement...

390
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,152
and don't screw it up, yeah?

391
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,528
[chuckles]

392
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:21,999
Devi?

393
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,586
Paxton! What are you doing here?

394
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,172
Swim practice.
What are you doing here?

395
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,632
Just... Ganesh Puja.

396
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,925
It's a weird Indian thing.

397
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:32,843
Oh.

398
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,011
What do you do for it?

399
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:38,057
We eat and pray to Ganesh.

400
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,601
[sighs] He's the elephant god.

401
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,478
He's sort of a big deal to Indians.

402
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,979
I mean Hindus.

403
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,608
'Cause, you know, there are 
Muslim Indians, Sikh Indians, Jains, and--

404
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,276
-Honestly--
-You don't have to give me

405
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,070
the Wikipedia page on India.

406
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,196
Sorry.

407
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,699
So is part of Ganesh Puja
kicking lockers in anger?

408
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,202
No, that was unrelated.
That didn't have...

409
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081
[chuckles] You were joking.

410
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,126
No, I just got mad,
which is something I'm working on.

411
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,504
You do have kind of a temper, huh?

412
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,838
It's not my fault.

413
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,508
Some old loser was telling me
that I'm too Indian,

414
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,760
and some other people think
I'm not Indian enough.

415
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,970
And honestly,
all I want to do is eat a doughnut,

416
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,347
but I'm stuck here.

417
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,724
Eh. Who cares what other people think?

418
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,976
You do you, Vishwakumar.

419
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,648
Also, you look cool in that outfit.

420
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,858
[McEnroe] Did he just say
she looked good?

421
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,861
Holy shit. Maybe she wasn't 
as friendzoned as she thought.

422
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,702
Okay. I've had my fill of socializing.

423
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,412
-Are you ready to head home?
-Yeah.

424
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,665
-You see Devi anywhere?
-I do not.

425
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,166
Perhaps she's gotten her arms stuck

426
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,960
in the vending machine
trying to steal chips.

427
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,044
It's happened before.

428
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,212
I'll go check.

429
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,922
-Nalini.
-Yes?

430
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:52,923
Are you leaving?

431
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,384
Ah, yes. I think it's that time.

432
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,469
It was so great
to see you out of the house

433
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,471
-and Devi back on her feet.
-Thank you.

434
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,515
Let me know if she stops walking again,

435
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,350
because I have a cousin in medical sales

436
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,561
who can get you
a very nice wheelchair for cheap.

437
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,478
Hello, ladies.

438
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,647
-Namaste, Pandit Raj.
-Hello, Pandit-ji

439
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,858
Would one of you
be able to give me a ride?

440
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,985
[McEnroe] The day had been a long one
for Nalini,

441
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,113
and she needed a win,
even if it was a small one.

442
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,281
I can.

443
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,285
Oh, wonderful. Could you take me
to The Home Depot?

444
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,661
It would be my pleasure.

445
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,956
Great. There's a beautiful fountain
I've had my eye on.

446
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,792
[Pandit] This is very kind of you.

447
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,502
I could've taken an Uber.

448
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,045
Our Pandit in an Uber?

449
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,256
What's next?
Prime Minister Modi on Postmates?

450
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,883
Over my dead body.

451
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,010
I really enjoyed puja today.

452
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,344
I like the incense you used.

453
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,971
It was like we were in a cannabis store.

454
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,724
Thank you. You can buy it on my website...

00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:51,565
Anyhow, I hope you all found some clarity
in your prayers today.

457
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,816
For sure. One hundred percent.

458
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,901
Very much so, Pandit-ji.

459
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,579
[Pandit] Wonderful.

460
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,415
Thanks for the ride.

461
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,542
I found the car very comfortable.

462
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,211
Our pleasure, Pandit-ji.

463
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,462
Though there is pain,

464
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,924
the pain will subside
because you are a good family.

465
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,801
And god will always see that.

[recites blessing in Sanskrit]

467
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,017
Where do you want to go to college?

468
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,937
-[sighs] Princeton.
-I will bring it up to god personally.
