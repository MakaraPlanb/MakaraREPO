00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,637
[McEnroe] To the untrained eye,

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,224
it seemed like Devi had just bailed
on her best friends to help a boy...

4
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,851
-[phone dings]
-...who, five minutes ago,

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,602
wanted nothing to do with her.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,563
[Fabiola]
Are you coming to the drama room?

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,649
[Devi] Just had to do one quick thing.
It's super important.

8
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,401
I'll be there in, like, ten minutes.

9
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,361
[McEnroe] But as you can see,
she had a plan.

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,655
She could help out Paxton and Eleanor.

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,741
And doesn't that make her
an even better friend,

12
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,367
nay, a better person?

13
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,619
Hi, Paxton. You said you needed me.

14
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,580
It's not me who needs you. It's my sister.

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,166
-What?
-She's applying to fashion school,

16
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,792
and was gonna shoot her portfolio today,

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,461
but none of her coworkers showed up
to help.

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,213
Wait. Your text made it seem like
this was an emergency.

19
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,840
I mean, it's a fashion emergency.

20
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,341
A fashion emergency?

21
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,260
[scoffs]
I just ditched my friends for this.

22
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,471
Come on. Look, she's really upset.

23
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,098
All right? 
The photographer's already here, paid for.

24
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,976
-And since you've met Rebecca--
-Paxton, I can't.

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,187
Please. Look, it won't take that long.

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,897
You just have to model
a few outfits.

27
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,440
Wait. Model?

28
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,400
You want me to model?

29
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,652
Devi. Thank you.

30
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,279
You're a lifesaver.

[upbeat music]

32
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,952
Okay, but we have to do this fast.

33
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,290
What is that?

34
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,086
Tyra says the broken-down baby doll
is the most editorial look.

35
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,630
Can you just, like, stand normal?

36
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,590
Like catalog? Sure.

37
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,634
You're doing great, Devi.

38
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,928
[photographer]
Don't need the hands in the face.

39
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,721
Or in the hair.

40
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,349
Okay, just stand flat to camera

41
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,184
with your arms at your side
like a paper doll.

42
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,895
Kinda thought this would be
more of a collab, but okay.

43
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,605
You look good.

44
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,107
'Cause these clothes are sick.

45
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,776
When you become a famous designer,
could I be your muse,

46
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,444
like Bella Hadid is for Dior?

47
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,571
I'll probably just get a real model.

48
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,323
Fair enough.

49
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,869
I don't know, Becca.
She's kinda pulling it off.

50
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,249
Too many teeth.
I can see all of your teeth.

51
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,458
Please close your mouth.

52
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,387
That's it. It's over.
I'm giving up acting.

53
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,223
Say goodbye to my little friend!

54
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,019
Hope you enjoyed that
because that was my final impression.

55
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,438
[imitating Porky Pig] 
That's all folks!

56
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,817
Okay, that was my last impression.

57
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,944
Eleanor, come on,
that's a little dramatic.

58
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,696
You're right.

59
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,199
I shouldn't be so dramatic.

60
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,118
Because from this point on,

61
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,120
drama is no longer part of my life.

62
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,707
Hello. My name is Eleanor.

63
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,668
My favorite color is beige,
and my dream is to be an accountant.

64
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,253
Oh, God. Where's Devi?

65
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,963
She was supposed to be here 
an hour ago.

66
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,552
What the hell?

67
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,512
Thanks for helping out today.

68
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,471
It was awesome.

69
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,639
Did I do okay?

70
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,308
Rebecca seemed really happy.

71
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,396
I don't want to make this weird,

72
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,524
but, like, thanks for not telling people
I lied about us.

73
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,485
Well, I don't fake kiss and tell.

74
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,239
Does this mean we can be friends again?

75
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,201
Yeah. We're good.

76
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,244
[McEnroe] Devi felt relieved.

77
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,663
She had dug herself out of a hole
with Paxton,

78
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,249
and while there might be no chance
of romance anymore,

79
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,751
at least she had a friend,

80
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,086
because after all, 
isn't friendship the most important--

81
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,630
[Fabiola] You're at Paxton's house?

82
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,173
Oh, God. Fab and Eleanor.

83
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,174
I gotta go.

84
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,175
See you at school.

85
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,676
[Rebecca] Stop.

86
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,429
You don't get to keep the clothes.

87
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:45,183
Well, I think Gisele usually gets
an outfit for her troubles, so...

88
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,311
Okay.

89
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,068

00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,444
Do you like your cake?

91
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,660
Yeah, I love it. It's, uh... It's me.
[chuckles]

92
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,995
I didn't know who you were
a fan of these days,

93
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,916
so I decided to have it made 
after my favorite star.

94
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,833
[laughs]

95
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,253
Oh, I want a photo of you
next to your cake head.

96
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,337
Oh, okay.

97
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,883
[Ben's mom] Oh, honey, don't lean back.
That's not attractive.

98
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,885
-There you go. Yes!

Listen, sweetie, I'm so, so sorry.

101
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,392
We have to go away on your birthday.

102
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,895
The moved up the launch
of 2 Chainz's new line of spiced rum,

103
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,605
and he says he needs me there.

104
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,400
Yeah, but we could cancel
if you want us to.

105
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,279
Because I would be more than happy
to not go to the Caribbean today...

106
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,322
and just stay here with my baby boy.

107
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,783
Bubelah, you say the word,

108
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,452
I'll get 2 on the phone
and tell him I'm not coming.

109
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,874
No, you should go.
Sixteen's not like a big birthday.

110
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,003
Uh, it's fine.
We can celebrate when you get back.

111
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,963
Are you sure?

112
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,756
Okay. Well, you know what?

113
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,551
If we're gonna be out of town,
you should throw yourself a party.

114
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,511
Absolutely!

115
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,514
-You have to have a party.
-No, I don't think so.

116
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,432
What?

117
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,435
When I was in high school,
I would've killed to have a birthday party

118
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,769
in a nice house like this.

119
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,104
I'll think about it.

120
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,398
You guys should get going.
You're gonna miss your plane.

121
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,527
Oh, Howard, why don't you give him
some cash, you know, so he doesn't starve.

122
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,070
Thousand dollars sound good?

123
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,241
But if you need more, just call.

124
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,287
Happy birthday, my favorite son.

125
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,543
-You know, he's your only son.
-[Ben's dad] That's why he's my favorite.

126
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,963
[Ben's mom] I know, but it sounds like
you have other children.

127
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,886
-Love you.
-[Ben's dad] Bye, bye.

[sentimental music playing]

129
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,899
Have you seen Eleanor and Fabiola?

130
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,025
Sorry, I haven't.

131
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,652
Then again, my eyes can't really pick up
anything below six.

132
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,114
Ben, I don't have time to listen
to you pretend to have standards.

133
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,744
What's going on? Are you okay?

134
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,582
Birthday acknowledgment, Ben.

135
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,627
-Uh, thanks.
-I don't want to presume it's a happy one.

136
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,630
It's okay if it's a sad one
or a neutral one.

137
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,964
Okay.

138
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,258
However you're feeling is right.

139
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,968
Just have a day.

140
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,266
Is it your birthday?
Why didn't you say something?

141
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,602
This is the one day
I have to be nice to you.

142
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,020
Then why did you punch me?

143
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,939
That was a friendship punch.

144
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,857
So, are you gonna
have a party or something?

145
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,735
Yeah, I don't really make a big deal
about birthdays.

146
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,821
I'm sort of a low-key man of mystery.

147
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,989
You Instagrammed your PSAT score.

148
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,200
Only to inspire others
to try to achieve the impossible.

149
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,035
Yo, Devi.

150
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,831
Rebecca uploaded your pictures
to her Wix site. You want to see?

151
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,419
You look great here.

152
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,297
You know what, David?

153
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,383
I actually think
I am going to have a party tonight.

154
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,260
-Really?
-Yeah.

155
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,678
So you should come if you want.

156
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,012
Okay. Awesome.

157
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,180
I'll be there.

158
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,849
Can Paxton come?

159
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,894
Yeah, definitely.

160
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,479
Cool. And how about Trent?

161
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,940
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

162
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,860
Anyone can come.
Party at my house tonight.

163
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,750
[school bell rings]

164
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,628
Guys...

165
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,381
I know you're mad at me,

166
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,550
but I did come
to the drama room eventually.

167
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,427
I can't believe you ditched us for him.

168
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,931
I know, and I am really sorry,
but Paxton had an emergency too.

169
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,850
Was it worse than having your mom
abandon you?

170
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,188
[McEnroe] Let's see.
Paxton's emergency was a fun photo shoot,

171
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,149
so no, it was not worse
than having your mom abandon you.

172
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,650
Keep your mouth shut, Devi.

173
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,195
I'll make it up to you guys.
Did you hear about Ben's party?

174
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,821
We can go together.

175
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,408
We can get everyone drunk
with Fabiola's bomb beer pong skills.

176
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,369
We are going to the party, Devi,
but not with you.

177
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,539
Eleanor, what are you wearing?

178
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,916
You look like a sad librarian.

179
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,293
I'm different since I quit the play.

180
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,878
I'm no longer a creative person,

181
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,589
therefore, I no longer require
a colorful appearance.

182
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,008
Listen, I know I've been a bad friend,

183
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,676
-but I really--
-[Fabiola] Yeah, you have.

184
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,678
You just promised
that you'd be there for us

185
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,055
and then immediately blew us off.

186
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,307
I didn't really blow you guys off.
I just had--

187
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,519
Eric was more compassionate
to Eleanor's pain than you were.

188
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,812
He gave her a baggy of gummy worms
to cheer her up.

189
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,815
They were very old, and hard,
and covered with lint.

190
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,192
I did not eat them.

191
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:50,112
We're supposed to be best friends.
I left a funeral to be by your side

192
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,032
after Nick Jonas married an Indian woman
that wasn't you.

193
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,575
That was very hard on me.

194
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,204
Oh, yeah? Guess what? My mother leaving
was pretty hard on me too.

195
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,665
Of course. I know that,
and I am so sorry--

196
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,376
Fabiola and I are gonna take
a friend break from you.

197
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,920
I beg your P?

198
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,421
We just need some space right now.

199
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,175
Maybe losing us will make you appreciate
our friendship a little bit more.

200
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,436
I just think it's super unfair of them
to stop speaking to me.

201
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,023
Well, you did abandon them
to do an amateur fashion show

202
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,900
for a boy you barely even know.

203
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,735
But I said I was sorry.

204
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,363
If women didn't accept
each other's apologies,

205
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,031
The View would grind to a halt.

206
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:38,327
Okay, so you want to talk about
how to make it better with them?

207
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,121
No. I don't care.

208
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,457
I'm just gonna go to this party tonight
and hang out with my cooler friends,

209
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,709
like Paxton and Trent.

210
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,377
We're more alike anyways.

211
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,504
I find it a little hard to believe

212
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,049
that losing both your best friends
isn't bothering you at all.

213
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,385
Well, believe it, because I give zero F's.

214
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,345
I think you give many F's.

215
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,638
If that were me,

216
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:02,101
I'd be scared to lose two more people
that were that close to me.

217
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,146
You're bringing it back to my dad,
aren't you?

218
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,897
I am.

219
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,233
I'd be a bad therapist if I didn't.

220
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,028
Devi, listen.

221
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,281
You were so traumatized
by your dad's death,

222
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,117
you lost the use of your legs
for three months.

223
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,162
Yeah, I know.
What does that have to do with anything?

224
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,497
This thing with your friends,

225
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,791
baby girl, that's your grief.

226
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,545
So, my dad dies,
and suddenly, my friends are bitches?

227
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,715
Devi, you are so desperate
to not feel sad,

228
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,551
you've made your whole world
about this boy.

229
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,136
I'm a teenager.

230
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,138
My whole world is about boys.

231
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,974
I want you to allow yourself

232
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,186
to acknowledge the pain
you so clearly feel.

233
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,523
So you're saying I should get over
my sadness by getting really sad?

234
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,900
Why would I do that?

235
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,278
So I can be miserable and realize
the person I love the most

236
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,447
is never ever coming back?

237
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,615
Yes!

238
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,035
Because I think that would help you heal.

239
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,413
Well, I think I should get
a different therapist.

240
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,126
And I think you might be right.

241
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:10,961
What?

242
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,755
I want the best for you.

243
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,131
You know that.

244
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:18,177
But maybe you would benefit
from a different approach.

245
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,638
Are you serious?
You're breaking up with me too?

246
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,848
-Oh, this is not a breakup.
-You know what?

247
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,060
This is perfect.
I've always hated coming here.

248
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,853
So, peace out. See you never.

249
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,484
[sighs deeply]

250
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,736
[clock ticking]

251
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,697
[Nalini] It's ticking.

252
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,740
[laughs] Good work, Kamala.

253
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,410
Wow, this grandfather clock
is so handsome.

254
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,078
Almost makes me blush.

255
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,621
[door slams shut]

256
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,333
What's going on?
Why do we have a spooky Scooby-Doo clock?

257
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,335
Kamala's future husband
is visiting tomorrow,

258
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,839
and I thought the house could do
with a little touch of elegance.

259
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,342
He's not my future husband yet.
He's a potential future husband.

260
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,095
To that end,
do not touch the clock, Devi.

261
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,515
I'm returning it to the store
as soon as Prashant leaves.

262
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:09,437
Sure. Well, it feels like I'll just
be in your way if I stay here tonight.

263
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,398
Maybe I should go over to Eleanor's
for a study session.

264
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:17,486
We have un million French verbs
to conjugate over le weekend.

265
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,363
Verbs like "to party"?

266
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,532
"To drink alcohol"?

267
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,117
"To try opioids"?

268
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,704
Uh-huh, yes.
I know Ben Gross is having a party.

269
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,458
I'm a dermatologist.
Half my patients are acne-faced teenagers,

270
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,042
and boy, do they love to talk.

271
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,711
But it's Ben's birthday,

272
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,338
and you know how sad and lonely he is.

273
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,718
If I don't go, he might hurt himself.

274
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,722
The only person 
who hurts themselves at parties is you.

275
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,516
The last one you were at,
you got bitten by a coyote,

276
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,143
the cousin of the wolf!

277
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,062
So you will stay here,
and you will study with Kamala,

278
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,355
the cousin of you.

279
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,775
That's so unfair.

280
00:12:55,858 --> 00:13:00,070
Oh, actually, I was planning to work
at the Caltech library tonight.

281
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,489
Why don't you just work here?

282
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,866
I'm paying through my nose
for ultra-fast internet.

283
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,909
Someone should use it.

284
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,161
Sorry, Nalini Auntie.
Of course, I'll stay here

285
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,622
and take advantage
of your top-notch Wi-Fi.

286
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,832
Great. So you'll supervise Devi.

287
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,542
Where will you be?

288
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,587
I am taking my nurses
to see the musical Waitress

289
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,589
as a bonding exercise.

290
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,008
Apparently, American workplaces
need fun perks

291
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,511
to keep the employees interested
in earning a paycheck.

292
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,888
Anyway, I'll be home by 11:00,

293
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,057
and I expect you to be in bed by then.

294
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,975
[Devi scoffs]

295
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,146
-[grandfather clock chimes loudly]
-[both gasp]

296
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,856
Oh!

297
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,612
[Ben] Hey, Trent. Hey, Marcus.

298
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,198
Uh, can I get a cup of that punch?

299
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,325
Oh, it's not punch. It's grandma juice,

300
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,036
'cause one sip makes you demented.

301
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,496
-Right?
-Ooh.

302
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,289
Whoa, like, whoa.

303
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,499
Tell me what you think, bro.

304
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,751
-[coughs]
-Exactly. [laughs]

305
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,419
How is your grandma, Trent?

306
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,006
She has her good days.

307
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,345
[McEnroe] While most of her classmates
partied the night away at Ben's,

308
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,723
Devi was trapped at home
with only her calculator as company.

309
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,141
Dammit.

310
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,519
[McEnroe] But even the calculator
died of boredom.

311
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,687
[indie music playing loudly]

312
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,438
Kamala, where are the batteries?

313
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,608
Kamala, batteries!

314
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,986
Kamala!

315
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,660
Whoa. Kamala?

316
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,328
Devi!

317
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,874
Uh, this is my co-worker, Steve.

318
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,793
We're doing some research.

319
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,087
On how to hook up?

320
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,047
Oh, God.

321
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,758
I can't imagine what you must think of me.

322
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,051
I'm so ashamed.

323
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,679
Um, I think you're friggin' cool.

324
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,682
You snuck a boy into the house.
Have you done that before?

325
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,809
-No.
-Yep. I know the whole roof by touch.

326
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,727
Steve!

327
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,186
Holy shit.

328
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,771
This is amazing.

329
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,148
You're not perfect.

330
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,858
You're bad like me.

331
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,361
[laughs] Steve, why don't
you go downstairs and get a snack?

332
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,571
Oh, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

333
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,406
[whispering]
I obviously need to talk to my cousin!

334
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,908
Oh.

335
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,743
Gotcha. Will do.

336
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,044
Wow, Kamala. Wow!

337
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,589
Okay, so now you know I have
a secret boyfriend.

338
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,884
I wouldn't normally bring him
into the house while anyone was awake,

339
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,262
but he's been feeling insecure
because Prashant is coming.

340
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,097
Oh, my God. Right.

341
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,891
You're in a legit love triangle.

342
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,142
It's not a triangle.

343
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,062
It's more of a line and a dot
if you're really going to graph it.

344
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,733
But Prashant is just a formality
to appease my parents.
