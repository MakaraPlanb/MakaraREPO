1
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,139
[McEnroe] Even though her family
had a nice time at Ganesh Puja,

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,559
Nalini had not forgiven Devi 
for drinking at a no-parents party

3
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,436
and being bitten by a coyote.

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,439
So Devi was grounded 
and forced to become a house servant.

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,399
Currently, she was on ironing duty. 

6
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,317
Man, this is boring.

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,237
I’m a tennis commentator,
not a golf commentator.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,323
You know what? We’re gonna jump ship
and check in with Fabiola,

9
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,659
who has much more
interesting things going on.

10
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:39,205
Fabiola had told no one she was gay,
except her robot, Gears Brosnan.

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,625
She knew the next logical step
was to come out to some humans,

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,335
specifically her family.

13
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:48,214
So, I bet you're all wondering
why I've called this family meeting.

14
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,382
I certainly am.

15
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,302
Hey, can we make this quick?
My frat has a rush event in 15.

16
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,721
Yes. I just need a minute
of your guys' time.

17
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,097
[inhales deeply]

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,559
What I'm about to tell you
is pretty personal.

19
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,103
I hope that you won't look at me
any differently.

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,105
I'm still the same Fabiola.

21
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,232
Did that Alex Gomez boy get you pregnant?

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,026
-It's always the short ones.
-[Fabiola] What?

23
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,570
[stammers] No, ew. He didn't.
Not even close.

24
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,116
What I want to say is that I am...

25
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:21,790
I am...

26
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,003
[McEnroe] Come on, Fabiola.
You can do this. Just one more word.

27
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,338
I am...

28
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,928
switching from AP French
to AP Latin this year.

29
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:37,931
Okay.

30
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:38,932
Um...

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,475
I'm a little shocked.

32
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,436
[inhales] And I gotta say,
you sort of blindsided me here.

33
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,440
If I'm being really honest,
this isn't the life I imagined for you.

34
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,776
We have that trip planned
to Marseilles next summer--

35
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,902
Honey.

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,613
We are so glad

37
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,865
that you felt comfortable enough
to tell us this.

38
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,745
[McEnroe] You'll get 'em next time,
Fabiola.

39
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,705
You'll carpe diem another diem.

40
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,341
I can't take it.
I'm like a straight-up indentured servant.

41
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,261
My mom won't let me leave the house,
except for school events.

42
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,722
And tonight, she wants me to clear
the black widows out of our chimney.

43
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,892
Ugh, well, I hope you're done
with your grounding soon,

44
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,270
and then we can party
like at spring break!

45
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,230
[gasps] Oh, which reminds me,

46
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,399
my mom just sent this to me.

47
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,109
Her ship just arrived in Cancún.

48
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,653
[McEnroe] Eleanor had caught the drama bug
from her mother,

49
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,364
an aspiring actress, who abandoned Eleanor
when she was seven.

50
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,615
What kind of mother would I be

51
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,409
if I didn't teach you
to follow your dreams?

52
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,369
That's why I'm leaving you
to follow my dreams.

53
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,746
[McEnroe] Currently, she stars 
in Thoroughly Modern Millie

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,998
on a Weight Watchers cruise.

55
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,458
Wow. That card's dark.

56
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,043
Your mom's cool.

57
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,172
I know. I wish she were here
to help me with my audition

58
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,924
for The Glass Menagerie this week.
She's such a pro.

59
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,303
I mean, she's tried out
for almost every role on TV.

60
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,429
[sighs] That--

61
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,015
Fab, what's wrong?

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,476
You usually house a bag of Doritos
in, like, 20 seconds.

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,730
No, I was just... saying grace.

64
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,064
Amen.

65
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,193
Now it is time for flavor city.

66
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,528
Nom, nom, nom.

67
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,281
Hey, Coyote Girl. Over here.

68
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,785
[McEnroe] While Devi may have become
persona non grata at home,

69
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,954
at school, she was grata as hell.

70
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,332
[club music playing]

71
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,130
Oh, my God.

72
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,466
Paxton just publicly acknowledged you.

73
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,719
Do they want me to go over there?
You guys should come with me.

74
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,095
-No.
-No.

75
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,805
We will only weigh you down.

76
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,599
This is a journey
you're meant to take alone.

77
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,478
[McEnroe] Devi still had not told
her friends the truth about Paxton.

78
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,649
But to be fair, he had said 
she looked good at Ganesh Puja.

79
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,736
So it seemed like hooking up
might still be a possibility.

80
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,031
-[Trent] Lil' D!
-That's me.

81
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,533
All right, wait. Lil' D
or Coyote Girl? What are we going with?

82
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,535
-[all laugh]
-[Trent] Yo.

83
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,621
[phone chimes]

84
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,377
[Nalini] Just a reminder, you need
to come home straight after school.

85
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,836
Once you're done with the chimney,

86
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,465
I volunteered you to go next door
to help old Mrs. Finch cut her toenails.

87
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,925
[Ben] What do you mean Eric's sick?

88
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,177
He's supposed to be
goddamn Equatorial Guinea.

89
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,845
It's not a big deal, Ben.

90
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,765
We've showed up to Model UN conferences
a man down before.

91
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,352
I mean, a man or woman down before.

92
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,938
A they/them down before.

93
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,982
Never when I was on the Security Council.

94
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,318
I need every loser I can get
to make me look smarter by comparison.

95
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,487
What's the point of spending the night
in Davis

96
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,447
if I'm not winning
the Best Delegate gavel?

97
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,657
[McEnroe] To an average teen,

98
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,868
a Model UN trip to UC Davis
might seem like a real drag.

99
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,537
But to a teen under house arrest,

100
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,707
it sounded like a one-way ticket
to freedom USA.

101
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,753
[Devi] I love Mrs. Finch,
but can someone else go work on her feet?

102
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,799
Because there's an overnight school event
that would be great for my college resume.

103
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,803
Did you see Devi's text?

104
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,972
I guess she's going on the Model UN trip.

105
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,851
[laughs] Wow. She must be desperate
to get out of her house.

106
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,853
Those kids are real losers.

107
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,982
Oh, did I tell you?
I now do all my homework with a quill pen.

108
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,567
Eleanor, right?

109
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,402
[stammers] Uh... I think so.

110
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,447
I think your mom was our server
at Casa Mexico last night.

111
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,324
She was cool. Gave us extra chips.

112
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,617
What? That's impossible.

113
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,119
No, for real.

114
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,872
No. My mother's an actress on a cruise

115
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,833
that's currently docked
in the vibrant city of Cancún.

116
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,921
All right. Well, my mom knew her
and talked to her and stuff,

117
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,424
but maybe she was confused. Whatever.

118
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,010
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

119
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,306
[stammers] You can't just start a rumor
about someone's mom like that.

120
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,017
Clearly, you think
all Asian women look alike.

121
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,771
You're a racist, Paxton Hall-Yoshida!

122
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,356
I'm part Japanese.

123
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,066
Whoa. You are?

124
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,151
What do you think Yoshida is, bro?

125
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,362
Oh.

126
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:06,199
Clearly, this is touchy
for some reason that I don't care about.

127
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,952
Honestly, I didn't really think I'd have
to talk to you guys for this long.

128
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:10,870
Let's go.

129
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,414
I'm sorry I didn't realize
you were Asian, bro.

130
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,208
I'll try to be more observant
in the future.

131
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,919
[Paxton] You've met my dad like 40 times,
Trent.

132
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,587
[Trent] I thought that was your neighbor.

133
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,008
MUN fam, we're gonna crush
this diplomacy so hard,

134
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,511
they'll be calling all of us
Mr. Worldwide,

135
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,388
and not just my dad's client, Pitbull.

136
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,515
-Because who are we?
-Sherman Oaks High!

137
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,725
-And what do we do?
-Model UN!

138
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,143
And-- What are you doing here?

139
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,353
Model UN!

140
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,772
Ben, I know you were worried about us
not having a full team,

141
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,776
but God, whoever she is,
is smiling on us today.

142
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,820
What the hell?

143
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,364
This is a clear violation of our pact.

144
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,701
[McEnroe] Years ago, Ben and Devi split
all extracurriculars down the middle,

145
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,036
except for sports,

146
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,415
which required too much locker room nudity
for either of them.

147
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,875
You're joking. That was in sixth grade.

148
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,169
This is my turf.
You don't see me showing up to orchestra

149
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,254
with a freaking bassoon.

150
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,090
As if you have the deftness
to play a double-reed woodwind.

151
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,883
Relax. It's just for two days.

152
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,635
Unless I turn out to be a natural.

153
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,971
Then I'm stealing this,
and you can have Chinese Club.

154
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,889
[in Chinese] Over my dead body.

155
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,239
Bad morning, enemy.

156
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,451
Just an unfriendly reminder
that you're not necessarily good at UN

157
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,910
just because you are a UN.

158
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,246
So keep quiet, don't raise your placard,

159
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,747
and support all my resolutions.

160
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,333
No way.
I'm winning that Best Delegate hammer.

161
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,334
It's a gavel.

162
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,837
Whatever. It's mine.

163
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,382
So prepare for Equatorial Guinea
to do what Equatorial Guinea does best:

164
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,720
have one of the worst 
human rights records in the world. Damn.

165
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,347
Take your seats.

166
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,977
I officially call this session
of the Security Council to order.

167
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,895
[hits gavel]

168
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,772
Our first topic today is climate change.

169
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,942
United States, you have the floor.

170
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,448
Distinguished delegates
and honorable chair,

171
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,285
the US is appalled. Nay, it's sickened
at the state of our world.

172
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,997
We could twiddle our thumbs
while Atlanta becomes the new Atlantis...

173
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,333
or we could pass a resolution right now. 

174
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,753
I’m calling for sponsors
in support of my proposal

175
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:28,007
to build seawalls to protect coastal areas
from rising sea levels.

176
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,844
Equatorial Guinea.

177
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,058
Equatorial Guinea feels 
that the United States' resolution

178
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,019
is a poorly considered half measure
at best.

179
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,606
Building taller and taller seawalls
isn't doing anything

180
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,985
except lining the pockets
of seawall corporations.

181
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,238
-Those aren't things.
-I'm just saying.

182
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,657
We need to address
the real root of the problem.

183
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,824
Carbon emissions.

184
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,787
Maybe the five permanent members
of the Security Council

185
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,081
should reach an agreement
before we listen to countries

186
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,749
that are lucky to even be included.

187
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,710
[hits gavel] United States,
you do not have the floor.

188
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,922
Equatorial Guinea, if you're done,
you may yield back to the US.

189
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,757
I yield to the chair.

190
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,800
[chokes]

191
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,635
Oh, shit.

192
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,346
[McEnroe] I know yielding to the chair
doesn’t sound exciting

193
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,973
to cool jocks like you or me,

194
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,102
but that was the Model UN equivalent
of me throwing my racket at an umpire.

195
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,437
Uh... Russia.

196
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,775
I'd actually like to hear more
of Equatorial Guinea's plan.

197
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,653
I think she's onto something,
and I'd like to make her my friend.

198
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,904
I mean, ally.

199
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,368
[upbeat music playing]

200
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,958
You're buffering, Eleanor.

201
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,253
Are you thinking about what Paxton said?

202
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,879
What if it was my mom?

203
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,258
What if she's just 20 minutes away
serving enchiladas?

204
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,386
She's not.
She's on a cruise ship off the Yucatán.

205
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,429
Is she?

206
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,722
[sighs] Okay.

207
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,891
You want to go to Casa Mexico
and see if it's her?

208
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,145
Sí, por favor.

209
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,187
Let's go.

210
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,530
[Mr. Shapiro] All right, everybody.

211
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,366
So before we go back into the hotel,

212
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,035
I just want to remind you,

213
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,080
I expect you to all act in a way
that is respectful to your school...

214
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,458
and to your bodies.

215
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,668
Ergo, no partying, no room service,

216
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,296
and no disrupting me
between 7:30 and 7:45.

217
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,715
I have a Skype call with my partner,
Debra.

218
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,343
[chuckles] We just became exclusive.

219
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,729
[Devi] Wow.

220
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,775
Pretty crazy I came in
and crushed it at Model UN with zero prep.

221
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,903
Wow. You really think you're hot shit,
don't you?

222
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,780
Now that you're having sex with Paxton?

223
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,823
[mouths] What the shit?

224
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,409
-No-- what?
-[McEnroe] Devi was panicking.

225
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,078
How did Ben find out about her lie?

226
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,121
Simple. Her friends told him.

227
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,624
Would a dork be sleeping
with Paxton Hall-Yoshida?

228
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,917
-Yeah, right.
-[Eleanor] It's true.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,420
Devi V and Paxton H-Y are plundering
each others' bods on the reg.

230
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,172
But just to be clear,

231
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,840
being Paxton's secret sidepiece

232
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,051
doesn't make me think
you're any less of a loser.

233
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,554
[scoffs]

234
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,435
OMG. Devi's railing Paxton H-Y!

235
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,024
Oh, my God. She's here.

236
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,610
Why are you looking at me?

237
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,529
You're allowed to take the apples
from the fitness center.

238
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,447
I overheard you and Ben talking
on the bus.

239
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,533
The idea that a girl in Model UN

240
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,743
can get with a guy
like Paxton Hall-Yoshida,

241
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,829
you're an inspiration to us.

242
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,622
[McEnroe] Devi felt surprisingly honored,

243
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,500
but wondered if she should correct
these girls about her and Paxton.

244
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,503
We talked, and you should have
a bed all to yourself.

245
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,380
Sleeping next to our bodies is a let down

246
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,133
compared to the marble statue
you're used to being with.

247
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,176
[McEnroe]
Maybe correcting these girls could wait.

248
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,512
It's not like they're gonna talk
to the Hot Pocket,

249
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,097
and she'd already given them hope.

250
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,807
It'd be cruel to take that away.

251
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,808
[knocking on door]

252
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,146
-Oh, my God. Her life is like a movie.
-Oh, my God. [exhales]

253
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,734
[boy] Meet me in the ice room.
Da svidania, Russia.

254
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,153
[squeals]

255
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,532
Psst. [whistles]

256
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,376
[scoffs]

257
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,044
I'm sorry. We were waiting for her?

258
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,296
[chuckles] Forget it. I'm out.

259
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,714
[scoffs] Not before I'm out.

260
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,341
Wait, please, comrades.
You haven't even heard my proposal.

261
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,261
I'd like to lead a joint initiative...

262
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,471
to get turnt.

263
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,184
I want to get drunk with you guys.

264
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,144
[stammers] I don't think so, Russia.

265
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,230
Even when we're not on campus,
we're still representatives of our school.

266
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,067
Yeah. The way he said it was lame,
but I'm out too.

267
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,403
Come on, guys. I need this.

268
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,906
My mom is such a bitch.
I never get to do anything.

269
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,741
Everyone at my school hates me.

270
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,785
But you, everyone loves you.

271
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,328
You're cool.

272
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,663
You're having sex
with Paxton Hall-Yoshida!

273
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,081
How do you know who Paxton is?

274
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,375
Every teen in SoCal knows
who Paxton is, brah.

275
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,044
He's got three fan Tumblrs.

276
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,545
One of them is entirely in Korean.

277
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,172
Wow. That's crazy.

278
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,674
He's just regular old Paxton to me.

279
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,551
It's hard to see him
through the eyes of a fan,

280
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,011
because we're so close.

281
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,014
Okay, Russia. How exactly are we
supposed to get alcohol?

282
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,016
There's a realtors' convention
here tonight,

283
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,268
and the vino should be flowing freely.

284
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,604
If we swiped a couple of bottles,
no one would even notice.

285
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,607
I don't know. I'm already, 
technically, grounded for drinking.

286
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,984
If I get caught again, I'm in deep shit.

287
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,028
But isn't this kind of normal for you?

288
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,156
Being grounded, sneaking alcohol,
hooking up?

289
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,825
I mean you're popular, right?

290
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,080
Yes. Yes, I am.

291
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,499
-I'm in.
-Yes!

292
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,042
Then I'm doing it too.

293
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,837
I want to make sure someone grabs
the good alcohol.

294
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,213
How do you know what's good?

295
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,091
My dad let me have a sip
of Cristal at New Year's.

296
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,008
Mm.

297
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,599
Oh, my God.

298
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,560
She is here.

299
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,186
Eleanor.

300
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,149
I can't believe my own mother
is so two-faced!

301
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,736
Oh, my God. You're not my mom.
I'm so sorry.

302
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,238
That was kinda racist of me.

303
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,323
See? It isn't her.

304
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,367
-She is on a cruise.
-I know.

305
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,997
I can't believe I trusted 
Paxton's beautiful lying mouth over her.

306
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,374
[singing "Happy Birthday" in Spanish]

307
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,169
Mom?

308
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,131
Eleanor.

309
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,591
You're here?

310
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,176
And this is your job?

311
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,470
What's happening?

312
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,306
I can explain.

313
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,225
Hi, Ms. Wong.

314
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:54,894
Bye, Ms. Wong.

315
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,608
[McEnroe] Devi and Ben
only had 15 minutes.

316
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,068
They'd have to be
as fast as a Björn Borg serve

317
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,988
and as precise as McEnroe return
to pull off this heist.

318
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,700
[Mr. Shapiro] Hi, Debra. I'm on,
and I'm gonna loop in our therapist.

319
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,386
Can I help you?

320
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,388
Hi. We'd like two martinis, please.

321
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,224
You guys look really young.
Can I see some ID?

322
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,435
[scoffs] I don't have my wallet.

323
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:40,689
I mean, I guess I could go all the way up
to my room on the fifth floor,

324
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,316
-find my key--
-Just be cool, man.

325
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,194
This is a one.

326
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,655
[whispers] And there's one more
where that came from.

327
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,949
Sorry, guys. No can do.

328
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,536
Fine.
You just lost yourself a dollar, bro.

329
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,797
They made me do it. They bullied me.

330
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,591
This is why your whole school hates you!

331
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,177
Let's go.

332
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,140
In here.

333
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,938
[footsteps approaching and receding]

334
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,191
Okay. I think we're safe.

335
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,819
-Let's just wait it out in here.
-[glass bottles clinks]

336
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:31,865
[scoffs]

337
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:34,451
[Devi laughs]

338
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,454
Jackpot. [chuckles]

339
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:39,915
[chuckle]

340
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:44,962
You okay?

341
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,881
Want to watch relaxing YouTube
on how to make tea?

342
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,799
No.

343
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,803
This is one of the few situations
where chamomile can't soothe my nerves.

344
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,263
[inhales]

345
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,683
When did she get here,
and why didn't she tell me?

346
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,768
I'm sure she has an explanation.

347
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,772
Maybe she's a spy
or in a really good cult.

348
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,275
No, she would've bragged
about those things.

349
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,902
You're so lucky.
You have a perfect family.

350
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,613
We are not perfect.

351
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,990
Yeah, you are.

352
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,035
It's not like you have a huge lie
threatening to tear everyone apart.

353
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,122
Actually, I do.

354
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,749
Oh, my God.

355
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,501
Do they not know you switched to AP Latin?

356
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,839
They don't know...

357
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:31,925
[sighs]

358
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:33,802
...that I'm gay.

359
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,389
What?

360
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,433
[sighs] I'm gay.

361
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you sooner.
I, honestly, just realized--

362
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,190
Don't you dare apologize to me.

363
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,984
Really?

364
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,320
I love this for you.

365
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,698
And I love this for me.
Finally, a gay friend.

366
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,825
It really fits my brand
as a theater wench.

367
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,743
[chuckles]

368
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,995
Wow.

369
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,372
That felt so great to say.

370
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:07,461
I feel like I just solved an escape room
I've been trapped in my entire life.

371
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,254
So, like, what's your type though?

372
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,007
Kristen Stewart in Twilight
or Kristen Stewart in Charlie's Angels?

373
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,384
Um... I don't know. Honestly,

374
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,305
I think my type is kinda that girl, Eve,
in our history class.

375
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,932
Oh, so Charlie's Angels.

376
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,017
-Wow.
-[chuckles]

377
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,312
How appropriate
that Eve could be your first woman.

378
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,232
I can't even think about that
until I talk to my parents.

379
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,069
Yeah. I guess we both have
tough conversations to look forward to.

380
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,238
I just wish Devi were here right now.

381
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,823
[gasps] Oh, man. She's gonna freak.

382
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,075
In a supportive way.

383
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,743
-Let's call her.
-Yeah.

384
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,583
[phone ringing]

385
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,087
[girl] Delegates,

386
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,383
I motion we toast the United States
and Equatorial Guinea.

387
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,510
Do I have any other signatories?

388
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,220
Whoo!

389
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,181
Ugh.

390
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,350
This is what wine tastes like?

391
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,771
So...

392
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,401
it turns out we're a pretty good team
for two people who hate each other.

393
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,735
I don't hate you.

394
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,904
I just think you're pretentious
and unlikable.

395
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,490
How am I unlikable?
My dad drives a Porsche Cayenne.

396
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,784
Right there. That was unlikable.

397
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,705
All right, but you have somewhat
of a difficult personality as well.

398
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,706
Who, me?

399
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,416
I'm a goddamn delight.

400
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,877
I should punch you in the Adam's apple
for saying that.

401
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,754
[sarcastically] Oh, I stand corrected.
You're America's sweetheart.

402
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,755
Thank you.

403
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,135
Hey, I kinda like Model UN.
Do you want to trade me for Chinese Club?

404
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,012
No way. Back off, poacher.

405
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,555
But you're so good at Mandarin.

406
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,933
Well, honestly, I only became good
at Mandarin to spite you, so...

407
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,185
[in Chinese] Thank you.

408
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,020
You're welcome.

409
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:48,979
[chuckles]

410
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,358
Hey, I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

411
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,861
What if we worked together tomorrow?

412
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,946
This will be killer on our transcripts.

413
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,699
[scoffs] Are you suggesting an alliance
between us?

414
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,243
That's like North and South Korea
becoming friends.

415
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,286
Exactly.

416
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,996
Imagine how powerful they'd be.

417
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,750
You'd have surface-to-air missiles,
and also, BTS.

418
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,127
I feel you. World domination.

419
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,924
Have you told Paxton about Model UN?

420
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,843
I'm sure he's really interested
in international diplomacy.

421
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,721
Hey, you know what country's cool?

422
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,181
Chad.

423
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,266
[scoffs] Okay. Paxton's not dumb.

424
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,560
He's just consistently bad at school.

425
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,478
[chuckles]

426
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,188
[door opens] Come on!

427
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,399
This is exactly
what I told you guys not to do.

428
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,235
Go to your rooms right now!

429
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:42,074
And text your parents what an educational
and safe time you're having.

430
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,912
[McEnroe] Devi went to bed
happy that night.

431
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,747
She was a hero to all the nerds,

432
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,541
and alcohol seems to make Ben Gross nice.

433
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,754
This Model UN trip just might be
the best decision she's made all year.

434
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,007
[phone buzzes]

435
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,175
[Paxton] Devi, WTF?

436
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,886
Why are you lying to everyone
about us having sex?

437
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,017
[girl] Good morning!

438
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,978
Breakfast in bed?

439
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:11,895
[chuckles]

440
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,648
-You guys didn't have to do that.
-Yes, we did.

441
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:18,068
Last night, I drank Sauvignon Blanc,
and a boy touched my shoulder.

442
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,821
I mean, thanks to you,
I'm basically Sex and the City.

443
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:21,780
My pleasure.

444
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,449
You guys are well on your way
to becoming cool.

445
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,367
Just like me.

446
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,994
-[giggles]
-[phone buzzes]

447
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,623
-Oh, my God.
-[girl] What is it?

448
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,418
-Is it from... him?
-[giggles] Ooh...

449
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,005
Yes, it is,
and I should give him a call back.

450
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,756
Could you guys give me
some privacy, please?

451
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,757
For phone sex?

452
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,718
Please leave. You're dismissed.

453
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,594
-[giggling] Okay.
-[giggling] Oh, my God.

454
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,848
[voicemail] This is Paxton.
I don't check my voicemail.

455
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,729
[voicemail] This is Paxton.
I don't check my voicemail.

456
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,482
[McEnroe] Apparently, what happens 
in Davis does not stay in Davis.

457
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,444
Particularly, juicy rumors about sex

458
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,612
with the hottest teen
in Los Angeles County.

459
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,658
Devi was distraught,
but she had no one to blame but herself.

460
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,661
Well, maybe she could think
of one other person.

461
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,333
If Ben hadn't opened
his big fat stupid mouth,

462
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,003
her harmless piece of fiction would have
never spread to the entire school.

463
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,047
It was his fault Paxton was mad at her.

464
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,548
He was the villain here.

465
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,884
If we don't act now,
the oceans will rise so much

466
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,762
that we'll be doing beach vacations
on the top of Mount Everest.

467
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,390
So the United States motions for a vote
to table our amended resolution.

468
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,893
Do I hear a second from my ally,
Equatorial Guinea?

469
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,227
Hmm.

470
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,815
Equatorial Guinea does not support
the American resolution.

471
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,235
In fact, we think that the resolution
is a piece of shit.

472
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,904
-[crowd gasps]
-[gavel banging]

473
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,032
Decorum. Equatorial Guinea,
please use respectful language.

474
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,035
Instead, I would like to put forth
an alternative plan.

475
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,080
The US contributes
far more carbon emissions

476
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,748
than any other nation.

477
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,834
Thus, Equatorial Guinea would like 
to formally request permission

478
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,045
to nuke the United States.

479
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,049
[gavel banging] Decorum.
That's not what we do in Security Council.

480
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,300
And even if it were,

481
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,095
Equatorial Guinea doesn't have
nuclear capabilities.

482
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,183
Russia, you're a narc,
but if you give me your nukes,

483
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,684
I'll let you have my e-mail address.

484
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,061
But you already gave it to me.

485
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,854
My real e-mail address.

486
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,357
Hot dog.

487
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,445
The Russian Federation formally surrenders
all nukes to Equatorial Guinea.

488
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,241
What now, Mr. Chairman? I'm all nuked up.

489
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,660
Point of order.
That's not even how Model UN works.

490
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,578
You're being insane, Devi.

491
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,289
We can't seriously be talking
about nuclear war.

492
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,624
Guess what, Belgium?

493
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,835
You just got nuked.

494
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,754
And anyone else who supports
the United States

495
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,464
can consider themselves nuked too.

496
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:48,385
The US has shown they can't be trusted
with sensitive information,

497
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,595
and if left to their own devices,

498
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,639
will ruin all our lives.

499
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,224
Who's with me?

500
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,976
Viva World War III!

501
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,394
[cheering]

502
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:04,818
[chanting] World War III! World War III!
World War III! World War III!

503
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,487
[chairman] Decorum!

504
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,873
Hello. I'm Eleanor Wong
reading for Laura Wingfield.

505
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,041
Uh-huh, ready when you are.

506
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,046
Why did you do that, Mother?

507
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,595
[whispers] Why did you do that, Mother?

508
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,474
[audience member coughs]

509
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,643
Why are you...

510
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,770
How old are you, Laura?

511
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,355
Mother...

512
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,817

Wow. Eleanor, I was prepared
to make you do props,

521

but that was... a revelation.

522
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,729
I don't think the part of Laura
is big enough for you.

523
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,397
I think you have to be our Amanda.

524

But Amanda is the lead.

525
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,903
Yes, she is, Eleanor. Yes, she is.

Why aren't you calling us back?

[Devi] Hey.

536
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,158
I just wanted to say that I'm so sorry
for everything that happened.

537
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,536
I never intentionally told people
that we were hooking up.

538
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,620
Oh, really?

539
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,706
Then why did I get a million texts
from people

540
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,458
asking me if I was having sex
with Devi Vishwakumar?

541
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,461
My friends just assumed it,
and I never corrected them,

542
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,629
and it just got out of hand.

543
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,339
And why didn't you correct them?

544
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,425
Because you wanted them
to think we were having sex.

545
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,052
-No, Paxton. You don't understand--
-No, you know what?

546
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,055
I thought we were friends,
but you were just using me.

It's just a silly rumor.

Devi! We've been trying
to get in touch with you.

552
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,034
Some crazy things happened,
and we both have something to tell you.

-But it's really important.
