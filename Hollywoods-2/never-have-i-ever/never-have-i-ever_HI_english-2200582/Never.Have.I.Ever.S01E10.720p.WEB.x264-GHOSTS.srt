[McEnroe]
Hey, it’s your boy McEnroe again.

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,808
Now, you may be wondering

4
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:21,396
did Devi redecorate and become a super fan
of the classic rock power-group,

5
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,689
The Doobie Brothers?

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,858
Not quite.

7
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,861
A week ago, Devi and her mom
had an epic blowout

8
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:31,197
after Nalini said
they were relocating to India.

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,367
You remember, 
the fight where Devi said this:

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,911
I wish you were the one
that died that night.

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,788
[door slams]

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,875
[McEnroe] After dropping that bomb,

13
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,085
Devi decided
she had to move out of the house

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,338
before her mom had a chance
to move her across the globe.

15
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,882
But where to go?

16
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:52,635
She wasn’t really on speaking terms
with her two best friends,

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,805
and it would be psycho
to ask a guy she’s only kissed once

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,307
if she could live with him.

19
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,605
So there’s really only one person left.

20
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,523
[Ben] Hey, David.

21
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,861
Um, did something kinda weird happen?
Or did I do something dumb at my party?

22
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,863
[McEnroe] He's talking about this:

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,700
-Whoa. Were you just trying to kiss me?
-Uh...

24
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,744
[McEnroe]
And then four seconds later, this:

25
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,329
Ben, what the hell?

26
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,208
Anyway, if I did,
that was just alcohol doing its thang.

27
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,835
So I... I hope that
you're not feeling weird, or awkward,

28
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,629
-because I--
-Can I move in with you?

29
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,214
[school bell rings]

30
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:33,051
[McEnroe] Ben’s parents were surprisingly
cool about letting Devi move in.

31
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,595
Their only concern was
that their last boarder,

32
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,515
a Greek foreign-exchange student
named Stavros,

33
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,184
had robbed them
and tried to seduce Ben’s mother.

34
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,269
Devi promised she would do neither,

35
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,606
and was invited to stay
in their rock-and-roll themed guest room.

36
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,735
So now Devi got ready for school
under the soulful gaze

37
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,987
of Howard Gross’s favorite clients.

-Good morning.
-Morning.

40
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,960
Good morning, Devi.

41
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,837
I have made your favorite:

42
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,381
-meat lover's omelet.
-Thank you, Patty.

43
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,551
Here's number one million and one
of the things

44
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,636
I couldn't get if I moved to India...

45
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,721
'cause nobody eats meat there.

46
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,598
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

47
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,393
Only about 20 to 30 percent 
of the population in India

48
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,352
are truly vegetarian.

49
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,146
I did an extra-credit report

50
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,939
for World History on the cuisines
of South Asia.

51
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,023
Suck-up.

52
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,401
You know, I would've run away earlier

53
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,945
if I'd known I'd get to use a bathroom
with a TV in it.

54
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,906
Yeah. I like to watch Billions
in the bath.

55
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,074
Mmm.

56
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,911
-Have you heard from your mom?
-No.

57
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,248
Honestly, I'm surprised
she hasn't had the police come over here

58
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,708
to drag you home. [chuckles]

59
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,334
I'm not sure she wants me back.

60
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,505
I mean, I'm like the only Indian child
ever to run away from home

61
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,631
aside from Mowgli.

62
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,509
Mowgli didn't run away.
He was lost after a tiger attack.

63
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,803
What? I'm a reader.

64
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,097
Look, maybe you should just apologize.

65
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,183
Why should I apologize?

66
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,436
She is the one who's ruining my life
by moving me to India.

67
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,563
I never even got to go to Coachella, Ben.

68
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,481
India is not that different
from Coachella.

69
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,568
It's crowded, dusty.
Diplo's sort of around.

70
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,403
Forget it. I'm not going.

71
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,989
You could ask my dad to help you
emancipate yourself like a child actor.

72
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,534
It usually goes pretty well for them.
You're looking to get into meth, right?

-Hello, Devi.
-Jesus! Kamala, what the hell?

75
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,381
I'm sorry. I've been told before

76
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,051
that my light tread is too elegant
to be detected by the human ear.

77
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,469
What are you doing here?

78
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,679
I thought you might need
some things from home.

79
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,181
It seemed like you packed in haste.

80
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,392
Yeah. I've been using
Ben's deodorant all week.

81
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,686
So, do you think
you might return home sometime soon?

about all the, quote, "delusional uggos."

I don't know, Kamala.

85
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,820
Your mother also misses you a lot.

86
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,113
Did she say that?

Not in words,

88
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,826
but I did see her hesitate when
she threw out all your favorite snacks.

00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,537
-[scoffs]
-So, is it nice over at Ben's?

90
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,081
It's friggin' luxurious.

91
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,916
They have a pool. They have a gym.

92
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,085
They use hella cushy soft toilet paper.

93
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,379
Not that one-ply trash Mom buys.

94
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,464
And they let me use the dishwasher.

95
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,590
I'm sure if you came home,

96
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,842
I could convince your mother
to let you run the dishwasher once.

97
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,386
Oh! Which home?

98
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,973
The one here,
or the one I'm being dragged to in India?

99
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,767
Obviously, you won't need a dishwasher
in India because you'll have servants.

101
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,605
Please just tell my mom
I'm not coming home

-Fine?

to upgrade to a four and three,

you have ever seen in your life.

116

And you tell Mohan it's got a rain shower.

117
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:17,442
I would, but, um... sadly,
he passed away eight months ago.

Oh, I am so sorry.

I have decided to move
my daughter and I back to India,

and, um, I'm looking to put my house
on the market.

123
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,496
Uh, okay, sure. I'll get right on it.

-But it is such a shame, you know?

Wow. This is perfect.

than this?

It's 90210, baby.

00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,228
Actually, it's 91403.

132
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,105
A higher number. Even better!

133
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,815
How come in all the movies about Hollywood

134
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,026
no one mentions
how many spiders live here?

135
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,196
Forget about the spiders
and look at the house.

136
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,990
We could plant a little garden here,

137
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,493
grow fresh tomatoes for thakkali sambar,

138
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,162
and our children could get married
right here on this lawn.

139
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,540
And when we grow old,
we can sit on the porch

140
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,376
and shake our fists at the skateboarders.

141
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,878
I do like to shake my fist.

142
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,130
So, you thinking this is the one, folks?

144
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,968
Yes.

145
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,138
Yes, this is our home.

146
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,350
Wonderful! I'll get started
on the paperwork.

Oh, my gosh. What is this song?

It's a sign. It is a beautiful day!

Sure.

[Nalini laughs] No!

[McEnroe] Devi had hoped that
kissing Paxton wasn’t a one-time thing,

158

but ever since he showed up at her house,

159
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:10,138
he had been a little bit,
how do you say… distant?

Hey. I haven't seen you all week.

161

Yeah, I've been busy.

was so crazy to you the other day.

-Totally.

166
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,863
I mean, honestly, I got
into a huge fight with her after that.

wanna hang out after school or something?

Get out of there, Devi.
This is a classic brush-off.

172

there are some exceptions.

-I'm concerned.
-Yeah, me too.

189
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,558
I told her we were moving us
back to India,

190

day and night.

-Wait. You're moving back to India?
-Yeah, we have to.

193
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,112
Devi is out of control. She needs to be
in an environment that values discipline.

Sure, but changing your geography

195
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,536
won't necessarily change the problems
that Devi is dealing with.

Why do you think Devi feels that way?

208
