1
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,704
Sir, shoals on every side.

2
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,789
Sand or reef, I cannot say.

3
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,628
Captain, the Malay pirates
have us cornered.

4
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,130
We must surrender.

5
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,386
Surrendering my father's ship
will not guarantee survival, Mr. Phelps.

6
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,771
Shallow water.

7
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,940
Dead ahead, full sails!

8
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,693
Captain! The ship will run aground.

9
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,195
It's impossible!

10
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,323
You know my views on
that word, Mr. Phelps.

11
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,619
Full sails. Full sails!

12
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,954
Full sails, boys.

13
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,706
Full sails!

14
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,045
Hard to port, Harper!

15
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,716
Turning to port at full sail
will tip us over.

16
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,551
Exactly!

17
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,892
Lads, get those sails down!

18
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,894
We haven't got all day!

19
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,651
Hold on, everyone!

20
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,325
It's too shallow.

21
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,411
We need full sails!

22
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,583
-Will! Hold on, lad!
-Help!

23
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,067
She's going over.

24
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,739
Hold on, boys!

25
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,038
Hold on, lads!

26
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,986
You did it, Captain!

27
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,920
The only way to achieve the impossible
is to believe it is possible.

28
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,589
Set a course for London, Harper.

29
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,676
Our work here is done.

30
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,180
Splice the mainbrace, lads!
We're going home!

31
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:31,188
ALICE THROUGH THE
LOOKING GLASS

32
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,313
Captain ashore.

33
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,816
Captain.

34
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,492
Mother.

35
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,036
Here you are.

36
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,162
Finally.

37
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,706
Miss Kingsleigh?

38
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,917
You and the Wonder have been expected
for over a year.

39
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,252
There were complications.

40
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,670
Pirates and such.

41
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,130
The ledgers are in my cabin.

42
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,425
And would you please let Lord Ascot know
I should like to see him immediately.

43
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:45,262
I'm afraid Lord Ascot passed away
whilst you were at sea.

44
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,181
The title's been passed on to his son.

45
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,308
-Hamish?
-Indeed.

46
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:50,934
Now chairman of the board.

47
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,770
How unfortunate.

48
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,869
Your letters were so infrequent.

49
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,371
I hardly know where
you've been all this time.

50
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,207
Mother, China's incredible.

51
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,626
We followed the Yangtze
deep into the interior.

52
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,630
Most of the people had never seen
a person with yellow hair before.

53
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,507
-Were you never afraid?
-Of course.

54
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,635
But, when I was, I thought of Father.

55
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,012
You sound just like him.

56
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,807
I miss him.

57
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,685
I do, too.

58
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,480
But the years pass quickly for me now.

59
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,483
Time is a cruel master.

60
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,445
Time is a thief. And a villain.

61
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:47,074
I hear the Ascots are marking
Hamish's succession tonight.

62
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:47,950
Perfect.

63
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,660
We should go.

64
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,329
I'm afraid the invitation
must have been lost in the post.

65
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,123
Nonsense. Lady Ascot once said
we would always be welcome.

66
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,126
Besides, I have a proposition for Hamish.

67
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,754
Hamish married last year, Alice.

68
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,173
He seems to have got over
your public rejection.

69
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,550
A business proposition, Mother.

70
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,094
You're leaving again?

71
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,512
So soon?

72
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,559
There are matters here which might
benefit from your attention.

73
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,435
After my next voyage...

74
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,604
you won't have to worry about anything.

75
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,190
Am I permitted to worry about tonight?

76
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,537
I do wish you'd worn that yellow dress.

77
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,582
If it's good enough for
the Dowager Empress of China...

78
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,417
then it's good enough for the Ascots.

79
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,711
Must you always be so headstrong?

80
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,546
No. It's just more fun that way.

81
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,057
What is she wearing?

82
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,767
It's the Kingsleigh girl.

83
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:56,935
Excuse me.

84
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,103
Outrageous.

85
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,313
Circus performer.

86
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:02,733
Miss Kingsleigh?

87
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,027
What are you doing here?

88
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,070
I've come to give my report
to Lord Ascot.

89
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,948
Right.

90
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,408
Well, follow me.

91
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:21,668
Helen.

92
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,587
What a surprise.

93
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,590
Alice. Well. Welcome home.

94
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,593
We were afraid you might
never come back with our ship.

95
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,136
My ship. Hello, Hamish.

96
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,264
It's proper to refer to my husband
as Lord Ascot.

97
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,267
That is why we're having
this little soirĂ©e after all.

98
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,813
Miss Kingsleigh, this is
my wife, Alexandra.

99
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,440
The new Lady Ascot.

100
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,945
Hamish tells me you've traveled
the world these last three years.

101
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,613
Yes. I've just returned.

102
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,365
How was it?

103
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:52,574
The world?

104
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:53,784
Yes.

105
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,872
Highly enjoyable.
You should visit it sometime.

106
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,086
Apologies for the intrusion, Lord Ascot...

107
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,629
but I've come to give my report.

108
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,506
Of course.

109
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,133
Follow me, Miss Kingsleigh.

110
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,887
And you, Mr. Harcourt.

111
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,603
Gentlemen, might I introduce
Miss Alice Kingsleigh.

112
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,272
Miss Kingsleigh, the board.

113
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,567
Good evening, gentlemen.

114
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,486
The world has opened to us,
but we must move quickly.

115
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,574
It is my belief that further expeditions
along the Wu River...

116
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm sorry, Miss Kingsleigh.

117
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,744
There will be no further expeditions.

118
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,330
What?

119
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,542
Now, there is a position
in our clerking office.

120
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,836
You will start in files...

121
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,005
but in time...

122
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,798
This isn't about China, is it?

123
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,135
It's because I turned you down
when you asked me to marry you.

124
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:59,016
I am sorry, Miss Kingsleigh,
but this is all that we can do for you.

125
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,520
No other company is in the business
of hiring female clerks.

126
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,106
Let alone ship's captains.

127
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,529
You can't do this.

128
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,865
I own 10% of the company.

129
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,742
Your father set those shares aside for me.

130
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,702
Correction.

131
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,621
He gave them to your mother...

132
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,624
who sold them to me a year ago,
while you were gone.

133
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,459
Along with the bond on the house.

134
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,211
Her house?

135
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,379
The bond we will redeem
against your ship.

136
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,591
But that was my father's ship.

137
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,218
Indeed.

138
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,763
Sign over the vessel...

139
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,641
and you will redeem the house.

140
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,184
Report to work Monday morning...

141
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,269
and you will receive a salary
and a pension.

142
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,897
And give up the Wonder?

143
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,400
Otherwise, we cannot help you.

144
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,402
Or your mother.

145
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:05,457
Alice.

146
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,335
Alice.

147
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:09,670
Alice!

148
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,129
How could you sell our shares?

149
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,007
Everything I do is for you, Alice.

150
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,634
So you can make a decent start in life.

151
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,345
Five minutes ago I was a sea captain.

152
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,013
A sea captain is no job for a lady.

153
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,433
Time is against you,
and you're being careless with it.

154
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:30,274
I once believed I could do as many as
six impossible things before breakfast.

155
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,068
That is a child's dream, Alice.

156
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,488
The Wonder is just a ship.

157
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,283
It's not just a ship.

158
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,659
It's Father's ship.

159
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,828
Everything he loved.

160
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,580
Everything I love.

161
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,956
He never would have let this happen.

162
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,499
Well, he's not here anymore!

163
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,088
You can't just make things
however you want them to be.

164
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,967
Every woman must face that, Alice.

165
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,135
I've had to.

166
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,471
Well, the last thing I want
is to end up like you.

167
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,406
Sign over the Wonder?

168
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,993
And give up on the impossible?

169
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,120
Then who will I be?

170
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,959
You're Alice, of course.

171
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,005
Absolem?

172
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,221
Absolem.

173
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,109
She had spent months up river.

174
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,779
Dressed like she'd gone native.

175
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,533
Of course, it's known to do strange things
to a man's mind, let alone a woman's.

176
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,868
-Wait!
-Just like her father.

177
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,829
A great man, no doubt,
but one touched in the head.

178
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,457
It appears the apple has not fallen
far from the tree.

179
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,564
Absolem.

180
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,588
Curious.

181
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,674
It's locked! Someone's in there.

182
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,342
-Who's in there?
-Who's in there?

183
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,386
You're trespassing!
This room is out of bounds!

184
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:05,888
Someone get the key!

185
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,602
Lord Ascot, there's someone
in your father's study.

186
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,458
Curiouser and curiouser.

187
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,157
Oh, no, not again!

188
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,086
All my horses. All my men. To the rescue.

189
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,300
All the pieces together first, chaps.

190
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,927
In a pile, over here.

191
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,763
How do I look? Tell me. I can take it.

192
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,557
He's not all he's cracked up to be.

193
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,100
He's a mere shell of a man.

194
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,978
Oh, please. You always make that joke.

195
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,187
Don't you mean "yolk"?

196
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,564
Get some new material.

197
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,982
I would be most grateful...

198
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,191
Sorry.

199
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,944
Clumsy as always, and twice as dim.

200
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,113
I thought you'd never get the idea.

201
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,989
Absolem.

202
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,907
Excuse me, young lady.
We'll be needing that.

203
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,701
You all disgust me.

204
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,370
You've been gone too long, Alice.

205
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,665
And he will be gone before long.

206
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:57,749
Who will be gone?

207
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,084
What has happened?

208
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,838
All will become clear
in the fullness of Time.

209
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,716
For now, hurry.

210
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,053
And do mind your step.

211
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,528
Hey!

212
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,755
-Alice.
-Oh, Alice.

213
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,633
Thank goodness you're finally here.

214
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,301
It's that girl again.

215
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:51,637
Alice.

216
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:52,763
You're back.

217
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,102
Don't be nice to her.

218
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,103
She's late.

219
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,897
Have I come at a bad time?

220
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:02,940
On the contrary.

221
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,775
We were afraid you weren't coming at all.

222
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,276
What's the matter?

223
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:07,819
The Hatter's the matter.

224
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,738
Or the matter of the Hatter.

225
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,490
-The former.
-No, the latter.

226
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:12,991
Tweedles?

227
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,119
He's mad.

228
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:18,247
The Hatter?

229
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,290
Yes, I know.

230
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,960
That's his muchness.

231
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,127
That's what makes him so...

232
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,588
him.

233
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,839
But he's grown darker...

234
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,049
less dafter.

235
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,467
Denies himself laughter.

236
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,847
And no scheme of ours
can raise any sort of smile.

237
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,393
We rather hoped you
might help us save him.

238
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:40,978
What happened?

239
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,480
There was a great storm.

240
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:48,151
We ventured out into the Tulgey Woods
to investigate.

241
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,198
Come, quadruped.

242
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:55,701
Fetch!

243
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,161
Your turn!

244
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,292
Fetch, doggy.

245
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,586
Hatter was perfectly hatterish.

246
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,880
Until...

247
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,258
that blue paper hat...

248
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,136
somehow put him in mind...

249
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:16,305
of his family's tragedy.

250
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,522
Slain by the Jabberwocky,
on Horunvendush Day...

251
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,733
many years ago.

252
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,027
He's just not himself anymore.

253
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:37,034
But, if anything could bring the Hatter
back, it would be seeing you again.

254
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,785
-Oh, yes.
-Indeed.

255
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,830
Well, where is he?

256
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,723
Go away!

257
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,558
You can't come in.

258
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,268
Hatter, it's me.

259
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:04,978
Alice.

260
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:09,525
Alice.

261
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,652
You're you.

262
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,570
And you're here.

263
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,785
You are you, aren't you?

264
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,663
Yes, Hatter.

265
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,582
Good.

266
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,919
You're the only one.

267
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,051
But you've always been Alice.

268
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,138
And that's how I know you'll believe me.

269
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:41,932
I've missed you, Hatter.

270
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,227
It's my family, Alice.

271
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,855
Your family?

272
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:49,815
Yes.

273
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,358
My family.

274
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,111
Lost for many years.

275
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,031
Or so I thought.

276
00:19:58,866 --> 00:19:59,950
Look.

277
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,244
I found this.

278
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,455
The first hat I ever made.

279
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,251
I thought I'd tossed it away
long, long ago.

280
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,713
It's impossible for it to be here,
and yet...

281
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,757
here it is.

282
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,094
So if this hat survived...

283
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,972
my family must have too.

284
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,224
But, Hatter, that's...

285
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,686
I thought I wasn't worthy of the
Hightopp name.

286
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,649
Very serious man, my father.

287
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,819
We had a terrible fight.

288
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,824
I never said I was sorry
when I had the chance.

289
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,412
But this means...

290
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,248
that I can make things right.

291
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:49,875
Hatter...

292
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,669
your family...

293
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,422
You...

294
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,675
do believe me, don't you, Alice?

295
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,678
I want to.

296
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,391
Hatter!

297
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,435
You're not well.

298
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,187
What can I do?

299
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:13,774
Of course.

300
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,236
My Alice...

301
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,197
could bring my family back to me.

302
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,699
Oh, but...

303
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,577
Hatter, the thing is...

304
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,413
your family died.

305
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,124
Long ago.

306
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,752
You told me so yourself.

307
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,423
No one can bring them back.

308
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,929
No one but you.

309
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,310
I'm sorry.

310
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:52,771
But it's...

311
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,651
It's impossible.

312
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,246
You...

313
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,415
are not you.

314
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:17,754
Hatter, please.

315
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,339
Get out.

316
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,260
I don't know who you are.

317
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:26,972
You're not my Alice.

318
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,767
My Alice would believe me.

319
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:38,942
Hatter!

320
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,446
Hatter, please!

321
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:44,448
Please!

322
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,707
We must do something.

323
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,876
He's so terribly ill.

324
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,462
I fear he's...

325
00:22:58,629 --> 00:22:59,630
dying.

326
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,131
Oh, dear.

327
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:02,466
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

328
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,634
No...

329
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,969
We can't lose him, Alice. We can't.

330
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,473
He said, to make him better,
I must bring his family back.

331
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,184
But that...

332
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,102
cannot be.

333
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,439
Unless it could.

334
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:18,941
What?

335
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,656
Unless there was a way.

336
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:28,283
No, no, no. You mustn't. You mustn't.

337
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:29,451
What is it?

338
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:32,287
It is dangerous. Perilous.
It is too much to ask!

339
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:33,830
What is it?

340
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,499
Alice.

341
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,877
You must travel back in time.

342
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:40,712
Oh, no.

343
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,465
Go back into the past and save
the Hatter's family.

344
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:46,051
If the Hatter's delusion is made true...

345
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,679
then he would be made well again.

346
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,848
Go back in time?

347
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:52,182
But how?

348
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:53,892
The Chronosphere.

349
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:55,853
I'm sorry, the Chrono-what?

350
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,020
The Chronosphere.

351
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:01,024
The source that powers
the Grand Clock of All Time.

352
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:05,988
Legend has, it also lets one travel
across the Ocean of time.

353
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:09,491
None of us can use it because
we've already been in the past.

354
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:12,494
And if your past self
sees your future self...

355
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,371
What happens?

356
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,915
There is no history of it happening.

357
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:18,542
But it is said that if it
were to happen...

358
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:21,461
everything would be history.

359
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,881
That sounds very dangerous.

360
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,133
It is. Extremely so.

361
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:30,387
Because you're not from here,
only you can use it, Alice.

362
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:31,930
It's not impossible...

363
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:33,265
merely...

364
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:34,933
un-possible.

365
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,852
Got ya!

366
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,607
Hatter is my truest friend.

367
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,610
If he's in need, I will help him.
No matter what.

368
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,070
Alice!

369
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:49,072
-So brave.
-I knew she'd help us.

370
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,700
Where exactly is this Chronosphere?

371
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:54,203
In the hands of Time. It's his.

372
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:58,582
I'm sorry. Time is a he?

373
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,631
He lives in a void of infinitude,
in a castle of eternity.

374
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:09,927
Through here,
one mile past the pendulum.

375
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:20,812
Very cold.

376
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,440
Find Time's castle,
borrow the Chronosphere...

377
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,275
travel back in time to
Horunvendush Day...

378
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:28,946
save the Hatter's family from being
killed, and thereby save the Hatter.

379
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:32,950
And do try not to break
the past, present, or future.

380
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,286
I was only trying to help.

381
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,121
What could go wrong?

382
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,140
Fairfarren, Alice.

383
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,101
Hatter's counting on you.

384
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:01,019
We all are.

385
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,733
Hello?

386
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,570
Anybody here?

387
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,424
Hello?

388
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,207
Stupid me-shaped corridor.

389
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,468
Will this day never end?

390
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,347
It clings to me like a pair of
sweaty pantaloons.

391
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,989
Who has stopped?

392
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:00,365
Who has ticked...

393
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,159
their last tock?

394
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,035
Tocked...

395
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,829
their last tick?

396
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:19,927
Brilliam...

397
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,471
Hinkle.

398
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,482
Brilliam Hinkle.

399
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,276
Your time is up.

400
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,124
Let's put you away, Mr. Hinkle...

401
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:55,003
...in the right place,
like alphabetical order.

402
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:00,801
Higgens.

403
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,470
Highbottom.

404
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:05,222
Not here yet.

405
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,558
Highturn.

406
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,726
Highview, Himmelby.

407
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,646
Hinkle.

408
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,064
I hope you were happy.

409
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:16,316
I hope you used your time well.

410
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,401
Good night.

411
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:23,407
Who is there?

412
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,450
I saw you.

413
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,494
How did you get in?

414
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:29,746
It is impossible.

415
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:32,624
Come out, you little, wriggling worm!

416
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:37,963
-It's a girl.
-Please, sir.

417
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:39,756
I'm sorry to disturb you...

418
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:41,967
but if I could
just have a moment of your time.

419
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,427
Time?

420
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,888
Young lady...

421
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,349
I am...

422
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:51,143
Time.

423
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:54,605
The infinite...

424
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,273
the eternal...

425
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:58,609
the immortal...

426
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,279
the immeasurable.

427
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,407
Unless you have a clock.

428
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:08,702
So, being Time...

429
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:11,246
I must give some of myself...

430
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,290
for you to have me.

431
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:15,375
Are you following what I'm saying?

432
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:16,293
Yes.

433
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,419
Really?

434
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,964
Do you promise to be concise?

435
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:22,633
Well, I can most...

436
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,635
Because if there's one thing
I do not like, it is...

437
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,554
people who are unable, unwilling, or...

438
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:34,895
uncompelled to form short sentences.

439
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,231
My friend is in mortal danger.

440
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:38,857
Enough of your incessant jabbering!

441
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:42,736
I have important work to do.

442
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:44,488
Please!

443
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:46,657
You haven't answered my question.

444
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:50,994
One minute.

445
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:54,748
Why do you carry that
fallen soldier in your pocket?

446
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:55,958
Reveal him now.

447
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,876
He is broken.

448
00:31:58,836 --> 00:31:59,837
Kaput.

449
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:01,880
It was my father's.
I would never part with it.

450
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:05,551
Everyone parts with everything
eventually, my dear.

451
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,183
Behold.

452
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:21,984
The magnificent Grand Clock of All Time.

453
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,823
He is me, and I am he...

454
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,577
and all that was or ever shall be.

455
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,996
I thought up that poem.

456
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,125
Now, remember. Look lively, everyone.

457
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,169
Wilkins!

458
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:41,712
Shoulders back, eyes forward.

459
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,548
How is my invincible machine?

460
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:45,716
-It's...
-Silence!

461
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,344
You will speak when you are spoken to.

462
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:50,888
-He was spoken to.
-Nonsense!

463
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:52,389
The machine, Wilkins.

464
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:54,016
How is it?

465
00:32:59,062 --> 00:32:59,855
Hello.

466
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:01,899
And who might you be?

467
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:05,652
These miniscule artisans are my Seconds.

468
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:07,112
Curious!

469
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,656
And I suppose every Second counts.

470
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,033
Count? I wish.

471
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,037
They are rather stupid.

472
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,337
That was rude of me.

473
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:24,546
I'm sorry.

474
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:35,015
I told you. Imbeciles.

475
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,225
Come on.

476
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:42,523
So, your question.

477
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,192
What is it? You have exactly one minute.

478
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:47,903
It's about the Hatter...

479
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,447
Tarrant Hightopp.
He's a great friend of mine.

480
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:53,534
And recently he's convinced that his
long-deceased family is still alive.

481
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,786
And, of course, his family cannot really
be alive...

482
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:57,579
because you see, the Jabberwocky killed
his family on the Horunvendush Day...

483
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:58,956
and I killed the Jabberwocky
on the Frabjous Day...

484
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,290
and I'd like your permission
to borrow the Chronosphere.

485
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:01,291
It is imperative that...

486
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,087
The Chronosphere.

487
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:06,797
That wasn't a minute.

488
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:08,215
You want to borrow it.

489
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:09,967
Loan it.

490
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:11,635
Purloin it.

491
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:13,554
Yes.

492
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:18,934
You ask...

493
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,063
to disintegrate history.

494
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,983
The Chronosphere powers the Grand Clock.

495
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:27,317
But I need it.

496
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:28,985
Without it,
the Hatter may never get better.

497
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,779
-And I have to...
-Wilkins!

498
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:32,489
Wilkins!

499
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:34,116
Stupid door.

500
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,576
Did you call, sir?

501
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:38,661
Wilkins, please remove this...

502
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,790
yellow-haired kindergartener, here.

503
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,333
Immediately, sir!

504
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,168
No interlopers!

505
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:46,837
Thank you for your you, sir.

506
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:48,839
Come along, come along.

507
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,257
My what?

508
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:52,426
For your Time.

509
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:54,803
Young lady...

510
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:57,681
you cannot change the past.

511
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:01,059
Though I dare say,
you might learn something from it.

512
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:05,689
Come on, you!

513
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:09,610
This next generation.

514
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:14,031
Now, back the way you came, miss.

515
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:15,866
All the way to the end.

516
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:22,289
Wilkins!

517
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:23,540
Yes, sir!

518
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,459
She's here! My liebchen is here!

519
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:26,627
Coming, sir!

520
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,921
Hurry! Quick!

521
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,844
All right. Here we go. Ding, ding!
Seconds out! Seconds out!

522
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:47,356
Get back.

523
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:49,066
Stay in line. Stay in line!

524
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:51,652
Your Highness.

525
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:52,736
Your Majesty!

526
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,863
Majesty!

527
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,741
My lord is expecting you in the parlor.

528
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:59,743
Shall I announce you?

529
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,080
Oh, no mind! I'll announce myself.

530
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:08,335
Tick Tock! Where are you?

531
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:11,505
Tick Tock! Where are you?

532
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,925
Tick Tock!

533
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,093
Coming, my love!

534
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:20,264
Present!

535
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,557
Of course.

536
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:27,604
My darling...

537
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:33,902
may I say that your head is looking
very, very big today.

538
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:44,496
I present you with a gift
made entirely out of love.

539
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,457
And also a little bit of metal and wood,
of course.

540
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:52,254
I know how you love the tiny things.

541
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:09,062
I'll treasure it forever.

542
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:12,357
Good!

543
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:20,365
Oh, dear.

544
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,388
The Chronosphere.

545
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,933
What troubles you, my dear?

546
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,644
You know what it is that I desire.

547
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,439
But, my love,
I have done so much for you already.

548
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,316
Yes, yes, that's all very well.

549
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:56,944
But don't you see?

550
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:58,570
That...

551
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:03,033
with my big brain...

552
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:04,743
and your...

553
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:06,995
little Chronosphere...

554
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:10,624
I could get even with my sister.

555
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:16,547
And we could rule the past, the present,
and the future.

556
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,435
You ask the impossible, my dear.

557
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:34,189
I cannot give you the Chronosphere.

558
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:36,233
You would if you loved me.

559
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,403
No one loves me.

560
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,946
No one fears me.

561
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:44,116
But I do love you.

562
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,284
Kiss?

563
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:46,493
Oh, no.

564
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,141
The Grand Clock!

565
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,020
Wilkins!

566
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:14,605
Right behind you, sir!

567
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,190
Tick Tock!

568
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,831
Seconds into Minutes.

569
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:54,770
Tick Tock!

570
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:57,356
Don't abandon me when I'm sulking!

571
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:26,510
What's the matter with you?

572
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:28,387
The Chronosphere.

573
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,225
Alice.

574
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:41,275
No!

575
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:42,693
Stop her!

576
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,033
Stop her, you imbeciles!

577
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,836
Which idiot labeled that?

578
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,254
You did, my lord.

579
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:04,423
Thank you for admitting your mistake.

580
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:07,092
Idiot!

581
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:09,303
How do I work this?

582
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:15,726
Halt! Stop!

583
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:22,399
Stop, you little mouse!

584
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:24,359
No. No!

585
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:57,267
How do I look? Tell me. I can take it.

586
00:41:57,434 --> 00:42:00,479
He's a mere shell of a man.

587
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,106
It's like a ship.

588
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:06,109
Dead ahead.

589
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:13,951
Come, quadruped. Fetch!

590
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,661
Hatter!

591
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,340
Don't worry, Hatter.

592
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,759
I'll save you and your family.

593
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:41,770
Alice?

594
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:46,817
The Alice?

595
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,530
Slayer of my Jabberbabywocky?

596
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:59,454
The very reason why I have been
banished from my kingdom?

597
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:01,707
That Alice?

598
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:03,166
Idiot!

599
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:07,629
I want her head!

600
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:16,013
Are you all right, sir?

601
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:17,890
It has begun.

602
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,350
Without the Chronosphere...

603
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:22,978
the Grand Clock will break down.

604
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,813
Time myself will stop...

605
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:27,691
and all in Underland will perish.

606
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:29,359
Did you say perish?

607
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:33,155
Wilkins, you must keep
the Grand Clock ticking.

608
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:34,865
Me? I said that out loud, didn't I?

609
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:37,201
I mean, of course, sir.

610
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:42,414
And I must find the kindergartner.

611
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:46,877
Oh, my goodness!

612
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:48,420
What's happening?

613
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,049
She must have the Chronosphere.

614
00:43:55,844 --> 00:44:00,182
Take care, dear Alice.
All our hopes fly with you.

615
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,070
Horunvendush Day!

616
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:32,840
You!

617
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:35,259
Give me what is mine!

618
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:36,760
Give it back...

619
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,471
or there will be none of me left.

620
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:43,934
Come back!

621
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:49,815
You cannot win in a race against Time.

622
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:53,110
I am inevitable!

623
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:49,333
Hatter?

624
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:52,586
Hatter?

625
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:55,839
It's you!

626
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,674
You're you again!

627
00:45:57,841 --> 00:45:59,510
Well, if I'm not, I wish I was.

628
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:02,971
-Have we met?
-Yes!

629
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,182
Well, no. I mean, not yet.

630
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:06,141
It's funny...

631
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:07,809
I feel like I should know you.

632
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,978
We have met once,
when I was younger.

633
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:11,647
I'm afraid I don't recall.

634
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:13,440
That's because it hasn't happened yet.

635
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:15,484
-When will it happen?
-Years from now.

636
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:16,985
When you're older.

637
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:20,072
I'll meet you when you're younger
and I'm older?

638
00:46:21,323 --> 00:46:23,033
I realize it doesn't make much sense.

639
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,952
Makes perfect sense to me.

640
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,119
I'm Tarrant.

641
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:27,704
I know. I'm Alice.

642
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:30,707
Alice, you seem to have time all mixed up.

643
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,042
He's not mixed up at all.

644
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:34,503
Actually he's quite angry with me.

645
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:37,381
You're bonkers, aren't you?

646
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:39,758
That's what I've been told.

647
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,385
All the best ones are.

648
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:46,807
Listen, I know it sounds strange,
but I need to find your family.

649
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:48,892
Oh, well, you're in luck. Right this way.

650
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:53,897
Wonderful!

651
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:55,899
Indeed.

652
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:08,745
Congratulations, dear Mirana,
on your coming of age.

653
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:11,748
And now...

654
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:13,208
the heir.

655
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:16,503
The crown for the Princess Iracebeth.

656
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:22,134
Ignorant peasants.

657
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:38,317
Quiet!

658
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:42,946
What are you doing, you idiot?

659
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:49,286
Put it on my head!

660
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,288
You're making me look stupid.

661
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:52,623
Get on with it!

662
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:56,460
You incompetent imbecile!

663
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:13,602
Silence!

664
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:16,855
The next person who laughs
will never laugh again!

665
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:20,651
Iracebeth, please!

666
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:23,487
However would you stop people
from laughing?

667
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:25,405
Put a bag on her head.

668
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:32,287
Put a bag on your head!

669
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:33,956
Put a bag on all of your heads!

670
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:36,667
Yes! We'll sew up your lips...

671
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:40,671
carve your tongues,
cut off your ears, off with you!

672
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,589
Just off, off, off with their...

673
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,591
Off with their...

674
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:45,843
Iracebeth, enough!

675
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:49,513
Iracebeth...

676
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:51,932
I had always hoped...

677
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:54,560
that you would one day show the necessary
qualities to become the queen...

678
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:56,019
you were born to be.

679
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:58,981
I realize now that day will never come.

680
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:02,401
People of Witzend...

681
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,986
upon my death...

682
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,029
my crown will pass...

683
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:10,075
to the Princess Mirana.

684
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:15,372
Father, no.

685
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:16,582
But that's not fair!

686
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,876
I'm the eldest!

687
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:22,379
You are unfit to rule, Iracebeth.

688
00:49:24,256 --> 00:49:25,507
I hate you.

689
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:33,015
I hate you all!

690
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:43,942
And I shall not ever forget you,
you sniggering Hightopps!

691
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:48,572
No, I shall wreak a terrible revenge!

692
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:52,743
Vile.

693
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:54,578
-Slow.
-Racie.

694
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:56,246
Don't "Racie" me!

695
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,123
You started it.

696
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:03,754
Why don't you tell them the truth?

697
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:10,802
I didn't think so.

698
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:13,639
No one loves me.

699
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:15,807
No one loves me!

700
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:17,142
-Racie.
-Iracebeth!

701
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:27,653
If you are to be a hatter
worthy of the Hightopp name...

702
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:32,199
you must be sane, sober, disciplined.

703
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:35,744
Everything you now are not!

704
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:39,331
All I did was laugh, Father.

705
00:50:39,748 --> 00:50:40,457
Couldn't help it.

706
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:43,168
Her head is rather voluminous.

707
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,963
You cost the princess her crown!

708
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:48,799
Do you know what this means to us?

709
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:50,425
Why am I never good enough for you?

710
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:54,096
Why are you always such a disappointment
to me?

711
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,517
There. You've said it.

712
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:01,812
You've said it, Father.

713
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:04,982
Well, if I'm such a disappointment...

714
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:08,777
I don't suppose you'll be sorry
if I leave home.

715
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:10,821
No.

716
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:12,489
Tarrant!

717
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:14,324
My hat please, Mom.

718
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:18,996
Tarrant.

719
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:23,458
-Zanik.
-No.

720
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:25,669
Please. Tell him to stay.

721
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:28,213
Zanik, please.

722
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:31,216
Tarrant.

723
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:33,969
Tarrant?

724
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:37,389
Hatter!

725
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:40,976
Hatter. Wait.

726
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:42,352
I am no hatter.

727
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:45,397
Of course you are. You're the Hatter.

728
00:51:45,564 --> 00:51:47,357
Or you will be at least when I knew you.

729
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:51,528
You should meet my friend Thackery.
He's nearly as mad as you.

730
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:53,739
-Won't you join us for some tea?
-Hatter, please.

731
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:55,616
You must go back to your family.

732
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:59,203
What do you know of my family?

733
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:00,454
They're in danger.

734
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:02,915
You have to warn them about
Horunvendush Day.

735
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:05,167
No idea what you're talking about.

736
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:09,546
But if my father sent you to
change my mind, you won't!

737
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:13,509
If you don't go now and reconcile,
you'll be sorry. I know you will.

738
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,261
Maybe later.

739
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,515
I lost my father.

740
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:23,060
And I miss him every day.

741
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:28,732
If you walk away now,
you will lose your father, too.

742
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:30,943
It's forever for me.

743
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:33,278
But it doesn't have to be forever for you.

744
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:36,823
You can still get him back,
and then you'll really be you again.

745
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,076
And a hatter just like him.

746
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,914
The last thing I want
is to end up like my father.

747
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:51,129
Tarrant, wait!

748
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:55,092
Your family will be lost and you will
have done nothing to stop it!

749
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:01,014
Fine. I'll warn them myself.

750
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:12,317
Mr. Hightopp.

751
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:15,612
If I could just have a
moment of your time...

752
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:17,781
there's something terribly important
you should know about.

753
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,324
Mr. Hightopp.

754
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,164
Our apologies.

755
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:28,959
You know of my sister's misfortune.

756
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:31,461
No apologies necessary, Your Highness.

757
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:35,966
All of Witzend laments the day
of your sister's accident.

758
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,303
Fell Day, as the clock struck 6.

759
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,640
I shall never forget that snowy night
when she hit her head in the town square.

760
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:46,310
She and I had...

761
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,149
That moment changed everything.

762
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,402
But if that moment never happened...

763
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:58,197
there'd be no Horunvendush Day.

764
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:00,365
Hatter would be saved!

765
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:04,703
Excuse me.

766
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,167
Who was that strange girl?

767
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:31,939
Oh, dear.

768
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:35,526
Don't worry, men. We can do this!

769
00:54:40,197 --> 00:54:42,199
Just not with him.

770
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:47,079
Cheer up, Tarrant.

771
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:49,915
We'll have fun now that you're
living here.

772
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:52,376
It's tea time!

773
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:56,588
Twinkle, twinkle little bat
How I wonder where you're at

774
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:58,966
Up above the...

775
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:22,239
Who's he?

776
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:25,450
Greetings, Underlings.

777
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:26,827
I am Time.

778
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:29,079
The infinite and immortal.

779
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,665
The personification of time itself.

780
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:35,752
I know you may find this concept
a little bit hard to digest...

781
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:38,505
but please keep your bewilderment brief
and to the point.

782
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:40,924
-Your Majesty.
-Nice to meet you, sir.

783
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:48,765
I seek a thief of meager intellect.

784
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:49,808
Her hair...

785
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:51,018
Yes?

786
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:52,269
Yellowish.

787
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:53,937
Her name...

788
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:55,814
Alice.

789
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:59,610
And what is your business with her?

790
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:01,320
She took something from me.

791
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:04,656
I will not say what it was.
It's not important.

792
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:06,033
It is a trifle.

793
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:08,619
I don't see why you are
making such a fuss.

794
00:56:10,162 --> 00:56:12,998
It is as nothing.
I must have it back.

795
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:14,791
But not that I'm concerned.

796
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:17,920
As soon as possible.

797
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:20,380
Either way, I'm fine with the outcome.

798
00:56:21,298 --> 00:56:23,884
Give it to me. Who knows about it?

799
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:34,311
Well, you are in luck, oh, timely one.

800
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:35,979
Because just today...

801
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:38,315
I invited Alice to tea.

802
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:40,526
-Wait. What's an Alice?
-Shush!

803
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:43,820
Why don't you have a seat...

804
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:45,739
and we can wait together.

805
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:47,824
There's no room at the table.

806
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,327
No room. No room.

807
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:52,663
Plenty of room.

808
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:54,998
Plenty of room.

809
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,209
-Tea for our guest.
-Tea time!

810
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:04,466
We're having such a lovely Time here.

811
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:08,178
Would ya like a scone?

812
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:10,180
Scone.

813
00:57:10,556 --> 00:57:12,015
-No.
-So...

814
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:17,020
if you are really Time itself, yourself,
or whatever suchness you claim...

815
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:18,230
Scone. Scone.

816
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:19,731
...perhaps you can answer me this.

817
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:24,027
I have always wondered when "soon" is.

818
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:28,991
If you vex me, it will be an eternity.

819
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:33,704
No! It's not fair! It's not fair!

820
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:45,883
He really reminds me of someone.

821
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:47,509
I can't think who.

822
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,888
I think he looks a little bit
like you, Brother.

823
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:53,891
Nonsense! He's hideous.

824
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:55,559
He looks more like you.

825
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:57,019
Come back!

826
00:57:57,728 --> 00:57:58,729
Hey, Tarrant.

827
00:57:59,062 --> 00:58:00,564
Tarrant. Watch this.

828
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:03,358
Now you see me. Now you...

829
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:06,028
Wait a moment. Wait a moment. Don't!

830
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:09,573
Where'd the cat go?

831
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:12,868
Gotcha!

832
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:15,370
Have at you.

833
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:17,456
Contrariwise, have at you.

834
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:27,758
It's nearly 6.

835
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:33,597
Hello.

836
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:35,849
You have a very nice head.

837
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:37,768
Thank you.

838
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:39,978
And a nice head deserves a very nice hat.

839
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:41,605
That's what my father says.

840
00:58:41,772 --> 00:58:43,941
He makes the best hats in Witzend.

841
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:46,109
Would you like him to make you one?

842
00:58:49,404 --> 00:58:51,490
Come on. He can make any hat.

843
00:58:51,657 --> 00:58:58,497
A bonnet or boater, dunce hat, fez, a
cloche, coif, snood, barboosh, or pugree.

844
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:04,670
You're eating all the tarts.

845
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:07,130
-You can have the crusts.
-I don't want the crusts.

846
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:08,298
If you can't get along...

847
00:59:08,715 --> 00:59:10,008
there'll be no more tarts
for either of you.

848
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:11,677
Now, out of my kitchen.

849
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:15,305
Scat!

850
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:22,980
Is it true that you heal all wounds?

851
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:25,148
Time is on my side.

852
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,985
And why is it you wait for no man?

853
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:30,195
I just can't find the Time.

854
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:32,823
Chessur.

855
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:34,366
Where have you been? You're late.

856
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:39,079
Actually, I'm right on Time.

857
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:43,542
I've got Time on my hand.

858
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:47,546
Do you silly nitwits...

859
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:51,341
really think that I have not heard these
cheap barbs before?

860
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:53,844
Your attempts at mockery fall flat.

861
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,346
Look. Time is flying.

862
00:59:56,513 --> 00:59:57,472
Enough!

863
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,059
No more wasting me.

864
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:03,604
I'm having the time of my life?

865
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:13,530
Father, look.
A customer with a lovely head...

866
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:15,616
right here.

867
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:20,829
What is the hat of your
heart's desire, madam?

868
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:22,122
Something...

869
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:23,582
feathery?

870
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:24,958
Something...

871
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:26,043
button-y?

872
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:29,421
Good afternoon, miss.

873
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:31,089
Good afternoon, sir.

874
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:36,261
The function of a hat is to
follow the proper dictum of society.

875
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:38,805
Not to be fun.

876
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:39,973
Father...

877
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,893
I have something fun.

878
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:46,605
What is it?

879
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,066
It's a hat.

880
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:51,068
Tarrant, you've got it on backwards.

881
01:00:52,778 --> 01:00:54,738
-Stop. You'll ruin it.
-Now, let me finish.

882
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:00,244
Oh, dear.

883
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,495
Oh, well.

884
01:01:02,037 --> 01:01:03,413
Tomorrow...

885
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:07,167
I'll show you precisely how to
make a proper hat.

886
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:15,259
Tarrant?

887
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:18,470
You're too hard on him, Zanik.

888
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:20,597
Hatting is a serious business.

889
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:25,435
I can't have his frivolous ideas
keep him from his true potential.

890
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:28,981
Now.

891
01:01:30,274 --> 01:01:31,441
Yes.

892
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:34,820
Yes, I think this hat will suit you...

893
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:39,783
-perfectly.
-Thank you ever so much, Mr. Hightopp.

894
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:41,743
Although, I really must be on my way.

895
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:43,745
Have a lovely evening.

896
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:53,630
Where is she?

897
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:23,035
What are you doing?

898
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:24,953
Nothing.

899
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:31,960
When is she coming?

900
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,550
Well...

901
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:42,012
I never actually said she was coming...

902
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:43,514
old bean.

903
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:45,849
I merely said I had invited her.

904
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:51,522
Very good. Very clever.

905
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:53,440
Well played, sir.

906
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:54,816
Well played.

907
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:56,151
Thank you.

908
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,987
You were asking me before
when "soon" is?

909
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:01,657
Let me try to explain when is now,
all right?

910
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:04,743
Now is...

911
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:08,413
exactly 1 minute till tea time.

912
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:12,543
And until the young Alice
joins you for tea...

913
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:16,588
it will always remain 1 minute
till tea time...

914
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:18,549
for you and your...

915
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:20,008
dunderheads.

916
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:22,010
Watch it.

917
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:25,055
Enjoy the present.

918
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:26,557
I've seen him
in his true light now, haven't I?

919
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:29,101
Time to go.

920
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:30,435
I must get the Chronosphere back.

921
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:32,855
She cannot be far away.

922
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:34,606
What a curious chap.

923
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:35,774
What a gentleman.

924
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,234
Bye bye.

925
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:43,115
I can't believe he just said that.

926
01:03:43,574 --> 01:03:44,658
Can you?

927
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:54,042
I can't believe he just said that.

928
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:56,461
What?

929
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,588
Can't bloody move.

930
01:03:57,754 --> 01:03:59,298
Wait! What's he done?

931
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:03,302
The blighter's stuck us all at
1 minute to tea time.

932
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:12,811
Tea time forever!

933
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:20,319
Here you are, little ants.

934
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,945
A nice new home.

935
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,830
What did I tell you two?

936
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:34,124
No more tarts.

937
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:35,501
I didn't eat any tarts.

938
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:39,880
Why are these crusts under your bed?

939
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:45,844
She put them there.

940
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:49,473
Did you, Mirana?

941
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,642
You did. Tell her!

942
01:04:52,476 --> 01:04:53,977
Tell the truth, Mirana.

943
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:56,939
Did you eat the tarts
and put the crusts there?

944
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,321
No.

945
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:07,157
But you did! You're lying!

946
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:10,035
The tarts are under your bed.

947
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:13,288
Don't blame your sister.

948
01:05:14,081 --> 01:05:16,625
No, it's not fair! It's not fair!

949
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:33,725
The stroke of 6!

950
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:44,862
The clock.

951
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:46,196
She'll hit her head!

952
01:06:06,216 --> 01:06:07,217
No!

953
01:06:12,598 --> 01:06:13,807
My head.

954
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:17,102
Stupid roses.

955
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:20,606
The princess.

956
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:22,065
Oh, no.

957
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,074
Is your head all right, miss?

958
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,118
Careful. It's swelling up.

959
01:06:34,244 --> 01:06:35,245
Oh, no.

960
01:06:36,288 --> 01:06:37,623
Iracebeth?

961
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:38,790
Iracebeth!

962
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:39,917
Where is she?

963
01:06:42,586 --> 01:06:43,921
My darling!

964
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:45,881
-Daddy, my head hurts.
-Arms around my neck.

965
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:51,803
Mirana!

966
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,473
Did you see that?

967
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,808
Yes. That's a nasty fall.

968
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:04,066
You cannot change the past.

969
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:06,652
Though I dare say,
you might learn something from it.

970
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:18,121
The first hat I ever made.

971
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:22,292
I thought I'd tossed it away
long, long ago.

972
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,795
He kept it.

973
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:28,090
It's impossible for it to be here,
and yet...

974
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:30,133
here it is.

975
01:07:30,676 --> 01:07:32,636
So if this hat survived...

976
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:34,805
then my family must have too.

977
01:07:35,305 --> 01:07:36,974
Higgens.

978
01:07:37,766 --> 01:07:39,434
Highbottom.

979
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:41,186
Not here yet.

980
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:42,980
No Hightopps.

981
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:46,984
They're alive.

982
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,652
They're alive!

983
01:07:53,866 --> 01:07:55,617
Your foolishness...

984
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:57,411
astounds me.

985
01:07:57,995 --> 01:08:02,207
You have no conception of how reckless...

986
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:04,960
you have been.

987
01:08:05,502 --> 01:08:07,546
The dangers that you have caused.

988
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:21,685
What are we going to do?

989
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:24,520
Quick! Where's the manual?
Who's got the manual?

990
01:08:42,538 --> 01:08:45,709
I need that Chronosphere now.

991
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,462
It must go back to the Grand Clock.

992
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:50,130
But Horunvendush Day.

993
01:08:50,296 --> 01:08:52,549
I'll only use it one more time.

994
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:55,426
I must find out what happened to the
Hightopps so I can rescue them.

995
01:08:55,969 --> 01:09:00,557
You will rescue no one.
Wherever you go, I will find you.

996
01:09:00,724 --> 01:09:03,435
The Grand Clock must not stop.

997
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:07,564
You cannot escape Time.

998
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:10,234
I'm sorry.

999
01:09:11,734 --> 01:09:13,403
But I must save Hatter.

1000
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:22,246
Alice! Alice!

1001
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:24,581
Come back with my Chronosphere...

1002
01:09:24,747 --> 01:09:26,500
It's the Kingsleigh girl.

1003
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,292
The girl's gone mad. Take her away.

1004
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,462
Strap her down, lads.

1005
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:34,174
Alice?

1006
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,926
Alice?

1007
01:09:39,846 --> 01:09:41,305
Alice?

1008
01:09:46,812 --> 01:09:47,770
Where am I?

1009
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,191
You're in an institution.

1010
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:52,776
How long have I been here?

1011
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:53,944
Not long.

1012
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:58,282
You were found in an
upstairs room at the Ascots'.

1013
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:01,034
Hamish had you brought here.

1014
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:03,745
You were behaving so strangely.

1015
01:10:10,169 --> 01:10:13,797
They say you were trying to
get under the furniture.

1016
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:15,966
Talking about the atmosphere?

1017
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:19,219
The Chronosphere!

1018
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,554
Hatter!

1019
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:21,847
Yes indeed, Miss Kingsleigh.

1020
01:10:22,431 --> 01:10:23,640
I've got to go back.

1021
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:25,017
Now, let's see.

1022
01:10:25,517 --> 01:10:26,351
Excitable...

1023
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:29,354
emotional, prone to fantasy.

1024
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,149
Textbook case of female hysteria.

1025
01:10:32,733 --> 01:10:35,110
Untreatable, some say.

1026
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:39,740
I beg to differ.

1027
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:41,825
But there's nothing wrong with me.

1028
01:10:42,326 --> 01:10:43,118
Lie back, Alice.

1029
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:44,661
Lie back.

1030
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,581
Dr. Bennet, is it really necessary?

1031
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,374
-Surely there must be some...
-Mr. Harris.

1032
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:51,460
I can't be here!

1033
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:53,378
Mr. Harris, if you could see
to Mrs. Kingsleigh.

1034
01:10:53,504 --> 01:10:54,254
I've got to go back!

1035
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:57,341
We have work to do.

1036
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:01,011
Never fear.
We'll have Alice fixed in no time.

1037
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:07,476
Where did I...

1038
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:17,319
Dr. Bennet, I really must object.

1039
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:20,113
Alice.

1040
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:22,991
Run!

1041
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:26,078
No!

1042
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:28,413
Don't let her get away! Hurry!

1043
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:00,904
If 3 years at sea
taught me anything...

1044
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:03,532
it's how to tie a bloody good knot.

1045
01:12:17,087 --> 01:12:17,796
Hey!

1046
01:12:18,255 --> 01:12:19,631
That's my cab!

1047
01:12:21,425 --> 01:12:22,092
You can't take that!

1048
01:12:22,259 --> 01:12:23,385
Sorry!

1049
01:12:23,844 --> 01:12:25,679
I plead insanity.

1050
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:43,071
Hold on, Hightopps.

1051
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:43,298
Hightopps!

1052
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:57,479
No!

1053
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:27,885
Revenge is mine.

1054
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:30,387
She took them.

1055
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:50,324
Next time.

1056
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,087
Hatter!

1057
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:06,715
Hatter!

1058
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:08,342
Your family, they're alive!

1059
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:30,572
He's barely ticking.

1060
01:15:31,281 --> 01:15:32,491
We fear you are too late.

1061
01:15:35,118 --> 01:15:36,119
Hatter!

1062
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,290
He's fading away.

1063
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:43,460
I can't bear to see him like this.

1064
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:48,298
Come, Mally.
Say your goodbyes, Alice.

1065
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:49,967
-Come on.
-Yeah.

1066
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:57,140
Please wake up, Hatter. Please.

1067
01:15:57,307 --> 01:15:58,600
Wake up.

1068
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:00,644
Please wake up.

1069
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:09,820
I know what this means now.

1070
01:16:10,654 --> 01:16:12,990
You made it for your father
when you were young.

1071
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:16,326
A token of your love which you
thought he threw away.

1072
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:18,787
But he kept it all those years.

1073
01:16:18,954 --> 01:16:20,289
He kept it.

1074
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:22,082
And now he needs your help.

1075
01:16:25,502 --> 01:16:27,462
I'm so sorry.

1076
01:16:27,629 --> 01:16:29,047
I thought it was impossible.

1077
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,012
I should have believed you.

1078
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:46,857
You believe me?

1079
01:16:54,573 --> 01:16:56,283
I'll always believe in you.

1080
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:07,211
It's you, isn't it?

1081
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:13,175
I'd know you anywhere.

1082
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:22,142
You're Alice.

1083
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:23,727
Hatter.

1084
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:26,730
I missed you so much.

1085
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:28,524
So have I, dear.

1086
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:34,571
But if my family's still alive...

1087
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:36,657
why have they not come home?

1088
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:38,450
Because they are being held captive...

1089
01:17:38,617 --> 01:17:41,286
by the only person cruel enough
to keep them locked up...

1090
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:42,913
all these years.

1091
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,385
Bloody Big Head.

1092
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:06,520
I'm going to find that Red Queen
and bring my family home.

1093
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:18,699
Hello!

1094
01:18:18,866 --> 01:18:19,992
What do you think, pets?

1095
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:24,204
Oh, dig, dig, dig. Work, work, work.

1096
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:28,876
Earthquake.

1097
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:42,472
Where the devil have you been?

1098
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:44,600
Where's Alice?

1099
01:18:44,975 --> 01:18:46,059
Where's my Chronosphere?

1100
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:51,106
She jumped into a looking glass.

1101
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:52,316
She's gone.

1102
01:18:52,482 --> 01:18:54,109
What? You let her get away?

1103
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:55,027
No.

1104
01:18:55,569 --> 01:18:57,738
I must find her.

1105
01:18:58,322 --> 01:19:00,157
-Where is she?
-How should I know where she is?

1106
01:19:00,324 --> 01:19:02,159
Because she is your enemy.

1107
01:19:02,743 --> 01:19:04,286
She muttered...

1108
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,371
an utterance about...

1109
01:19:06,997 --> 01:19:07,998
Hightopps.

1110
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:09,958
Hightopps.

1111
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:13,337
She said she was going to rescue them.

1112
01:19:13,837 --> 01:19:14,880
What could this mean?

1113
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:19,843
I know exactly what that means.

1114
01:19:23,013 --> 01:19:23,680
Guards!

1115
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:25,098
Seize him.

1116
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:29,811
You see, from now on, dearest...

1117
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:31,563
I'm in charge.

1118
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:39,404
I've fallen off!

1119
01:19:57,548 --> 01:19:59,258
Alice.

1120
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:01,385
Mirana.

1121
01:20:11,562 --> 01:20:14,273
My family's there. I know it!

1122
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:25,075
Good heavens!

1123
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:26,702
Which way is up?

1124
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:28,370
There's a lot of stairs.

1125
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:30,330
Is this where we...

1126
01:20:30,706 --> 01:20:31,206
Split up.

1127
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:33,417
We'll split up together.

1128
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:35,711
It is a very large castle.

1129
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:37,921
Perhaps if we don't split up...

1130
01:20:38,422 --> 01:20:39,506
Oh, dear.

1131
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:40,674
I'm out of breath already.

1132
01:20:40,841 --> 01:20:42,467
Mrs. Hightopp?

1133
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:46,430
Hightopps? Hightopps?

1134
01:20:47,139 --> 01:20:48,849
Zoinks!

1135
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:53,770
This one's locked.

1136
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:54,980
This one, too.

1137
01:21:00,194 --> 01:21:01,320
This is the last room.

1138
01:21:01,486 --> 01:21:03,030
They must be this way.

1139
01:21:03,447 --> 01:21:05,240
I just know it.

1140
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,708
Father? Mother?

1141
01:21:15,584 --> 01:21:17,127
Anyone?

1142
01:21:29,348 --> 01:21:30,349
They're not here?

1143
01:21:35,604 --> 01:21:36,897
They're not here.

1144
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:40,651
They're not here.

1145
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:48,617
But I was certain that they were here.
I could feel it.

1146
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:57,084
I'm so sorry.

1147
01:22:21,984 --> 01:22:23,068
Father!

1148
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:24,194
Mother!

1149
01:22:24,778 --> 01:22:26,321
Everyone, it's you!

1150
01:22:31,034 --> 01:22:34,037
Teeny-tiny you, but still you.

1151
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:49,928
Hello, Alice.

1152
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:54,183
Get it!

1153
01:22:56,977 --> 01:22:58,103
No!

1154
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:01,899
Thank you ever so much.

1155
01:23:04,026 --> 01:23:10,407
You have just delivered to me the most
powerful device in the entire universe.

1156
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:15,204
Along with your dearest friends.

1157
01:23:15,621 --> 01:23:19,249
And my dearest enemy.

1158
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:24,796
Racie!

1159
01:23:24,963 --> 01:23:25,964
Shut up!

1160
01:23:27,883 --> 01:23:30,344
I knew we should have stayed together.
Now look at us.

1161
01:23:30,928 --> 01:23:32,930
Stuck in a giant vegetable jail.

1162
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:39,269
What happened to you?

1163
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:47,361
Wait! Your Majesty, stop!

1164
01:23:47,528 --> 01:23:50,197
You cannot change the past.
Believe me, I have tried.

1165
01:23:50,781 --> 01:23:54,409
Oh, Alice, you always were an irksome,
slurvish, interrupting thing.

1166
01:23:54,952 --> 01:23:55,953
When I get back...

1167
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:58,664
I shall have the heads
of all your friends.

1168
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:01,166
And then I shall have your head.
Ta-ta.

1169
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,004
Come on.

1170
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:08,048
Don't let her see herself.

1171
01:24:08,632 --> 01:24:10,092
Or else she will destroy everything!

1172
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:23,647
I now recall why I don't like her.

1173
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:38,495
"How to Keep the Clock Going Yourself."

1174
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:40,038
Of course!

1175
01:24:40,706 --> 01:24:42,624
Seconds, Minutes...

1176
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:45,752
Proceed to 347!

1177
01:24:47,671 --> 01:24:49,339
It's time...

1178
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:53,635
for the Hour!

1179
01:25:10,235 --> 01:25:11,195
It's Time.

1180
01:25:12,112 --> 01:25:14,198
This is all my fault.

1181
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:15,866
I stole the Chronosphere.

1182
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:20,871
I think you may have to steal it again.

1183
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,590
She ate my schnozzle.

1184
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,178
"And my fingers..."

1185
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:37,763
"...and my elbow!"

1186
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:40,098
Thank you.

1187
01:25:40,724 --> 01:25:43,101
I think you look rather fetching
without your schnozzle.

1188
01:25:44,102 --> 01:25:45,938
Absolutely radishing.

1189
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:47,898
Stop it.

1190
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,566
What are we going to do?

1191
01:25:49,983 --> 01:25:51,068
Yeah, what's the plan?

1192
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:57,241
It's up to you now, Alice.

1193
01:25:59,743 --> 01:26:01,161
Take Time to his castle.

1194
01:26:01,578 --> 01:26:03,413
Hatter and I will retrieve
the Chronosphere...

1195
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,749
and restore order to the universe.
Do you understand?

1196
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:07,501
-Yes, of course!
-Got it.

1197
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:09,920
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

1198
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:20,430
Where are we?

1199
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:22,933
You know where we are.

1200
01:26:26,019 --> 01:26:27,729
Why are these crusts under your bed?

1201
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:31,733
She put them there.

1202
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:34,903
Did you, Mirana?

1203
01:26:35,654 --> 01:26:37,573
Did you, Mirana?

1204
01:26:38,282 --> 01:26:39,241
You did.

1205
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:40,868
Tell her!

1206
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:42,202
Tell the truth, Mirana.

1207
01:26:43,579 --> 01:26:45,831
Did you eat the tarts
and put the crusts there?

1208
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:50,878
-No.
-No.

1209
01:26:54,381 --> 01:26:55,883
-Racie, no!
-You're a liar!

1210
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,885
Liar! You're lying!

1211
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:21,742
This cannot be good.

1212
01:27:32,753 --> 01:27:33,879
We've got to go now!

1213
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:41,303
She has broken the past.

1214
01:27:41,845 --> 01:27:44,848
Only putting back the Chronosphere
can save us now!

1215
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:12,376
It's catching up.

1216
01:29:04,178 --> 01:29:05,387
Alice?

1217
01:29:05,554 --> 01:29:07,347
Hold on, everyone.

1218
01:29:07,764 --> 01:29:08,807
I don't wanna hold on!

1219
01:29:16,523 --> 01:29:17,858
The Chronosphere!

1220
01:29:18,525 --> 01:29:20,402
She brought it back!

1221
01:29:38,629 --> 01:29:39,838
Run, Alice!

1222
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,715
They might actually pull this off.

1223
01:29:44,092 --> 01:29:45,969
Follow me. This way.

1224
01:29:46,929 --> 01:29:48,388
I've got you, wee man.

1225
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:56,647
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Gotta save the Grand Clock.

1226
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:03,320
I won't leave you.

1227
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:13,413
Sir, sir! Hold on, sir! She's here!

1228
01:30:13,956 --> 01:30:16,875
The girl who tricked you
and made you look a complete idiot!

1229
01:30:27,511 --> 01:30:28,929
Alice!

1230
01:30:29,972 --> 01:30:30,889
Hatter!

1231
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:47,906
Goodbye, Brother.

1232
01:30:49,241 --> 01:30:50,367
Brother, goodbye.

1233
01:30:51,285 --> 01:30:54,705
I have cherished every moment
with all of you.

1234
01:30:58,041 --> 01:30:59,376
On guard!

1235
01:31:00,878 --> 01:31:01,920
Time's up.

1236
01:31:04,715 --> 01:31:06,258
She's not going to make it!

1237
01:31:06,717 --> 01:31:08,594
She needs more time, sir!

1238
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:13,557
I have not ticked my last tock yet!

1239
01:31:23,066 --> 01:31:24,109
It appears...

1240
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:26,695
that my invincible machine...

1241
01:31:29,406 --> 01:31:30,824
is in fact...

1242
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:33,035
vincible.

1243
01:32:53,824 --> 01:32:55,826
My goodness.

1244
01:33:07,337 --> 01:33:09,715
Did I miss anything?

1245
01:33:12,467 --> 01:33:13,719
Are you all right?

1246
01:33:15,512 --> 01:33:16,680
Yes.

1247
01:33:17,181 --> 01:33:18,140
Wilkins.

1248
01:33:18,307 --> 01:33:19,308
Wilkins!

1249
01:33:19,725 --> 01:33:21,518
-Wilkins!
-Yes, sir.

1250
01:33:22,436 --> 01:33:23,562
Oh! There you are.

1251
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:25,355
Stop standing around.

1252
01:33:25,856 --> 01:33:27,232
There is much to do.

1253
01:33:28,942 --> 01:33:30,402
You don't need a butler, do you, miss?

1254
01:33:31,278 --> 01:33:32,029
Wilkins!

1255
01:33:34,323 --> 01:33:36,575
They did it! They did it!

1256
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:40,037
Hooray, Alice! I always liked that girl.

1257
01:33:47,711 --> 01:33:49,421
Get off me!

1258
01:34:05,979 --> 01:34:11,151
Why does this always happen to me?

1259
01:34:21,203 --> 01:34:23,914
Why does no one love me?

1260
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:28,126
I love you, Racie.

1261
01:34:29,169 --> 01:34:30,504
No, you don't!

1262
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:36,093
This is all your fault.

1263
01:34:38,428 --> 01:34:39,388
I know.

1264
01:34:40,013 --> 01:34:42,724
I ate the tarts and I lied about it.

1265
01:34:42,891 --> 01:34:46,562
I should have just told the truth,
and none of this would have ever happened.

1266
01:34:47,437 --> 01:34:48,772
I'm so sorry.

1267
01:34:51,817 --> 01:34:54,319
If it's not too late...

1268
01:34:56,029 --> 01:34:58,073
please forgive me.

1269
01:35:03,203 --> 01:35:05,414
That's all I ever wanted to hear.

1270
01:35:07,457 --> 01:35:08,417
Really, it was.

1271
01:35:15,174 --> 01:35:16,675
Your Majesty...

1272
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:19,386
I do beg pardon for any intrusion.

1273
01:35:23,599 --> 01:35:24,892
My family find themselves...

1274
01:35:26,143 --> 01:35:27,769
in somewhat awkward circumstances.

1275
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:31,148
Of course.

1276
01:35:34,318 --> 01:35:35,819
I always liked tiny things.

1277
01:35:38,447 --> 01:35:40,032
Thank you.

1278
01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:47,456
Not too much now. Be careful.

1279
01:35:58,759 --> 01:36:01,553
Outstanding, my boy. Well done.

1280
01:36:02,638 --> 01:36:04,848
Oh, my family.

1281
01:36:06,183 --> 01:36:08,393
My dear family.

1282
01:36:08,977 --> 01:36:10,103
Mother.

1283
01:36:12,397 --> 01:36:14,650
You, Father.

1284
01:36:16,235 --> 01:36:18,820
You kept my blue hat.

1285
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:22,491
I make hats, Father.

1286
01:36:24,368 --> 01:36:25,536
I'm a hatter.

1287
01:36:26,411 --> 01:36:29,540
I always knew you were, my boy.

1288
01:36:43,971 --> 01:36:45,180
All is well.

1289
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:48,183
Yes?

1290
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:51,478
I know you tried to warn me.

1291
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:52,729
But I didn't listen.

1292
01:36:53,105 --> 01:36:54,982
I'm sorry.

1293
01:36:56,441 --> 01:36:58,485
I used to think Time was a thief...

1294
01:36:59,528 --> 01:37:01,113
stealing everything I loved.

1295
01:37:04,533 --> 01:37:07,411
But I see now that you
give before you take.

1296
01:37:07,911 --> 01:37:09,580
And every day is a gift.

1297
01:37:10,122 --> 01:37:13,083
Every hour, every minute, every second.

1298
01:37:19,089 --> 01:37:20,841
The fallen soldier.

1299
01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:22,634
I suppose you want me to fix it.

1300
01:37:23,677 --> 01:37:24,803
No.

1301
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:26,221
I want you to have it.

1302
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:33,812
He used to say the only thing
worth doing...

1303
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:35,105
was what we do for others.

1304
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,818
I think he would have liked you.

1305
01:37:43,906 --> 01:37:46,533
It is said that Time is a friend
to no man.

1306
01:37:49,077 --> 01:37:51,288
But I will remember you always.

1307
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:54,249
And please...

1308
01:37:55,292 --> 01:37:56,418
do not come back.

1309
01:38:03,634 --> 01:38:04,635
Alice.

1310
01:38:05,052 --> 01:38:05,928
Oh, Alice.

1311
01:38:06,053 --> 01:38:07,804
You simply must come and meet my family.

1312
01:38:08,263 --> 01:38:11,892
After all, you are the very person
who saved them, aren't you?

1313
01:38:12,392 --> 01:38:15,145
We're going to have so much fun together.

1314
01:38:25,572 --> 01:38:27,699
But, of course, you have
a family of your own...

1315
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:29,326
don't you?

1316
01:38:30,827 --> 01:38:33,747
Very important thing, a family.

1317
01:38:35,123 --> 01:38:36,834
You only get the one.

1318
01:38:38,669 --> 01:38:40,838
Oh, Hatter.

1319
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:42,923
I fear I may never see you again.

1320
01:38:46,009 --> 01:38:47,469
My dear Alice.

1321
01:38:52,683 --> 01:38:54,726
In the gardens of memory...

1322
01:38:57,521 --> 01:38:59,857
in the palace of dreams...

1323
01:39:01,233 --> 01:39:04,027
that is where you and I will meet.

1324
01:39:05,028 --> 01:39:07,322
But a dream is not reality.

1325
01:39:12,953 --> 01:39:15,873
Who's to say which is which?

1326
01:39:39,938 --> 01:39:41,523
You did it, Alice.

1327
01:39:42,065 --> 01:39:43,692
An impossible thing.

1328
01:39:44,526 --> 01:39:47,905
Not as impossible as
saying goodbye to you, my friends.

1329
01:39:52,743 --> 01:39:54,119
Goodbye, Hatter.

1330
01:40:05,214 --> 01:40:07,799
Goodbye, Alice.

1331
01:40:14,431 --> 01:40:16,934
Now, please.
The deed to your husband's ship.

1332
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:19,269
Just sign here...

1333
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:20,646
and the house is yours.

1334
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:31,448
Mr. Harcourt...

1335
01:40:31,907 --> 01:40:33,075
time is money.

1336
01:40:34,952 --> 01:40:36,954
I'm afraid he most certainly is not.

1337
01:40:38,038 --> 01:40:38,956
Alice!

1338
01:40:39,414 --> 01:40:42,459
Time is many things, Hamish,
but he isn't money.

1339
01:40:44,628 --> 01:40:45,879
Nor is he our enemy, Mother.

1340
01:40:47,756 --> 01:40:48,841
Where did you come from?

1341
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,718
I walked right through the walls.

1342
01:40:56,974 --> 01:40:59,935
I may not be able to change the past,
but I can learn from it.

1343
01:41:01,687 --> 01:41:02,938
Sign the papers, Mother.

1344
01:41:03,397 --> 01:41:04,815
You want me to sign them?

1345
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:13,657
But what about the Wonder?

1346
01:41:14,157 --> 01:41:16,159
It's just a ship. There's always another.

1347
01:41:17,828 --> 01:41:19,997
But you are my mother,
and I only have one.

1348
01:41:22,457 --> 01:41:23,792
So you've decided to be a clerk?

1349
01:41:26,128 --> 01:41:27,671
I knew that you would.

1350
01:41:28,088 --> 01:41:29,965
Headstrong or not.

1351
01:41:37,514 --> 01:41:39,183
You're not a nice man, Hamish.

1352
01:41:40,684 --> 01:41:42,686
I'm glad my daughter didn't marry you.

1353
01:41:47,024 --> 01:41:47,524
Mrs. Kingsleigh.

1354
01:41:47,858 --> 01:41:49,067
Mrs. Kingsleigh! No, you can't!

1355
01:41:49,484 --> 01:41:50,944
You can't! You can't!

1356
01:41:51,862 --> 01:41:54,323
Alice can do whatever Alice chooses.

1357
01:41:56,575 --> 01:41:58,243
And so can I.

1358
01:42:00,037 --> 01:42:00,996
Good day.

1359
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,462
Mother!

1360
01:42:25,395 --> 01:42:26,897
Higher.

1361
01:42:28,774 --> 01:42:30,275
Higher.

1362
01:42:32,236 --> 01:42:34,238
Perfect! Thank you, gentlemen.

1363
01:42:36,573 --> 01:42:38,659
We'll run the Ascots out of business
in a year.

1364
01:42:38,825 --> 01:42:39,910
Mother!

1365
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:46,792
A full cargo aboard, Captain.

1366
01:42:46,959 --> 01:42:49,586
Shall we commence with
Kingsleigh and Kingsleigh's maiden voyage?

1367
01:42:49,753 --> 01:42:52,756
Time and tide wait for no man,
Mr. Harcourt.

1368
01:42:52,923 --> 01:42:55,092
Or, indeed, woman.

1369
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:57,636
Captain aboard.

1370
01:42:57,803 --> 01:42:58,929
Full sail.

1371
01:52:43,722 --> 01:52:44,806
Time to go.
