1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,720
<i>Death is predestined.</i>

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,480
<i>How and when, no one knows.</i>

3
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,520
<i>Would it be a fall from the mountain?</i>

4
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,920
<i>Would it be in your sleep,</i>
<i>or death from drowning?</i>

5
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,840
<i>Be it in any form,</i>
<i>death is certain for all.</i>

6
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,560
<i>It's God's will.</i>

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,360
<i>Even I don't know</i>
<i>how I will meet my death.</i>

8
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,960
<i>You see, eventually,</i>
<i>everything fades away.</i>

9
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,320
<i>I moved here in 1997</i>
<i>after my retirement from the railways.</i>

10
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,320
<i>Back then, the population was sparse.</i>

11
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,160
<i>Now the place is overpopulated.</i>

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
<i>I met the family when I moved here.</i>

13
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,280
In 1997. we constructed
our houses together.

14
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,680
As neighbours, we got along very well.

15
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,400
What remains are the ruins.

16
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,160
Usually, their shop would open
between 5:00-5:30 a.m.

17
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,520
That's when the milkman
delivered the milk.

18
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,240
That day, their shop did not open.

19
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,480
Around 7:00 a.m., I went to my balcony

20
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,840
and saw someone
inquiring about buying milk.

21
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,680
So I wondered why
they were late in opening the shop.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,600
None of them picked up the phone,
it kept ringing.

23
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,440
This was rather unusual.

24
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,280
So I went downstairs to check.

25
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,680
I knocked on the door only to realize
that it was not locked from the inside.

26
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,800
I pushed the door and it opened.

27
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
At that moment, I panicked.

28
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,080
I climbed up the stairs…

29
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,320
My mother is old and is a light sleeper.

30
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,560
She had stepped out for a morning walk.

31
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,680
She came back from the street screaming.

32
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,680
I was still sleepy
after working all night.

33
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,200
In that state, I rushed to their house.

34
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,920
I stood there for two minutes
wondering whether it was real.

35
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,000
I asked my son to quickly get my phone
and called the police control room.

36
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,000
At around 7:35 a.m., I got a call
from the Burari station informing me

37
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,240
that a suicide had taken place in my beat.

38
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,520
You see, I grew up
in the same area, Sant Nagar.

39
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
Before becoming a police officer,
I was their neighbour first.

40
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,360
My seniors asked me
to go and check the scene.

41
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,520
Just as I entered the lane,

42
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
I saw men and women

43
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,560
running down the stairs,
crying hysterically.

44
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,560
I reached upstairs and saw…

45
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,360
nine people hanging
from an iron grill on the ceiling.

46
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,360
A tenth lady was hanging right opposite.

47
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,360
I found their mother in the other room
lying on the floor near the bed.

48
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,560
I could hear their dog,
tied on the roof, barking continuously.

49
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,720
The formation in which they were hanging
reminded me of a banyan tree,

50
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,760
like branches of the tree
suspended downwards.

51
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,760
They too were suspended,
in the same manner, by colorful scarves.

52
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
POLICE STATION, BURARI

53
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,000
Hello. Yes?

54
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,720
I am at the station.

55
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,120
There is a documentary being made
on my case. I'm busy with the shoot.

56
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,640
All right.

57
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,200
This is something
that's etched in my mind,

58
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,720
and till I die,
it is going to remain there.

59
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Early morning I was in the police station.

60
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,760
I was out patrolling
till 5:00 a.m. that morning.

61
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,320
I had told the duty officer
that I was tired and needed some rest.

62
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,600
He woke me up in a panic,
"Sir, this is very important."

63
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,960
I woke up.

64
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,680
Rajeev was on the phone
and he was beside himself.

65
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,200
"They're all hanging," he said.

66
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,120
I asked, "How many?"
He said, "I couldn't count."

67
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,720
How can one count "one, two, three,
four, five, six…" in that state of mind?

68
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,840
He said, "They're hanging in a line."

69
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,680
I asked him to seal the place.
"Don't allow anybody.."

70
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,520
"You stay there, I am coming."

71
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,480
<i>Everybody should rush to the spot.</i>

72
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,520
<i>I was still putting on my belt</i>
<i>as I jumped into my car.</i>

73
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,840
<i>I still remember entering</i>
<i>the scene of the crime.</i>

74
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,680
<i>Everybody is hanging.</i>

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,680
<i>Blindfolded. Hands bound.</i>

76
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,680
<i>From 12 to 13-year-olds</i>
<i>to 60 to 80-year-olds.</i>

77
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,880
<i>I don't think I have ever seen</i>
<i>such a scene, even in a movie.</i>

78
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,320
<i>I don't think anybody has seen</i>
<i>this kind of crime scene ever in his life.</i>

79
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,720
What's important is there was a family,

80
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,960
not an atypical family, mind you,

81
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,960
quite a typical family.

82
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,200
There were three generations
living under one roof.

83
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,440
The grandparents, the parents,
and the children.

84
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,360
And in a joint family, you see,
everyone's roles are kind of plotted,

85
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,480
and everybody falls in line.

86
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,640
All of them educated.

87
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,680
All of them high-functioning
social members.

88
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,040
People in the prime of their lives.

89
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
This was truly extraordinary.

90
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,520
The first question that comes
to a person's mind would be why?

91
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,840
Why did this incident happen?
Everybody wants to know why.

92
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,360
And the answer is not simple,
it's quite complex.

93
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,360
We certainly don't know
what's happening with our neighbours.

94
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,960
And we absolutely do not know
what's happening in our neighbourhood.

95
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,120
But every now and then
something comes along

96
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,760
that shakes the most hardened of us.

97
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,960
You know, it makes you go, "Oh, my God!"

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,120
If anyone wanted
to commit this kind of mass-killing,

99
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,440
killing 11 people, would require at least…

100
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,800
If we think that two people
were controlling one victim,

101
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,680
still we require 20. 30 people over here

102
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,760
The crime scene doesn't indicate
any disturbance of that sort.

103
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,160
Their ornaments were still on them.
So there is no indication of burglary.

104
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:41,040
And if indeed it was suicide,
why are they blindfolded and tied up?

105
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,280
Exactly, what is it?

106
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,560
Could someone have poisoned them
and then hung them?

107
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,920
Once murdered, then they could've
been hung to make it look like a suicide.

108
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,960
It was morning time.

109
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,920
Fifty to sixty people had
already gathered to buy milk.

110
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,200
-Their regular customers.
-Their regular customers.

111
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,560
They spread the news,
and it flared up in no time.

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,640
The Chief Minister of Delhi,
Shri Arvind Kejriwal is here

113
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,440
to visit the crime scene
and take stock of the situation.

114
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,200
What caused these 11 deaths?
Is this murder or suicide?

115
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,200
Securing the crime scene
became our top priority.

116
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,720
Our entire staff was on the road
controlling the crowds.

117
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,400
We placed barricades.

118
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,160
As we secured the lanes,
people took to the roofs.

119
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,960
They were trying
to get a view from the rooftop.

120
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,200
There was a lot of curiosity
around what had happened.

121
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,680
People were crowding windows and terraces,
hoping to get a view.

122
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,480
Just then, I got a call from my source.

123
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,800
He informed me that,

124
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,760
"11 people have been
found dead inside a house."

125
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,720
"They've been murdered!"

126
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,120
Finding 11 bodies together
in a city like Delhi was a big deal.

127
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,400
Why has this happened?
How? Who did it? And why?

128
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,600
There is a saying that crime reporters
are devoid of emotions,

129
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,800
just like police officers

130
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,000
who deal with dead bodies
and accidents every day.

131
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,320
They become emotionally dead.

132
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,640
I guess it is partly true for us.

133
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,400
But on that day, I was disturbed hearing

134
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,720
that a whole family was found dead.

135
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,240
Because I have never
come across such a case

136
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,200
ever since I started covering crime.

137
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,440
So, my first instinct was
that this could be fake news.

138
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,480
I was desperately trying
to get more information on the case,

139
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,040
but no one was answering my calls
because it was such a big case.

140
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,120
Meanwhile, I spoke
to my local police source.

141
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,320
They confirmed the story to be true.

142
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,080
I was the first one to break
the news in the Burari case.

143
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,080
I was the first one
to present this case to the world.

144
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,280
My tweet got rapidly retweeted.
Soon the news spread like wildfire.

145
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,000
Everybody rushed to Burari
to cover the story.

146
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,280
<i>11 bodies were found hanging</i>
<i>from a mesh in a residence in Burari.</i>

147
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,320
<i>Seven women and four men…</i>

148
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,440
By 8:30 a.m., every media channel
was at the scene.

149
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,480
<i>Delhi Police has never dealt</i>
<i>with a case like this before,</i>

150
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,320
<i>where 11 dead people</i>
<i>are found in the same house.</i>

151
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,000
It's definitely a race.

152
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,160
There's too much pressure
to be the first to break the news.

153
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,960
We were stuck in the crowd
since the police had blocked the access.

154
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,320
Based on the hearsay, we were
trying to put the pieces together.

155
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,320
Behind me, you can see
the senior police officials

156
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,080
who are still here at the spot.

157
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,600
Right now, we are at the top
and let me show you the top angle view.

158
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,440
Just then, we got a video

159
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,600
and it was a video of the crime scene
shot in the morning.

160
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,160
The police reached the scene
by 7:35. 7:40 a.m.

161
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,280
The video was already shot
and uploaded by then.

162
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,040
Someone from the crowd had shot it
and it had gone viral.

163
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,760
I received this video
on one of my WhatsApp groups.

164
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,600
It was spine-chilling.

165
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,280
It was such a horrifying video.

166
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,160
This entire video
was almost two minutes long.

167
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,040
No police is visible in that at all.

168
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,160
Someone from the crowd shot it
and made it viral.

169
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,240
Instructions were given that nobody should

170
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,600
air it on their channel

171
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,160
because it's brutal and disturbing.

172
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,080
After watching that video
we were all shaken up.

173
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,720
We couldn't believe this could happen.
It was so disturbing.

174
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,080
After watching that video
we needed no further confirmation.

175
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,000
The video verified the news for us.

176
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,000
<i>In a horrifying incident,</i>

177
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,840
<i>dead bodies of 11 members</i>
<i>of the same family,</i>

178
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,280
<i>seven women and four men,</i>

179
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,880
<i>were found in a house</i>
<i>in north Delhi's Burari area…</i>

180
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,720
<i>11 members of a family were found dead…</i>

181
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,960
<i>Big news now coming in from Burari, Delhi…</i>

182
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,760
<i>11 bodies found…</i>

183
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,760
<i>…the phone call came in</i>
<i>to the Delhi police control room…</i>

184
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,120
<i>11 people dead…</i>

185
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,320
<i>It's an exclusive…</i>

186
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,760
When this video and the visuals got out,

187
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,120
the gravity of the news spiralled.

188
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,920
On watching the video,
it looked like they had been murdered.

189
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
How could 11 people do this to themselves?

190
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,200
The public could not believe it
and people kept pouring in.

191
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,800
We must act responsibly in such cases.

192
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,080
While reporting, you have to be very sure.

193
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,840
Even a small error could cascade
into a massive law and order situation.

194
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,480
In these situations,
people tend to get agitated

195
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,160
and soon it turns destructive.

196
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,600
One person starts some bullshit
and it soon gets out of hand.

197
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,240
We need to calm the crowd,
make sure there are no riots.

198
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,240
Anti-social elements
are on the lookout for exposure.

199
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,640
In a short while,
the police will make a statement.

200
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,360
Senior officers reached the crime scene
within an hour.

201
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,400
We are not ruling out
any possibility for now.

202
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,440
We are investigating
from all possible angles. Thank you.

203
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,640
<i>At this point in time, what is happening</i>
<i>is that evidence is being gathered</i>

204
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,560
<i>and the forensic team</i>
<i>has also arrived here</i>

205
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,080
<i>in order to gather the evidence.</i>

206
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,840
By 9:30. FSL were there.
The whole team was there.

207
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,960
Biology, Physics, Chemistry.

208
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,040
FSL Photography.
Everybody, we wanted there.

209
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,440
All of the experts.

210
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,960
Each of them had the same reaction,
"What is this?"

211
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,600
"What is this?"

212
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,040
As we went from the ground floor
to the first floor,

213
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,840
we saw the bodies.

214
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,000
The first reaction was, "Oh, my God!"

215
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,480
We could not believe it.

216
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,160
It was very surprising and very cruel.

217
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,120
Because there were elders
and children there.

218
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,440
It was difficult to make sense of it.

219
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,880
Three generations of a family, hanging.

220
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,400
Our photography team started to document

221
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,920
each and everything.

222
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,040
We did not want to miss a single detail.

223
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,600
We marked the bodies.

224
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,880
One, two, three, four, in serial number.

225
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,880
Marking the bodies
was a really difficult task.

226
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,080
The hanging bodies
would move as we worked.

227
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,640
We had to negotiate our way
to mark the bodies.

228
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,640
This didn't feel
like a typical crime scene.

229
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,240
Something was off.

230
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,800
The nine people hanging together
looked like suicide, but still,

231
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,480
why the double knots? Why the blindfolds?

232
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,520
It's a mystery.

233
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,480
Along with the sarees,
the wires were also used as nooses.

234
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,000
Some had their hands tied, some didn't.

235
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,320
The woman who was hanging at a distance,

236
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,120
her legs were touching the ground.

237
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,040
The mother, 80 years old,
dead in another room.

238
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,320
Why is she in that position?

239
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,080
Again, the same queries.
Is it suicide, or is it murder?

240
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,880
The motive was yet to be known.
Why and how did this happen?

241
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,000
Suicide note is not there.

242
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,040
Because of all these things,
we could not leave out anything.

243
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,520
And we can't just rule it as suicide.

244
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,920
We needed every kind of clue,
whatever we could get.

245
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,680
We noticed a CCTV camera
just across the lane.

246
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,000
Immediately a team was deputed
to check the footage

247
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,720
right from the beginning.

248
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,680
From the previous evening

249
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,840
right up until 7:00-8:00 a.m.
the next morning,

250
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,440
scan through every moment,
don't skip anything.

251
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,120
To rule out the possibility
of an outsider's entry.

252
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,080
To ensure that there was
no outsider involved.

253
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,440
<i>Was it a case of mass murder</i>
<i>or mass suicide?</i>

254
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,720
<i>This is a question that has grappled</i>

255
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,680
<i>not just the people</i>
<i>from these by-lanes of Burari</i>

256
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,280
<i>but perhaps the entire nation.</i>

257
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,960
This is their house.

258
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,920
Right next door to us.
We often talked to them from here.

259
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,920
We live right next door.
We were close to them.

260
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,440
They were very harmonious people.

261
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,920
They were a close-knit family
of 11 members.

262
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,560
They were great neighbours.

263
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,600
I have a son who often
visited their shop downstairs,

264
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,240
they were all extremely fond of him.

265
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,720
He often called out to them
from the terrace.

266
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,560
My son misses them a lot.

267
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,920
As neighbours, we were very
fond of each other.

268
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,000
Actually, they had come from Tohana.

269
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,360
They used to do farming there.

270
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Earlier, they had one shop
and then later opened another one.

271
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,000
They opened a general store.

272
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,720
The younger one, Lalit,
had a plywood business.

273
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,360
They were doing well.

274
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,280
I worked for eight years
at the plywood store with Lalit.

275
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,800
I never saw the family
have even the smallest argument ever.

276
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,680
At home and outside,
no one even raised their voice ever.

277
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,720
They were religious people
who prayed at the temple twice a day.

278
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,040
They were generous.

279
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,440
If I ever forgot to bring lunch,
they would feed me.

280
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,120
They treated me like family.

281
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,760
When we moved here, we became a family.

282
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,760
We were together in sorrow and joy.

283
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
We used to attend
social functions together.

284
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,800
Our own families
got left behind in villages.

285
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,640
In the city, our neighbours
become our family.

286
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,560
My elder son was a bit older
than their sons.

287
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,360
They formed a deep friendship.

288
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,400
They would play outside
till 11:00 at night.

289
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,240
They hung out together.

290
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,080
They always greeted me with respect.
Always touched my feet.

291
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,160
I always wished
that my children were like them.

292
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,280
All three kids that studied with us
were intelligent.

293
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,520
I personally coached Neetu.

294
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,440
She was bold and always spoke her mind.

295
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,680
She was intelligent,
good with her studies.

296
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,560
They were brave girls
and intelligent ones.

297
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,600
Strong personalities. Without fear.

298
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,480
<i>Ever since I knew them,</i>
<i>they were called the Bhatia family.</i>

299
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,320
Narayani Devi… Her maiden name was Bhatia.

300
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,160
Narayani Aunty was friendly
and warm to all.

301
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,680
If you visited their house,
she'd host you with love and care.

302
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,400
The daughters-in-law, Savita, Tina,
both of them were very sweet.

303
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,720
Not just these two, the whole family
would go to any length to help.

304
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,520
They were there for us all the time.

305
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,360
We would even leave our children
in their care when we left town.

306
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,880
I was at the Chandni Chowk Gurudwara,
when she called me.

307
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,400
She said, "Come fast."

308
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,720
"There has been a tragedy
in Bhupi's house."

309
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,600
My initial feeling was that

310
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,520
it must be a burglary
since Priyanka was about to get married.

311
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,160
How could three generations
kill themselves together?

312
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,000
And to murder 11 people is inconceivable.

313
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,680
Since the whole family had perished,

314
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,600
all 11 of them,

315
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,360
and there were no eyewitnesses,

316
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,040
nobody to tell us what had happened.

317
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,840
Their dog was the sole surviving member
of that family.

318
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,960
I saw this breaking news on TV.

319
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,800
A family of 11 was found dead
due to hanging.

320
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,920
It struck me that there was a dog
constantly being shown

321
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,440
and no one seemed to care.

322
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,600
They were talking about everything
but the dog.

323
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,000
All the news channels,
they were all showing the dog.

324
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,680
It struck me that
I have to rescue that baby.

325
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,520
He's obviously in a lot of pain and trauma
and troubled by the blazing sun.

326
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,440
He was tied to the same grill
where the family was found hanging.

327
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,200
He had obviously been a silent witness
to the whole act, unable to stop them.

328
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,920
Because he's voiceless.

329
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,160
When we reached,
the police escorted us upstairs.

330
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,800
Tommy was very aggressive.

331
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,720
We couldn't control him at all.

332
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,600
So then we had to bring a dog catcher.

333
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,200
Tommy was the twelfth member
of that family.

334
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,600
If Tommy wasn't tied upstairs,

335
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,160
perhaps the family
could've been alive now.

336
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,880
Over here.

337
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,600
Let me show you.

338
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,800
A family member has arrived on the scene.

339
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,920
-As you can see--
-Move aside.

340
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,120
Look…

341
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,720
Don't create a spectacle.

342
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,920
Let them through.

343
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,440
As you can see, a family member is here.

344
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,280
They are all gone!

345
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,840
Do not make a scene!

346
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,080
They were God-like people.
Don't speculate.

347
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,000
Easy.

348
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,640
They were great people!

349
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,440
The first one to arrive
was the sister from Panipat. Sujata.

350
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,880
We had to ensure
that she didn't faint due to the shock.

351
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,200
First, we told her everything.
Then we consoled her.

352
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,760
We told her, "Life and death
is in God's hands."

353
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,680
"Something bad has taken place."

354
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,000
"Neither you nor I
can change what has happened."

355
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,680
We heard that they were simple
and religious people.

356
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,080
Yes. The neighbours can tell you.

357
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,600
They were all great people.
Ever so great people.

358
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,520
Their family is gripped with sorrow.

359
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,120
In no condition to talk.

360
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,680
And one can only hope,

361
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,960
that a thorough investigation
into this matter

362
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,840
will finally bring answers
to the family which has seen it all.

363
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,840
My elder brother informed us

364
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,600
that something terrible
had happened to our family in Delhi.

365
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,920
I asked him, "What has happened?"

366
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,520
He said that the entire family
was wiped out.

367
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,240
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

368
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,640
As I switched on the TV,
I saw the shocking news.

369
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,920
I was devastated.

370
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,400
We could not believe it.

371
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,760
But then we saw coverage
of the house and the location.

372
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,720
It got confirmed that this was our family.

373
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,440
It is our sister's family.

374
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,840
This is how we came to know.

375
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,880
She was always busy at work,
such was her nature.

376
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,920
For her, family came above all.
She kept the family together.

377
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,840
She was unique
in her selfless love for the family.

378
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,720
She never demanded anything from anyone.

379
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,320
We went to Rawatbhata

380
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,080
and after meeting Bhuvnesh,
we fixed the marriage.

381
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,800
After just three months
of being engaged they got married

382
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,600
They were leading
an honest and simple life.

383
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,520
No signs of struggle or conflict.

384
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,640
Why did it all happen, and how?
We know nothing.

385
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,000
We are clueless.

386
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,640
The men left that evening.
We ladies were left behind.

387
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
There is immense pain

388
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,480
and a deep emptiness in our hearts.

389
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,960
I doubt this will ever be filled.

390
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,360
Our family has lost their loving sister.

391
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,160
Our house has lost a daughter.

392
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,840
Our family has lost
such a nice son-in-law.

393
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,560
We lost our loving nieces and nephew.

394
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,880
Even future generations will never
be able to fill this void they have left.

395
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,280
I spoke to Tina that day itself.

396
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,280
She had called me
on the night of the incident.

397
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,960
I spoke to Lalit too.

398
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,080
We spoke for five minutes.

399
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,840
"Everything is fine with us.
How are things? Everything is good."

400
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,800
"We will talk in the morning."

401
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,160
After a girl is married, her brother,
her parents, her whole family,

402
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,080
we all worry about
how she is coping in her new house.

403
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,840
Hoping that she is happy.

404
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,640
But our family or me,

405
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,120
never had reason to worry about Tina.

406
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,480
Rarely do you get to see
such a perfectly paired couple.

407
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,760
They honoured each other's wishes always.

408
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,440
Their rapport was too good to be true.

409
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,840
This is Lalit and Tina.

410
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,080
Wedding poses.

411
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,240
"Made for each other."

412
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,960
It was painful
to see my mother deal with it.

413
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,280
There is good and evil in the world.
Both in equal measure.

414
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:00,560
I don't know what is the truth
and what are the lies?

415
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,200
<i>The big story in the national capital…</i>

416
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,680
<i>The survivors of the Burari family</i>
<i>have spoken out, they say,</i>

417
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,480
<i>"How could a family go from throwing</i>

418
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,400
<i>a big bash for their daughter</i>
<i>to mass suicide in 14 days?"</i>

419
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,840
<i>This is a case of suicide.</i>

420
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,320
<i>The second daughter, Sujata,</i>
<i>refuses such claims</i>

421
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,600
<i>and she says they were murdered.</i>

422
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,200
Lies are being peddled
against my family.

423
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,520
They are all lies.
It is a cooked-up story.

424
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,600
Sujata, the sister from Panipat
had already arrived,

425
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,160
and the situation
was growing from bad to worse.

426
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,160
They objected to our portrayal
of this incident as a mass suicide.

427
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,520
-What do you think happened?
-Someone has killed them all.

428
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,480
The police are trying
to suppress the truth.

429
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,640
They are definitely hiding something
to save themselves.

430
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,880
None of the relatives
were willing to accept

431
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,800
that this was a mass suicide.

432
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,880
The eldest son, Dinesh,
was living in Rajasthan at the time.

433
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,120
This is what he said.

434
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,880
My family was so bold
that I do not buy this theory.

435
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,280
The kids and my brothers were so bold.

436
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,440
I can't believe they would
do something like this.

437
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,760
They were not weak or helpless.

438
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,560
They had no idea
about the reality of the situation,

439
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,280
even they couldn't tell us
what had happened.

440
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,080
They were adamant that it was a murder
and we were misreporting it.

441
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,960
This news spread across the country
and we were accused of reporting lies.

442
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,520
"You are reporting what the police want."

443
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,680
We want justice!

444
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,200
Justice for the dead family!

445
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,880
We demand justice for the dead family!

446
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,160
-Hail Karni Sena!
-Hail Sena!

447
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,440
By then, some people started sloganeering.

448
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,360
They were shouting murder,
accusing the police.

449
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,920
Some members belonging to their community,
there's no point in naming them,

450
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,920
they have a social organization.

451
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,760
They arrived at the crime scene.

452
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,840
This is a lie.

453
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,440
They are trying to
wash their hands of their responsibility.

454
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,960
The police aren't accountable
even to the Delhi Government,

455
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,480
let alone to this poor family.

456
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,720
I declare that the family is not alone.
Karni Sena is with them.

457
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,720
Karni Sena reached the crime scene

458
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,480
and claimed that this family,

459
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,360
some of the deceased were their relatives.

460
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,640
Basically, they were
from Chittorgarh, Rajasthan.

461
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,400
They threatened to shake up
not just the city,

462
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,400
but the whole country
in their fight for justice.

463
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,360
We will do whatever it takes
to get justice for our family in Delhi.

464
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,200
What usually happens
in a conflicted case like this is,

465
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,880
the first person
we tend to blame is the police.

466
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,680
The crowds were getting out of hand.

467
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,800
We were prepared in case things got worse.

468
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,200
This is Delhi. We had to
get this under control.

469
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,840
They're mistaken if they think
they can bully the police.

470
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,760
The police are clearly trying
to dismiss the case.

471
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,360
We strongly demand a federal-CBI probe.
A case of murder must be registered.

472
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,200
"What's your demand," we asked.

473
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,920
We registered this as a murder case.

474
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,120
We don't think it is,
but still, we are doing it.

475
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,520
We are investigating.
We'll take care of every aspect.

476
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,640
You can see the FIR.

477
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,920
In that, we have explained
everything in detail.

478
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,280
Case registration isn't the end
of the investigation.

479
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,800
It is just the beginning
of the investigation.

480
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,800
<i>The latest on the multiple deaths</i>
<i>in Delhi's Burari area…</i>

481
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,520
<i>A murder case has been registered.</i>

482
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,400
<i>This, a day after 11 persons of one family</i>

483
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,320
<i>were found mysteriously dead</i>
<i>in their home in Delhi.</i>

484
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,600
Sometimes people presume
that the local police

485
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,120
will just want to hush up the case.

486
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,880
When the Crime Branch is there,
they're perceived to be efficient,

487
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,240
the case will be in good hands

488
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,000
and they will conduct
a thorough investigation.

489
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,160
Crime Branch specializes
in handling cases of sensitive nature.

490
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,880
In any crime, there's something
called a <i>mens rea.</i>

491
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,320
There has to be knowledge.
There has to be intention.

492
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,040
And there has to be
a motive behind a crime.

493
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,320
Why should they die?
And who should kill them? And for what?

494
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,200
From the Crime Branch side,
I was the first person to reach.

495
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,640
See, my reaction was not shock.
It was curiosity

496
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,640
because I've handled cases
of multiple murders before.

497
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,560
So my first instinct was,

498
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,120
this could be a hanging
after the crime has been committed.

499
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,480
I kept calling my team.

500
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,320
I specifically called for Satish.

501
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,200
He is not one of the best.
He is my best investigating officer.

502
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,040
<i>Cop portrayals in films</i>
<i>are sometimes positive</i>

503
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,680
<i>and sometimes negative.</i>

504
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,000
<i>We feel happy</i>
<i>when the portrayal is positive.</i>

505
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,840
<i>We put our heart and soul</i>
<i>into catching the culprit.</i>

506
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,200
<i>And when we solve the case, we are happy.</i>

507
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
<i>The moment I entered that house in Burari,</i>

508
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,720
the sight I saw when I climbed up
those stairs to the first floor,

509
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,280
I can never forget that sight.

510
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,360
I felt devastated.
I felt sick in my stomach.

511
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,680
We investigated the case
from all possible angles.

512
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,040
The plan was to rule out things
one by one.

513
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,440
We went around searching the house
very, very systematically.

514
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,040
There was nothing disturbed.
There was no forced entry.

515
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,040
There was milk in the refrigerator

516
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,880
and there were some traces
of food being taken.

517
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,640
If this was a homicide,
there would be some kind of struggle.

518
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,480
And it was almost
as if they were hanging in peace.

519
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,640
Between the second and the first floor,
this mesh was there.

520
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,400
It was covered.

521
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,360
I wondered if it could be moved?
It was very light.

522
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,600
It was made of fiberglass and wood.

523
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,480
And then I could see that the ligatures
were equidistant from each other.

524
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,120
It is like a Rubik's Cube, you know.

525
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,960
I thought this is too difficult to stage.

526
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,160
Further angles were revealed
in our investigation,

527
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,400
which we had to rule out.

528
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,360
Bhuvnesh, "Bhupi," tried to free himself.

529
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,880
One of his hands was free,
showing clear signs of struggle.

530
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,840
The kids couldn't struggle
as their feet were tightly bound.

531
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,800
Their hands were tied behind.

532
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,440
They used telephone wires
to ruthlessly bind them.

533
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,800
Even if they tried to free themselves,
they couldn't.

534
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,920
They had tape over their mouths and eyes.

535
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,720
Cotton stuffed in their ears.

536
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,120
Their mother…

537
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,520
she was found
lying by the side of her bed.

538
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Her body was half-turned.

539
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,880
And there was a scarf around her neck,
like everyone else.

540
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,960
And there was a belt.

541
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,040
On one side of her neck,
there were marks.

542
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,040
Spotted by both FSL and us.

543
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,880
They were of the same size as the belt,
but only on one side.

544
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,400
In hanging cases,
usually the marks go upwards like a V.

545
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,960
It was suspicious, to say the least.

546
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,360
The bodies were carefully
removed and numbered.

547
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,480
They were properly packed
before we shifted them to the mortuary.

548
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,240
And all this was done
despite the chaos outside.

549
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,760
Five thousand people around.
So many cameras were lurking.

550
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,680
We arranged for 11 ambulances.

551
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,960
Two men would carry the body,

552
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,840
one sat with the driver
to keep the route clear.

553
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,400
Two ambulances would reverse in the lane

554
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,960
because there wasn't enough space
to turn around.

555
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,480
They were parked
exactly in front of the stairs.

556
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,680
As the bodies were being lowered,

557
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,400
we made sure that each body
had the ligature intact.

558
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,720
And we packed them all in zip lock bags.

559
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,200
It was very painful to watch.
We couldn't help but get emotional.

560
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,160
How could something like this happen?

561
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,440
How could children hang like that?

562
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,600
It was the same story then,
and it remains the same today.

563
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,880
No one else dared to touch the bodies.

564
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,320
My colleagues and I

565
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,960
brought all the 11 bodies down,
one by one.

566
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,760
It was a mammoth task.

567
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,120
One ambulance would leave
and make way for the next one.

568
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,720
Covered from all sides.

569
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,520
In groups of two, we did this.

570
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,960
It took us two hours
to just shift the bodies.

571
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,400
We had to do this carefully
and bring them down one by one.

572
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,880
It was being telecast live.

573
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,680
The movement of the convoy
was closely followed.

574
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,880
In the beginning, those who
were exiting the crime scene

575
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,720
were sure that this was a murder.

576
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,280
A lot of police officers
who had been inside felt the same way.

577
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,720
The reason being

578
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,120
that everyone had their hands tied,

579
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,480
their mouths were gagged,
tied with telephone cables.

580
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,120
These were the big clues
pointing at murder.

581
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,400
How could 11 people do this to themselves?

582
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,960
Why would they do such a thing?

583
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,400
It was evident that
something strange had transpired.

584
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,560
We found evidence of a ritual
performed the night before.

585
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,520
There was something odd
in that crime scene.

586
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,560
As the investigation progressed,
some new revelations came to light.

587
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,960
The CCTV footage was a turning point.

588
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,200
That camera covered the exterior
of the crime scene house.

589
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,480
So we saw it all together.

590
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,960
Frame by frame,
so that we don't miss a thing.

591
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,200
On 28th June, 2018.

592
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,880
Tina, wife of Lalit,

593
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,480
and her son purchased four stools.

594
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,120
On the night of 30th June
when the main event took place,

595
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,000
at 9:40 p.m.,

596
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,440
Tina, wife of Lalit,

597
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,320
can be seen with another girl
carrying newly purchased stools.

598
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,920
At 10:29 p.m.

599
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,520
Lalit's son opens the plywood shop,

600
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,280
and brings a small bundle of wires.
He takes it upstairs.

601
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,760
We also found that the scarves
and sarees used for hanging

602
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,280
were purchased from the market.

603
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,440
The footage from that night

604
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,480
showed the movement
of only family members.

605
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,560
Nobody else entered the house after that.

606
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,280
That assured us that
no outsider was involved.

607
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,360
Now the question was,

608
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,560
"Is it an inside job?"
