1
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,560
As soon as we got there,

2
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,480
they all started
screaming and shouting with joy.

3
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,520
Priyanka asked if I had brought
the special Punjabi shoes for her.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,800
I said, "Yes!"
I had bought them especially for her.

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,880
I bought dresses for Pratibha
and dry fruits for the family.

6
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,320
Everyone was in a festive mood.

7
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,720
We celebrated and danced all night.

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,800
We didn't even realize how time passed.

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,560
All the musical arrangements
were made by Lalit.

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,160
He had set up the playlist on his phone
and when our turn came to perform,

11
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,000
the right song would play from his phone.

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,320
I started the dance
and one by one they all joined me.

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,760
After all,
we were celebrating Priyanka's engagement.

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,640
We were dancing in exactly the same place
where they were found hanging.

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,160
Who knew that in just ten days
this would happen?

16
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,520
It was beyond anyone's imagination.

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,400
"Autopsy" as such
means to see for yourself.

18
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
That is the examination of the bodies.

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,520
When I heard the news first,
that 11 deaths had happened,

20
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,800
I knew that it's going to be a long day.

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,040
The dead can't speak for themselves.

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
So we become like their spokespersons.

23
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,120
That we have to find out their truth
and bring it out in the open.

24
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,400
I think what we saw in this family
was an extreme version

25
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,320
of what we see
in families all over the world.

26
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,040
The family presents itself very often,

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,520
as this beautiful,
harmonious, intact "Indian family."

28
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,920
Families have secrets

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,920
and they can be preserved
at all sorts of costs.

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,120
The post-mortem started around 3:30 p.m.

31
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,240
11 bodies will take time.

32
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,200
Alongside, the media was snooping around,
hoping to get a lead.

33
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,800
Hoping to get a scoop from the mortuary.

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
Whatever is there, we are doing it.
Let the results come.

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,320
Were they sedated?

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,840
Was their food poisoned?
All these possibilities are there.

37
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,680
<i>Why was the door left open?</i>
<i>Ten bodies were found hanging.</i>

38
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,080
<i>But the body of the matriarch</i>
<i>was found head down, on the floor.</i>

39
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,440
<i>…and she was allegedly strangulated.</i>

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,040
Would you kill your mother?

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,800
Why would my family kill my mother?
Stop making false accusations!

42
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
<i>How could a family go from</i>
<i>throwing a big bash for their daughter</i>

43
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,320
<i>to mass suicide in 14 days?</i>

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,000
I was here with the family for five days.

45
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,640
I left on the 20th.

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
If they had to commit suicide

47
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,720
why would they spend about
Rs. 400.000 on the engagement?

48
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,320
Now, the actual cause of death

49
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,720
can only be verified
by the post-mortem reports.

50
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,720
<i>The police has transferred</i>
<i>the case to the Crime Branch.</i>

51
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
The biggest clue we found
was the CCTV footage.

52
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,440
The CCTV did not show
any outsider's entry in the house.

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,920
The footage from that night showed
movement of only the family members.

54
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,640
<i>11 members of a family</i>
<i>died here on Sunday.</i>

55
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,560
<i>But it now appears,</i>
<i>on the basis of new CCTV footage,</i>

56
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,360
<i>that this had methodically been planned.</i>

57
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,400
The house had four rooms.
We minutely checked every corner.

58
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,400
We didn't want to miss any detail.

59
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,640
We wanted to collect
every piece of evidence.

60
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,400
From just looking at the crime scene,
I knew something was up.

61
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,440
We found the remains of a ritual pyre.

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,560
The ash was very telling.

63
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,080
It suggested that
they did some ritual the night before.

64
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,000
Generally, in cases of suicide,

65
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,080
we search near the temple area
where people place suicide notes.

66
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,360
We did a thorough search
and we found a diary near the shrine.

67
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,760
We saw the diary and we read its contents.

68
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,560
Everything became clear to us.

69
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,200
We found another one in another room,

70
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,800
and then I made my team
comb the entire place.

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
Every room was checked at least ten times.

72
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,520
Ten times.

73
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,880
<i>In total, we found 11 diaries.</i>

74
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
<i>The earliest was dated 2007.</i>

75
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,520
<i>And the last was just before the incident.</i>

76
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,800
<i>11 years.</i>

77
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,320
The biggest problem
was that there was no witness,

78
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,280
no known offender, and no survivor.

79
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,720
In this situation,
the diaries proved to be

80
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,480
the most crucial evidence in this case.

81
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,720
You can see the Crime Branch officials
exiting the house.

82
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,880
They have found some documents and diaries

83
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,000
that they have discovered
from the scene of the crime.

84
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,600
The contents of these diaries
are being taken for verification.

85
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,240
Standing on a terrace,
we could see the police

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,560
<i>were carrying away some notes and diaries.</i>
<i>We watched this.</i>

87
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,320
What do the diaries say?
What are the handwritten notes?

88
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,000
Any idea what is written
in those handwritten documents?

89
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,320
I have some idea, but at this point
it will not be desirable to say anything.

90
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,360
How do we explain
something like this to our readers?

91
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,640
Because we were clueless
about what's written in those notes.

92
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,120
Are those notes related to this incident?

93
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,160
Are those notes responsible
for the 11 deaths?

94
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,960
<i>There was a lot of pressure</i>
<i>to be the first one to break the news.</i>

95
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,480
And some reporters were being pulled up
to find answers as soon as possible.

96
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,640
I was standing outside that house
and looking at it.

97
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,680
Suddenly, my eyes fell on the bare wall.

98
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,680
On that there were objects
that looked like dots.

99
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,840
I was at a distance,
so I took my phone out and zoomed in.

100
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,400
I was talking to my colleague
about the strange pipes on the wall,

101
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,360
wondering who would
place pipes like this in their house?

102
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,160
Just then a channel was reporting live.
They heard us.

103
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,400
Surprisingly, seven pipes
were facing downwards.

104
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,200
Four of them were straight.

105
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,360
Among the dead were seven females

106
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,799
and four males.

107
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,520
And the pattern of the pipes

108
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,440
was exactly the same
as the hanging bodies.

109
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,680
While we were still discussing this,

110
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,400
the other reporter
spoke about it on his live report.

111
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,520
Pipes, planning, and pattern.

112
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,600
<i>The pipes and the pattern</i>
<i>of the hanging bodies.</i>

113
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,240
11 pipes were seen protruding…

114
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,400
Were these pipes installed
to help the 11 souls escape?

115
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,600
Soon, the number 11
became a recurring theme in this case.

116
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,840
As you can see,
there are 11 bars on the grill.

117
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,200
And now we have found
11 windows and 11 vents.

118
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,600
This was my idea that the number 11
has some deep relevance in this case.

119
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,040
The pipes had no other meaning.

120
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,960
They were installed
for light and ventilation.

121
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,920
They asked me to put pipes

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,080
because they didn't want
to put windows facing another plot.

123
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,720
They shall be closed
when the neighbours construct their wall.

124
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,840
It didn't seem logical to us.

125
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,880
It didn't feel
like it was for ventilation.

126
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,880
Why would someone
put pipes for ventilation?

127
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,760
And how can bent pipes
be used for ventilation?

128
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,360
We put the pipes randomly.

129
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,640
I got hold of some old pipes,
some bent and some straight.

130
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,080
My workers were lazy.
They didn't bother to cut the bent pipes.

131
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
There is nothing more to it.

132
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,720
<i>The question remains,</i>
<i>why is everything in that house</i>

133
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,920
<i>numbered at 11?</i>

134
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,360
<i>In my opinion, this whole "11" thing</i>
<i>is just a coincidence.</i>

135
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,680
<i>There is absolutely no connection</i>

136
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,800
<i>between the pipes,</i>
<i>the numbers, and 11 people dying.</i>

137
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,880
<i>But again,</i>
<i>because the story was so intriguing,</i>

138
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,160
<i>that it was tough to understand.</i>

139
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,520
<i>Who were these people?</i>

140
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,160
<i>How could somebody as old as 14</i>
<i>agree to do something like this?</i>

141
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,440
<i>How could an educated girl</i>
<i>pursuing Master's in Commerce,</i>

142
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,720
<i>who's working with an MNC,</i>

143
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,080
<i>how could they agree</i>
<i>into doing something like this?</i>

144
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,760
They were doing what the diaries said.
This much I believe.

145
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,840
That they were absolutely abiding
by whatever was written

146
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,440
inside those diaries.

147
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,640
Once we found the diaries,
we started reading them.

148
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
And then, it took us a lot of time.

149
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,520
I read each and every word myself.

150
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,600
I just locked myself in the office
and I read it, at one go.

151
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,440
The language was instructional.

152
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,640
At times, scolding.

153
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,200
It was conversational.

154
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,000
And immediately we went to the last page.

155
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,240
And there it was.

156
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,720
Everything we found at the crime scene
was exactly as was written in the diaries.

157
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,560
They had documented the whole procedure.

158
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,960
They had written it about a week ago.

159
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,360
And they are talking about a ritual
which will run for the next seven days.

160
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,160
Which they called the "Badh Pooja."

161
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,800
Badh is a tree
which has roots hanging from the branches.

162
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,440
So the language
suggests that they have to behave

163
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,480
like the roots hanging from branches.

164
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,200
They even wrote the time.

165
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,480
It's supposed to happen
at about 1:00 in the morning.

166
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,000
"Perform the Badh ritual
for seven consecutive days."

167
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,720
"If somebody visits the home,
it has to be performed the next day."

168
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,200
"Nothing should be visible."

169
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,160
"Dim light should be used.
The eyes should be completely shut."

170
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,280
"The blindfold should be
properly tied on the eyes."

171
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,640
"The mouth should be
gagged by the handkerchief."

172
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,240
"The state of mind has to be zero."

173
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,480
"Nothing but infinity."

174
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,160
"While you are standing at attention,

175
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,440
imagine the branches of the tree
are wrapping themselves around you."

176
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,000
"Perform the Banyan tree ritual
with unity and determination."

177
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,200
"This will help repent for your mistakes."

178
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,200
I went to great lengths to get my hands
on some pages of the diaries.

179
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,160
I tried calling a few people,
but no one had any leads.

180
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:28,560
I was trying every angle
when I got a call from my source.

181
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,560
Those notes were terrifying.

182
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,520
I was going through each and every line
written in those notes.

183
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,160
Trying to understand
the intention and meaning behind them.

184
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,200
Since I had access to those notes,

185
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,480
I wanted to publish them
the very next day.

186
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,560
It was an exclusive.

187
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,360
It seemed like these notes
were written on a daily basis.

188
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,760
Every morning, each family member
used to check the diary

189
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,760
for their routine for that day.

190
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,360
What each of them is supposed to do,
who has defaulted.

191
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,600
"You all have to
perform a prayer tonight."

192
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,800
"Attend to Mother's needs in the morning."

193
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,160
There is a diary entry, December 24. 2017.

194
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,960
wherein, it's written,

195
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,400
"Dhruv is spending
too much time on the mobile phone."

196
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,320
"This must be corrected."

197
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,440
So even these kinds of little things
they have mentioned in those diaries.

198
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,960
The diaries actually tell them
how to conduct their life.

199
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,520
It was also filled
with weird and eerie details,

200
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,160
which hinted at
witchcraft and occult practices

201
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,720
and that this was responsible
for their deaths.

202
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,040
It seemed like
there was some other mystical energy,

203
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,280
that there was another presence
apart from these 11 people,

204
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,240
that was giving them directions,

205
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,080
"Do this. Do that."

206
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,960
The family was drowned
in superstitious beliefs.

207
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,920
This made us believe that

208
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,440
maybe they were advised by a tantrik
to perform such a ritual.

209
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,600
Sir, any involvement of a tantrik?

210
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,240
A guru of any sort?

211
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,960
Any seer involved?

212
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,920
The media was putting pressure
on the investigation.

213
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,480
The papers reported
about a tantrik's involvement.

214
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,200
Our seniors asked us
to look for a tantrik.

215
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,600
That's when the plumber's daughter
got dragged into it.

216
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,840
They interviewed her
and declared her the tantrik,

217
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,960
just because she dresses in red clothes.

218
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,000
Geeta Mata was the daughter
of the contractor

219
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,840
who was renovating Lalit's house.

220
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,880
The media hyped her
as the family's spiritual guru.

221
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,040
<i>Delhi Police Crime Branch</i>
<i>is questioning tantrik Geeta Mata</i>

222
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
<i>in the Burari death case.</i>

223
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,480
<i>Geeta has been arrested</i>
<i>from her house in Burari.</i>

224
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,880
I have nothing to do with this case.

225
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,040
That's all I have to say.
And I don't know anything else.

226
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,640
My father has five contracts at any time

227
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,480
and I don't meet everyone
that he works for.

228
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,840
The media is capable
of making a mountain out of a molehill.

229
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,240
They'll do anything
to create sensational news.

230
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,400
I was harassed for no reason.

231
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,200
The news showed my face

232
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,160
and spoke all sorts of rubbish about me.

233
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,080
I told the people from media this as well.

234
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,520
That I had no role in it at all.

235
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,160
My children starved for three days.

236
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,000
I was unable to cook food for them.
We were so tense.

237
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,520
And I was called for questioning
multiple times all over the city.

238
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,040
It is not a good thing
to trouble a decent person.

239
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,960
We looked for some person
with a religious, spiritual background

240
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,360
who might have
been in contact with the family.

241
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,080
Late night calls,
daily messages, something like that.

242
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,400
We did not find
a single person of that sort.

243
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,119
Not even one.

244
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,800
So then the second question was
who wrote the diaries?

245
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,280
In India, a typical joint family

246
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,560
is several generations
living under one roof

247
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,000
and there being
a head of household, a patriarch.

248
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,960
And all authority is derived from him.

249
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,480
But once the father dies
there's a vacuum in the family.

250
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,200
<i>The family was heavily influenced</i>
<i>by Bhopal Singh.</i>

251
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,320
<i>He was an authoritative figure.</i>

252
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,680
Bhopal Singh wasn't financially well-off.

253
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,600
Bhopal Singh came
to Narayani Devi's father,

254
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
asking for work.

255
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,560
Her father took a liking to Bhopal Singh
and found him to be honest and reliable.

256
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,240
So, he offered
his daughter's hand in marriage

257
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,560
and took Bhopal Singh
into the family and his home.

258
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,960
That's when Bhopal Singh
took on the surname "Bhatia."

259
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,040
He dropped
his earlier surname "Chundawat."

260
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,600
After his death, things started changing.

261
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,720
When he was alive,
he was the head of the family.

262
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,040
He used to guide the whole family
down to planning the children's education.

263
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,160
How to manage the savings and expand
the business. He made all decisions.

264
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,840
When the father passed away,

265
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,080
the family wondered who will take over
as the head of family?

266
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,960
From 1988 to 2018. 30 years of friendship.

267
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,120
They moved to Delhi in the '90s.
Before that they lived in Tohana.

268
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,000
In Delhi they started from scratch.

269
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,640
From that time to today, we would
go to Delhi only because of them.

270
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,680
The eldest brother
lived away from the family, in Kota.

271
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,160
Dinesh, that's his name.

272
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,920
The middle one, Bhuvnesh,
was very reserved.

273
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,640
He'd leave for work in the morning,
come back at night.

274
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Although he was the youngest,
everyone would listen to Lalit.

275
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
It was because
he was mature beyond his years.

276
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,960
So everyone looked up to him.

277
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,960
I was confused about why he was so mature
despite being so young.

278
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,320
He took care of everyone.

279
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,640
From his mother down to the children.

280
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,800
He successfully filled the void
that his father's death left behind.

281
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,400
The family considered his word as final.

282
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,120
Lalit was Chander's friend
even before our marriage.

283
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,760
I really liked him.
He was like an elder brother to me.

284
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,520
I would look up to him
for guidance on everything.

285
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,600
He would say,
"Don't mind Chander's anger."

286
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,080
"He's been like this since the beginning."

287
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,040
When they would sit with each other,

288
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,320
they would crack up
with jokes all of the time.

289
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,760
They were just like us,
the average middle-class family.

290
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,960
She isn't permitted to go out
without my father's consent.

291
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
She needs his consent.

292
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Even though we know he will never say no.

293
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,120
But the veto power is with my father.

294
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,880
That's why it's been 25 years,
no fights between us.

295
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,160
So far, no fights.

296
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,000
All of them listened to Lalit.

297
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,080
Whatever he said was obeyed by all.

298
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,520
Even during festivals we used to see

299
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,800
Lalit was leading the festivities.

300
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,480
None of the kids would even light up
a fire cracker in Lalit's absence.

301
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,080
We moved here around '97-'98.

302
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,800
In the beginning years,
we didn't observe this kind of behaviour.

303
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,760
I wonder why everything changed
only after his father's death.

304
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,880
We don't know about their relationship
when Bhopal Singh was alive.

305
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,240
But after his death,
Lalit's attachment to his father

306
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,680
became stronger.

307
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,520
First entry according to my notes
is September 2007.

308
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,960
Right after Bhopal Singh's death.

309
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,080
Most of the things mentioned
in the diary were related to Lalit.

310
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,640
"You all are making Lalit very anxious."

311
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,880
"Follow Lalit's instructions
or else the outcome will be disastrous."

312
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,560
"If you want solutions to your problems

313
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,400
then you must
follow Lalit's instructions."

314
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,920
As the police found more diaries,
more details came to the front.

315
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,440
That's when we discovered that since 2007.

316
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,920
Lalit was being visited
by his dead father in his dreams.

317
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,400
He was having conversations
with his dead father,

318
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,080
following everything his father told him.

319
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,640
And slowly, he started sharing
these instructions with the family.

320
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,320
Neetu had told her neighbours

321
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,800
that her uncle was possessed
by their grandfather's spirit.

322
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,840
The spirit guides the family.

323
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,720
Whenever Lalit was possessed,
his voice would change.

324
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,400
The voice that he spoke in
was the father's voice.

325
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,480
That must have been a moment,
which I think did something to everyone.

326
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,160
He became a medium
for the spirit of his father

327
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,720
and he would speak
and behave like his father.

328
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Even though Narayani Devi
was Lalit's mother,

329
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,560
he addressed her as "Narayani."

330
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,320
Just the way
Uncle Bhopal used to address her.

331
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,960
Lalit was being possessed
by his father's spirit.

332
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,120
And whatever Lalit wrote

333
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,240
was assumed to be instructions
for the family from the dead father.

334
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,720
<i>After I leave,</i>
<i>all of you must go to sleep.</i>

335
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,840
<i>No need for discussions.</i>

336
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,720
<i>My visitations are not</i>
<i>an ordinary occurrence.</i>

337
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,680
<i>You must not take God's will lightly.</i>

338
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,680
<i>Don't worry about Lalit's health.</i>

339
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,520
<i>My visits affect him physically.</i>

340
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,800
<i>Sleep will heal him.</i>

341
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,840
Pay attention to this line from the diary,

342
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,960
"Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday,
I will be back."

343
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
<i>Instead of your own will,</i>
<i>follow the will of the diaries.</i>

344
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,680
<i>Don't think, "What is the use?"</i>

345
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,640
<i>When it actually happens</i>
<i>your eyes will open.</i>

346
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,800
<i>My next visit will be</i>
<i>on Thursday or Saturday.</i>

347
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,880
<i>Be fully ready.</i>

348
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,640
The language that Lalit was using,

349
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,880
he wasn't saying that,
"I'm saying you should do this."

350
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,120
It's like, the father has said
that Lalit should do this.

351
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,360
Now the father is dead.

352
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,320
So in some ways a dead person…

353
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,960
You know it's kind of ironical,
that somehow a dead person

354
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,280
demands more authority
and commands more respect from the family.

355
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,160
So here is nine, ten people in the family

356
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,080
ready to listen to Lalit,
which are the instructions of the father.

357
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,240
I never felt like
Savita had any interests of her own.

358
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,320
All she ever did was to manage the kitchen
morning to night.

359
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,440
We wondered why the poor woman
was always in the kitchen.

360
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,440
I think the diaries
dictated this role to her.

361
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,200
<i>Savita has not been able to come to terms</i>
<i>with her role in the kitchen.</i>

362
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,640
<i>She must put an end</i>
<i>to her temper tantrums.</i>

363
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,120
<i>Be mindful of your mother's age and needs.</i>

364
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,520
<i>If you are able</i>
<i>to keep your parents happy,</i>

365
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,160
<i>you are serving God's wishes.</i>

366
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,760
<i>Savita and Tina must improve</i>
<i>their relationship with Pratibha.</i>

367
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,440
<i>Make her feel loved.</i>

368
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,840
<i>Bhuvnesh, be careful!</i>

369
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,760
<i>Doom will enter the house</i>
<i>in the guise of alcohol.</i>

370
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,360
<i>The lack of harmony</i>
<i>between Priyanka and Neetu</i>

371
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,200
<i>creates obstructions at various levels.</i>

372
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,160
<i>You all must emulate Lalit and Tina's</i>
<i>values and behaviour.</i>

373
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,960
Lalit's wife, Tina, was very good-natured.

374
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:16,040
But since Lalit had taken over
as head of the family,

375
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,600
Tina stood to benefit from that.

376
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,320
Life can be difficult
for a daughter-in-law.

377
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,560
Whatever Lalit said,
Tina would second that.

378
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,440
They were two bodies but one soul.

379
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,040
So she must have encouraged him,

380
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,160
since it was beneficial to her.

381
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,440
It's most shocking to know about Tina.
She held a master's degree in Sociology.

382
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,000
Yet, she supported him?

383
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,280
<i>All your present gains</i>
<i>are thanks to Lalit and Tina's efforts.</i>

384
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,560
<i>Every small mistake you make</i>

385
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,000
<i>has an effect</i>
<i>on Lalit and Tina's well-being.</i>

386
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,280
<i>To protect Lalit and Tina, you all</i>
<i>will be put through a test till Diwali.</i>

387
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,360
11 years is a long time.

388
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,520
Did he get any opposition
from his family members?

389
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,040
Was he challenged by anybody?
Did anybody make an effort to get away?

390
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Clearly not.

391
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,360
It takes two to play a game.

392
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,000
You have to have people who will say,

393
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,880
"Okay, I am willing to be controlled."

394
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,720
The day this case was registered,

395
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,040
the police submitted
eight to ten diaries in question

396
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,000
along with personal diaries
of family members.

397
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Our job was to find
if the handwriting matched

398
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,360
the writing in the personal diaries.

399
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,480
We felt that it must be Lalit
who was writing those notes.

400
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,480
But the forensic report prepared
by the handwriting expert

401
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,360
revealed that
Pratibha's daughter, Priyanka,

402
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,880
and Bhuvnesh's daughter, Neetu,
used to write these notes.

403
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,760
This came as quite a shock,
that on Lalit's instructions,

404
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,000
these new age girls were taking notes.
They were so influenced by him.

405
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,840
Not a single member of the family
spoke about this to anyone outside.

406
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,680
This was the amount of control.

407
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,080
You can call it faith or belief.
Or even fear.

408
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
But this is how it was.

409
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,720
Earlier, they were just managing
to survive financially

410
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,320
but after Daddy's death,
when they started these rituals,

411
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,560
life started looking up for them.

412
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,240
They thought they were prospering.
They opened a new shop.

413
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,720
Priyanka got a job.

414
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,680
They all began to do well and settle down.

415
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,480
They believed that all this prosperity
was coming to them

416
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,920
because they were
following Daddy's instructions.

417
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,760
Whatever he said bore good results.
They began making profits.

418
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,480
Then, their financial position
also became better.

419
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,400
He even took credit
for the girl's marriage that was arranged.

420
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,840
"All these good things are happening
because you're following the diaries."

421
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,080
We all attended Priyanka's engagement.

422
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,200
Our whole family went.

423
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,440
The family made elaborate arrangements
as you can see in the video.

424
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,440
The children prepared for days.

425
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,560
They rehearsed the dance
with a professional choreographer.

426
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,360
Based on Priyanka's Facebook profile
and police investigation,

427
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,360
we have come to know that

428
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,080
she was working as a senior executive
in a multi-national company.

429
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,960
She had graduated
from University of Delhi.

430
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,240
When I had spoken
to an official in her office,

431
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,040
he said that she used to
maintain her distance.

432
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,400
In fact, from what I was told,

433
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,560
she had not told
about her engagement in office at all.

434
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,680
The girls were like goddesses,
so pure and good-hearted.

435
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,840
What was their fault?

436
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,640
My heart pains every time
I think about those kids.

437
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
This was their time to enjoy life.

438
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,640
<i>Do not disobey</i>
<i>my instructions in the diaries.</i>

439
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,680
<i>Despite making mistakes,</i>
<i>you come here in the evening</i>

440
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,600
<i>and claim to have made no mistakes.</i>

441
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,920
<i>Do not forget that the vibrations</i>
<i>of your old mistakes never end.</i>

442
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,360
<i>They follow you.</i>

443
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,160
<i>If you continue</i>
<i>to disregard God's warnings,</i>

444
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,080
<i>God might summon you in person.</i>

445
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,440
These are very educated children.

446
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,080
They are young.

447
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,360
They are at an age group
when they should be asking questions.

448
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,360
Especially the younger generation.
They are, at the face of it, "modern."

449
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,760
I don't feel I know

450
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,560
how the multiplicity of voices
which is usually there in human beings,

451
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,440
how it could have been
so completely silenced?

452
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,040
<i>Let's in fact begin</i>
<i>with some breaking news.</i>

453
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,680
<i>The post-mortem report has now confirmed</i>

454
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,640
<i>that the ten deaths</i>
<i>of the family members were due to hanging.</i>

455
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,120
<i>The post-mortem report</i>
<i>of the oldest family member,</i>

456
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,560
<i>the grandmother, however,</i>
<i>is yet to be released.</i>

457
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,880
Emotions actually take a back seat
whenever we are dealing with dead bodies.

458
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,960
Because we have to look at it
very technically.

459
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
The grandmother, the eldest member,

460
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,440
hers was a case of "partial hanging."

461
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,840
She was found lying
by the side of her bed.

462
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,920
There was a wardrobe next to her.
The scarf was tied to its handle.

463
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,040
When we read the diaries,
this was all explained.

464
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,800
Since mother is old and overweight,

465
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,400
she will not be able to perform the ritual
standing on a stool like others.

466
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
She will do the ritual lying down.

467
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,120
I don't know if Narayani Devi was forced
or if she was easily convinced?

468
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,560
The grandmother
did have some injury marks.

469
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,480
That could happen if she had been
gripped very tightly by someone.

470
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,680
It was very difficult for us to understand
because it was really unusual, this case.

471
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,960
They all had masking,
padding, blindfolding.

472
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,400
That was common. Ear plugs.

473
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,320
There was gagging with a handkerchief.

474
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,560
One of the children, the boys.

475
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,000
The youngest boy.

476
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,440
The diaries' entry notes,

477
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,240
that gave us a lot of clue about this,

478
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,760
which actually corroborated
with the post-mortem findings also.

479
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,880
<i>Make sure you are bound tightly.</i>

480
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,800
<i>God should be impressed</i>
<i>with your dedication.</i>

481
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,800
<i>Use moist cloths to gag your mouths.</i>

482
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,000
<i>If not, use doctor tape over your mouth.</i>

483
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,440
You cannot, I don't think

484
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,440
anyone in the world
can convince kids to commit suicide.

485
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,560
That's why they were tied so tight,
so that the ritual happens at any cost.

486
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
What they did to the children
is unforgivable.

487
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,840
Did he make them swallow it,
or did he force it down their throats?

488
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,440
If he was alive, I don't know
what I would have done to him.

489
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,240
I feel so much anger.

490
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:19,760
So many questions that this case raised
about my own beliefs, and society.

491
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,000
There is such a thin line
between faith and delusion.

492
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,120
Where does faith end
and where does delusion start, you know?

493
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,199
Where do you draw the line?

494
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,000
I went up the steps
and saw everybody standing in a circle.

495
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,600
I stood there for two minutes

496
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,199
wondering whether it's real.

497
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,960
The last one to, what I feel,
the last one to commit suicide was Lalit.

498
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,480
That's what I think.

499
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,960
Because the ties on his hands
were of some kind of wire.

500
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,000
His binds were different
from everyone else's.

501
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,520
Lalit and Tina,

502
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,880
neither of them
had their hands tied properly.

503
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,320
Their legs too were unbound.

504
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,640
It seems like they were the ones
to help tie up the others.

505
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,760
It's not possible for anyone
to tie themselves from behind.

506
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,120
Tina must be his partner in crime.

507
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,400
I know that he never
hid anything from her.

508
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,640
I can't say if anybody else in the family
knew what would happen.

509
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,720
These two definitely knew
what they were doing.

510
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,000
That this would end badly for the family.

511
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,520
It's as if the maternal wish
to protect the children

512
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,760
had been lost.

513
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,720
We often hear of women fighting to,

514
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,280
at least if nothing else,
protect their children.

515
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,840
To me, what this raised
was questions of power.

516
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,680
Did the women of the house,

517
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,360
and more women died
at the end of it than men…

518
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,040
Did the women of the house have the right
to not participate in that ritual?

519
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,760
And if they didn't,
can it still be called suicide?

520
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,240
Or should it be called murder?

521
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,720
<i>On the 30th of June, 2018.</i>

522
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,720
<i>the ritual had already begun</i>
<i>eight days back</i>

523
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,440
<i>as was written in the notes.</i>

524
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,600
<i>There was a promise</i>
<i>of the father arriving in the final act.</i>

525
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,480
And that is why the entire family
agreed to perform the ritual,

526
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,920
to further their betterment.

527
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,160
That it's only a matter
of 10 to 15 minutes.

528
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,560
They were made to believe
that Father will come and save them.

529
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,520
"No harm will come to you.
This is for your own good."

530
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,480
My name is Jatin.
I was Dhruv and Shivam's friend.

531
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,040
They were my neighbours.
They lived next door.

532
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,440
I had met them that night too.
I was taking some food stuff home.

533
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,800
They were standing at their shop.

534
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,560
They were laughing
and joking among themselves.

535
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,680
They playfully hit me too.

536
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,040
I asked them if they wanted to play.
They said, "Not today."

537
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,960
It was around 10:30.

538
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,880
The one sentence in this entire episode
that will always always stay with me is,

539
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,680
"It's time for Daddy's visit."

540
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,920
It was a goose bumpish feeling.

541
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,080
And obviously,
the magic of the moment was such

542
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,440
that they believed that,
"We will not die."

543
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,920
"And we can trust so completely."

544
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,240
<i>God is pleased with you.</i>

545
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,520
<i>Knowing that 11 of you are standing</i>
<i>in one line, with one thought.</i>

546
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,280
<i>Do not panic</i>
<i>while performing the Banyan Tree ritual.</i>

547
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,760
<i>The earth might shake</i>
<i>or the skies might tremble.</i>

548
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,840
<i>Do not let this weaken your resolve.</i>

549
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,480
<i>Convince the children to keep chanting.</i>

550
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,040
<i>The chanting may last</i>
<i>from five to 15 minutes.</i>

551
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,480
<i>Till the chanting lasts,</i>

552
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,960
<i>Lalit will protect all of you.</i>

553
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,120
<i>The responsibility of tying up everyone</i>
<i>has been assigned to one of you.</i>

554
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,320
<i>When all the binds are secure,</i>

555
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,760
<i>then Lalit will give a signal</i>
<i>with a stick.</i>

556
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,880
<i>Place a tumbler full of water nearby.</i>

557
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,160
<i>Just as the colour of the water changes,</i>

558
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,720
<i>I will come back.</i>
