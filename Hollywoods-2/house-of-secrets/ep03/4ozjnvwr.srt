1
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,640
I don't think we have ever met
or will ever meet such an amazing family.

2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,120
The love that they gave us
was unparalleled.

3
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,240
She is my elder sister,
Sunita Mehta is her name.

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,560
She is my sister-in-law.

5
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,560
My husband was friends with Lalit.

6
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,160
Slowly our family and their family
became like an extended family.

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,240
Our kids also loved their kids.
They were very attached to each other.

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,880
My son Karan and her son Vishwaâ€¦

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,960
These are the gifts
that Monu (Menaka) gave to Karan.

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,480
Such was her love for my son.

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,360
How can someone
love their brother so much?

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,880
Each of these gifts was created by her.

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,360
When you open them
you realize how unique each one is.

14
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,080
"Happy Birthday Brother."

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,760
This is all Menaka's creativity.

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,160
Menaka was a very good girl,

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,480
very intelligent.

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,560
She wanted her life to be meaningful.

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,400
She had no clue that
something like this would happen to her.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,240
She did not send me the cards one by one,

21
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,360
but gave me this whole lot on my birthday.

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,040
She was so attached to me
that she wanted to surprise me.

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,000
She actually made all these cards
herself for my birthday.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,440
Our bond was stronger
than a brother-sister can ever have.

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,200
Sometimes it hits me

26
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,120
that she is no more.

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,920
But then, I have to accept it.

28
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,800
It felt like something
had changed in my son.

29
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
I slept in his room for days.

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,760
I wouldn't leave him alone.

31
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,520
He would keep saying,
"This cannot happen to Monu."

32
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,920
"Mamma, why did they do this?
Why did Lalit Uncle make them do this?"

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,400
Only God has these answers.

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,000
What happened?
Why did this happen? How did this happen?

35
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,320
It just doesn't make sense.
Don't cry, Parveen. Please don't cry.

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,320
Our legacy is the beautiful memories
that the family left us.

37
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,640
I'm actually surprised
that more conversations have not happened

38
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,400
about what exactly happened in Burari.

39
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,800
Talking about this
in thoughtful reflective fashion,

40
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,960
not shutting ourselves off,

41
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,920
can then help foster future conversations.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,400
Obviously some things went,
clearly, very, very wrong.

43
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,440
This was all a creation of Lalit's mind.

44
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,280
There was obviously
something going on in his head for years,

45
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,160
and he was entangled in his own creation.

46
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,680
<i>He was playing</i>
<i>with their minds psychologically,</i>

47
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,840
<i>right from the beginning.</i>

48
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,880
<i>I think what happened</i>
<i>to the whole family was very unfair.</i>

49
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,120
<i>Don't consider</i>
<i>these evening prayers a joke.</i>

50
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,640
<i>And stay away from people</i>
<i>that you have been forbidden to talk to.</i>

51
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,120
<i>Every time you default, Lalit,</i>
<i>Tina and Shivam have to pay the price.</i>

52
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,120
<i>But you always forget that.</i>

53
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,000
If anyone defaulted,
or did not follow his instructions,

54
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,120
or did not follow the instructions
in the diary, they were punished.

55
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,720
<i>It's a blessing that God</i>
<i>is making you aware of your mistakes.</i>

56
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,320
<i>For a whole year,</i>
<i>starting December, you will be punished.</i>

57
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,280
<i>This year will be your last.</i>

58
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,480
His situation was getting worse.

59
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,040
This shift tells me

60
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,320
that he felt in many ways
so out of control,

61
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
that he couldn't carry it any further.

62
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,960
That he had come to the end
of his tether, so to speak.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,600
Lalit was instrumental in this.

64
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,720
He succeeded because

65
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,400
he successfully positioned himself
as the patriarch.

66
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,720
So, everybody was bound to follow.

67
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,080
One person is responsible
for all of them ending up like this.

68
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,880
Lalit.

69
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,080
Just because of you,
everybody has lost their life.

70
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,200
As per the revelations
from the police investigations,

71
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,240
the youngest son, Lalit, instigated
the whole family to commit a mass suicide.

72
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,840
What is tragic is that
it's only presented as the bizarre.

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
Because there are other things
also going on in this incident,

74
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,920
but it's only presented
as something sensational,

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
as something terribly voyeuristic.

76
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,920
That you can't stop watching
because it's so bizarre.

77
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,280
Piercing through the deafening silence,
we bring you this sensational scoop.

78
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,280
<i>The truth uncovered</i>
<i>from Burari's Death House!</i>

79
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,560
The media has different approaches
to cover these kinds of cases.

80
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,920
We have seen it in the past,
and this will continue in the future.

81
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,720
But do you agree with
the way cases like this are reported?

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
You will get me in trouble.

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,840
Okay.

84
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,200
Sensationalized reporting is something
I do not agree with.

85
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,760
Some reporters had approached it
that way in this case,

86
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,680
and hyped up their coverage.

87
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,560
Was this murder
that the police aren't looking at?

88
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,600
<i>What about a possible "Baba"</i>
<i>being involved?</i>

89
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,800
<i>Were these pipes installed</i>
<i>to help the 11 souls escape?</i>

90
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,560
One of the things
that clearly happened with this case

91
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,560
and which is why
we know so little about it,

92
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,800
is that it was reported
in this, sort of, crime drama way.

93
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,240
It was reported as a story of numerology,

94
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,080
of this, sort of,
almost <i>tantrik</i> dimension to it.

95
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,640
And I think it was an early heralding

96
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,880
of the kind of rubbish

97
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,160
that broadcast journalism
in the mainstream TV space

98
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
has descended to in India.

99
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,840
The media reported
that screams were heard from the house

100
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,560
that people have seen ghosts.

101
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,720
People were vicariously enjoying
the fake and hyped-up news.

102
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,400
The media was feeding that demand.

103
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,080
They added all the spices
and lies to sell their news.

104
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,840
You, as a reporter, need to be objective,
sensible about what you're reporting.

105
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,560
And in the Burari case,
it was more important because,

106
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,000
you are dealing with this bizarre case
that is not making sense

107
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,440
which has all these sorts of things
that need to be dealt with sensitivity.

108
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,960
The collective salacious appetite
for scandal

109
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,760
comes from the kind
of "othering" of dysfunctionality.

110
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,280
It's much easier to pretend

111
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,240
that this happens to other people
and it doesn't happen to you.

112
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,920
And here is this entire family
that hangs itself,

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,640
or at least that's what we are told,
and we know literally nothing about it?

114
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,800
No one actually ever told us
why or how this happened.

115
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,320
And none of us went back
to try and follow it up?

116
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,640
It just fell off the map.

117
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
Their father's name was Bhopal Singh.

118
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,800
He was a very simple man.
He didn't smoke or have any vices.

119
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,720
We were the oldies. We'd sit and chat.

120
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,080
He often shared
his memories of Tohana with me.

121
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,120
<i>His days in farming,</i>
<i>the prosperous milk business he had.</i>

122
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,840
<i>They had cows and buffaloes</i>
<i>on their farm as well.</i>

123
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
This eight acres of land around us,

124
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,680
it all belonged to Bhopal Singh.

125
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,440
He sold it to us in 1988-'89.

126
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,400
My name is Gurdayal Singh.

127
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
These two are my brothers.

128
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,280
My elder brother's name is Karam Singh.

129
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,720
My younger brother's
name is Gurcharan Singh.

130
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,240
His nickname is Tari.

131
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:56,040
When he met my father,
they had an instant connection.

132
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,800
They considered each other brothers.
There was so much love between them.

133
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,320
He had made a dairy in his farm as well.

134
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
After that he worked hard
as a labourer and brought up his children.

135
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,280
Then they purchased a tractor.

136
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,000
They started doing farming on the land.

137
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,240
But then he spent all his earnings
on his children's marriages.

138
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,400
He told my father that they had run
into major debts after the marriages.

139
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,400
At that point they sold their land to us.

140
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,560
After selling the land, he said,
"I have no means left to survive now."

141
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,160
He said, "My children lived
a prosperous life here,

142
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,480
but in this community,
I can't afford a downfall in status."

143
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,720
So they decided that since relatives
were in Delhi, they should also go there.

144
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,120
Bhopal Singh was a very nice man.

145
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
We used to address him as "uncle."

146
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,120
He always spoke to the point.

147
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,200
He wasn't narrow-minded, in fact,
he was a very broadminded person.

148
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,440
He wasn't strict at all.

149
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,560
Back then, the family lived here
very happily.

150
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,160
Lalit was a naive and mischievous boy.

151
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,760
He was very naughty.

152
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
The youngest child is always pampered.

153
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,240
Lalit, being the youngest,
was everyone's favourite.

154
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,360
Lalit, Chander and I,

155
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,880
we were in 12th grade and we drank beer.

156
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,560
We didn't miss a chance
to hang out and drink beer.

157
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
We would talk late into the night.

158
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,560
Lalit would drive the conversation always.

159
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,520
He used to go on and on
about the past or the future.

160
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,120
He would keep talking and entertaining us.

161
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,880
We were not connected by blood.
Our relationship was beyond that.

162
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,840
He was a true friend to me.

163
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,120
When I first met him,
he had already met with an accident.

164
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,280
I don't remember exactly, but I think

165
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,520
Lalit's first accident
was a bike accident.

166
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,160
He was hospitalized for quite a few days.

167
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,960
He was supposed to take his exams,

168
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,800
but he was in the hospital
and could not take his exams.

169
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,760
I spoke to his parents and learned

170
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,480
that Lalit had suffered
from serious head injuries at that time.

171
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,720
I remember that he used
to fall asleep all the time.

172
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Right in the middle of a conversation,
he would go to sleep.

173
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
So that was his first accident,

174
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,320
during which, he was admitted
for quite a few days.

175
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,240
After he moved to Delhi,
he met with another accident.

176
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,880
Actually, I cannot call it an accident.
It was an attack on his life.

177
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,080
The people who attacked him
intended to kill him.

178
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,400
That's when he lost his voice.

179
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,040
Lalit worked in a plywood shop
in the suburbs across the Yamuna river.

180
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,280
He had a dispute
with his employer about his payment.

181
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,800
They had a fight about it.

182
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,560
We heard that Lalit was locked
inside the store and it was set on fire.

183
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,320
Nobody knew what
the attacker's intention was,

184
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,840
but they thrashed him badly
and locked him in the plywood shop.

185
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,160
They burnt the boxes of plywood
that were kept there.

186
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,720
When he gained consciousness,

187
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,240
he realized that plywood
had fallen on him.

188
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,680
The wood got stuck on his shoulder.

189
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,920
He removed his phone from his pocket
and called his brother.

190
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,160
"I have been attacked!"

191
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,520
"They have injured me
and locked me in the shop."

192
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,440
"Come soon. They have
set the shop on fire."

193
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,680
Someone actually planned that attack.
They must have hated him.

194
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,960
It was considered
to be an attempt to murder.

195
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,400
It was near fatal,
it was assumed he was dead.

196
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,440
He had already suffered a head injury,

197
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,000
but after this second incident,

198
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,040
the smoke entered into his lungs.

199
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,040
Because of this, he lost his voice.

200
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,360
When I used to visit him during that time,

201
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,960
I saw an able, good-humoured man
who was shut down.

202
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,720
He had to write his thoughts
to communicate with us.

203
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,560
He quit his job.

204
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,120
His entire family was in despair,

205
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,160
as he was the sole earning member
of the family.

206
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,760
Lalit's son was born
when he couldn't speak,

207
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,320
and I used to think

208
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:12,040
that it must be so difficult for Lalit,
that he can't call his son by name.

209
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,200
I believed that he had
really lost his voice.

210
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,760
Never had reason to doubt it.

211
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,080
That's highly unlikely

212
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,080
unless the person has had a stroke
or a bleed in the brain,

213
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,120
which has managed
to affect the speech centre.

214
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Or there is physical damage
by trauma or disease

215
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,760
to the larynx, to the voice box.

216
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,520
I don't believe there is
any evidence of either.

217
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,520
Had he really lost his voice?
Or was he putting on an act?

218
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,920
I can't say for sure.

219
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,160
The family chose to bury that episode.

220
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,880
His mother also asked me
not to discuss it with him.

221
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,280
"It's best we forget it
and not mention it ever."

222
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,640
Gradually, we all made an effort
to forget that episode.

223
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,120
To recover from that
requires a fair amount of healing.

224
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,800
Physical healing. Emotional healing.

225
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,720
And especially since
after the accident he didn't speak,

226
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,280
it seemed that he had lost his voice.

227
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,720
Did he really lose his voice?
We don't know.

228
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,840
Or at a deep psychological level,
the trauma was so great

229
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,400
that he just decided
that he wasn't going to speak anymore.

230
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,600
Because it was just too painful.

231
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,120
And nobody treated his PTSD,
which was after that fire.

232
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,480
Nobody treated it.

233
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,800
After the accident,
the doctor had suggested that

234
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,160
Lalit should be taken to a psychiatrist.

235
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,760
The family told us also

236
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,280
that they were advised
to take Lalit to a psychiatrist.

237
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,880
But people believe that
only "mad" people go to a psychiatrist.

238
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,280
But he was mentally ill.
They should have taken it seriously.

239
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,040
The psychological literature suggests

240
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,000
that when a person
has been through a fair amount of trauma,

241
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,120
and if you're not treated
from that trauma,

242
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,280
a certain level of psychosis sets in.

243
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,440
Psychosis is the inability of the mind

244
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,320
to deal in a rational way

245
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,680
with what's going on in your life.

246
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,840
And one of the direct results
of psychosis is hearing voices.

247
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,840
Then there is the loss of his father.

248
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,680
After Daddy <i>ji</i> passed away,

249
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,960
one day, Lalit heard
his father's voice telling him

250
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,720
to recite the Hanuman Chalisa
every single day at 10:00 in the evening.

251
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,360
"Lalit will regain his voice."

252
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,520
They made this into a routine.
They prayed at 7:00 in the morning,

253
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,680
12:00 noon, and then 10:00 in the night.

254
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,800
But Lalit didn't get his voice back
immediately, it took one year.

255
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,400
They were reciting Hanuman Chalisa
when Lalit suddenly started singing.

256
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,200
Hearing this, everyone else
stopped singing,

257
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,200
and Lalit took the song to completion.

258
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,480
In a trance, Lalit did not realize
that he was the only one left singing.

259
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,880
They called, excited, to inform us
that Lalit got his voice back.

260
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,760
"Right in between our prayers.
Daddy was right!"

261
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,400
Lalit had mentioned to me

262
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,400
that all this is happening
because of the blessings of Daddy.

263
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,960
But he never mentioned
about his father's spirit.

264
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,800
The fact that the spirit
was speaking through him.

265
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,400
He used to share everything with me,
but he never spoke about all this to me.

266
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,400
After the father left,
no one was in a position of authority.

267
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,760
Their mother was bedridden,

268
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,160
and the elder brother
did not take much initiative,

269
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,640
so Lalit had to somehow
hold the family together.

270
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,160
Which he did remarkably well.

271
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,720
In the last 11 years,
nobody has ever been hurt.

272
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,480
Except for this time.

273
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,520
As their financial condition improved,
their belief system became concrete.

274
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:47,440
The result was that
they developed a blind faith in Lalit.

275
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,760
From the time that his voice came back,

276
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,840
to the time, of whatever diaries
we have some pages of,

277
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,000
he was slowly building up,
"This is what our father is telling us."

278
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,480
"This is what we need to do."

279
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,480
Telling everybody to behave
in a certain manner

280
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,960
and be restricted in that manner.

281
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
And everybody was believing him.

282
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,200
They started praying, and God
started answering their prayers.

283
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,800
Whatever Lalit said or asked them to do,

284
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,280
was believed to be
Daddy's wishes that had to be fulfilled.

285
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,120
This, in turn, empowered Lalit even more.

286
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,560
So there's an entire, sort of, formula

287
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,960
by which he becomes the idealized,

288
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,640
somewhat scary authority figure.

289
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,000
And, you know, everyone just does
what he asks them to do.

290
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,720
And it was like a little cult
inside of that family.

291
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,000
If you would go through
the beginnings of any cult,

292
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,640
the so called leader of the cult,

293
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,320
needs to demonstrate by
the performance of an extraordinary feat,

294
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
which is usually
against the laws of nature,

295
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,200
that he is in possession of supernatural
or superhuman capabilities.

296
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,560
The regaining of the voice

297
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,320
is the performance of that feat.

298
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,480
You can't execute anything in a cult
unless there is complete submission.

299
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,160
This kind of social isolation was created
that you're not supposed to have fun.

300
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,480
You're only supposed to enjoy,
"in a manner" enjoy

301
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,560
the religious stuff that
was happening in the house.

302
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,680
Whatever we found in the written material,

303
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,960
it's repeatedly mentioned that,
"Nobody will disobey what's written here."

304
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,040
And it suited them in the past.
The quality of their lives improved.

305
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,200
They expanded from one shop to two.

306
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,040
The notes directed them
to invest money in certain places,

307
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,360
which was successful.

308
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,680
Arranging marriage for the daughter.
That worked too.

309
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,760
When they followed the instructions,
the family made significant growth.

310
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,120
That bolstered their belief
in it so much that

311
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,800
whatever power is guiding them,
they were compelled to follow it.

312
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,320
He was slowly creating
some impact on everybody.

313
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,720
And everybody was believing him.

314
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,160
And they thought
that was the best way of life.

315
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,960
He must've been telling them,
"Our secrets must remain between us only."

316
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,960
We often raise our kids in the same way

317
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,400
when we tell them not to discuss
domestic matters with the outside world.

318
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,760
"What will people say"
is what matters to us.

319
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,120
So people believe it.

320
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,680
And lots of us who actually believe

321
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,920
that secrets of the house
should remain secret.

322
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,440
There are always multiple life events,

323
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,040
but there is a trigger which finally
gets them into psychosis.

324
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,400
Was he feeling that there's going to be

325
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,920
some problem happening
with this engagement?

326
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,400
If this Priyanka goes away,
will the world come to know

327
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,280
something else is happening in the family?

328
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,520
That means, "Maybe we're in danger."

329
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,560
And suddenly realizing that
now she's going to go away

330
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,120
and the world is going to come to a halt.

331
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,840
If you call this
a personal kingdom of Lalit,

332
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,080
and a very, very important part
of that kingdom

333
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,400
was going to leave the family.

334
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,080
So, it was the forbidden kingdom for him.

335
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,600
And nobody was allowed to leave.

336
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,040
I had noticed that a few days
prior to Priyanka's engagement,

337
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,760
Lalit's behaviour had changed quite a bit.

338
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,840
He was more reserved than usual.

339
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,960
Lalit would turn away from us
to avoid conversation.

340
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,360
When the children were rehearsing
a dance for Priyanka's engagement,

341
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,200
I asked Lalit how the rehearsal
was coming along.

342
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,880
Lalit ignored me and then got up and left.

343
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,880
So his behaviour had changed drastically.

344
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,600
I had asked Priyanka on one of our walks

345
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,840
if Lalit was okay?

346
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,160
She hesitated and said yes.

347
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,920
I pointed out that he wasn't talking much.

348
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,040
She said Lalit had a throat problem.

349
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,880
I asked if he was taking medicines,
and she said, yes, he was.

350
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,160
I found it very weird.
I'd never seen him this dull, ever.

351
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,760
He was sleeping all night
and then all day.

352
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,880
After the engagement,
he slept for days on end.

353
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,760
I even asked Tina that, "What happened
to Lalit? Why is he sleeping so much?"

354
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,960
She told me he's suffering
from some nerve pain.

355
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,120
"He's had his medication
and gone to sleep."

356
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,000
I didn't bother after that.

357
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,480
But I found it really weird
that he was sleeping so much.

358
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,880
I even called Lalit after that.

359
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,600
Tina received the call,
she told me that Lalit's still sleeping.

360
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,480
I told her that's exactly
what I wanted to discuss with him.

361
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,200
Why is he sleeping so much?

362
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,560
Tina told me not to worry.

363
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,560
That was the last time we spoke.

364
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,600
This was my first experience with death.

365
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,560
For a week, I was so scared.

366
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,400
I wouldn't be in my room alone.
I didn't want to be by myself.

367
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,760
In my dreams, I would see them.
I still see them sometimes.

368
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,280
I saw them a few months ago.

369
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,360
It was night time.

370
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,720
In my dream,
I found myself standing on the roof.

371
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,480
My sister and me.
Jokingly we started calling out names.

372
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,840
And we saw Dhruv standing there
like he used to when he was alive.

373
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,640
Just standing there. Normally.

374
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,000
"Dhruv! Dhruv!" We screamed a few times.

375
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,280
He shouted back, "Tell me,
Jatin, what's up?"

376
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,280
Just then, I woke up scared.

377
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I especially remember
Dhruv and Shivam at night.

378
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,440
That's the time we used to play together.

379
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,400
How do I define this incident?

380
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,760
Okay.

381
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,640
It's not a crime.

382
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,000
They had no intentions to die,

383
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,200
so it cannot be called suicide.

384
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,480
Whatever they did, they did willingly.
So it cannot be a murder.

385
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,440
What do we call it?

386
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,880
It's a damn good question,
what do we call it?

387
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,640
Everything points at suicide.

388
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,960
But can we say for sure
that it was suicide?

389
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,280
-Yes.
-Or incidental death?

390
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,080
Accidental death, I mean.
If you look at the page in the diary,

391
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,520
it said, "Everyone will
help each other in untying."

392
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,400
But that never happened.

393
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,680
They were expecting
to survive this ritual.

394
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,280
We believe it was accidental.

395
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,240
This is not a murder. This is not suicide.

396
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,920
-Accidental death.
-This is accidental death.

397
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,240
When the ground investigation
was complete,

398
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,920
then it was decided that
we should go for something

399
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,040
which is called a psychological autopsy.

400
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,680
A group of scientists,
including a psychologist,

401
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,680
they go into the psyche
of the people who have died

402
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,200
to find out how it happened
or why it happened.

403
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,360
All of this was examined
in the psychological autopsy.

404
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,880
Basically, Lalit had
the problem, psychosis.

405
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,600
And then Lalit transmitted it
to the family,

406
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,160
making it a case of shared psychosis.

407
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,720
They believed everything Lalit would say.

408
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,760
So considering all of this,

409
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,760
the psychological autopsy

410
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,440
concluded that they were
not planning to commit suicide.

411
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,160
This is not a suicide.

412
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,040
This is a ritual, which went bad,
and they lost their lives.

413
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,320
It's very, very easy
to just start giving snap explanations,

414
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,480
including things like, you know,
collective psychosis, which I thought wasâ€¦

415
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,800
Which is probably true, maybe.
But it's sort of a catch-all phrase

416
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,480
which just says everything
and doesn't say anything at the same time.

417
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,640
Uh, it has the value of satisfying people

418
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,720
in that world
where everyone wants certainty.

419
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,880
Whereas, actually, what you need
to live with is

420
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,320
that you don't know the answers.

421
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,760
So it would be better to just say,

422
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,120
that, "This is how we imagine
this event might have taken place."

423
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,520
"These are the things
we think might have happened."

424
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,600
Instead ofâ€¦

425
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,520
What is it called?
A Psychological Autopsy?

426
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,600
What we really need
is a sociological autopsy.

427
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,000
At the heart of it, there seems to be

428
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,960
this mass resistance
to talking about mental health

429
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,840
because we have
stigmatized these conversations.

430
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,400
I think that is the reason why,

431
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,040
a lot of times,
we never find out the truth.

432
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,400
I think the society
does need to have these discussions.

433
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,040
Not having those conversations
is perhaps not an answer.

434
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,000
The trouble is that unless we have
those unsettling difficult conversations,

435
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,920
this might happen, again.

436
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,600
They handed over the bodies
to us the next day in the evening.

437
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,760
Dinesh had also arrived by that time.

438
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,840
Dinesh and I identified
and took custody of the bodies.

439
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,800
Looking at the bodies and carrying themâ€¦

440
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,760
We cannot forget that.

441
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,680
It was a difficult and horrible moment

442
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,640
when they made us identify each body
by showing us the face.

443
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,280
The moment we got
the approval for the cremation,

444
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,760
we took the bodies from the mortuary.

445
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:24,280
We had already covered an entire block
on Nigambodh Ghat (cremation ground).

446
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,080
The area had space
to accommodate 12 to 15 cremations.

447
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,480
All the formalities,
from priest to making the pyre ready,

448
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,280
we did in advance.

449
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,120
At the cremation centre

450
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,920
there were so many people.

451
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,160
Their friends, family,
relatives, neighbours.

452
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,760
Everyone was there.

453
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,200
Yet it was not enough people.

454
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,760
There weren't enough priests.

455
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,120
We weren't able to provide
a priest per body.

456
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,960
We wantedâ€¦

457
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,800
that every ritual is done justice to.

458
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,360
Nothing should fall short.

459
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,160
So it was decided to appoint
a single senior priest for all bodies.

460
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,840
And get him to perform all of the rituals.

461
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,160
That's when my mother and I
saw Tina for the last time.

462
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,920
Lalit.

463
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,480
Shivam.

464
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,920
We told them,

465
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,040
at least let us see their faces
for the last time.

466
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,240
So they showed us their faces.

467
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,880
That's the last time I saw her.

468
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,680
My mother cried inconsolably.

469
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,200
The final rites are usually done
by a son or grandson.

470
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,240
Only selected few of the family
are supposed to do the ritual.

471
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,760
There weren't 11 relatives present
for the cremation to be done all at once.

472
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,160
Dinesh lit the pyre for one body
and then moved to the next.

473
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,840
I was looking at Dinesh, the brother.

474
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:49,640
One by one, he did the rituals.
He'd cry, then had to go to next body.

475
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,560
His son was doing it for another body.

476
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,000
Something that, I think,
nobody should go through.

477
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,160
For the first time in my life,

478
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,680
I saw the last rites
of 11 family members together.

479
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,800
Lord Krishna had said to Arjunâ€¦

480
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,240
"Hey, Arjun, our mind cannot be corroded."

481
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,960
"It cannot be destroyed or killed.
It is indestructible. It is immortal."

482
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,800
Our tears had dried up.

483
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,840
But we were all thinking
about the fond memories from the past.

484
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,120
But I will neverâ€¦

485
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,000
I will never let go of those memories.

486
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,240
The memories will always remind meâ€¦

487
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,920
of the void they left behind.

488
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,720
I got to know from you
that their eyes were donated.

489
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,120
I finally see some light.

490
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,040
At least there is some closure.

491
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,280
A small sigh of relief.

492
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,280
Whenever a death takes place somewhere,

493
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,240
the surviving family needs
to be counselled

494
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,160
and motivated to donate
the eyes of the deceased.

495
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,440
I salute Mr. Dinesh that he kept himself
composed in such a situation

496
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,800
and made this choice on the same day

497
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,600
when three generations
of his family had perished.

498
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,520
Even in that condition, he thought thatâ€¦

499
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:42,000
â€¦if he donates the eyes,
it will somehow keep his family alive.

500
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,480
It makes me feel so angry
and sad at the same time.

501
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,480
I wish that one of the children
had given me even a hint.

502
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,040
They all had taken some kind of oath

503
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,640
that they'll not share
this secret with anyone.

504
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,640
Whatever secret
the 11 family members were hiding,

505
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,280
died with them that night.

506
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,280
They were good, normal people.
They still are for us.

507
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,280
A lot has changed after their deaths.

508
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,560
Our shops were right across
from each other.

509
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,200
We would see Bhuvnesh
or Neetu at the shop.

510
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,680
Now we don't see them.

511
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,400
Imagine, our best days were yet to come.

512
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,880
Our kids were growing up.
We would have celebrated their weddings.

513
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,280
We could have been together.

514
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,000
After the death of these 11 people,

515
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,160
we suffered major losses.

516
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,400
The area has been disgraced a lot.

517
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,640
Our shop was closed for nearly a year.

518
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,520
We just couldn't get anyone to come.

519
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,880
With time, all will be forgotten.

520
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,720
New people will move in. We will move on.
That's the law of the world.

521
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,400
The urge to find answers

522
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,960
which will stitch this up neatly

523
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,960
and suddenly make sense of 11 people dead,

524
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,680
is very strong.

525
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,160
Sadly, they may or may not exist.

526
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,520
The closure is elsewhere.

527
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,280
Every case has an ending.

528
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,240
But here, there are
many unanswered questions,

529
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,040
and those will always remain unanswered,

530
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,520
because there is no one
to tell us what happened.

531
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,360
I think I relived each and every moment
of covering that story.

532
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,520
All of it.

533
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,520
And tonight, when I go back home,

534
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,960
I think I'm gonna
think about it for a while.

535
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,000
It's gonna stay.

536
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,720
It's already been a year.

537
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,400
But this conversation
took me back in time, to last year.

538
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:54,120
I relived all my emotions and conflicts
from that time. All over again.

539
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,600
Till today, people constantly
ask me about this case.

540
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,760
It's still a mystery for them.

541
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,040
Even though, they've read
about it in newspapers.

542
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,840
They've seen it on news.
They know about it.

543
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,680
All the family is gathered here.

544
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,480
But they want to know the "real truth."
I say, there's no other truth.

545
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,200
"What do you want to hear from me?"

546
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,320
Some people just won't
accept the theory that is out.

547
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,720
Every case is different.

548
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,600
We put our heart and soul
into catching the culprit.

549
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,920
I feel very happy when a case is solved.

550
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,320
And we solved this case.

551
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,560
That's it.

552
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,760
I wonder what they
were thinking that night?

553
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,160
Why did they submit to this madness?

554
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,960
Something was definitely
going on in their minds.

555
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,920
I stopped believing in God.

556
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,480
Parveen, my wife, tells me
that I was never a believer,

557
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,040
but now I am a total atheist.

558
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,480
This episode played a major role in this.

559
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,960
If something like this could happen,
where was God?

560
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,400
If God existed, he would have
given at least one of them some wisdom

561
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,120
neighbouram or shout for help
so that a neighbour may have heard them.

562
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,040
Where was God then?

563
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,840
The secrecy with which this happened,

564
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,840
it speaks of the lack
of interconnectedness

565
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,040
of society.

566
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,840
So society actually needs
to have these conversations,

567
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,600
even if they're unsettling,
because telling the story of these people

568
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,040
is in itselfâ€¦

569
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,920
giving closureâ€¦

570
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,280
both for them, and for us.
