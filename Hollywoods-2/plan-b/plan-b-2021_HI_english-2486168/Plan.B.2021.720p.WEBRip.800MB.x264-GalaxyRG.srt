1
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:36,407
While I'm at the real estate
convention this weekend,

2
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,991
I want you to finish your PSAT test book.

3
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:42,782
- Oh, Ma, do you think we can skip
the coconut oil this morning?

4
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:45,907
- It's a tradition.
Are you too good for tradition?

5
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:48,616
Lupe, we talked about this.
Your outfit, your hair...

6
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:50,699
I mean, every day,
it gets more and more ridiculous.

7
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,866
- Oh, Jesus wore dresses
and nobody judged him, right?

8
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:56,074
- Everybody judged him,
they crucified him.

9
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:58,491
- Your online grade book says
you received a 96.

10
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:01,032
- What happened?
- It was just one question about Judge Danforth.

11
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,282
It was a dumb mistake.

12
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:04,991
- There are no smart mistakes, Sunny.

13
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,907
One little mistake can ruin
the rest of your life.

14
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:10,699
- You look like a skunk,
a depressed skunk.

15
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,741
- Thought we don't use
insults in this house.

16
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:14,325
- Wipe that lipstick off.

17
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,158
Now.

18
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,199
- Now I'll pay attention to the minor characters
so I don't get tripped up again.

19
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,408
- What did I do to get such a good girl?

20
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:18,574
- What's up, bitch?

21
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:21,366
- Just studying for the calc test.
- Fuck!

22
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,824
- Munchie bag?
- Oh, man!

23
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:24,991
Thank you.

24
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:27,657
My dad was in full form this morning.

25
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:31,366
Someone needs to seriously
depucker his asshole.

26
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:32,825
- How is Logan?

27
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:35,991
- Oh, real good.

28
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:38,158
Look at all the squirt emojis
my butt caused.

29
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:41,574
- Ah, at least you're wearing
underwear this time.

30
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:44,407
Sunny, when you start dating,
you'll see,

31
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:47,782
you gotta keep 'em hooked,
gotta use what God gave you.

32
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:50,616
What exactly do you think God gave me,

33
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:52,699
except a nightguard
and an overbearing mother?

34
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,657
Sunny, you can't be
embarrassed about this stuff.

35
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:58,324
Is Jason bringing the keg tonight?

36
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:01,157
- Yeah. Oh, did I tell you?
We finally tried reverse cowgirl.

37
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,699
- And? How was it?

38
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,032
Amazing, right?

39
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,991
- Yeah. I mean, it wasn't...
that great for me,

40
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,032
but I feel like it looked cool.

41
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,449
My butthole's not my best feature...

42
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,449
- Girls are horse fucking and
I haven't even had my first kiss.

43
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,907
I'm so behind.

44
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:18,407
- Pretty sure that's not
what they mean, okay?

45
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:21,991
- Eww, gross, is that
like a Mexican thing?

46
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:24,074
- Yeah, I mean,
if your armpit hair's that long,

47
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:26,032
I can't imagine what else is overgrown.

48
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,032
- Eww! Oh my God.

49
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:31,741
Glad you spent your free time thinking
about what my pussy looks like, Megan.

50
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:34,824
- Oh my God, I don't.

51
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:37,866
Obviously. I don't.

52
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:40,949
- That was so funny.
She was really embarrassed.

53
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,491
Listen, obviously boys like
your "au naturel" look.

54
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,157
Meanwhile, the underwear my mom buys me
renders me invisible.

55
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:49,866
Take a look. It's like sexual camouflage.

56
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:51,824
- Oh, that's your underwear?

57
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,200
Thought you just shaved
your nipples and pubes off.

58
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,491
Our slumber party is gonna be bomb.

59
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:02,574
We're gonna do face masks and binge
My Hero Academia. Perfect night.

60
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:05,699
- Also, I have a thousand-piece puzz
that I wanted to get my claws into.

61
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,824
- Oh!
- And we can go through all the Halloween candy that your dad confiscated.

62
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,157
- If you can find it.
- I did and I ate it.

63
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,532
- Oh, fuck.

64
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:17,032
When I look at Hunter,
I just creamed my pants.

65
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,282
Who plays hockey in a cardigan?

66
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:22,907
He's like...
He's like an athletic librarian.

67
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,574
I totally do not understand the attraction.

68
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,782
I mean, he's, like, cute, but he's got
major guidance counselor vibes.

69
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:32,282
- Yeah.
- Well, maybe you should invite him over

70
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:34,907
for a little
"Disney+ and Thrust," huh?

71
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:37,992
He can bang you doggy style
while you watch Lady and the Tramp.

72
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:40,991
- How would we do the pasta thing
if he's behind me?

73
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,741
Also, you know I want
my first time to be romantic,

74
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:46,449
looking into each other's eyes
as we make love.

75
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,782
- Only serial killers stare into
each other's eyes while they fuck.

76
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,867
It's like...

77
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:56,741
Doesn't it feel weird?
Doesn't it feel weird?

78
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:58,824
- Stop.
- Okay, exactly.

79
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,949
- So don't do that.
- Doesn't matter anyway. Look.

80
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,449
Megan Dillons has staked her claim.

81
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,449
- Do you need to like a little...
- Well, it would be...

82
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,699
- It's kind of dry.

83
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,366
- How am I supposed to compete with that?

84
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,574
- I definitely wouldn't lick it.

85
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:11,991
- I don't know, deep-throat a basketball?

86
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:15,116
Hello, ladies. Sunny, Lupe.

87
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:16,782
- Hi, Kyle.

88
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:18,783
- What's that behind your ear?

89
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:24,449
Is that a flattened penny
from the Corn Palace?

90
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,116
- She's never been there.
- Yeah, my mom doesn't let me go there.

91
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:29,699
She's weirded out
by the phallic nature of corn.

92
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,824
- Oh, I didn't even think about it
like that. I love that place.

93
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,199
My church's youth group is throwing
a talent show next week,

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,616
and so I'm premiering
some of my new closeup magic.

95
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:39,491
You should come. My church is awesome.

96
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:42,491
I mean, Lupe, does your dad's church
let you watch Harry Potter?

97
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:44,199
Because mine did.

98
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,449
- Kyle, how many times do I have to tell
you, I don't want to compare churches?

99
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,991
- Okay, okay, I just think it'll be fun.

100
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,116
Oooh!

101
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:52,866
I forgive you!

102
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,366
- That wedding was amazing.
- All right.

103
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,282
Oh, that's your car?

104
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:03,741
It's so used!

105
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:05,532
Man, I could never sit in here

106
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,491
because it looks like you gave rides
to the entire football team.

107
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:10,741
- Oh!
- And what if somebody I know was given a ride?

108
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,408
Oh! Hell no!

109
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,407
- Oh, I wish I knew that nobody would want
something so damaged, and ugly.

110
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,991
I should have saved my car
for my husband.

111
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:26,283
But now... it's all used up!

112
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:39,741
Abstinence.
'Cause one joy ride could ruin your life.

113
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:45,991
- Well, that was a hoot
and a half, wasn't it?

114
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:48,532
- Hey, if your vagina was a car,
what would it be?

115
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:51,324
- Ferrari.
- Oh, shit, really?

116
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:54,117
- Stays covered up and completely
untouched in the garage.

117
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,866
- Mine would definitely be a Transformer.

118
00:07:56,867 --> 00:08:00,241
You think you know her?
Boom, autobots pop out.

119
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:02,657
- I feel like if you're following the
metaphor, that means that you have crabs.

120
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:03,949
- What?
- Do you have crabs, Lupe?

121
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,407
- No. It's a surprise.
- What is surprising about your vagina?

122
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:10,075
- My vagina is awesome.
- Okay, so...

123
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:15,116
Basically, what's happening right now
is puberty is telling you

124
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:16,824
to step on the gas,

125
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:20,616
but just trust me
when I say it is okay to wait.

126
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:23,866
When you finally take that first drive,

127
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:27,991
you're gonna want it
to be with your spouse, okay?

128
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:30,199
Oh, yes, Emma?

129
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,157
- Uh, if I let a guy ride in my trunk,
that doesn't like count, right?

130
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:36,574
- What if I want to drive my car alone,

131
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:39,449
you know, just to make sure
that the oil still works?

132
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,657
- Okay, okay, does anybody
have a real question?

133
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:45,574
- Yes, Hunter.
- It's a real question.

134
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:49,907
So, how does giving a passenger "a ride"

135
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:52,616
actually make a difference
in how a car drives?

136
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:56,116
- Oh, well, just because the guy can tell

137
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:57,657
if the...

138
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:00,574
upholstery was ripped

139
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,157
by the other passengers,

140
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:05,407
so then the car can never get back

141
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:08,324
that "new car feeling" again.

142
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:10,782
- Yeah?
- You can't tear the upholstery.

143
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:14,116
That's a myth.
It just stretches and then it goes...

144
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:16,157
- Who is that?
- ...back into place.

145
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,407
- Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay.

146
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:24,157
So why does this groom
care so much about this car

147
00:09:24,158 --> 00:09:26,699
when he doesn't even have one,
'cause now he is just some bum

148
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,407
who is ragging on his wife

149
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:31,367
about her car?

150
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,366
- Right, so weird.
Why would he do that? What?

151
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,532
He has his car.

152
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:40,824
It's just, in the video, we're just
looking at his-- at her car, okay?

153
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:43,699
- Then why aren't we seeing
his car being inspected?

154
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,116
Why is there no "his car" inspection?
- We don't know where his car is.

155
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:51,282
- I prefer to take public transportation
because it helps with the environment.

156
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:54,741
So... am I fucking everybody?

157
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:55,991
Uh...

158
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:57,533
- Oh, yuck!

159
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:01,116
- Just wanna be teaching Home Ec again.

160
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:03,366
- Oh my God!

161
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:05,158
- I know, I know, I know!

162
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:09,532
- Dude. You gotta ask him out.
Don't lose momentum. Totally.

163
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:13,282
- Megan's dad accidentally shot himself
in the foot at the ammo store,

164
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:16,657
and so he isn't going on his hunting trip.
The party is canceled.

165
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,282
- Deep breath.
- No, you don't understand, I've been planning this for two hours.

166
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:20,866
- Okay.
- That's a bummer.

167
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,116
I know.

168
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:24,991
- You know, Sunny's throwing a party
at her place later.

169
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:27,782
Yeah, gonna be dope. Way doper
than Megan's would have been, so...

170
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:29,992
- Yeah, Sunny throws the best parties.
- Really?

171
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:33,157
- Yeah, you know me.

172
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:35,949
Party queen.
Love a good high school party.

173
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,741
With the liquors and the touching...
All the other stuff. Drugs.

174
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:42,824
- Tide pods.
- Cool.

175
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:45,366
What time? If I'm invited.

176
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:49,116
- Yeah. No, yeah, of course,
you're invited. If you want to. Do you?

177
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:50,616
It's at my house,
you heard that part, right?

178
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,741
Is 8 p.m. good for you?

179
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:53,324
- 8 p.m. sounds great.

180
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:55,991
- I'll see you then.
- Cool.

181
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:57,032
Tight.

182
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,532
Cool and tight.

183
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,366
Like you.
- Catch you later.

184
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,241
- Bye. What the hell, Lupe?
If my mom finds out, I'm dead.

185
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,741
- She won't find out.
She's conveniently out of town,

186
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:07,782
and according to every teen movie
we've seen,

187
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,950
this is the perfect time to throw a party.

188
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,283
- You're right.

189
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:14,157
- Hunter's coming to my house!
- Yes!

190
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,616
- I just had a genius idea.
You should invite Logan.

191
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,116
- What? No.
- Yeah.

192
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,241
- No.
- Yeah.

193
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:28,907
- No.
- You have to invite him, Lupe!

194
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,617
When do I throw parties?

195
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:33,992
You made me invite Hunter.

196
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,824
- Okay, this is for you, okay?
- I'll take it.

197
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:45,700
- That's medicine.
- Oh.

198
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,866
- I dub thee... the Skull Fuck.

199
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:54,157
- Oh. What's a Skull Fuck?

200
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:57,616
- It's when a guy puts his junk
in your mouth and humps your skull.

201
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,200
- That's a real thing?
- I'll send you some links.

202
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:03,492
To Hunter!
- To Logan! Yes!

203
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:09,116
Ehh!

204
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:10,699
- Oh, God!

205
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,657
- God! Fuck. I feel that in my eyeballs.
- I don't like it.

206
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:21,117
- Pick a card, any card.

207
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:24,741
That's more than one card.

208
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:31,367
- No one's drinking our punch.
- Because people have no taste.

209
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:37,949
- Is that Logan?

210
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,367
- No. Billie Eilish's dog is doing
an Instagram Live.

211
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,283
No sign of Hunter?

212
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:48,616
- There's a truck, there's a truck.

213
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:50,658
It could be the neighbors.
No, they're out of town.

214
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:54,574
It's him, it's him. Oh my God.
How's my hair, how's my face?

215
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:56,782
How am I? How am me?
- You are gorgeous.

216
00:12:56,783 --> 00:13:00,617
All right? I got you something.
Had a bowl of them at Hot Topic.

217
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:02,407
It's not for sex.

218
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,742
I mean, it is, but it's not why
I'm giving it to you.

219
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,324
It's like a good luck charm.
Right? Like a rabbit's foot.

220
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:09,825
Tastes like strawberries.

221
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,241
It's a big night for you, all right?
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:16,075
- Throwing a rager, inviting your crush.

223
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:18,783
I just want you to have the best time.

224
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,991
- Thank you.
- Right.

225
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:22,741
- I will.
- All right! Go get 'em!

226
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:24,199
Yeah! You can do it!

227
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,699
- All right...
- Have fun.

228
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,116
Yes.

229
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:29,407
Make good choices. Love you.

230
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,199
- No offense, but I can't believe
this is the party I'm at tonight.

231
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,824
- I like your shoulder glitter.

232
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:44,449
- Hey, I thought it would like stink
of curry in here, but it smells normal.

233
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,075
- Sorry to disappoint you.

234
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:48,574
- Hey.
- Hi.

235
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:49,575
- Sunny.
- Hunter.

236
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,158
Want a Skull Fuck?

237
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:53,950
- What?

238
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,907
- Oh my God. Oh my God, no.
It's the name of a drink.

239
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:59,449
I don't want you to fuck my skull,
or anyone's skull, unless you want to.

240
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,074
You're allowed to fuck people's skulls.
I'm gonna stop, I'm gonna stop now.

241
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,242
- Gotcha.

242
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,282
Sounds good.

243
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:07,157
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:09,200
Dragon Ball Z. Nice.

245
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:15,157
Wait, this is a very weird déjà vu,
but when I was little,

246
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:16,991
I put strawberry milk in a Yu-Gi-Oh mug

247
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:19,282
and it was under my bed
for like three weeks.

248
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:20,575
And...

249
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:24,616
it smelled exactly like this. It's...

250
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:26,867
- Well, you don't have to... drink it.

251
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,449
- Whoa, why is that spicy?

252
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,949
- There, uh... there's
some pickle juice in there.

253
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,407
- Lupe did it.
- It's spicy.

254
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:36,157
It's like really spicy.
- Also cough syrup.

255
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:43,907
- Hey, dude.
I know, it's like psychopathic

256
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:45,907
to leave a voicemail.

257
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:48,324
Uh, but I figured you were driving
and couldn't text?

258
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:51,199
And just checking on what your ETA is,

259
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,699
'cause I'm just like a little nervous.

260
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,907
And also can't wait to see you
and, like, meet ya.

261
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:58,949
You'll meet Sunny, it'll be great.

262
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,492
Anyway, uh, just text me
when you're close.

263
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:05,699
- I'm close.
- Jesus, what the fuck?

264
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,032
- Sorry. It's just a bit I do
where I throw my voice.

265
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,032
See? I'm close. And now, I'm far!

266
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,532
- What? Eww.

267
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,866
Don't ever put your hot breath
on my ear again.

268
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:17,657
It sent chills down my spine.

269
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:20,616
- Okay, jeez, I just came here
to refresh my beverage.

270
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:23,116
Muy bueno margaritas.

271
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:24,450
Did I say that right?

272
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:30,532
- Kyle, I'm sorry, but you're a moron,
and your blazer makes me sad.

273
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:31,908
Now just...

274
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:33,699
go away.

275
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,366
- Partying and drinking.
I feel so stimulated.

276
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,532
Is this what white privilege feels like?

277
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,199
- Things going good with Hunter?

278
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,366
- Oh, yeah, he likes Sailor Moon, too.
He's like the perfect man.

279
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,532
I'm gonna show him
my Sailor Mercury Funko.

280
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,616
Fuck. I wanna suck his face so bad.

281
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:51,532
- Whoa! All right, drunk Sunny is bold.

282
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:56,032
- Lupe, I'm gonna kiss him tonight,
and I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

283
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:57,657
But like consensually.

284
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,367
- Always. All right, you go do that.

285
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,408
- I'll go around.

286
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,116
- I know. This party sucks.

287
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:07,282
Oh my God.

288
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:10,699
If Hunter wasn't here, I would have
ran out of here screaming.

289
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,032
- Did you see her room?
What's with all the toys?

290
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:14,907
- Oh my God, I heard she's
actually 12 years old,

291
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,074
but her mom made her skip
a bunch of grades.

292
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:20,366
- Oh my God, that's why she dresses
like a huge American Girl doll.

293
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,242
- Exactly.

294
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,283
- Hey, Hunter.

295
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,158
You didn't recognize me?

296
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,449
It's Sunny.

297
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,782
You got this, Sunny.
You are a grown woman.

298
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:24,116
This is the real me.

299
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:26,616
And you have erogenous zones.

300
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:30,199
I don't show this side at school because
I don't want to overwhelm people.

301
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,657
You've got tits!

302
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:33,324
You smell really nice, so...

303
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:35,616
You have a... pussy.

304
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,782
You know, if you're up for it,
then I could, um...

305
00:17:37,783 --> 00:17:39,324
ride you, boy.

306
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,116
And you're gonna get the dick.

307
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:43,991
You're gonna get that d'yick!
Go get that d'yick!

308
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:45,241
Go get that dick!

309
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:47,741
Yes! Yes.

310
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:05,367
- Hey! Have you seen Hunter?

311
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,241
- Nah, man.

312
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:09,325
- Uh, I actually think he's with Megan.

313
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:12,783
- Megan. Do you know where they went?

314
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:15,532
- What was I saying?

315
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,699
Oh, the CIA declassified...

316
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:12,282
- Oh, sorry, sorry. I didn't know
anyone else was in here.

317
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:14,282
No, it's fine.

318
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,700
I'm not going number one.

319
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,325
My eyes are, though.

320
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,658
- Are you having a shitty time
at this party, too?

321
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,742
- It's just...

322
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:27,116
everybody sees me

323
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:31,449
as this macho Christian warrior type guy,

324
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,782
like Chris Pratt, but I have feelings too.

325
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,949
- I know.

326
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,408
Of course. I'm sorry.

327
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,158
Can I ask you a question?

328
00:19:43,825 --> 00:19:46,532
Do you see me as this like

329
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,742
unsexy 12-year-old?

330
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,616
- What? No!

331
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:53,783
I think you're very womanly.

332
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:55,825
You've got a great figure.

333
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:59,158
You got the whole
Princess Jasmine thing going on.

334
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,907
- That's the incorrect ethnic group.

335
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:04,157
- Oh.
- But...

336
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:05,407
- Sorry.

337
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:08,366
- That's okay. It's kind of
the closest princess we've got.

338
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:09,408
So I'll take it.

339
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:13,200
- I like your new look.

340
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:15,616
It's, uh... it's cool.

341
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:17,117
It's mature.

342
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,408
- You're nice.

343
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:22,492
- Want a hug?

344
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:24,783
- Sure.

345
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:51,617
Um...

346
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:54,908
I'm touching your thing.

347
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:58,700
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you are.

348
00:21:14,658 --> 00:21:16,200
Oh. Okay...

349
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:22,491
Oh, wow. I've never seen
a thong in real life before.

350
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:24,407
- Here, take this.

351
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,741
- Hey, uh, are you sure you want this?

352
00:21:26,742 --> 00:21:29,282
- Yeah.
- Okay, yeah, me too.

353
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:31,450
- Okay, okay.

354
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:42,116
- Smells like Fruity Pebbles.

355
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:43,325
- Yum.

356
00:21:44,242 --> 00:21:46,074
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

357
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:47,658
- All right. Let's...

358
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,657
- Uh, can't... I can't reach.

359
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:54,783
- Grab the squatty potty. Yeah.

360
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,366
- Oh, exit only.
- Sorry.

361
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:06,699
- I'm so, sorry. Sorry.
- That's okay, that's okay.

362
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,242
- Just...
- Okay. Um...

363
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:25,824
- Does this feel good...?

364
00:22:25,825 --> 00:22:26,949
Ohh!

365
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,324
Ah! Oh my gosh!

366
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:31,117
Ah. Oh, wow!

367
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:34,949
Oh!

368
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,949
Huh. Ahh...

369
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:45,199
- We... Oh.

370
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,699
We... we just did it.

371
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,950
We did it.
- Yeah, we sure did.

372
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:53,199
- Oh my gosh.

373
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,241
Oh my gosh,
I just had premarital sex.

374
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,199
How did that happen so fast?
It's like something just took over me.

375
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,157
How does everything change
in just a few seconds?

376
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:03,366
- I... I don't know.

377
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:07,116
- I'm drunk. I knew I shouldn't
have had that margarita mix.

378
00:23:07,117 --> 00:23:09,949
You can't tell anyone about this.

379
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,199
- I won't. I won't tell any...
I won't tell anyone about this.

380
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,491
- Okay.
- Okay?

381
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:15,992
- Okay.

382
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:19,658
I'm sorry, I... I have to go pray.

383
00:23:31,992 --> 00:23:34,657
- Hey, do you have a tampon?

384
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:38,157
It's like the elevator
from The Shining down there.

385
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:39,741
Hey, Logan.

386
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:41,867
Uh, are you okay?

387
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:44,949
I'm worried.

388
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,117
Call or, you know, text.

389
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:51,282
But also I'm cool, and I'm good.

390
00:23:51,283 --> 00:23:52,992
So whenever you...

391
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:55,407
get here, that's great.

392
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:56,574
Um...

393
00:23:56,575 --> 00:23:58,616
Hey, look, it's other friends.

394
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:00,616
And... Emma, what's going on?

395
00:24:00,617 --> 00:24:01,825
Uh...

396
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,199
Wassup?

397
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,492
Are you good?

398
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,992
- I don't know.

399
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:15,658
What's good, anyway?

400
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:18,158
Are you a-good?

401
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:21,117
- No.

402
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:24,199
I'm not good.

403
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,532
- Oh! Oh!

404
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:08,116
Shit. This is the worst alarm ever.

405
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:10,157
Oh my God. Why are you doing this to me?

406
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:12,318
- It's already noon,
I just wanted to get a head start.

407
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:14,700
- What's the bucket for?

408
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:19,533
Aw, fuck.

409
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:21,532
- That.

410
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:23,532
Oh, here, this helps.

411
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:26,242
- Oh, thanks, man. Oh, yeah.

412
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,533
Ah.

413
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:31,782
This place is looking good.

414
00:25:31,783 --> 00:25:34,949
For all your mom knows, you...
spent the whole weekend doing flash cards

415
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,033
and diddling yourself as usual.

416
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:40,075
- Oh, um, did Logan come?

417
00:25:42,158 --> 00:25:43,408
- Eh, never showed up.

418
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,741
- I'm sorry. That sucks.

419
00:25:46,742 --> 00:25:49,533
- How about you? What happened?

420
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,908
- I had sex.

421
00:25:57,783 --> 00:26:00,199
- Wait. Wh... what?

422
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,199
Oh my God.

423
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,532
You lost your virginity to Hunter?

424
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,908
Dude, tell-tell me everything.

425
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:14,158
- I was so drunk, so it's a little hazy,
to be honest.

426
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:17,657
- No, no, no.
You are a woman now.

427
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:19,241
Welcome to the club.

428
00:26:19,242 --> 00:26:21,616
And you banged your crush
at your own party?

429
00:26:21,617 --> 00:26:24,907
You are my hero.

430
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:27,950
Tell me everything you remember, sex master.

431
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:30,824
- I have to pee.

432
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:31,867
- Oh.

433
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:34,158
Okay.

434
00:26:34,575 --> 00:26:37,408
Go, just... we'll talk after you
empty that bladder.

435
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:40,949
Oh, that bucket smells...

436
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,283
interesting.

437
00:26:45,783 --> 00:26:47,574
Fuck.

438
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:27,033
- Lupe?

439
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,157
I was peeing.

440
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:33,533
And a condom fell out.

441
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:35,866
- What?

442
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:38,532
- A condom was inside me.
A condom full of goo.

443
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,282
Just like a goo balloon sitting in there.

444
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,199
Just like a condom full of spermatozoa.

445
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,657
I could get pregnant.

446
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:46,616
My mom's gonna kill me
and then she's gonna kill herself.

447
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:48,449
It's gonna be a murder-suicide,
and my head is killing me.

448
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,574
That could be TSS!

449
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:51,241
Lupe, that could be Toxic Shock Syndrome!

450
00:27:51,242 --> 00:27:54,074
I've never even put a tampon inside me.
It has carcinogens!

451
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:56,199
- It's okay, it's all right, all right?

452
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,616
Your headache is probably just
from a hangover.

453
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:02,491
All right? So let's go to the pharmacy,
get you some aspirin

454
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:05,492
and the Plan B pill, just in case.

455
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:07,741
- Is there an alternative?

456
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:10,116
- You mean a Plan B?

457
00:28:16,992 --> 00:28:19,241
- So basically escuincle
means little kid" but,

458
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:21,199
I love that word,
I love the way it sounds.

459
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,199
Like, come on.
Just try it with me.

460
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,532
Escuincle.

461
00:28:25,658 --> 00:28:27,116
- Escuincle.

462
00:28:27,117 --> 00:28:29,407
Okay, where is this supposed to be?
I don't see it anywhere.

463
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,532
It's in none of these aisles.

464
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:32,699
- Uh, no, we have to go up to the counter.
- What?

465
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
- Yeah.

466
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:37,116
- Indian Mafia. They're everywhere.

467
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:40,699
Sunny, there's no secret network
of Indians reporting back to your mom.

468
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,866
Don't worry about him, okay?
He's a professional.

469
00:28:43,867 --> 00:28:46,033
Come on, let's go.

470
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:50,491
- Good morning.

471
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:54,282
It's so refreshing to see a young
woman from our little slice of the earth.

472
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:56,032
India?
- Yes, sir.

473
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:57,824
My mom's from Tamil Nadu.

474
00:28:57,825 --> 00:28:59,532
- Oh, my family's Punjabi.

475
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:02,491
You know, you really remind me
of my daughter.

476
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,574
She just got into Northwestern.

477
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:06,657
I mean, look at you two, huh?

478
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:09,074
I mean, look at this, the two of you,
you could be twins.

479
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:10,699
Here, hold it up there.
- No, that's okay.

480
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,574
- Come on, please, look, look at this.

481
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:14,741
I wanna get a picture for my wife.

482
00:29:14,742 --> 00:29:18,241
My gosh, look, your spittin' image here.
Oh, God.

483
00:29:18,242 --> 00:29:19,866
Okay, I'll take that back.

484
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:22,616
Very nice. Okay.
- Thank you.

485
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:24,658
- What can I do for you, my dear?

486
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:28,450
- I would like...

487
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:35,366
- I, uh, need the Plan B pill.

488
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,157
- I love you.

489
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:38,867
- The Plan B pill?

490
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:49,574
Do you have any ID?

491
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:50,867
- Yeah.

492
00:29:56,992 --> 00:29:59,074
- Yeah. Oh, you're 17.

493
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:02,199
I'm sorry, but I decline to offer you
the Plan B pill.

494
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,741
Have a nice day.

495
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:06,366
- What? Why? You can't do that.

496
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:07,532
- Yes, I can.

497
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,574
It's a little thing called
the conscience clause.

498
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:12,907
See, any medical professional
in the great state of South Dakota

499
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:15,199
can refuse to sell
birth control drugs to someone

500
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,991
if it goes against their beliefs.

501
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:19,533
And around here it does.

502
00:30:20,158 --> 00:30:22,199
Honestly, it really
helps me sleep at night.

503
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,366
- Okay. What about me? Her.

504
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,949
What are we supposed to do here?

505
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,033
- I'm sorry, but my hands are tied,
morally speaking.

506
00:30:32,408 --> 00:30:34,032
- Conscience clause?
- Sunny.

507
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,241
- A conscience clause.
- Hey, wait up.

508
00:30:35,242 --> 00:30:36,741
- How is this even real?

509
00:30:36,742 --> 00:30:39,991
God, one dumb mistake and it's gonna
ruin the rest of my life, great.

510
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,617
Just like my mom said.

511
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:47,283
- Oh my God, she's everywhere.

512
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,574
- Okay, look.

513
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:52,907
Your life is not over.

514
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:54,200
What if we...

515
00:30:55,117 --> 00:30:56,616
Amazon Prime the pill?

516
00:30:56,617 --> 00:31:00,366
- Tomorrow's Sunday, so it would get here
like Monday the earliest.

517
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:03,157
That's too late.
- What about a hospital?

518
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:05,741
- It'll show up on my insurance. Fuck!

519
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:07,824
Punch me, right now.
Punch me in the uterus.

520
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:10,242
- Wait, you have to already be pregnant
for that to work.

521
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,824
Wait, Planned Parenthood?

522
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:16,367
- Yes! Okay, okay. Google.
Is there one near us?

523
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:20,949
- All right, the nearest one
is in Rapid City.

524
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,074
Not bad.
- Not bad?

525
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:22,992
It's already 1:30.

526
00:31:22,993 --> 00:31:25,741
It's gonna take us like
69 hours to get there.

527
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:26,950
- What?

528
00:31:28,325 --> 00:31:30,949
Why are you looking at biking directions?

529
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,200
- How else are we gonna get there?
We don't have a car.

530
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,075
- Uh... yeah, we do.

531
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,616
No. No! Absolutely not.

532
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:43,824
- Hmm. Well, picture this.

533
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:46,657
You, your mom, your baby...

534
00:31:46,658 --> 00:31:48,949
Driving around, going to school.

535
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,449
Going to open houses.

536
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,325
"Baby on board" sticker on the back.

537
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:57,741
- Fine.
- Yeah.

538
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:28,407
- Okay, so ideally I'd take the pill
within 24 hours of...

539
00:32:28,408 --> 00:32:29,574
the encounter.

540
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,449
So, hopefully that should be fine.

541
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:37,032
It's like three hours there...
- Put it all the way back.

542
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:38,033
- I got it.

543
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:40,407
So hopefully it will be like
three hours there and like...

544
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:42,991
hopefully we don't get
like a wait time or anything.

545
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:45,616
So that works out perfectly.

546
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:47,866
So it'll be easy. It'll be so easy, right?

547
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,117
It'll be easy.

548
00:32:49,742 --> 00:32:50,907
- You're not alone.

549
00:32:50,908 --> 00:32:53,158
We're gonna do this together, okay?

550
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:01,533
- No, no, no...
- What? Aah!

551
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:17,616
Nope.

552
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:19,532
Dedicate this next song
to his baby mama Deena,

553
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:21,616
who's in her 23rd hour of labor.

554
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:22,866
Super nope.

555
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,949
As God is my witness...

556
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,616
- Huh. Wonder... wonder what this is.

557
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:35,492
- Is this Christian trap?

558
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:38,574
Yeah, I believe it is.

559
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:43,491
- It's kind of good.

560
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:48,157
- Okay, good, because
I secretly love this song so much.

561
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:50,282
It's so fucking good, dude.

562
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:04,742
- Who are you?

563
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:09,199
- Okay, so like you really like it,
like you know all the words like it?

564
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,032
- Oh, yeah. No, you will too.

565
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:14,032
Oh my God, did you hear that?

566
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:15,491
Did you just fart?
- What?

567
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,741
- No, these are my pretzels.

568
00:34:29,658 --> 00:34:31,825
- God dang, Lupe.
Take it easy on that thing.

569
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,991
- What? It's the mango one.
You love mangoes.

570
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:38,074
- Yeah, but every time I smell mangos now,
I'm picturing your insides rotting.

571
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:40,616
Didn't you read that article I sent you
on popcorn lung?

572
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:42,199
- Yes.

573
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,450
But I didn't finish it because
the title made me hungry.

574
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:48,282
So...

575
00:34:48,283 --> 00:34:49,867
Now that we're...

576
00:34:50,408 --> 00:34:53,199
sittin' in the car for hours alone...

577
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,866
why don't you tell me about
your sexual awakening?

578
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:58,867
- I don't know, it's, it's not a big deal.

579
00:35:00,783 --> 00:35:03,699
- Are you being weird about it
'cause he was weird?

580
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,032
Did he keep his cardigan on?

581
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,324
Does he have like a giant
hairy birthmark on his dick?

582
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:08,741
- Eww, no.

583
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:11,407
- Oh my God, did you fuck
on your mom's bed?

584
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:12,616
Or was it on your bed?

585
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:16,116
Did you have that little stuffed elephant
just staring right at you?

586
00:35:16,117 --> 00:35:17,949
Was it like involved in the action
or something?

587
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,325
- Dude, stop.

588
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:26,032
- Wait, was it bad?

589
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:27,532
Did he do something to you?

590
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:29,866
I'll fucking kill him.
- No, don't. No, no, no, no.

591
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:31,032
God, no.

592
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,991
It wasn't...
- Okay.

593
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,992
- I just...

594
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:35,867
I don't know.

595
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:39,825
Merge onto I-90.

596
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:42,907
- It's blocked.

597
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,199
Take the exit.

598
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,949
- Bitch, I can't.

599
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,992
- That's okay, it's all right.
We'll just take the next one.

600
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,824
Okay, we've been driving
around in circles for an hour.

601
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,282
Where in the absolute fuck are we?

602
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:04,866
Please make a U-turn when possible.

603
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:07,449
It's getting late
and I need to get that pill.

604
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,574
It gets dark super early in the winter.

605
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:10,616
We'll make it.

606
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:13,116
Please make a U-turn when possible.

607
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:15,408
- I just did that. I just did that.

608
00:36:16,658 --> 00:36:18,200
I don't like this bitch's tone.

609
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,616
Please make a U-turn when possible.

610
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:24,117
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

611
00:36:25,992 --> 00:36:27,992
Shit, we're in a dead zone.

612
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,200
Fuck.

613
00:36:31,617 --> 00:36:33,200
- Dude, what are we gonna do?

614
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,907
- Oh, uh, my mom keeps a map
behind one of these seats.

615
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:38,907
Can you? I can't...

616
00:36:38,908 --> 00:36:40,824
- Ah, yes.
- Yes, okay.

617
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:41,907
- Okay.
- Okay.

618
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,616
Wonderful.

619
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:44,991
Oh my God.

620
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:46,074
Okay.

621
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:48,866
Look at this thing. It's huge!

622
00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:50,824
Where are we on here?

623
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,116
Okay.

624
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:55,741
- There's a greenish line here.
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:36:55,742 --> 00:36:57,907
What do these red lines mean?
Traffic?

626
00:36:57,908 --> 00:37:00,242
This really needs a pinch-and-zoom.

627
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,700
We were looking at North Dakota.

628
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,116
- Jesus Christ, you know Westeros
like the back of your hand,

629
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:09,907
but you can't tell what state
we're looking at.

630
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:12,282
Wait, wait. I see a light.
I see a light.

631
00:37:12,283 --> 00:37:14,157
We're saved, we're saved, we're saved!

632
00:37:14,158 --> 00:37:15,867
- Yeah!

633
00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:18,367
Fuck you, paper!

634
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:30,158
All right, let's make it quick.

635
00:37:35,325 --> 00:37:36,449
Oh, God!

636
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,699
Oh! Hello, la... Hello, ladies.

637
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,907
- Oh, God.
- A couple of beautiful young women.

638
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:42,491
How are ya?
- You're so beautiful.

639
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:44,491
- Excuse me?
- Looks like we got a couple hot tamales!

640
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:48,032
- Oh-ho-ho, girl, I get it.
- Oh, ho-ho-ho!

641
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:51,699
- I got a place you can put that finger.
- Tasty!

642
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,949
Hey, gimme some sugar, sugar!

643
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,450
- How you doin', sir?
- Thank you for your service.

644
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:58,991
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

645
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:01,574
- Hi, uh, Doris.
- That's right.

646
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:03,907
- I was wondering if you could help me
get back onto the highway.

647
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:06,116
We're headed toward Rapid City.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

648
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,949
You're gonna go right out
to that road you were on

649
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,199
and you're gonna keep on driving till you
get to Neil Larson's corn farm.

650
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,074
- Neil Larson's corn farm?
- Mm-hmm.

651
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:17,199
Ah, you don't know Neil?

652
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,158
- No.

653
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:21,407
- He's the only person around here
who grows dent corn

654
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:23,991
instead of sweet corn.

655
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:27,116
Crazy.

656
00:38:27,117 --> 00:38:29,074
- Yeah. So...

657
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:30,616
- You're gonna start countin'.

658
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:34,074
You're gonna give yourself
a one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi...

659
00:38:34,075 --> 00:38:37,782
You'll go to 20-Mississippi and then
you'll take a right at the doll museum.

660
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,449
- Uh, are there any street names?

661
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,617
- Hmm...

662
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,032
You know, probably.

663
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:46,116
So then you're gonna come to a rock...

664
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:47,699
But not just any rock...

665
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,824
Fist Rock.

666
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:52,616
And then things get a tiny bit strange.

667
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:54,907
There's a few houses
with bullet holes in 'em.

668
00:38:54,908 --> 00:38:57,866
You'll go six more Mississippis,
and you will be on the highway.

669
00:38:57,867 --> 00:39:00,074
- Okay. Think I got that.

670
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:01,491
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

671
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:02,866
- And if you guys got some time...

672
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:05,241
I don't know what you got
and what you don't got...

673
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:09,449
but if you got some time,
get up in that doll museum.

674
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,366
You are gonna love it.

675
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:13,074
It's beautiful, I got married there.

676
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:14,491
- Oh.
- Congratulations.

677
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:18,241
- Yeah, well, "congrats"
is not quite the word.

678
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:19,782
- Oh.
- Hmm-mm.

679
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:20,991
Sorry.

680
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,992
- Something happened.

681
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:27,032
What happened?

682
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,574
- You wanna guess?

683
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,617
- Uh, it was an amicable split?

684
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:33,991
- No. Way worse. You wanna guess?

685
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:36,866
- I don't really want to.
- No.

686
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:38,824
- He did that thing from Footloose,

687
00:39:38,825 --> 00:39:42,449
where he had one...
one foot in each car window

688
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,116
and he was sort of surfing,
but, you know,

689
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,532
one started going faster
and veering a little to the right

690
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:50,574
and one started veering
a tiny bit to the left,

691
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:52,991
and he just split right in half,

692
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:57,199
right up the seam of his balls,
and just right up the middle of his face.

693
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,074
And just, the right half of him
was on one side,

694
00:40:00,075 --> 00:40:01,699
the left half of him was on the other.

695
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,866
So we weren't married very long,
but we had a beautiful wedding

696
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:07,158
amongst those shorthaired dolls.

697
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,116
- How much for the food?

698
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:14,616
- You know what? I like you two.

699
00:40:14,617 --> 00:40:18,575
Let's call it $2.67.

700
00:40:20,242 --> 00:40:22,824
- Look what I got.
- What'd you get?

701
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:27,532
A little token of my friendship, yeah.

702
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:28,991
It's a friendship necklace.

703
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:31,991
- Oh my God, it's so cute!
- Is that cool?

704
00:40:31,992 --> 00:40:33,074
Dude, look at these things.

705
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:35,199
- I wasn't sure about you, but now...

706
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,532
Matching!

707
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:38,782
- Ooooh!
- This is so fun.

708
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:40,907
- Hello, pretty ladies.
- Hello.

709
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:43,616
- Bill and I were just having
a couple of... couple of beers,

710
00:40:43,617 --> 00:40:45,617
just waiting for you to come back.

711
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:49,116
- Why don't you just fuck off, okay?

712
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:51,532
- Okay. We have a little live one here.

713
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,324
- Hey, Bill, I got a question.

714
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,324
You think these two Mexicans
got spicy tacos?

715
00:40:56,325 --> 00:40:58,574
- What are you talking about, our vaginas?
- Yeah.

716
00:40:58,575 --> 00:41:00,699
- I'd like to put my burrito in that taco.

717
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,574
With a side of beans
if you know what I mean.

718
00:41:02,575 --> 00:41:04,657
- I'm South Asian, so like that metaphor
doesn't track, actually.

719
00:41:04,658 --> 00:41:06,366
- What's the equivalent of your taco?

720
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,407
- Rotis, or like naan or something.

721
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:10,449
- They're fucking idiots,
so they won't even get it.

722
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,449
- Why don't you show us?
- I don't think so.

723
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,657
- Please leave.

724
00:41:13,658 --> 00:41:15,657
- If you take one step closer,
I'll pee on you.

725
00:41:15,658 --> 00:41:17,282
Seriously, I'll pee on you, dude.

726
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:20,282
Okay, I saw a TED Talk that says
that peeing discourages sexual assault,

727
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:23,074
so I intend on peeing on you,
and I don't miss, bucko.

728
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:25,825
- You can't even do it.
- All right, Sunny, start peeing. Do it.

729
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:29,282
She's gonna pass out!
She's gonna pass out!

730
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:32,574
- Pee on my face right now!
- Philip Peterson!

731
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:35,158
As I live and breathe,
I thought that was you.

732
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:38,032
- Doris?
- Yeah, Doris.

733
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:40,074
Yeah. We know each other.

734
00:41:40,075 --> 00:41:42,157
- She knows my mom.
- I'll tell her you say hi.

735
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:43,907
- Oh.
- No?

736
00:41:43,908 --> 00:41:47,033
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?

737
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:50,282
B'yitch!

738
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:52,574
Look at her face!
Look at her face!

739
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:54,449
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

740
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,366
Let's talk about it!

741
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:06,324
- I think you boys should leave.

742
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:07,491
- Doris, don't tell my mom!

743
00:42:09,992 --> 00:42:11,866
Let it all come out!

744
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:14,699
- Don't tell her!
Don't tell my mom!

745
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,157
We'll see how it shakes down, Philip.

746
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,949
- Don't tell my mom!
- Oh, man, thank you.

747
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,866
- Sure. Are you okay?
- Yeah, thank you.

748
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:22,074
- Thank you, Doris, thank you so much.
- Okay.

749
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:23,449
What you got in there?

750
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,032
Tobacco, like every other teenager?

751
00:42:26,033 --> 00:42:27,574
- It's, uh...

752
00:42:27,575 --> 00:42:29,532
it's m-m-m-m-marijuana.

753
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:30,533
It's marijuana.

754
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:32,407
- A little weedsie-deedsie?

755
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:36,157
You know, I will trade you
a few hits off of that...

756
00:42:36,158 --> 00:42:38,783
...for those friendship crystals
that you stole.

757
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:41,616
- You stole these?

758
00:42:41,617 --> 00:42:43,157
- They were really overpriced.

759
00:42:43,158 --> 00:42:46,282
- Yeah, she took 'em.
That's why I came out with the bat.

760
00:42:46,283 --> 00:42:47,283
- Oh.
- Oh my gosh.

761
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:48,907
- I'm so so sorry. I just...

762
00:42:48,908 --> 00:42:51,158
- No, it's fine.
I feel like we'll be even stevens.

763
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:56,783
So the condom just fell out?

764
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:01,032
Hmm. I've been there.

765
00:43:01,033 --> 00:43:03,574
- So, uh, I just... I need
the morning after pill, like now.

766
00:43:03,575 --> 00:43:05,532
So that's... what we're trying to do.

767
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:08,408
- We're headed to Planned Parenthood
in Rapid City, so...

768
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:12,086
- Well, I hate to tell you,
but they're probably closed for the night.

769
00:43:12,825 --> 00:43:15,367
- Shit. Fuck.

770
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,366
My 24-hour window is closing rapidly.

771
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:21,824
I'm down to like 61% efficacy
after 48 hours.

772
00:43:21,825 --> 00:43:24,699
- You know, I wonder if my nephew Andy
could help you girls.

773
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,324
- Yeah?
- Oh. What?

774
00:43:26,325 --> 00:43:29,324
- He gets me oxy at Canadian prices.

775
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:33,241
'Cause here it is, uh, too expensive,
and there's some doctors

776
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:34,949
who won't prescribe it.

777
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,742
Like mine.

778
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,949
I think there's only
one hit left in that.

779
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,617
- I feel like there's a little more
so I'm gonna keep going on it.

780
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:48,199
Okay, you know how earlier I told you
to go down to the doll museum

781
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,824
and take that right?

782
00:43:49,825 --> 00:43:52,282
You won't take that right,
you'll just keep counting.

783
00:43:52,283 --> 00:43:53,782
Sixteen Mississippi.

784
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:55,657
And then you're gonna take a left instead.

785
00:43:55,658 --> 00:43:59,366
And he is set up in the playground
next to the middle school.

786
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:02,157
- He's in... he's in the playground?

787
00:44:02,158 --> 00:44:03,991
- Yeah, yeah, that's where his office is.

788
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:07,325
Because he is not allowed to do business
from his mom's house anymore.

789
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:22,408
I think we're here.

790
00:44:32,867 --> 00:44:34,199
Oh, man.

791
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,366
Playgrounds go from fun to creepy
really quick at night.

792
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:39,158
Yo, what do you want?

793
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:42,075
- Hello?

794
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:46,408
We're looking for Andy?
His Aunt Doris sent us here.

795
00:44:47,158 --> 00:44:48,949
- Oh, Auntie D?

796
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:53,158
Yeah! Okay, if she says you're cool.
We can do that b'ness.

797
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,491
Ow!

798
00:44:57,658 --> 00:44:59,449
Welcome to the kingdom.

799
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:02,533
What can I get you fine females
this evening?

800
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,157
- We need the morning after pill.

801
00:45:05,158 --> 00:45:06,574
- Oh, Levonorgestrel?

802
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:09,699
That shit has been flying off my shelves.

803
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,782
All these girls gettin' seeded up.

804
00:45:11,783 --> 00:45:14,075
Like to put that yogurt right in the cup.

805
00:45:15,617 --> 00:45:17,457
Check that shit out.
I got one more right here.

806
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:20,907
- Um, yeah. Okay, that could be anything.

807
00:45:20,908 --> 00:45:22,825
- Nah, girl, it's the pill.

808
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,950
Or speed.

809
00:45:25,408 --> 00:45:28,950
There's like a really small chance
it might be PCP.

810
00:45:33,783 --> 00:45:37,282
No, it's the pill.
Shit, you got me scared.

811
00:45:37,283 --> 00:45:38,574
It's one hundo.

812
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:39,699
- No. No.
- What?

813
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,282
No, I'm sorry, I'm not paying
for an unmarked pill

814
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:44,157
that's probably PCP, no.

815
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,949
- Really small chance it's PCP.

816
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,324
Suit yourself.

817
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:50,366
You want that labeled shit, I got you.

818
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:54,157
I got Premarin, I got Ritalin,
Next Level Latisse.

819
00:45:54,158 --> 00:45:57,032
I got bad coke, I got ephedra.

820
00:45:57,033 --> 00:46:01,032
I smoked two of those, I saw God.
Looked like a rat.

821
00:46:01,033 --> 00:46:02,491
That's just Excedrin.

822
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:05,949
I got meth, I got fake IDs.

823
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,283
I got meth--
- You sell fake IDs?

824
00:46:08,992 --> 00:46:11,074
- Do I sell fake IDs?

825
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:12,574
Eh! Ha ha!

826
00:46:12,575 --> 00:46:16,282
Check it out. Look at this.
I got one that looks just like you.

827
00:46:16,283 --> 00:46:18,616
- Okay, well, Lupe,
if we find a 24-hour pharmacy,

828
00:46:18,617 --> 00:46:21,407
then, I mean, maybe we can...
maybe we can use a fake ID.

829
00:46:21,408 --> 00:46:23,241
- Yeah.
- Oh, here we go.

830
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:25,116
- Great.
- Oh, shit. Look at that.

831
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:26,949
It's like a doppelbanger.

832
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,866
- How much is it?
- Three hundo.

833
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:31,242
- That's steep.

834
00:46:32,075 --> 00:46:34,032
Okay, um, how's...

835
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:36,449
how's 50 bucks and a weed vape?

836
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:39,282
- What? No.
- It's for the cause, dude, I'll pay you back later.

837
00:46:39,283 --> 00:46:41,532
- No, I don't fuck with vapes.
That shit'll kill you.

838
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:44,199
Four hundo.
- It was only three a second ago.

839
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,616
- I don't know what to tell ya,
supply and demand, okay?

840
00:46:46,617 --> 00:46:48,616
Shit, like, fluctuates with the market.

841
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:51,074
But like... I feel ya.

842
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:53,282
If that's too much,
we can find another way...

843
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:55,032
to pay.

844
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:56,575
Some of that...

845
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,366
- What?
- Okay, um...

846
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,032
Okay, gross. Gross!
- Eww!

847
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:04,116
- No.
- God, I'm 17.

848
00:47:04,117 --> 00:47:06,824
- We're both 17. What the fuck.
- Dude, so am I.

849
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:09,700
I just have like literally never
drank water in my life.

850
00:47:10,575 --> 00:47:13,324
- Okay, yeah, no, this is...
we're... this is disgusting.

851
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:15,325
We're gonna just go.
- Hold on.

852
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:19,533
If this is the only way...

853
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:22,449
then it's the only way.

854
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:25,741
- What? No, it's not the only way.
This is not the only way.

855
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,074
- I can't get pregnant, dude.

856
00:47:27,075 --> 00:47:29,657
- You're not gonna get pregnant, but we're
also not gonna fucking suck his dick in a--

857
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:31,032
We're in a playground!

858
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:33,616
- I'm running out of options,
I'm running out of time. I've to do it.

859
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:37,658
- Okay, if it's any consolation,
it's gonna be like so fast.

860
00:47:39,075 --> 00:47:41,574
- Uh, oh, goddamnit.
Okay, we don't have to do this.

861
00:47:41,575 --> 00:47:44,032
- I'm sucking his dick.
- No. No, no. No.

862
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:47,242
No, no. I'm gonna suck his dick.

863
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:49,824
- What? You can't suck his dick.
I'm gonna suck his dick.

864
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,824
- I love you, we're in this together.
I'm gonna suck his dick.

865
00:47:51,825 --> 00:47:53,324
- I'm not gonna let you suck his dick.

866
00:47:53,325 --> 00:47:55,407
- My innocent little
precious little baby, okay?

867
00:47:55,408 --> 00:47:57,532
Doesn't mean anything to me, all right?
I've done this before.

868
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:59,699
- I believe in her, she could do it.
- Just shut up.

869
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,741
- Let me suck his dick.
- No, let me suck his dick.

870
00:48:01,742 --> 00:48:05,116
- It's my mess, it's my problem.
It's my problem, my dick.

871
00:48:05,117 --> 00:48:07,616
- No, I'm gonna do it.
- My problem, my-- Lupe, please!

872
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:09,533
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

873
00:48:13,117 --> 00:48:15,324
Just don't judge me, okay?

874
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:18,116
- What? I would never.

875
00:48:18,117 --> 00:48:20,367
- Oh, shit, that's a good-ass friend.

876
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:26,074
- I'm gonna suck it.
- Go in there and get it.

877
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:27,075
- Okay.

878
00:48:27,076 --> 00:48:29,450
- I'm here if you need me.

879
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,032
- Just don't skull-fuck me, okay?

880
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:35,657
- I can't even move my pelvis like that.

881
00:48:35,658 --> 00:48:37,117
- Okay.

882
00:48:39,825 --> 00:48:41,824
- Oh, fuck, your dick is pierced!

883
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:43,032
Hell, yeah!

884
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:45,449
Oh, yeah, there was
so much blood at Claire's.

885
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,949
You know, personally, I hate it,

886
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,366
but it feels really good for the ladies.

887
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:50,867
- No!
- Oh, you'll see.

888
00:48:58,617 --> 00:49:00,199
- I don't know what I'm doing.

889
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,616
I literally have no idea what I'm doing.
- Uh, right, okay.

890
00:49:02,617 --> 00:49:05,032
Um, just like pretend
you're eating a banana,

891
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:06,574
but don't use your teeth.

892
00:49:06,575 --> 00:49:08,116
- Yeah, definitely don't use your teeth.

893
00:49:08,117 --> 00:49:10,242
- Okay, okay.

894
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:25,657
I'm sorry, I'm out, I can't do it.

895
00:49:25,658 --> 00:49:27,532
- I can't do it.
- Uh...

896
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:28,742
- Sunny.

897
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,616
Sunny!
- Oh my God!

898
00:49:31,617 --> 00:49:32,907
- Sunny, th-th-th-th-the...
- What?

899
00:49:32,908 --> 00:49:35,574
- Th-th-th-th...
- You ripped my dick!

900
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:40,157
- Oh my God!
- What was it...? Oh, fuck!

901
00:49:40,158 --> 00:49:42,366
- Get it out, get it out!
- You ripped my dick!

902
00:49:42,367 --> 00:49:45,741
Holy shit, you're dead!
- Oh my God! Oh my God!

903
00:49:45,742 --> 00:49:48,032
Oh, God!

904
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:50,324
Oh! I want my junk!

905
00:49:50,325 --> 00:49:52,574
Oh, God! I can't see the eye!

906
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,449
- Get in!
- You get back here!

907
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,241
Oh, fuck me, I'm coming!
Oh, fuck, ow!

908
00:49:57,242 --> 00:49:59,032
Is it in my hair? Is it in my hair?

909
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:01,074
Wait. No, no,
it's not in your hair anymore.

910
00:50:01,075 --> 00:50:03,157
It's not in your hair anymore.
It's on the floor, I don't know.

911
00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:04,949
- Ohhh! Fuck you!
- Oh my God!

912
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,782
- Go, go, go!
- Come back here with my dick!

913
00:50:06,783 --> 00:50:08,824
- Oh my God, he's right after...
- Oh, fuck!

914
00:50:08,825 --> 00:50:10,907
- Go, go, go!
- Oh my God!

915
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:12,824
- Fuck you!
- Oh, fuck.

916
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:18,657
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

917
00:50:18,658 --> 00:50:20,032
Who am I? Who am I?

918
00:50:20,033 --> 00:50:22,991
I literally almost sucked
a bedazzled penis for a fake ID.

919
00:50:22,992 --> 00:50:25,074
You did get it, right?
You stole it, you stole it?

920
00:50:25,075 --> 00:50:28,032
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay. And now I'm a thief.

921
00:50:28,033 --> 00:50:29,282
- Here you go.
- Okay, thank you.

922
00:50:29,283 --> 00:50:30,699
- All right.

923
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,824
- What? Dude, this is a 60-year-old man.
What?

924
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:35,491
- Let me see that. Wow.

925
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:37,949
Well, if you don't wax your mustache,

926
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:41,324
you could probably pull off
Pablo Jimenez III.

927
00:50:41,325 --> 00:50:42,532
- Are you fucking kidding me?

928
00:50:42,533 --> 00:50:45,783
I was on my literal knees for a fake ID
that I can't even use?

929
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,157
- Oh, hey.

930
00:50:48,158 --> 00:50:50,657
But I also got...

931
00:50:50,658 --> 00:50:51,783
this.

932
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,741
- Yes, okay, yes, yes, you sneaky genius.

933
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:56,241
Thank you, thank God.

934
00:50:56,242 --> 00:50:58,366
Okay, um, maybe we can look up
what the pill is.

935
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:00,700
Is there anything written on it?
- Let's see...

936
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,157
Uh, a clown face or a "P" or...
- Okay, hold on.

937
00:51:05,158 --> 00:51:06,699
- I don't know.
- Hold on, let me pull over.

938
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,949
It also kind of looks
like a little worn down...

939
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:10,824
like... it's kind of faded.

940
00:51:10,825 --> 00:51:11,991
Is the faded thing good?

941
00:51:11,992 --> 00:51:13,282
- What do you mean, faded?

942
00:51:13,283 --> 00:51:15,741
Faded like it's old?

943
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,032
You know, like, would that be great?

944
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,866
Oh my God, oh my God.

945
00:51:19,867 --> 00:51:22,366
My mom, my mom is calling me.
My mom is calling me. What do we do?

946
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:24,532
- I don't know. This is why
I ignore my dad's phone calls

947
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:28,074
and I just pretend to be the busy signal,
like beep-beep-beep.

948
00:51:28,075 --> 00:51:30,616
Do you want me to try it?
- No, how is that helpful? No!

949
00:51:30,617 --> 00:51:34,157
- Well, she's also gonna know
if you're freaking out, so just be normal.

950
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:36,616
Be normal. Be normal.

951
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:37,657
Be normal. Yeah.

952
00:51:37,658 --> 00:51:40,616
- Yeah.
- Be normal. I'll look for the pill.

953
00:51:40,617 --> 00:51:42,199
- Normal.
- Yeah.

954
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,907
- Be normal.
- Yeah, be normal.

955
00:51:45,575 --> 00:51:46,907
- Helloooo!

956
00:51:46,908 --> 00:51:49,866
Hi, Sunita, how are you?

957
00:51:49,867 --> 00:51:53,532
- Good, good, good, I'm good.
I'm so good! How are you?

958
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:54,699
- Good!

959
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,199
This real estate convention is so crazy.

960
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,907
There are so many people
and new technologies.

961
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,699
Shh!

962
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,991
What was that?

963
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:07,616
- I drank water and it went down
the wrong pipe, Ma. Sorry!

964
00:52:07,617 --> 00:52:09,824
- That's... that is really bad.

965
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:11,824
Be careful when you are swallowing.

966
00:52:11,825 --> 00:52:13,074
- Yes.

967
00:52:13,075 --> 00:52:14,574
Yes, Mom.

968
00:52:14,575 --> 00:52:16,574
I'll be careful when I'm swallowing.

969
00:52:16,575 --> 00:52:19,408
- Okay. Well, I will see you tomorrow.

970
00:52:20,242 --> 00:52:22,491
Sunita?
- Yes, Mom.

971
00:52:22,492 --> 00:52:26,116
- When you finish your prep tests,
look in the cabinet above the microwave.

972
00:52:26,117 --> 00:52:28,117
I left a little surprise for you.

973
00:52:28,742 --> 00:52:30,324
Oh, I can't hide anything from you.

974
00:52:30,325 --> 00:52:33,532
It's a little bag of Hershey Kisses
I made for you when you finish.

975
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:36,532
But no cheating, only after you finish.

976
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:38,199
Okay, my good girl.

977
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,491
I love you.

978
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:40,907
Good night.

979
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,324
- Good night, Mom.

980
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,450
Love you.

981
00:52:53,242 --> 00:52:54,699
I'm a piece of shit, dude.

982
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,450
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

983
00:52:56,867 --> 00:52:59,991
She thinks I'm this perfect person,
her perfect little girl.

984
00:52:59,992 --> 00:53:01,866
Like... what if she knew?

985
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:04,491
Like, what if she knew
that I almost like blew

986
00:53:04,492 --> 00:53:08,116
Monster Energy-drinking goblin?

987
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:12,866
Or that I had sex, I lost my virginity,
in our home bathroom?

988
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:15,616
- She's not gonna find out, okay?
- I think I left the condom in the toilet.

989
00:53:15,617 --> 00:53:17,574
I think I left it in the toilet.
It's just swimming around...

990
00:53:17,575 --> 00:53:18,949
- Sunny, honey.
- ...it's like egg-drop soup.

991
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:21,157
- Sunny. Don't spiral, okay?

992
00:53:21,158 --> 00:53:22,866
Just breathe. Look at me.

993
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,574
Everything is gonna be okay.

994
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:25,617
Okay?

995
00:53:26,575 --> 00:53:28,366
Maybe you need some rest.
Give your eyes a break.

996
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:29,407
Let me take a shift.

997
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:32,282
- Listen, I'm gonna take a break when
all the sperm inside me are dead, okay?

998
00:53:32,283 --> 00:53:35,199
For now, we're going to go to the Planned Parenthood,
we're gonna park out in the parking lot

999
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,991
until we know that they're open.
- Sunny?

1000
00:53:36,992 --> 00:53:38,825
Get out of the car, I'm driving.

1001
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:41,783
- Fine. Shit.

1002
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,415
- Where are we?
- Please don't be mad.

1003
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,782
- Are we in a bowling alley?
- Um...

1004
00:54:53,783 --> 00:54:55,532
- Yeah.
- Lupe!

1005
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:59,532
- I know, but look, Planned Parenthood
is closed for the night, right?

1006
00:54:59,533 --> 00:55:01,907
- Right.
- And then we can't get the pill tonight.

1007
00:55:01,908 --> 00:55:04,407
- So we're going bowling?
- No. Well, possibly.

1008
00:55:04,408 --> 00:55:08,241
But Logan's band is playing here.

1009
00:55:08,242 --> 00:55:09,533
In Agatha.

1010
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:11,824
- Lupe.

1011
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:13,824
- No, look, I know.
- Agatha?

1012
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:16,532
- I know, but look, we got time to kill.

1013
00:55:16,533 --> 00:55:18,741
You know, I just thought it might...
it could be fun.

1014
00:55:18,742 --> 00:55:23,283
Go in there, get a little music action.
- Mm-hmm.

1015
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:25,783
Okay, fine.

1016
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:27,450
- Yeah?

1017
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:28,657
- Fine.
- Okay.

1018
00:55:34,117 --> 00:55:36,407
I used to take singing lessons in Agatha.

1019
00:55:36,408 --> 00:55:37,408
- Oh, yeah?

1020
00:55:37,992 --> 00:55:39,533
- Keys?
- Yeah.

1021
00:55:40,158 --> 00:55:41,575
- Right.
- Got 'em?

1022
00:55:44,158 --> 00:55:45,574
Here you go.
- Thank you.

1023
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:46,782
- Um, do I...

1024
00:55:46,783 --> 00:55:50,200
It's my shirt from the party,
so do I smell... smell good?

1025
00:55:51,242 --> 00:55:52,907
Yeah?
- It's like musky.

1026
00:55:52,908 --> 00:55:54,116
- Okay.
- In a good way.

1027
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,408
- Okay.

1028
00:55:57,617 --> 00:55:58,741
Okay.

1029
00:55:58,742 --> 00:56:00,325
Wait, wait, uh...

1030
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,825
Do I...

1031
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:07,782
Do I look okay?

1032
00:56:07,783 --> 00:56:09,199
- What's happening right now?

1033
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
- No, just like my lines and my...

1034
00:56:12,283 --> 00:56:14,199
- I've never seen you nervous before.

1035
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,032
How are you nervous? Don't kick me.
How are you nervous right now?

1036
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:19,241
It's like one dude in like
a string of dudes.

1037
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,824
I don't understand.

1038
00:56:20,825 --> 00:56:23,825
- Yeah. Uh, I know, I know. I just...

1039
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,825
this one is...

1040
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:28,241
different.

1041
00:56:28,242 --> 00:56:29,574
- Okay, well...

1042
00:56:29,575 --> 00:56:31,449
Okay, but you know that
you're the catch here, right?

1043
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,241
I know you like him,
but you're the catch.

1044
00:56:33,242 --> 00:56:37,366
Like, Lupe, if Logan looks at you
and does not instantly worship you,

1045
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:39,616
then like he's a straight-up dildo, so...

1046
00:56:39,617 --> 00:56:41,699
You know, I'm gonna be there
the whole time.

1047
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,492
I'm with you.
We're together on this.

1048
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:45,742
- Thank you.

1049
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:52,532
- I'm not letting go
so you have to get it.

1050
00:56:55,908 --> 00:56:57,449
- I'm here for you.
- Uh-huh.

1051
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:58,491
- It's gonna be great.
- Uh-huh.

1052
00:56:58,492 --> 00:57:00,282
- It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be awesome.

1053
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,407
- Okay.

1054
00:57:01,408 --> 00:57:03,992
- Oh my God, shit.
Indian Mafia, look.

1055
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,199
- Shit. Indian Mafia.

1056
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,282
- Maybe I should leave just for a second.
- Sunny. Hey.

1057
00:57:10,283 --> 00:57:11,449
- Hunter.
- Holy shit.

1058
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,366
What a turn of events.

1059
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:15,324
- Wha... what are you doing here?

1060
00:57:15,325 --> 00:57:16,949
- My buddies wanted to check out the band,

1061
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,032
and this place doesn't card, so,
you know, it's something to do.

1062
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:21,824
Plus, they have a really cool arcade here.

1063
00:57:21,825 --> 00:57:24,074
They've got X-Men on original hardware.

1064
00:57:24,075 --> 00:57:26,574
Um... What are you guys doing?

1065
00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:30,574
- Well, Lupe... Lupe has
a friend in the band, so...

1066
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:31,699
- Cool. Um...

1067
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,700
Do you guys want to sit with us?
We've got a table.

1068
00:57:34,992 --> 00:57:36,616
- Yeah. Okay.

1069
00:57:36,617 --> 00:57:37,907
All right.

1070
00:57:37,908 --> 00:57:40,699
- Am I still asleep in the car
or am I dreaming?

1071
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,907
- Oh, wet dreaming.

1072
00:57:41,908 --> 00:57:44,782
- Hey, scoot. Look who I found.

1073
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:46,491
- Hey, cool party last night.

1074
00:57:46,492 --> 00:57:47,991
Some really great conversations.

1075
00:57:47,992 --> 00:57:49,866
- Yeah, how... how late did it go?

1076
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:51,283
I... I had to dip out.

1077
00:57:52,075 --> 00:57:53,866
- Um, I don't know. We passed out.

1078
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:55,450
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1079
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,070
Who do you know in the band?

1080
00:58:07,408 --> 00:58:09,616
- We are Rancid Tofu.

1081
00:58:09,617 --> 00:58:11,825
- A-1, 2, 3, 4!

1082
00:58:17,742 --> 00:58:20,824
You're fucking kiddin', right?
you stay out all night

1083
00:58:20,825 --> 00:58:23,491
You wanna love me but you
don't know how to do it right

1084
00:58:23,492 --> 00:58:26,574
I saw your Instagram
you knew I'd see it, man

1085
00:58:26,575 --> 00:58:28,366
I should have let you...

1086
00:58:28,367 --> 00:58:29,574
- I'm gonna go...

1087
00:58:29,575 --> 00:58:31,283
- Get it, girl.

1088
00:58:44,117 --> 00:58:46,533
- Hey, Hunter, I really gotta poop.
Do you wanna come with?

1089
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,741
- No.

1090
00:58:48,742 --> 00:58:50,241
- All right, let's go.

1091
00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:52,949
You know I love you and I'm
never gonna let you down

1092
00:59:04,992 --> 00:59:06,242
- They're good.

1093
00:59:08,575 --> 00:59:10,575
- Yeah, I like them.
- Yeah.

1094
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:14,241
You wanna dance?

1095
00:59:14,242 --> 00:59:15,991
- With me? Like, together?

1096
00:59:15,992 --> 00:59:17,907
- Yeah.
- What about Megan?

1097
00:59:17,908 --> 00:59:19,574
- What about Megan?

1098
00:59:19,575 --> 00:59:20,866
- Didn't you, um...

1099
00:59:20,867 --> 00:59:23,157
Didn't you, like,
hook up at my party or...?

1100
00:59:23,158 --> 00:59:25,199
- No. Whoa! No, no, no, no.

1101
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,616
I gave her a ride home 'cause...
'cause she was like super wasted.

1102
00:59:28,617 --> 00:59:31,867
And then the second she got in my car,
she leaned over and vomited on me.

1103
00:59:32,617 --> 00:59:34,574
- Oh!
- Yeah.

1104
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:37,657
I mean, I was pretty freaked out.
I almost hit a parked car.

1105
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:41,074
You have no idea how hard it is
to get glitter barf out of the upholstery.

1106
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:42,367
- No, I don't.

1107
00:59:45,075 --> 00:59:46,657
- You wanna dance or...?

1108
00:59:46,658 --> 00:59:47,699
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

1109
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,741
- Yes.
- Okay. It's cool.

1110
00:59:49,742 --> 00:59:50,783
- Okay.

1111
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:18,657
- Yeah! Ooh!

1112
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,616
- Hey!
- Hi. I was just texting you.

1113
01:00:55,617 --> 01:00:58,491
Okay, so me and Hunter
are gonna go grab a bite.

1114
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:01,657
So, are you and Logan chilling
for a bit...?

1115
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,866
- Yes!
- Okay.

1116
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,241
- You guessed it.
- Okay.

1117
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:06,782
- Um, can I borrow the keys?
We'll just hang in the car.

1118
01:01:06,783 --> 01:01:08,407
- Oh, yeah, all yours, all yours.

1119
01:01:08,408 --> 01:01:10,366
Um, but wait, no, I wanna meet Logan.

1120
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,616
I'll just tell Hunter to like
wait a second for me.

1121
01:01:12,617 --> 01:01:15,449
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
It's cool. It's cool.

1122
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:17,991
You go chill with your boy, all right?
You can meet Logan after.

1123
01:01:17,992 --> 01:01:19,117
- Okay.

1124
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:21,782
- All right!
- Have fun! Have fun!

1125
01:01:21,783 --> 01:01:24,282
- All right!
- Make sure the condom fits snug!

1126
01:01:24,283 --> 01:01:25,825
- Come on, dude, shush!

1127
01:01:33,408 --> 01:01:34,950
- Hey, uh, Logan?

1128
01:01:37,575 --> 01:01:38,907
- Lupe?

1129
01:01:38,908 --> 01:01:40,907
Oh, hi.

1130
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:43,241
I thought I recognized that ass out there.

1131
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:45,782
Oh, shit, I'm so sweaty.
I'm so sorry.

1132
01:01:45,783 --> 01:01:48,742
- Oh, no, you're... perfect.
- Oh.

1133
01:01:49,283 --> 01:01:51,532
Wow, it is trippy to see you in 3-D.

1134
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:54,282
- I know.
- Uh, uh, did you like the show?

1135
01:01:54,283 --> 01:01:56,907
- Yeah. Oh my gosh.
It was fucking awesome.

1136
01:01:56,908 --> 01:01:58,782
You slayed it on the drums.

1137
01:01:58,783 --> 01:01:59,866
- Aw.
- Seriously.

1138
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:03,991
I've kind of always wanted to play,
but I have terrible rhythm.

1139
01:02:03,992 --> 01:02:06,116
- No, I don't believe that for a second.
I saw you out there.

1140
01:02:06,117 --> 01:02:07,158
Come on.
- Okay.

1141
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,449
- Okay, sit.
- All right.

1142
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:10,574
Whoa, careful!

1143
01:02:10,575 --> 01:02:12,242
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1144
01:02:13,617 --> 01:02:14,700
All right.

1145
01:02:21,867 --> 01:02:24,157
I can't... I...
- You're nailing it.

1146
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:25,533
I mean, you're pretty good.

1147
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:28,532
Hey, yo.

1148
01:02:28,533 --> 01:02:29,825
Logan.

1149
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,450
Ooh.

1150
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:34,324
Well are you gonna introduce me?

1151
01:02:34,325 --> 01:02:37,907
- Ah, Xander, this is Lupe.
- Lupe.

1152
01:02:37,908 --> 01:02:40,407
Oh, so you're the chick
that she's been texting

1153
01:02:40,408 --> 01:02:42,616
during band practice.

1154
01:02:42,617 --> 01:02:44,032
Hey, are you coming to Doug's?

1155
01:02:44,033 --> 01:02:45,241
- I don't know, maybe later.

1156
01:02:45,242 --> 01:02:47,657
I'm just... I'm gonna hang out
with my, um...

1157
01:02:47,658 --> 01:02:49,157
my friend here.

1158
01:02:49,158 --> 01:02:51,616
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah.

1159
01:02:51,617 --> 01:02:56,366
I mean, I have a car,
so if you want later, I could drive you.

1160
01:02:56,367 --> 01:02:58,574
- Oh my God, you have a car?

1161
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:00,699
That's so sick.

1162
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,616
- Okay, that's enough.
- That's so cute.

1163
01:03:02,617 --> 01:03:04,449
- Stop teasing her.
- I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry.

1164
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:06,324
- I'll see you later.
- You two have fun.

1165
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:09,074
I'll call you if I need a ride, okay?
Love you.

1166
01:03:09,075 --> 01:03:10,658
- Fuck off. Love you.

1167
01:03:13,158 --> 01:03:14,741
Sorry.
- Oh, my gosh, he's great.

1168
01:03:14,742 --> 01:03:16,699
- Yeah, he's a lot, but he's the best.

1169
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,532
- Mm, he seems like it.

1170
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:19,991
- Um...

1171
01:03:19,992 --> 01:03:22,075
do you wanna go spark up?

1172
01:03:24,992 --> 01:03:26,117
- Yes.

1173
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,616
This is great.

1174
01:03:29,617 --> 01:03:31,491
- Oh, man.

1175
01:03:31,492 --> 01:03:32,783
Hmm.

1176
01:03:33,742 --> 01:03:35,949
I never get to smoke actual weed.

1177
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:36,950
What?

1178
01:03:36,951 --> 01:03:38,949
- Gotta vape because my dad...

1179
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,157
- The 'rents will catch the sniffs.

1180
01:03:41,158 --> 01:03:42,992
- Indeed, indeed.

1181
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,282
That's...

1182
01:03:46,283 --> 01:03:49,283
really brave of you
to wear that pin around here.

1183
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:52,907
- Of all the names that
I have been called for wearing this,

1184
01:03:52,908 --> 01:03:55,408
"brave" is definitely a first.

1185
01:03:55,992 --> 01:03:57,825
I like your necklace.

1186
01:04:00,075 --> 01:04:02,366
- Thank you.
Uh...

1187
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:04,742
Sunny and I got it at a gas station.

1188
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,824
It's a friendship crystal.

1189
01:04:07,825 --> 01:04:09,032
- Huh.
- Mm-hmm.

1190
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:10,699
- You talk about her a lot.

1191
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:15,407
Are you and Sunny like more than friends?

1192
01:04:15,408 --> 01:04:17,657
- Oh, no. Oh, God.

1193
01:04:17,658 --> 01:04:19,699
Um...

1194
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,407
No, jeez, she's my best friend.

1195
01:04:21,408 --> 01:04:24,574
And I would probably kill for her.

1196
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,866
Literally do anything for her.

1197
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,366
- Hmm.
- Seriously, it's gotten weird.

1198
01:04:29,367 --> 01:04:31,324
Um, but...

1199
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:32,575
No, no.

1200
01:04:33,367 --> 01:04:36,449
Yeah, she doesn't even know I like...

1201
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:38,866
people like you.

1202
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:41,700
- Oh, like really cool people, you mean?

1203
01:04:43,158 --> 01:04:46,491
- Yeah, like really cool people,

1204
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:48,907
regardless of, uh, what's in their pants.

1205
01:04:48,908 --> 01:04:51,407
- Hmm. Have you thought about telling her?

1206
01:04:51,408 --> 01:04:52,950
- Yeah.

1207
01:04:53,408 --> 01:04:57,532
Yeah. I just haven't found
the right moment, you know.

1208
01:04:57,533 --> 01:04:58,783
I don't know.

1209
01:05:01,658 --> 01:05:04,158
Did you ever have a hard time
telling anyone?

1210
01:05:05,575 --> 01:05:06,991
- My parents.

1211
01:05:06,992 --> 01:05:07,992
- Hmm.

1212
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:10,242
Yeah.

1213
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:12,782
So...

1214
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,699
how did you tell them?

1215
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,991
- Oh, I didn't.

1216
01:05:15,992 --> 01:05:17,491
They walked in on me.

1217
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:18,949
Oh, no.

1218
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:22,700
Oh, gosh, that's the worst.
- Yeah.

1219
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:28,324
- So, what happened?
- My mom cried.

1220
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:30,574
Dad called me a disappointment,
and it was, you know...

1221
01:05:30,575 --> 01:05:32,783
went predictably downhill from there.

1222
01:05:33,658 --> 01:05:35,367
- Hmm. Shit.

1223
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:37,408
- Yep.
- Sorry.

1224
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:39,949
My dad's a pastor.

1225
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:41,407
- Whoa.

1226
01:05:41,408 --> 01:05:43,074
- So, yeah.

1227
01:05:43,075 --> 01:05:44,157
Um...

1228
01:05:44,158 --> 01:05:46,032
After my mom died...

1229
01:05:46,033 --> 01:05:48,949
he just got so insanely strict.

1230
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,532
Like I can barely move in that house
without him yelling at me.

1231
01:05:51,533 --> 01:05:54,325
I'm just... too much trouble for him.

1232
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:57,700
This would definitely be the last straw.

1233
01:05:59,158 --> 01:06:02,700
I'd be kicked out and going to hell.

1234
01:06:04,242 --> 01:06:05,825
- Shit.
- Yeah.

1235
01:06:08,075 --> 01:06:09,492
- I'm sorry.

1236
01:06:11,242 --> 01:06:13,157
I moved in with the band,

1237
01:06:13,158 --> 01:06:16,741
afterwards, and, believe it or not,

1238
01:06:16,742 --> 01:06:18,699
it makes a real difference
in your mental health

1239
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,324
when you are free to be who you are.

1240
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:23,782
- Really? What?
- I was shocked.

1241
01:06:23,783 --> 01:06:26,367
- I wonder what that is like?
I don't know.

1242
01:06:39,242 --> 01:06:40,907
- Oh my God, I'm sorry, did I get you?

1243
01:06:40,908 --> 01:06:42,575
- No. You're fine.

1244
01:06:46,242 --> 01:06:48,117
- I think it makes you look brave.

1245
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:53,033
- Fuck it.

1246
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:19,491
I've been loving Ouran High School.

1247
01:07:19,492 --> 01:07:21,074
- Can I have some of your ketchup?
- Sure.

1248
01:07:21,075 --> 01:07:24,324
- I'm more of a Cowboy Bebop kind of guy.
- Oh, really?

1249
01:07:24,325 --> 01:07:26,325
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't have pegged you as that.

1250
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,574
- Did you just dunk that...

1251
01:07:28,575 --> 01:07:30,991
in, like, a full dunk?

1252
01:07:30,992 --> 01:07:32,907
- Mm-hmm. Ketchup.

1253
01:07:32,908 --> 01:07:35,324
- You know, I've often said that
the thing waffles are missing

1254
01:07:35,325 --> 01:07:37,449
is the savory tang of tomato.

1255
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:40,241
- You wouldn't get it.
It's my complicated palate.

1256
01:07:40,242 --> 01:07:41,657
That's weird.

1257
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:45,033
And I've seen my pregnant sister
dip pickles into peanut butter.

1258
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,782
- Your sister's pregnant, cool.

1259
01:07:48,783 --> 01:07:51,116
- Mm-hmm.
- Congrats. That's very exciting.

1260
01:07:51,117 --> 01:07:52,200
- Yeah.

1261
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:55,992
You okay?

1262
01:07:56,908 --> 01:07:59,032
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm great.

1263
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,907
I'm perfect. I'm awesome.

1264
01:08:00,908 --> 01:08:02,158
I'm great.

1265
01:08:03,825 --> 01:08:06,532
- Just as a casual observer,

1266
01:08:06,533 --> 01:08:08,616
you don't seem great.

1267
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,866
- Yeah. No, I'm just like...

1268
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:13,657
I'm having like a weird, rough day.

1269
01:08:13,658 --> 01:08:15,366
- But it's fine, it's great.
- Yeah.

1270
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:16,574
- It's fine, so...
- Yeah.

1271
01:08:16,575 --> 01:08:19,075
- You know, I know someone
who can help with days like that.

1272
01:08:20,325 --> 01:08:23,658
Yes. If you just give me...
just give me like one second.

1273
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:33,824
This is Mr. Waffles.

1274
01:08:33,825 --> 01:08:36,366
And when he's not being a 1940s announcer,

1275
01:08:36,367 --> 01:08:39,825
he's being a waffle,
and a great listener.

1276
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:43,116
- Hi, Mr. Waffles.
- Hello there, Sunny.

1277
01:08:43,117 --> 01:08:46,407
Ooh, hey, let's give him a Belgian accent.
Sacre bleu, Sunny.

1278
01:08:46,408 --> 01:08:48,783
- That's not Belgian.
That's like French.

1279
01:08:49,617 --> 01:08:52,032
- Sunny.
- Hmm?

1280
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:53,658
- What is wrong?

1281
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,950
- Mr. Waffles?
- Yes.

1282
01:08:58,658 --> 01:09:00,199
- Um...

1283
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,782
I just made like
a really dumb mistake, so...

1284
01:09:03,783 --> 01:09:06,282
- Oh, no, Sunny, we all make
mistakes sometimes.

1285
01:09:06,283 --> 01:09:07,617
It's okay.

1286
01:09:08,908 --> 01:09:10,200
What happened?

1287
01:09:14,242 --> 01:09:15,658
- I...

1288
01:09:16,325 --> 01:09:17,367
had...

1289
01:09:18,783 --> 01:09:21,782
I had sex with someone...

1290
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,617
who I don't even like.

1291
01:09:24,742 --> 01:09:27,617
I was drunk and...

1292
01:09:28,367 --> 01:09:30,367
it was meaningless.

1293
01:09:31,325 --> 01:09:32,325
And...

1294
01:09:33,283 --> 01:09:35,949
I don't know, it feels like
ever since that happened, if feels like

1295
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:38,616
the universe has been trying
to punish me or something

1296
01:09:38,617 --> 01:09:41,241
because now there's a big chance
that I might get pregnant,

1297
01:09:41,242 --> 01:09:43,491
so me and Lupe tried to get
the Plan B pill,

1298
01:09:43,492 --> 01:09:45,491
but the Planned Parenthood
is closed down for the night,

1299
01:09:45,492 --> 01:09:48,074
so I'm literally just...

1300
01:09:48,075 --> 01:09:50,116
the dumb slut who is very stressed out,

1301
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:52,532
and I'm sorry for unloading all of this
on you and Mr. Waffles,

1302
01:09:52,533 --> 01:09:56,741
but it just feels like... if you want
to switch booths or something...

1303
01:09:56,742 --> 01:09:58,449
- Sunny, Sunny, stop.
- ...I could totally understand

1304
01:09:58,450 --> 01:09:59,782
because this is embarrassing.
- Stop, whoa!

1305
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:01,449
Stop! No.

1306
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:04,075
First of all, you are not a slut.

1307
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:07,324
That word is a bullshit double standard.

1308
01:10:07,325 --> 01:10:10,449
And second, you are not dumb.
You are the furthest thing from dumb.

1309
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:12,116
You...

1310
01:10:12,117 --> 01:10:14,324
I've been afraid to talk to you
for the last three years

1311
01:10:14,325 --> 01:10:16,866
because you are actually
the smartest girl in school.

1312
01:10:16,867 --> 01:10:19,199
- You were scared of talking to me?

1313
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,324
- Yeah.
- You?

1314
01:10:20,325 --> 01:10:21,325
- Yes.

1315
01:10:21,326 --> 01:10:24,241
When I was new in ninth grade,
you did a presentation

1316
01:10:24,242 --> 01:10:27,657
on the... the finished elements.

1317
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:30,407
And I'm looking around in class
and I'm like, okay, great.

1318
01:10:30,408 --> 01:10:33,199
Yeah, even the teacher's confused,
so I am never

1319
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,200
going to open my mouth around this girl.

1320
01:10:35,908 --> 01:10:39,449
- Number one, um...
it's finite element method.

1321
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:42,907
But secondly, I am very happy

1322
01:10:42,908 --> 01:10:45,450
that you decided to open your mouth, okay?

1323
01:10:47,408 --> 01:10:48,658
- Me too.

1324
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:54,075
And I don't think
that you have to feel guilt...

1325
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,241
or shame.

1326
01:10:56,242 --> 01:11:00,907
I think that you did something that is
totally normal, totally human, and...

1327
01:11:00,908 --> 01:11:03,282
Ms. Flaucher, she might not agree.

1328
01:11:03,283 --> 01:11:05,491
But you know what,
I think that we both know

1329
01:11:05,492 --> 01:11:09,824
that our Sex Ed teacher has come
nowhere near having sex.

1330
01:11:09,825 --> 01:11:11,574
- Why is she the one teaching us?

1331
01:11:11,575 --> 01:11:14,241
- It is a miracle that we're not
all pregnant right now.

1332
01:11:14,242 --> 01:11:18,366
If I didn't have older sisters,
I mean, I would be an idiot.

1333
01:11:18,367 --> 01:11:21,616
And I think you're gonna... you're gonna
figure this out. And it's gonna be okay.

1334
01:11:21,617 --> 01:11:22,825
Let me know if I can help.

1335
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:25,325
- You are helping.

1336
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,617
What am I, chopped liver?

1337
01:11:29,908 --> 01:11:32,991
- Oh...
- Dude, why don't you just...

1338
01:11:32,992 --> 01:11:34,199
- Third wheel?

1339
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,616
- Get out of here. Yeah, third wheel much.

1340
01:11:36,617 --> 01:11:38,449
Well, do not push me away.

1341
01:11:39,742 --> 01:11:40,949
I like her, too.

1342
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,657
Well, dude, we can talk about this later.

1343
01:11:42,658 --> 01:11:46,157
Do not tell me to talk about it later.
I will talk about it right now.

1344
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:48,032
This fucking guy.

1345
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:51,824
Okay, I have one.
So, if you're on a desert island

1346
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:55,991
and you could only bring Rihanna or TLC,
who would you bring?

1347
01:11:55,992 --> 01:11:57,908
And you have to say TLC.

1348
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:01,032
- Mm... yow.

1349
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:02,366
TLC.

1350
01:12:02,367 --> 01:12:04,367
Whoo! I love her.

1351
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:09,033
Mm.

1352
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,283
Well...

1353
01:12:13,408 --> 01:12:16,283
Well, Sunny says
she'll be out front in five.

1354
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:19,532
And she wants to meet you.

1355
01:12:19,533 --> 01:12:20,950
- Are you ready for that?

1356
01:12:22,325 --> 01:12:24,992
- Yeah. I think I am.

1357
01:12:27,117 --> 01:12:28,741
Fuck...

1358
01:12:28,742 --> 01:12:30,575
Oh...

1359
01:12:31,075 --> 01:12:33,282
- What?
- The car smells like weed!

1360
01:12:33,283 --> 01:12:34,699
Oh, no!

1361
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:37,116
Sunny's gonna kill me.
We gotta air this bitch out.

1362
01:12:37,117 --> 01:12:39,157
- You just go get Sunny
and I'll take care of it.

1363
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:40,782
I'll just like roll down
the windows and...

1364
01:12:40,783 --> 01:12:42,617
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.

1365
01:12:44,617 --> 01:12:45,617
- You're the best.

1366
01:12:45,618 --> 01:12:47,532
She's gonna love you.

1367
01:12:47,533 --> 01:12:49,575
Rosie, you're everywhere!

1368
01:12:53,992 --> 01:12:56,492
- This is, uh...?
- Oh, yeah.

1369
01:12:57,033 --> 01:12:58,532
- Yeah.
- It's good.

1370
01:12:58,533 --> 01:13:00,367
- Lupe's waiting for me. So...

1371
01:13:01,283 --> 01:13:04,574
- All right, sorry again about the...
the windows being stuck.

1372
01:13:04,575 --> 01:13:05,907
- No, yeah, that's okay.

1373
01:13:05,908 --> 01:13:08,907
Uh, it helps with... the barf smell.

1374
01:13:08,908 --> 01:13:10,699
- Yeah. Yeah, that's like...

1375
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:14,282
It's gonna be really hard to get out.
- Pungent.

1376
01:13:14,283 --> 01:13:16,408
- Very strong.
- Very... present, yeah.

1377
01:13:20,783 --> 01:13:22,616
- We gotta kiss before you get out.

1378
01:13:22,617 --> 01:13:23,782
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

1379
01:13:23,783 --> 01:13:25,199
Yeah.

1380
01:13:43,117 --> 01:13:44,324
Okay.

1381
01:13:44,325 --> 01:13:45,782
- Okay.
- Bye.

1382
01:13:45,783 --> 01:13:46,783
- Bye.

1383
01:13:51,117 --> 01:13:52,407
Bye, Hunter.

1384
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:53,575
See ya later.

1385
01:13:54,908 --> 01:13:56,992
Whooo!

1386
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:59,574
You look happy.

1387
01:13:59,575 --> 01:14:01,366
You do too.

1388
01:14:01,367 --> 01:14:02,699
- Where's the car?

1389
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,782
- I parked it in the back
for some privacy.

1390
01:14:05,783 --> 01:14:07,574
- Huh. Eww.

1391
01:14:07,575 --> 01:14:09,824
- I can't wait for you to meet Logan.

1392
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:11,449
- Me neither.

1393
01:14:12,867 --> 01:14:14,033
- What?

1394
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:20,741
I don't... Huh. The van, it was...
I don't...

1395
01:14:20,742 --> 01:14:22,950
- Where is it?
- I don't... I don't know.

1396
01:14:23,783 --> 01:14:25,032
Uh...
- How do you not know?

1397
01:14:25,033 --> 01:14:27,117
- No, I left it with Logan for a second.

1398
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:30,324
- You left my car with a stranger?

1399
01:14:30,325 --> 01:14:32,699
- Not a stranger -- Logan!

1400
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,324
- Okay, so where is he?

1401
01:14:34,325 --> 01:14:37,574
- Okay, maybe Logan went
with the band to Doug's party.

1402
01:14:37,575 --> 01:14:39,616
- Okay?
- Okay, where is Doug's party?

1403
01:14:39,617 --> 01:14:41,074
- I don't know.

1404
01:14:41,075 --> 01:14:42,282
- Who's Doug?

1405
01:14:42,283 --> 01:14:43,617
- I don't know.

1406
01:14:45,533 --> 01:14:47,532
- Great.
- Great.

1407
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:48,907
- Great, that's great.

1408
01:14:48,908 --> 01:14:51,407
Cracked the case, Sherlock!
That's great!

1409
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:53,824
- Okay, no, there's gotta be
an explanation, okay?

1410
01:14:53,825 --> 01:14:56,575
- Okay. Text him, then.
Come on, just text him.

1411
01:14:57,575 --> 01:14:59,200
- Left my phone in the van.

1412
01:15:00,492 --> 01:15:01,949
- Great! Great!

1413
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:03,074
Cool!

1414
01:15:03,075 --> 01:15:04,991
- Call Hunter. Call Hunter.

1415
01:15:04,992 --> 01:15:06,117
Text Hunter.

1416
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,867
- I don't have his number.

1417
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,407
And my phone is at 12%.

1418
01:15:11,408 --> 01:15:12,907
This was supposed to be easy.

1419
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:16,450
This was supposed to be three hours there,
three hours back, that's it.

1420
01:15:17,325 --> 01:15:20,491
- Okay, no, look, all right?
We're gonna figure this out.

1421
01:15:20,492 --> 01:15:21,492
Okay?

1422
01:15:21,493 --> 01:15:23,325
We're gonna figure this out.

1423
01:15:26,908 --> 01:15:27,992
What are you doing?

1424
01:15:28,783 --> 01:15:30,407
- It's my only choice at this point.

1425
01:15:30,408 --> 01:15:32,116
- No, it's not, it could be PCP.

1426
01:15:32,117 --> 01:15:35,074
- Really small chance it's PCP, remember?

1427
01:15:35,075 --> 01:15:37,074
- Sunny, Sunny!

1428
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:39,241
No, no!

1429
01:15:39,242 --> 01:15:41,032
You fucking bit my fingers!

1430
01:15:41,033 --> 01:15:43,074
Let me back in there!

1431
01:15:43,075 --> 01:15:44,783
No, spit it out!

1432
01:15:45,492 --> 01:15:46,575
Fuck!

1433
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,450
Great.

1434
01:15:52,908 --> 01:15:54,741
- This is your fault.

1435
01:15:54,742 --> 01:15:56,325
- What?

1436
01:15:57,617 --> 01:16:00,032
How is this my fault?

1437
01:16:00,033 --> 01:16:01,616
- It's not my fault.

1438
01:16:01,617 --> 01:16:05,491
It's not my fault that you got catfished
by anemic Harry Styles.

1439
01:16:05,492 --> 01:16:07,199
It's not my fault that you
forced me to throw that party

1440
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,699
that I didn't even
wanna throw, Lupe, okay?

1441
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:11,907
You're even the one
that handed me the condom.

1442
01:16:11,908 --> 01:16:16,033
- Yeah. For good luck, not so you could
fuck the first guy who gave you attention.

1443
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,283
- Wow. Fuck you.

1444
01:16:22,033 --> 01:16:23,825
- Fuck you!

1445
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,700
- You're a truly shitty friend.

1446
01:16:30,242 --> 01:16:32,032
- I'm a shitty friend?

1447
01:16:32,033 --> 01:16:34,950
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm a shitty friend.

1448
01:16:38,867 --> 01:16:41,241
Friend. Friend... Find My...
Find My Friend.

1449
01:16:41,242 --> 01:16:45,241
You can use the Find My Friend app
to find my phone in the van.

1450
01:16:45,242 --> 01:16:46,658
- Cruel twist of irony.

1451
01:16:47,617 --> 01:16:49,241
Yeah. Thank God.

1452
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:52,949
It's only 300 Mississippis away. Great.

1453
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:54,783
Okay.

1454
01:17:02,617 --> 01:17:04,283
Fuck, it's fucking cold.

1455
01:17:04,992 --> 01:17:06,074
Well, the car's gone,

1456
01:17:06,075 --> 01:17:08,116
but it's a good thing
you still have your weed.

1457
01:17:08,117 --> 01:17:09,282
God, you're the worst.

1458
01:17:09,283 --> 01:17:12,532
You know what?
Give me a fucking break, Sunny.

1459
01:17:12,533 --> 01:17:15,907
Okay? I'm done with your selfish bullshit.

1460
01:17:15,908 --> 01:17:18,032
- I'm selfish? Right.

1461
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,324
- Yeah, yeah.

1462
01:17:19,325 --> 01:17:24,241
Every time Sunny has a problem,
everyone just has to drop everything

1463
01:17:24,242 --> 01:17:25,991
and forget what they're doing,
but you know what?

1464
01:17:25,992 --> 01:17:27,991
I have problems, too, man, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1465
01:17:27,992 --> 01:17:30,866
Like what, getting too high
when you watch the movie Cats?

1466
01:17:30,867 --> 01:17:32,492
Fuck off.

1467
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:37,199
There's the van.

1468
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,116
Shit! It's locked on this side,
is it locked on that side?

1469
01:17:57,117 --> 01:17:58,117
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1470
01:17:58,118 --> 01:18:00,741
Well, I could try to break the car window,
but then the alarm would go off.

1471
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:02,366
Also I would have to explain
to my mom why it's broken

1472
01:18:02,367 --> 01:18:04,532
and that wouldn't be
a very fun conversation to have.

1473
01:18:04,533 --> 01:18:07,407
I don't really have the allowance to pay for it
either because I'm Indian and I don't get allowance.

1474
01:18:07,408 --> 01:18:09,366
- Why are you talking like that?
- How am I talking?

1475
01:18:09,367 --> 01:18:11,491
Are you okay? You're in slow motion.
Catch up.

1476
01:18:11,492 --> 01:18:14,783
- Oh, Sunny, I think
what you took was speed.

1477
01:18:15,783 --> 01:18:17,741
- Oh, that makes a lot of sense
because I feel like I have

1478
01:18:17,742 --> 01:18:19,782
all the solutions
to the world's problems right now.

1479
01:18:19,783 --> 01:18:22,116
Global warming is definitely
the hardest puzzle, but oh my God,

1480
01:18:22,117 --> 01:18:24,116
this would be the perfect time
to take the PSAT--

1481
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:27,324
- Sunny, shut the fuck up. The car.
What do we do about the car?

1482
01:18:27,325 --> 01:18:29,325
- Um, okay, all right, hold on.

1483
01:18:35,533 --> 01:18:37,282
Okay, I went through
all the variables in my head

1484
01:18:37,283 --> 01:18:40,366
and I feel like the only option that we've
is to go inside and confront Logan.

1485
01:18:41,617 --> 01:18:43,658
- I don't think
we're welcome at that party.

1486
01:18:44,617 --> 01:18:47,241
- Twenty-four hours ago we threw
the house party of the year.

1487
01:18:47,242 --> 01:18:48,867
We were born for this.

1488
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,824
- Okay, we just need to find Logan
and to figure it...

1489
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:07,492
Sunny?

1490
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,366
Sunny?

1491
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:10,866
Sunny!

1492
01:19:10,867 --> 01:19:12,158
Fucking Sunny...

1493
01:19:12,867 --> 01:19:14,075
Sunny!

1494
01:19:16,492 --> 01:19:17,533
Sunny!

1495
01:19:23,033 --> 01:19:24,492
Sunny?

1496
01:19:27,533 --> 01:19:29,117
Sunny?

1497
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:35,199
Sunny! What the fuck!
- Sorry, sorry.

1498
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,866
There was an uneven leg,
and I really had to fix it or I would die.

1499
01:19:37,867 --> 01:19:40,407
Like, I actually literally felt
like I was going to actually die.

1500
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:42,742
- Okay, come on, let's go.
We're gonna go.

1501
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:50,574
- Hey! Who are you,
why are you in my house?

1502
01:19:50,575 --> 01:19:52,699
- Oh, your house.
- This is my house.

1503
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,907
- Well, you must be Doug.

1504
01:19:54,908 --> 01:19:56,699
Tell you a funny story,

1505
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:00,241
um, some people that we know
were possibly here

1506
01:20:00,242 --> 01:20:01,907
and it was just
a funny thing that happened--

1507
01:20:01,908 --> 01:20:05,157
- You know what, Doug,
stay the fuck out of it.

1508
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:07,158
It's none of your business.

1509
01:20:18,575 --> 01:20:19,992
- You're crazy.

1510
01:20:21,575 --> 01:20:23,283
I can see you're full of shit.

1511
01:20:23,783 --> 01:20:26,324
And you thought I was full of shit.

1512
01:20:26,325 --> 01:20:29,574
I was just as scared as you were.

1513
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,116
- Okay, dude.
- Come on.

1514
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:33,407
- I think you can see me.

1515
01:20:33,408 --> 01:20:34,782
Why are you going?

1516
01:20:34,783 --> 01:20:38,075
- We have to go solve a problem, Doug.

1517
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:44,075
- Wow.

1518
01:20:46,367 --> 01:20:48,241
- What the fuck, Logan!

1519
01:20:48,242 --> 01:20:50,657
- Lupe, Oh my God,
I was literally just texting you.

1520
01:20:50,658 --> 01:20:52,741
- So sorry, dude.
- My phone is in the van.

1521
01:20:52,742 --> 01:20:54,449
- Fuck.
- You are Logan?

1522
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,699
- Yeah, hi, um...
- Why did you take the car?

1523
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,407
- I didn't-- I didn't, Xander did.

1524
01:20:58,408 --> 01:21:00,991
I tried to stop him,
but he just like literally took off.

1525
01:21:00,992 --> 01:21:03,032
I am so sorry.

1526
01:21:03,033 --> 01:21:04,283
- And who is Xander?

1527
01:21:04,908 --> 01:21:07,407
- Uh... he's my lead singer.

1528
01:21:07,408 --> 01:21:09,491
- Ohh!

1529
01:21:09,492 --> 01:21:11,282
I get it now.

1530
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:15,617
Logan is also a girl's name.

1531
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,491
And an airport.

1532
01:21:17,492 --> 01:21:19,449
But more importantly, it's the name...

1533
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:20,783
Logan's a girl?

1534
01:21:21,867 --> 01:21:23,407
- So where is he with the keys?

1535
01:21:23,408 --> 01:21:27,117
- He is... playing hide-and-seek...

1536
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:30,574
- Sorry, what?
- Think he might be tripping.

1537
01:21:30,575 --> 01:21:32,741
Doug is like always trying
to get Xander to party with him

1538
01:21:32,742 --> 01:21:36,074
and I think maybe this time he said yes
'cause I've literally been looking for him

1539
01:21:36,075 --> 01:21:38,241
for like 20 minutes now.

1540
01:21:38,242 --> 01:21:40,200
- I'm really good at hide-and-seek.

1541
01:21:45,492 --> 01:21:47,991
- So, I'd better go... do that.

1542
01:21:47,992 --> 01:21:50,907
So...
- Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'll help.

1543
01:21:50,908 --> 01:21:53,492
Xander, we need those keys!

1544
01:21:55,408 --> 01:21:57,492
- Xander!
- Xander!

1545
01:21:58,992 --> 01:22:00,407
- I'm sorry.

1546
01:22:00,408 --> 01:22:02,325
Make sure that condom fits snug.

1547
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,699
Xander!

1548
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,741
- Nope, not going in there. Too scary.
Not going.

1549
01:22:09,742 --> 01:22:12,366
Here we go, going back. Okay.

1550
01:22:12,367 --> 01:22:14,699
- No, it's just that these moths...

1551
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,742
they keep flying into the flames and they
don't know that they're gonna die.

1552
01:22:19,158 --> 01:22:20,158
But they do.

1553
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,949
- Sunny, what are you doing?

1554
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:25,033
- It really is sad.

1555
01:22:30,908 --> 01:22:31,950
- There.

1556
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:36,657
- Oh, Xander, what the...
- Shh! They don't know I'm in here.

1557
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:39,241
- Gimme the keys, gimme the keys.
Gimme the keys, gimme the keys.

1558
01:22:39,242 --> 01:22:42,991
- You... I know what you're trying to do.

1559
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:45,532
You're trying to break up the band.

1560
01:22:45,533 --> 01:22:46,533
- Xander, no, she's not.

1561
01:22:46,534 --> 01:22:47,991
Dude, look, I don't know
what Doug gave you

1562
01:22:47,992 --> 01:22:50,449
but you are like
paranoid as fuck right now.

1563
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:53,532
- You're gonna make it all fall apart.

1564
01:22:53,533 --> 01:22:55,574
Like Yoko.

1565
01:22:55,575 --> 01:22:57,325
- What the fuck is a Yoko?

1566
01:22:58,325 --> 01:23:02,199
What is that pretty
little crystal around your neck?

1567
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,450
Is that meth?

1568
01:23:04,867 --> 01:23:06,242
It looks like meth.

1569
01:23:08,658 --> 01:23:10,866
- Ye-ye-yeah-yeah-yes. Yes.

1570
01:23:10,867 --> 01:23:12,866
Yes. My favorite meth.
- Yes.

1571
01:23:12,867 --> 01:23:16,616
- That's why I keep it here
on this chain here close to my heart.

1572
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:19,449
Yep, I've had some wonderful,
wonderful experiences

1573
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,116
with this... meth.

1574
01:23:21,117 --> 01:23:24,824
So why don't you... give us the keys...

1575
01:23:24,825 --> 01:23:26,950
and I'll give you this meth?

1576
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,158
- Keys, keys...

1577
01:23:31,825 --> 01:23:33,366
- Yes. Those keys.

1578
01:23:33,367 --> 01:23:35,366
- Okay. Okay, yeah.

1579
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:37,866
- Okay. All right, come outside.

1580
01:23:37,867 --> 01:23:39,366
- Yeah. Ugh!

1581
01:23:42,075 --> 01:23:45,032
What the fuck!

1582
01:23:46,533 --> 01:23:49,074
- Run! Run! Run!
- Oh, my...

1583
01:23:51,533 --> 01:23:54,657
- I got 'em, I got 'em, I got 'em!
- Wait, there's mud, there's mud.

1584
01:23:54,658 --> 01:23:56,407
What? Oh, shit.

1585
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,907
- Hurry up, we have to trudge!

1586
01:23:59,908 --> 01:24:01,782
My foot's stuck!

1587
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:10,824
Ohh!

1588
01:24:10,825 --> 01:24:12,741
Ugh!

1589
01:24:12,742 --> 01:24:14,407
Let's go!

1590
01:24:16,533 --> 01:24:18,032
- Yoko!

1591
01:24:18,033 --> 01:24:20,713
- I've never seen anything like this.
I don't know what's happening.

1592
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:24,741
Trudge!

1593
01:24:24,742 --> 01:24:26,491
- Stop saying trudge!

1594
01:24:26,492 --> 01:24:29,449
Oh my God, oh my God.

1595
01:24:32,242 --> 01:24:33,407
- Oh my God.

1596
01:24:38,867 --> 01:24:41,241
- Drive!
- I'm trying!

1597
01:24:44,908 --> 01:24:46,199
Fuck!

1598
01:24:51,117 --> 01:24:52,699
- Unlock-- unlock the window.

1599
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:55,575
- Do you wanna get fuckin' murdered?!
- Unlock the window!

1600
01:24:57,117 --> 01:25:00,492
Fuck!

1601
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:04,950
- Okay, go get it! Go get it!

1602
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:07,782
Oh, yes!

1603
01:25:07,783 --> 01:25:09,282
- Yes!
- Watch out!

1604
01:25:13,617 --> 01:25:16,074
- Xander? Oh!

1605
01:25:16,075 --> 01:25:17,449
Xander!

1606
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:19,074
- I killed a man, a man.

1607
01:25:19,075 --> 01:25:21,199
Killed a man, I'm gonna be
pregnant in prison.

1608
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,907
- Sunny, Sunny!

1609
01:25:23,909 --> 01:25:25,449
- Oh my God.

1610
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:26,824
- Oh my God, Xander!

1611
01:25:26,825 --> 01:25:28,532
Oh!

1612
01:25:28,533 --> 01:25:30,032
- My God, are you okay?

1613
01:25:30,033 --> 01:25:32,741
- I think I'm really high, Logan.

1614
01:25:32,742 --> 01:25:35,907
- Yeah, no shit.
You're covered in blood and mud.

1615
01:25:35,908 --> 01:25:38,617
- Hey, that rhymes.

1616
01:25:39,283 --> 01:25:40,949
We could use that.

1617
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:42,449
- Okay, whatever you want.

1618
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:45,282
But right now can you get up?
- Okay.

1619
01:25:45,283 --> 01:25:47,449
- Okay, okay.

1620
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,991
Okay, okay.

1621
01:25:49,992 --> 01:25:51,491
What did I miss?

1622
01:25:51,492 --> 01:25:54,449
Whoa, Xand, you look like
a straight-up monster, bro.

1623
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:56,866
- Doug, Doug, will you
take him into the house, please?

1624
01:25:56,867 --> 01:26:00,366
And never give him
any of your shit ever again?

1625
01:26:00,367 --> 01:26:02,657
- Did you have a bad trip?
- Okay.

1626
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,366
- Did you have a bad trip?

1627
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:07,075
- Sorry.
- I had such a good trip.

1628
01:26:13,825 --> 01:26:14,907
- Fuck.

1629
01:26:14,908 --> 01:26:17,242
I need to go take care of him.

1630
01:26:17,908 --> 01:26:19,699
- Yeah, absolutely.

1631
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:22,157
I'm... I'm... glad he's okay.

1632
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:23,199
- Yeah.

1633
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:26,949
Um... I'm really sorry about, like...

1634
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:28,616
everything that's happened.

1635
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:31,533
This is not how I wanted
our first date to go.

1636
01:26:34,575 --> 01:26:36,949
- Yeah. Well...

1637
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,532
well, at least it was memorable.

1638
01:27:01,242 --> 01:27:02,325
- Bye, Lupe.

1639
01:27:03,033 --> 01:27:04,658
- Bye, Logan.

1640
01:27:40,617 --> 01:27:44,907
- You... you're okay to drive, right?
I mean, you're on speed.

1641
01:27:44,908 --> 01:27:46,282
- No.
- Yeah.

1642
01:27:46,283 --> 01:27:50,158
- But... hitting that guy with the car
really sobered me up.

1643
01:27:50,575 --> 01:27:53,033
No different than my usual
four coffees a day, so...

1644
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,075
- Okay.

1645
01:28:07,742 --> 01:28:10,407
- So, were you just not gonna tell me?
- No...

1646
01:28:10,408 --> 01:28:12,657
I was. I was going to tell you.

1647
01:28:12,658 --> 01:28:14,824
- When? At your wedding?
- No!

1648
01:28:14,825 --> 01:28:17,033
I don't know, I just...

1649
01:28:18,367 --> 01:28:19,742
I was scared...

1650
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,533
that things would change between us.

1651
01:28:23,325 --> 01:28:25,407
- How? What do you mean?
Like, what would change?

1652
01:28:25,408 --> 01:28:27,574
- I don't know. I don't, like...

1653
01:28:27,575 --> 01:28:29,866
Things would get weird.

1654
01:28:29,867 --> 01:28:33,157
I don't know, you'd be afraid
to like change in front of me,

1655
01:28:33,158 --> 01:28:35,991
or like... I was checking you out or...

1656
01:28:35,992 --> 01:28:39,991
like... you know, you wouldn't
wanna have sleepovers anymore.

1657
01:28:39,992 --> 01:28:42,366
- Oh my God, are you nuts?

1658
01:28:42,367 --> 01:28:46,366
I wanna have sleepovers with you
till we're like little old ladies, okay?

1659
01:28:46,367 --> 01:28:50,157
You're my best friend, okay?
My best best friend, and I love you.

1660
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,616
I like actually really love you,
do you understand?

1661
01:28:52,617 --> 01:28:54,908
I love you so much, I love you.

1662
01:28:56,033 --> 01:28:58,116
I love... I love you.

1663
01:28:58,117 --> 01:29:00,907
- Sorry, I do feel a little speedy.
There's a little speed happening.

1664
01:29:00,908 --> 01:29:03,074
- Yeah, okay.
- In and out, in and out.

1665
01:29:03,075 --> 01:29:04,907
- Right, you're good, okay.

1666
01:29:04,908 --> 01:29:06,491
- It's helping my driving, actually.

1667
01:29:08,617 --> 01:29:10,408
- Why is Kyle calling me right now?

1668
01:29:11,367 --> 01:29:12,741
What do you want, Kyle?

1669
01:29:12,742 --> 01:29:14,824
Hey, uh, Sunny, can we talk?

1670
01:29:14,825 --> 01:29:16,991
- Actually, no, um,
a little busy at the moment,

1671
01:29:16,992 --> 01:29:18,199
but like maybe later?

1672
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:23,241
- I know, but I'm having
a really difficult time. Okay?

1673
01:29:23,242 --> 01:29:27,783
I keep thinking about the fact
that we had sex last night!

1674
01:29:28,408 --> 01:29:30,782
I'm tortured! I can't sleep.

1675
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:33,616
- Uh-huh. Totally, totally.
Let's just talk tomorrow about it, okay?

1676
01:29:33,617 --> 01:29:37,992
- I keep thinking about the fact that I
put it in your rear end for a second.

1677
01:29:39,033 --> 01:29:42,117
That's a whole 'nother sin.
We did two sins!

1678
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,408
- Goodbye, Kyle.

1679
01:29:52,408 --> 01:29:53,824
- What?

1680
01:29:53,825 --> 01:29:55,491
- I know, I know.

1681
01:29:55,492 --> 01:29:58,324
- Okay, why didn't you tell me?

1682
01:29:58,325 --> 01:29:59,617
- Because it's Kyle.

1683
01:30:00,242 --> 01:30:03,616
- We're on this whole road trip
because you had sex with Kyle?

1684
01:30:03,617 --> 01:30:05,450
- Okay, don't say it out loud.

1685
01:30:07,867 --> 01:30:08,908
- Uh...

1686
01:30:09,742 --> 01:30:11,116
Do you like him?

1687
01:30:11,117 --> 01:30:12,741
I-I I'm so confused.

1688
01:30:12,742 --> 01:30:13,991
- No.

1689
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:16,533
No. It just like happened, no.

1690
01:30:18,908 --> 01:30:21,325
- Why did you feel like you had
to lie to me about this?

1691
01:30:23,575 --> 01:30:24,908
- I don't know.

1692
01:30:26,617 --> 01:30:28,242
You're so experienced.

1693
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:33,610
And you were so excited
when you thought it was Hunter.

1694
01:30:34,575 --> 01:30:35,575
And...

1695
01:30:35,576 --> 01:30:38,324
I wanted to feel like we were
on the same page for once.

1696
01:30:38,325 --> 01:30:40,157
Like...

1697
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:42,949
I don't know, sometimes when I
talk to you, I feel like this little girl

1698
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:46,283
talking to a fully realized sexual being.

1699
01:30:47,908 --> 01:30:49,283
It gets tiring.

1700
01:30:53,992 --> 01:30:55,408
- I'm sorry.

1701
01:30:56,992 --> 01:31:00,075
I did have sex
with that guy from church camp.

1702
01:31:00,658 --> 01:31:02,742
But that was like once.

1703
01:31:06,867 --> 01:31:08,949
And I just felt like...

1704
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:11,032
it was better to be thought of as a slut

1705
01:31:11,033 --> 01:31:15,532
than as like a lesbo or whatever.

1706
01:31:15,533 --> 01:31:16,949
So I just...

1707
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:19,992
let people think what they wanted to...

1708
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:23,200
and played into it.

1709
01:31:25,492 --> 01:31:26,991
- But I'm not "people."

1710
01:31:26,992 --> 01:31:28,575
- I know.

1711
01:31:29,117 --> 01:31:30,657
And I think I'm...

1712
01:31:30,658 --> 01:31:33,325
ready to stop caring
what people think anyway.

1713
01:31:37,783 --> 01:31:39,533
No more secrets?

1714
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:43,117
No more secrets.

1715
01:31:45,575 --> 01:31:47,824
Um, I do have a question, though.

1716
01:31:47,825 --> 01:31:51,532
Can I call you Fruit Loop now

1717
01:31:51,533 --> 01:31:53,574
or is that like very offensive?

1718
01:31:53,575 --> 01:31:58,407
- You can absolutely call me Fruit Loop
and I will wear that name with pride.

1719
01:31:58,408 --> 01:31:59,741
- Yeah.

1720
01:31:59,742 --> 01:32:00,783
Kewl.

1721
01:32:01,367 --> 01:32:03,574
- Wait, did Kyle say
he put it in your rear end?

1722
01:32:03,575 --> 01:32:04,492
- No.
- No?

1723
01:32:04,493 --> 01:32:07,949
- I'm pretty sure I heard him say
it was in the rear end.

1724
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:09,325
- It was--
- That was...

1725
01:32:10,242 --> 01:32:11,741
Sunny, no secrets!

1726
01:32:11,742 --> 01:32:14,491
- It was more like the taint, if anything.

1727
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:34,699
Look!

1728
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:37,491
Dude, we did it!

1729
01:32:43,158 --> 01:32:44,824
- Yes!
- Yes!

1730
01:32:57,658 --> 01:33:00,116
Fuck, this is it.

1731
01:33:00,117 --> 01:33:02,866
We've made it!

1732
01:33:02,867 --> 01:33:05,407
Oh!

1733
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,782
Can we get breakfast after this?

1734
01:33:06,783 --> 01:33:09,200
No, dude, I gotta get home
before my mom does.

1735
01:33:13,158 --> 01:33:14,782
- We too early?

1736
01:33:14,783 --> 01:33:16,158
No.

1737
01:33:21,158 --> 01:33:22,325
- Sunny?

1738
01:33:24,783 --> 01:33:25,867
Look.

1739
01:33:52,617 --> 01:33:54,241
- Fuck!

1740
01:33:54,242 --> 01:33:56,074
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1741
01:33:56,075 --> 01:33:57,450
Fuck!

1742
01:33:58,825 --> 01:34:01,033
Oh my God!

1743
01:34:04,783 --> 01:34:05,867
- Hey...

1744
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:12,325
Hey...

1745
01:34:14,075 --> 01:34:16,449
W-w-w-we'll figure this out, okay?

1746
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:18,741
We'll... I... I will...

1747
01:34:18,742 --> 01:34:21,617
I'll figure out a way
that we can get it somewhere else.

1748
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:32,158
- Lupe.

1749
01:34:38,367 --> 01:34:40,117
I need my mom.

1750
01:34:41,533 --> 01:34:42,533
- Okay.

1751
01:34:43,158 --> 01:34:44,533
Okay. Come here.

1752
01:34:45,783 --> 01:34:46,908
Okay.

1753
01:34:49,033 --> 01:34:50,699
Hey.

1754
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:51,908
Just breathe.

1755
01:34:58,617 --> 01:35:00,158
- I need my mom.

1756
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:07,242
- Hey, it's okay, just breathe.

1757
01:35:08,075 --> 01:35:09,325
I love you.

1758
01:35:57,950 --> 01:35:59,450
- Hi, Kyle.

1759
01:36:00,033 --> 01:36:02,116
Hey, Sunny, I just...

1760
01:36:02,117 --> 01:36:04,867
wanted to apologize
for freaking out last night.

1761
01:36:07,158 --> 01:36:08,492
- That's okay.

1762
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,532
I was pretty freaked out,
too, to be honest.

1763
01:36:11,533 --> 01:36:15,324
- You know, I realized something
this morning at church.

1764
01:36:15,325 --> 01:36:16,991
God forgives.

1765
01:36:16,992 --> 01:36:20,657
It's like the whole reason
Christianity exists.

1766
01:36:20,658 --> 01:36:22,741
He loves his children no matter what.

1767
01:36:22,742 --> 01:36:25,617
Even if they almost do butt sex.

1768
01:36:26,783 --> 01:36:28,241
I'm gonna hold onto that.

1769
01:36:28,242 --> 01:36:29,867
And I-- I think we'll be okay.

1770
01:36:31,867 --> 01:36:33,033
- Yeah.

1771
01:36:34,158 --> 01:36:35,283
Yeah.

1772
01:36:36,242 --> 01:36:37,367
Thanks.

1773
01:36:38,033 --> 01:36:39,782
- Take care, Sunny.

1774
01:36:39,783 --> 01:36:41,699
Oh, Sunny, I don't know
if I mentioned it before,

1775
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:44,282
but my youth group
is doing a talent show next week...

1776
01:36:44,283 --> 01:36:45,367
- Okay, bye, Kyle!

1777
01:37:16,367 --> 01:37:17,408
- Dad?

1778
01:37:18,492 --> 01:37:19,700
Dad?

1779
01:37:20,867 --> 01:37:22,033
Dad?

1780
01:37:22,825 --> 01:37:24,199
- Guadalupe?

1781
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,492
Oh, mija. Thank God you're okay.

1782
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,074
I was so worried about you.

1783
01:37:29,075 --> 01:37:31,324
Thank you, God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1784
01:37:31,325 --> 01:37:33,616
- Oh, yeah, no, I'm...

1785
01:37:33,617 --> 01:37:35,532
I'm okay.

1786
01:37:35,533 --> 01:37:37,032
Thanks.

1787
01:37:37,033 --> 01:37:39,824
- What happened? Where were you?

1788
01:37:39,825 --> 01:37:41,657
- Uh, I just...

1789
01:37:41,658 --> 01:37:44,907
uh, had to help Sunny with something

1790
01:37:44,908 --> 01:37:46,491
really important,

1791
01:37:46,492 --> 01:37:49,699
and it just took
a lot longer than we thought, so...

1792
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:52,282
- Why didn't you answer my calls?
- You called?

1793
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:54,491
- At least 10 times.
There was this weird busy signal.

1794
01:37:54,492 --> 01:37:57,407
Lupe, you gotta get better at...

1795
01:37:57,408 --> 01:37:59,741
No, you know what? Whatever.

1796
01:37:59,742 --> 01:38:01,616
Look, I'm just glad you're okay.

1797
01:38:01,617 --> 01:38:04,616
Oh, mija, my mind went through
the worst-case scenarios.

1798
01:38:04,617 --> 01:38:08,783
Just kept imagining you getting into
all kinds of crazy situations.

1799
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:12,907
- Yeah, no... crazy situations for me.

1800
01:38:12,908 --> 01:38:15,449
I gotta call your abuela,
tell her you're okay.

1801
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:19,241
Okay, thank God, and don't
ever do this to me again, okay?

1802
01:38:19,242 --> 01:38:20,617
Gonna call your abuela.

1803
01:38:22,367 --> 01:38:23,492
- Hey, Dad?

1804
01:38:28,117 --> 01:38:29,325
- Yeah?

1805
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:35,825
- Pr-promise me you'll never, um,
kick me out.

1806
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:39,532
- What? What do you mean?
Why would I do that?

1807
01:38:39,533 --> 01:38:41,157
- I-I don't know.

1808
01:38:41,158 --> 01:38:44,825
I just, um, you know,
sometimes parents do that.

1809
01:38:45,533 --> 01:38:47,200
- Oh, mija.

1810
01:38:48,283 --> 01:38:49,616
You're my little loquita.

1811
01:38:49,617 --> 01:38:52,032
Okay, it's not my job to judge you.

1812
01:38:52,033 --> 01:38:54,825
It's my job to be your dad,
no matter what.

1813
01:38:55,867 --> 01:38:59,075
You can kill someone
and you will always have a home here.

1814
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,949
I mean, I gotta call your tíos
to bury the body,

1815
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:05,158
gotta deal with my boss upstairs.

1816
01:39:05,867 --> 01:39:08,617
Plus, I will never hear
the end of it from your mom.

1817
01:39:18,033 --> 01:39:19,783
- I love you, Dad.

1818
01:39:20,742 --> 01:39:22,283
- I love you, too, mija.

1819
01:39:32,367 --> 01:39:33,700
Nice pin.

1820
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:44,325
Shut up.

1821
01:39:55,075 --> 01:39:57,824
- Mommy. I need to...

1822
01:39:57,825 --> 01:39:59,866
- You took my car

1823
01:39:59,867 --> 01:40:03,574
without my permission
to some bowling alley in Agatha?

1824
01:40:03,575 --> 01:40:05,699
Damn you, Indian Mafia.

1825
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:08,616
- You could be dead in a ditch!
What were you thinking?

1826
01:40:08,617 --> 01:40:10,407
I trusted you and you lied to me.

1827
01:40:10,408 --> 01:40:12,907
- I...
- What is this?

1828
01:40:12,908 --> 01:40:14,532
What happened to my good girl?

1829
01:40:14,533 --> 01:40:16,949
Because this,
this is not the daughter I raised.

1830
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:20,074
- Maybe it is.
- Do not talk back at me.

1831
01:40:20,075 --> 01:40:23,324
- Maybe I'm not a good girl, Mommy.

1832
01:40:23,325 --> 01:40:27,741
Maybe I'm a terrible person
who deserves terrible things.

1833
01:40:27,742 --> 01:40:31,949
Maybe I should just stop trying
to be perfect for you all the time,

1834
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:35,367
because the me that makes mistakes,
the me that you don't know...

1835
01:40:36,658 --> 01:40:39,075
I feel like it's never
going to be good enough for you.

1836
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:06,367
Sunny?

1837
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:27,533
Why do you think
you are a terrible person?

1838
01:41:43,533 --> 01:41:48,283
You know, growing up
I made a lot of mistakes.

1839
01:41:50,408 --> 01:41:51,825
And I was...

1840
01:41:53,658 --> 01:41:55,325
far from perfect.

1841
01:41:56,617 --> 01:41:58,658
Especially in my own mother's eyes.

1842
01:42:01,742 --> 01:42:04,408
My mother decided everything for me.

1843
01:42:05,367 --> 01:42:07,533
She talked at me, never with me.

1844
01:42:10,658 --> 01:42:13,908
I don't want our relationship
to be like that.

1845
01:42:33,617 --> 01:42:35,492
- I need a morning after pill.

1846
01:42:37,075 --> 01:42:40,074
I need the car because I needed to go
to the closest Planned Parenthood,

1847
01:42:40,075 --> 01:42:43,324
which is very far away,
and I tried to get it at a pharmacy here,

1848
01:42:43,325 --> 01:42:45,574
but the pharmacist refused
to sell me the pill,

1849
01:42:45,575 --> 01:42:47,407
so it turned into a wild goose chase.

1850
01:42:47,408 --> 01:42:50,617
- Wait. What do you mean he refused you?

1851
01:42:51,325 --> 01:42:53,574
- Good afternoon.
How may I help you?

1852
01:42:53,575 --> 01:42:58,242
- I need the Plan B pill,
for my daughter's friend.

1853
01:43:04,242 --> 01:43:05,324
- Okay.

1854
01:43:05,325 --> 01:43:07,032
So glad I'm here to see this.

1855
01:43:07,033 --> 01:43:08,657
Great.

1856
01:43:08,658 --> 01:43:12,199
Now, when we get home, you are both
cleaning all this mud in here.

1857
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,867
It's a total mess!

1858
01:43:18,283 --> 01:43:19,617
What's this?
