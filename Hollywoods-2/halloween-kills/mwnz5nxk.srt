1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,940
Doctor, get back in the car!

2
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,776
No! No.

3
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,153
I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

4
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,199
-Mom! Mom!

5
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,242
Help!

6
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,837
-Pick up.

7
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,548
Pick up.

8
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,134
Dude, where are you?

9
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,469
OSCAR
Hey there, sassy lovers.

10
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,137
-This is Oscar.
-Damn it.

11
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,806
I am unable to take
your call right now

12
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,349
because I'm standing right...

13
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,809
-behind you!

14
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,062
Hey, Oscar, uh, call me
wh-when you get this.

15
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,524
Um, I messed up
with Allyson, man.

16
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,151
I got to find her and, uh,
fix it somehow,

17
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,612
so, uh, if you know where she is

18
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,365
or if you guys are together,
let me know.

19
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,410
All right. Be safe. Bye.

20
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,957
Damn it!

21
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,465
Dude, you okay?

22
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,386
Hey! You okay?

23
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,265
Hey.

24
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,228
Hey, man, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

25
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,063
Oh, no.

26
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,065
Oh, my God. Okay.

27
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,235
Okay.

28
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,071
Help! Help!

29
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,157
Oh, shit. Help!

30
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,034
Somebody help!

31
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,535
Okay, okay.

32
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,661
All right.

33
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,040
All right.
Um, okay, okay, okay.

34
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,918
Okay. All right, man.

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,879
Come on. Come on,
look at me, look at me.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,172
Stay with me, stay with me.

37
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,548
Hawkins, Officer Hawkins.

38
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,717
Okay. Look at me, look at me.
You're good.

39
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,303
Hold on tight.
I'm gonna get help, okay?

40
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,764
-Help! Help!
-He needs to die.

41
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,391
He needs to die.

42
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,268
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on.

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,644
Stay still, stay still,
stay still. Look at me.

44
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,229
-Look at... Look at me.
-He needs to die.

45
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,647
Who needs to die?

46
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,775
He needs to die.

47
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,485
And I'm the one...

48
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,695
that's gonna get him.

49
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,495
Oh, shit.

50
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,247
Haddonfield
Sheriff's Department.

51
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,458
Stop right there.

52
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,631
I said stop!

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,310
Shit.

54
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,648
Shit.

55
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,580
-Hawkins! You all right?

56
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,832
-Did you see him?

57
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,709
-Where did he go?
-Where have you guys been?

58
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,252
I called for backup
ten minutes ago.

59
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,795
Easy, rookie.

60
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,630
Loomis said he shot him
multiple times in the chest.

61
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,132
I saw from 50 yards away.

62
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,385
He crossed right here
and then just disappeared.

63
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,178
Okay. Sullivan, you and Tobias

64
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,722
search Chestnut,
south to the bypass.

65
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,849
Hawkins and I will track
Market Street up to Lampkin.

66
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,891
We'll catch him.

67
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,977
Yeah, kill the bad guy.

68
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,563
Jesus, Frank.

69
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,440
I used to know the guy.

70
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,650
-Michael. We were kids.
-Yeah?

71
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,819
Was he one of those
weirdo freaks who used to pluck

72
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,238
the wings off butterflies
when he was a kid?

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,282
Not that I ever saw.

74
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,992
He was just...

75
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,161
Just killed his sister
when he was six years old?

76
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,205
Yeah. My mom used to make me
go over to his house to play.

77
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,708
She felt bad. But he would just
spend the whole time

78
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,461
staring out of his sister's
bedroom window.

79
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,504
I always remember thinking,

80
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,007
"The hell is he looking at
out there?"

81
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,510
He was looking at Haddonfield.

82
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,847
Simple town where
nothing exciting ever happens.

83
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,432
Yeah.

84
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,393
Then one day, he just snapped.

85
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,529
-Lonnie, Lonnie,
weird and scrawny. -

86
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,199
Has bad dreams,
so cries to mommy.

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,784
He's gonna get you.

88
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,203
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.
He's gonna get you.

89
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,496
Touch Conrad's candy again,

90
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,955
I swear to God
I'll beat your ugly ass!

91
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,207
Yeah, we'll beat your
ugly ass. That's right!

92
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,708
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

93
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,418
-It was Richie.
-Then show me.

94
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,920
Open your hand right now.

95
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,463
-No. -Why don't you
open up your hand?

96
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,756
I don't want to.

97
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,218
-Get off.
-Open your hand!

98
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,845
Leave me alone.

99
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,932
Yeah, okay.

100
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,520
That's what you get when
you fuck with the Mullanys.

101
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,022
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

102
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,735
Hey. Everything all right
with you kids?

103
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,488
Yeah. Just trick-or-treating
with our new old friend Lonnie.

104
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,073
What? You...

105
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,450
You kids see anyone
walking around in a white mask?

106
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,828
It's Halloween.
Everyone's wearing a mask.

107
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,955
That's right. I need you
to go home right now.

108
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,416
Go home to your parents
and lock your doors.

109
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,668
-Why? What did he do?
-What did he do?

110
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,253
He murdered three teenagers
down the street.

111
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,094
Don't get murdered, Lonnie.

112
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,263
--Sleep with
one eye open, Lonnie.

113
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,931
He's gonna get you, Lonnie Elam!

114
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,100
-Boogey, Boogey.
-Did you see his face?

115
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,354
Lonnie, Lonnie,
weird and scrawny.

116
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,606
Has bad dreams,
so cries to mommy.

117
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,233
Be careful, Lonnie.

118
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,776
He's gonna get you,
Lonnie. He's gonna get you.

119
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,278
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.

120
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,988
Sleep with one eye open, Lonnie.

121
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,781
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.

122
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,034
He's gonna get you,
Lonnie Elam.

123
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,475
Help.

124
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,893
Help!

125
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,604
I'm sorry
for tripping Tommy Doyle

126
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,855
and bullying him.

127
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,816
Just... just-just please
don't kill me.

128
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,401
-Hey, kid. You okay?

129
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,028
Hey, whoa. It's all right.
Take it easy.

130
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,363
Where'd he go?

131
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,614
Where is he?

132
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,574
You-you didn't see him?

133
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,118
-Take a deep breath.
-Who?

134
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,162
The Boogeyman.

135
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,499
-He's gonna kill you!
-Whoa. Hey, hey.

136
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,501
-Boogeyman?
-What the hell?

137
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,002
That's it.

138
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,297
That's the Myers house.

139
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,675
That's where it happened.

140
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,844
Halloween, 1963.

141
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,085
-Hey, Frank?

142
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,586
Yeah.

143
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,880
There's a dead dog in here.

144
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,048
What?

145
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,174
Nothing.

146
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,563
Don't shoot!

147
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,898
-Frank. Frank.
-What?

148
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,318
Oh, sh...

149
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,823
Go for it.

150
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,952
PETE
Three, two, one.

151
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,623
Okay.

152
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,085
-Crazy.

153
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,385
Ugh.

154
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,970
Spiderwebs.

155
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,899
Haddonfield.

156
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,526
Where nothing exciting
ever happ...

157
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,157
McCabe?

158
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,330
McCabe?

159
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,249
-McCabe!

160
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,838
Drop him!

161
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,423
Drop him or I'll shoot.

162
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,134
Michael, I'm warning you.

163
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,304
Goddamn it!

164
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,701
Hang on, McCabe.

165
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,369
Pete. Pete, Pete.

166
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,830
Hey, hey. It's-it's okay.

167
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,457
We're gonna get...

168
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,917
We're gonna get you some help,
okay? Just hang in there.

169
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,294
-It's gonna be okay, all right?

170
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,712
-You're gonna stay with me?

171
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,047
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Stay with me, okay?

172
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,214
Stay back! The evil is here!

173
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,217
-Move, move, move!

174
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,552
-Freeze!
-Stop!

175
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,138
Michael, stay where you are.

176
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,723
You got him, right?

177
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,059
We... Tell me we got him.

178
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,477
OFFICER
Stay right there!

179
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,978
Uh-huh.

180
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,231
We got him?

181
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,525
HAWKINS
Oh, my God.

182
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,281
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,200
Sorry.

184
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,911
Oh, God.

185
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,584
Stop!

186
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,002
Michael, stay back.

187
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,754
Hold it right there!

188
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,089
...description of
the subject for confirmation.

189
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,549
-It's him.
-It's him.

190
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,134
It's Michael Myers.

191
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,933
Officer Hawkins, tell me,
what happened in here?

192
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,601
Tell me what happened.

193
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,103
Did Michael kill?

194
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,646
Did Michael kill again?

195
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,574
I thought that was
gonna be, like,

196
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,909
a holiday pizza party

197
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,327
with a bunch of coworkers,
not an orgy.

198
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,663
Your vulgar-ass boss
acted inappropriately.

199
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,081
You need to start

200
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,457
standing up for yourself
in these situations.

201
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,084
Yeah, no. That's right.
You're right.

202
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,585
No, stand up for myself.
Now, tomorrow morning,

203
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,254
I'm gonna go in there,
I'm gonna quit that job...

204
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,089
And you're gonna punch
Dr. Mathis in the face.

205
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,425
-Ooh! Champagne.
-Yep. Punch him in the face.

206
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,051
-Okay. -- Yes!
-- Oh, look at you.

207
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,469
With all the shit
happening today,

208
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,263
-two homicides at
a gas station... -

209
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,306
Stop it. We don't even
know if he was on the bus.

210
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,684
Tommy, you're so paranoid.

211
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,937
-Very sous bois.
-Mm, okay.

212
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,605
-Oh. Excuse me.
-Great.

213
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,691
Yeah, that's...
that's a little old French term

214
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,317
meaning this bitch tastes good.

215
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,070
All right!

216
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,783
Hey. Hey.

217
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,910
Hey, hey, guys, guys, guys.

218
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,537
Can you bring it down a tad?

219
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,914
Like, my wife and I are trying
to watch the talent show.

220
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,499
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

221
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,293
-Sorry. -Yeah. Yeah, sorry.
-Sorry about that.

222
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,628
-Appreciate it.
-Okay.

223
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,798
I'm gonna go get us
a couple of drinks.

224
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,467
-You relax.
-Okay.

225
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,261
Well, I'm kind of a
sommelier, but for cheap wines.

226
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,638
-Yeah.
-Yeah, can I get, um,

227
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,307
two of the voodoo
skeleton thing right here?

228
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,601
Hey, look here, don't be
bothered by them motherfuckers

229
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,061
over there, man.

230
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,229
They are friends
with that crazy lady

231
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,982
that almost got killed
by Michael Myers.

232
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,984
No shit.
I-I heard about that.

233
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,486
Wha...
Uh, Laura Stropes or something.

234
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,571
-Laurie Strode.
-Strode, yeah.

235
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,239
The one that survived
Michael Myers.

236
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,033
They come here every Halloween,

237
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,744
and, you know,
tears in their beers.

238
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce

239
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,541
our next thespian.

240
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,796
Now, I used to bust this guy's
balls when we were kids,

241
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,714
but he is all grown-up now.

242
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:09,969
And he's become the most
captivating bird whistler.

243
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,561
-Hey, everybody.
-All right, Tommy!

244
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,897
Uh, Lonnie put me up
to this shit.

245
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,901
Uh, I'm not gonna
whistle for you.

246
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,403
I'm, uh... I'm gonna
tell you a story.

247
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,155
-Ghosts and goblins!
-Oh...

248
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,867
-- You got this, Tommy!
-- Turn off the lights!

249
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,538
Any of you know the story
of the Haddonfield Boogeyman?

250
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,208
Too young to give a shit?
Too drunk to remember?

251
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,046
40 years ago, a madman escaped
from a mental hospital.

252
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,090
It was the night
before Halloween,

253
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,925
and three teenage girls

254
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,844
were walking home
from Haddonfield High.

255
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,555
They had sightings of a...

256
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,225
a ghostlike figure creeping
right through our town.

257
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,103
A man in a white mask.

258
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,023
Or was it more than a man?

259
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,442
He was watching them.

260
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:09,487
Before the night was over,
three people would be murdered.

261
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,158
And in the house next door,
there was a babysitter

262
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,660
and a young boy
and a young girl,

263
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,997
and they were brutally attacked
by this stalker

264
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,335
who had a power beyond
any mortal man.

265
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,881
My name is Tommy Doyle.

266
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,134
And I was that young boy.

267
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:34,888
So, please, join me

268
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,600
in commemorating the victims

269
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,437
and the survivors
of Michael Myers.

270
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,231
-Thank you.

271
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:52,781
Now, we have, uh, the lovely
Miss Lindsey Wallace.

272
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,659
Her babysitter, Annie Brackett,
was executed that night.

273
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,711
And we have
Miss Marion Chambers.

274
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,380
She survived an assault.

275
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,510
We have Lonnie Elam.

276
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,513
Lonnie survived
a face-to-face encounter.

277
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,433
Help!

278
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,645
It's Halloween night
in Haddonfield.

279
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:27,190
When terror's
supposed to be fun.

280
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,693
When we hide behind masks

281
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,945
and we pretend
we aren't what we are.

282
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,822
Is he real?

283
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,657
Who knows?

284
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,659
Who's next?

285
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:42,205
Maybe not tonight,
maybe not tomorrow,

286
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,332
but the Boogeyman
is coming for me.

287
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,459
And he's coming for you.

288
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,713
But he's not gonna get us.

289
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,214
Not this time.

290
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:54,843
Because we will never
succumb to fear.

291
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,177
This is for you, Laurie.

292
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,556
Wherever you are.

293
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,974
We're almost at
the hospital, Mom.

294
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,726
Take deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

295
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,686
We're almost there.
We're almost at the hospital.

296
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,771
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

297
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,440
It's good. It's good.

298
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,191
-It's okay. It's okay.

299
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,193
No, no, no, no.

300
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:15,280
-No, no, no, no, no!
-No!

301
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,657
Oh, let it burn!

302
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,242
No!

303
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,910
Let it burn!

304
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:24,581
MAN Copy that.
Utilities are being shut down.

305
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,542
We got a gas-fed fire in here.

306
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,169
Ten-four. Stand by.

307
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,754
Copy.

308
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,053
Assignment complete.

309
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,221
-Utilities are disengaged.
-Copy.

310
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,806
-Eyes on the roof.
-Watch out.

311
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,558
With you. Let's move.
All right, let's go.

312
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,894
Command Ladder 13, do you copy?

313
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,128
-Mayday. Mayday.

314
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,590
Radio silence.
We have a Mayday alert.

315
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,384
This is Benton
with Engine Eight.

316
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,678
There's been
a structural collapse.

317
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,097
My air supply has been
compromised.

318
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,015
PASS alarm has been activated.

319
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,393
Oh, shit.

320
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,270
Come in, Engine 13.

321
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,357
Oh.
There's someone else down here!

322
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,442
Do you copy?

323
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:44,411
Central,
we have a firefighter down.

324
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,373
All right, team one,
commence rescue.

325
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,501
Benton?

326
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,462
Benton, my hand's here!

327
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,881
Take my hand!

328
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,717
Take my hand now!

329
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,969
Mayday event.
Send in rescue team now.

330
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,512
Grab my hand!

331
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,771
The fuck is that?

332
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,047
Mom, can you hear us?

333
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,091
-All right.
-She was stabbed in the abdomen.

334
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,093
Activate the trauma team.
We got an unconscious female

335
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,011
-with an abdominal injury.
-Can you hear me, Mom?

336
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,388
Possibly penetrating,
multiple contusions.

337
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,597
Mom, can you hear me?

338
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,724
She's losing a lot of blood.

339
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,267
Ma'am, can you tell me
your name?

340
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,477
Allyson, wait here, honey.

341
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,521
Ma'am, can you tell me
your name?

342
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,315
Um, uh, that's... that's my mom.

343
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,483
It's Laurie Strode.

344
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,610
-Strode. She was attacked.
-Laurie.

345
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,070
She's, uh... she's my mom.

346
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,988
Sh-She's been attacked.
She has probably...

347
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,408
Ma'am, I-I think you should
really let a nurse look at you.

348
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,534
I'm fine.

349
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,828
I'm fine.

350
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,957
It's not my blood.

351
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,333
Okay? It's not my blood.

352
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,960
DOCTOR
We'll close up the fascia,

353
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,880
and, uh, we'll loosely
staple the, uh, skin

354
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,548
so it doesn't get infected.

355
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,053
She's lost a good bit of blood,
but it's all controllable.

356
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,763
I think she'll be fine.

357
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:53,641
Get her to the floor,
into the ICU tonight.

358
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,977
The internal organ
will be repaired,

359
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:58,563
and so there shouldn't be
any long-term damage.

360
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:00,190
Her only concern will be

361
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,984
her abdominal wall will be
very sore from the knife wound

362
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,528
and from our midline
incision here.

363
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,992
Thank you for everything.

364
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:12,952
Honey.

365
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,537
Hey.

366
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,581
She's gonna be okay.

367
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,584
She's gonna be okay.

368
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,883
Dad's gone.

369
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,764
He'll always be with us.

370
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,975
Even if we can't see him.

371
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,900
WOMAN
No, I'm not afraid to go.

372
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:46,403
I just don't feel like it.

373
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,488
Besides, I sort of promised
my father

374
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,698
we-we were going to the movies.

375
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:52,242
I don't hear
no more fire trucks.

376
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,745
Goddamn sleep apnea mask
smells like Lucky Strikes

377
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,539
from when
your mother borrowed it.

378
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,207
I smell it, too.

379
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,667
But that stink ain't cigarettes.

380
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,210
That's Laurie Strode's
house on fire.

381
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,672
Well, from-from upstairs,
it looks like they put it out.

382
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,675
But that nut bag lives
a highly flammable lifestyle.

383
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,719
Better not talk no shit
about that woman.

384
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,138
She will fuck you up.

385
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,557
How about you and I
snack on some Cheez-Its

386
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,810
and try a little
Beaujolais nouveau?

387
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,856
Cheap piece of shit.

388
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,607
You don't know
how to fly that thing.

389
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,401
Give me that controller.

390
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,653
-Here, I got you.

391
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,201
The fuck was that?

392
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,162
Somebody in there?

393
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,772
Hey!

394
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,821
SONDRA
You see anything?

395
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,635
Hey, Sondra. Sondra.

396
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,011
There's a big fella
in our bathroom,

397
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:37,055
and he's wearing a monster mask.

398
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,723
Well, what the fuck
does he want?

399
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,184
Who gives a shit?
Call the cops!

400
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,957
Run, Sondra! Run!

401
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,929
No.

402
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,895
Please no.

403
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,527
Fuck...

404
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,219
-Sondra!

405
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,726
Sondra!

406
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,521
Sondra!

407
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,571
Sondra!

408
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:25,181
Hey. I, uh, heard
your speech up there, man.

409
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:27,267
Like, everybody knows
that story,

410
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:30,103
everybody is terrified
of that Boogeyman shit,

411
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,105
-and I had no idea.
-No, I appreciate it.

412
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,648
Yeah. Hey, man, let me...
let me buy you guys a round.

413
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,525
-Drink? Drink? Yeah.
-Appreciate it, man. Thank you.

414
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,235
-Sorry about that earlier, too.
-No, no, no, it's fine.

415
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,154
-It's fine. We're all good here.
-Hey, let me see that.

416
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,905
-- I'm a nurse.
-- Oh, okay.

417
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,866
Is he a real doctor?

418
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,409
-Oh. Thank you. Cheers, Tommy.
-Cheers.

419
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,202
-- Yeah.
-- Let me check you out.

420
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,005
Hey there, Bonnie.

421
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:58,381
You and Clyde need a ride?

422
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,175
Dad, I need you
to come pick me up.

423
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:02,844
I'm, uh... I'm-I'm at
the park near school,

424
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:05,263
and, uh, a police officer
was attacked.

425
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,724
-And, uh...
-Where-where are you?

426
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,190
Keep applying pressure
to external hemorrhage.

427
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,025
How's that pulse?

428
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,453
I've been having a bar
about 50 years.

429
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:30,455
-50 years? -And you started
with your granddaddy, right?

430
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,207
Yeah, my grandpa
who started the business.

431
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,793
That's my grandpa's picture
up here. Yeah, I got...

432
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,419
I got my bat up here.
Huckleberry.

433
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,921
-Old Huckleberry.
-Baseball bat. Excellent.

434
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,297
Oh, if he come back today,
we gonna...

435
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,799
-we got something for him.
-That's right.

436
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,050
-To Brian. To Brian.
-Yeah.

437
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,385
-- To Brian.
-- To Brian.

438
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,844
-Thank you. Yes.
-All right, then.

439
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,054
I knew we came
to the right place.

440
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,139
Hey, guys.
Cameron's in trouble.

441
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,933
Lonnie, what's wrong?

442
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:51,226
Oh, my God.

443
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:59,984
Got a goddamn massacre
on our hands.

444
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,444
-Graham!
-Yes, sir.

445
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:02,696
Establish a perimeter.

446
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,280
Copy that.

447
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,742
Motherfucker!

448
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,744
GRAHAM
Attention, all responders.

449
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:12,414
Be advised, we have
a violent criminal at large,

450
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,124
armed and dangerous.

451
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:15,750
We will deploy all units

452
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:19,462
of frontline and tactical
officers to search the area.

453
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,091
This fugitive is on foot.

454
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,343
His name is Michael Myers.

455
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:28,054
Go get him.

456
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:42,944
-Oh, my God.
-Hey, turn it up.

457
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:45,113
Tommy, look. Hey, turn it up.

458
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:48,158
...service station
earlier today.

459
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,410
This evening,
four bodies were discovered

460
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:53,121
in three homes along
the same residential street.

461
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:56,458
Residents of North Haddonfield
are on high alert.

462
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,293
-Officials are investigating.
-What's gonna stop him?

463
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,711
Less than an hour ago,

464
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,172
Haddonfield authorities
positively identified...

465
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,465
-That's our street.
-...several more victims

466
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,633
in this
South Bastick neighborhood.

467
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:07,802
That reporter is right
outside Mrs. Dewbottom's house.

468
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:09,137
That's right next door
to our house.

469
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,597
...two patients of the local

470
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,640
Smith's Grove State Hospital
unaccounted for

471
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:14,642
after yesterday's
transport bus escape.

472
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,811
Authorities have not
confirmed a connection

473
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:20,231
between those two events,
but police are encouraging

474
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,442
all residents to remain inside

475
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:25,070
until further information
is released.

476
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:28,198
Tonight's tragedy
an eerie reminder of an event

477
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,075
in Haddonfield history

478
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:32,660
this community has spent
decades trying to forget.

479
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:34,537
But police now believe
that more people...

480
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,956
I-I remember him
from 40 years ago.

481
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:39,334
I was laying in my bed,
and he...

482
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:41,836
he stabbed... he...
he killed her.

483
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:43,421
That's-that's Julian.
That's that...

484
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,465
That's that little asshole kid
from across the street.

485
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:47,676
And she was my number-one
main best babysitter.

486
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,678
Yeah, we're gonna go, all right?

487
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,221
Uh, hey, thanks, man.

488
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:53,348
Um, it was nice meeting
you guys, but we got to go.

489
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,183
-- Be careful. --
Oh, y'all be careful, now.

490
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,268
What the hell is happening?

491
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,687
It's Michael. It's got to be.

492
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:00,438
WOMAN
I've lived here my whole life.

493
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,732
This was a safe place,
and now it's not anymore.

494
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,406
Shit. I forgot my stethoscope.

495
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:10,865
Come on, baby,
we got to get home.

496
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,368
I bet that lady still has it.
Hey, I'll be right back.

497
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:36,850
What?

498
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:40,270
-What's wrong?

499
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,604
Baby. Baby, baby.

500
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:42,897
-What? What? What's wrong?
-He's in the car.

501
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:44,232
-What?
-He's in the car.

502
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,567
-Who? What?
-He's in the back seat.

503
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:46,901
Michael Myers is
in the back seat. Go look.

504
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:47,902
-Go look? Hell no!

505
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:49,738
What's wrong with you?

506
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,409
Somebody help me.
He's here.

507
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:55,660
He's in the back seat of my car.

508
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,245
I saw him when I went
to go get in.

509
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:58,747
It's the same guy
you were talking about--

510
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,290
-the one that that was on TV.

511
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:01,666
Tommy, what are you doing?

512
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,918
That nasty snatcher's
in my parking lot?

513
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,587
Yes, sir.

514
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,297
Love lives today.

515
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,840
But evil dies tonight.

516
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,595
Tommy Doyle's gonna fuck him up.

517
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:15,096
He's right there, in my car.

518
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,057
He, uh... he got out of the car

519
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,476
and got into the front
of the car.

520
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:22,020
I saw him.
He looked right at me.

521
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:40,747
Is it him?

522
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:42,499
He's watching us.

523
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,088
I got this.

524
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,256
Tommy, be careful.

525
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,153
Michael.

526
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:13,488
Wake up.

527
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,281
-Oh, my God.

528
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,117
-Tommy, careful!
-Oh, no!

529
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:19,244
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Whoa!

530
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:26,126
Damn.
What in the hell's going on?

531
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:43,852
Fuck!

532
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:45,520
Come on, come on.

533
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:49,232
Look at my damn car.

534
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,234
ANNOUNCER
WURG 94.9.

535
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:52,736
Tommy, careful!

536
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:56,156
Giving you the urge
with Willie the Kid.

537
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:58,491
Haddonfield's home for rock.

538
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:01,995
He thinks he can come
around here and scare us?

539
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:12,881
I'm gonna rip his mask off,
look him in the eye,

540
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:16,676
swing Old Huckleberry here
and say night night.

541
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,889
Night night.

542
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:57,300
Mmm.

543
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:00,637
Hey, Big John.

544
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,269
Hey, Big John!

545
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:17,320
Could you turn that down?

546
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:19,781
Christ, Little John.

547
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:22,117
I thought we were gonna
watch a movie.

548
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:23,910
-No.

549
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:25,161
Fuck that.

550
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:26,663
It's Halloween.

551
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:28,998
Pulled some old spooky records.

552
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,792
Want to get high and dance?

553
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:31,960
It's tempting.

554
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:36,464
Little late
for trick-or-treaters.

555
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,469
-Argh, matey. -Me and my sister
were trick-or-treating,

556
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:43,638
and, uh, we got candy bars
from your house,

557
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,224
and when she bit into it,
there was a rusty razor blade.

558
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,059
Wha... All right.
Calm down, calm down.

559
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:49,519
Now, where is she?

560
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:51,813
She's right, um... there.

561
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,275
Big John!

562
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,860
Big John, come quick!

563
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,528
What, what, what, what?

564
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,363
-What's happened?
-She's bleeding.

565
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:02,407
She swallowed a razor blade.
She's still alive.

566
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,743
-Call 911.
-Can you help her?

567
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:07,078
-Oh.
-She bit her tongue off.

568
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,580
-She's bleeding to death.
-Okay, there's the blade.

569
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,665
-It's in the barf.

570
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,668
The fuck was that?

571
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,503
Did someone just go
in our house?

572
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:19,716
Oh, my God.

573
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,426
-What is it? What?
-Are you okay?

574
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:22,677
-Boo!
-Aah! Jesus!

575
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,096
-We scared you!

576
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:28,433
I got it!

577
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:30,393
You think this is funny, huh?

578
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:33,271
We got you good.

579
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:35,440
I stole the whole damn bowl.

580
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:39,277
You don't know who
you're messing with, do you?

581
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,779
Take it easy, Big John.

582
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,864
-They're too young to know.
-Too young to know what?

583
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,617
Do you have any idea
whose house this was?

584
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,535
No.

585
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:50,872
You ever hear of
Michael fucking Myers?

586
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:53,583
And do you know
what happens to people

587
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:57,712
who come into the Myers home
without an invitation?

588
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,172
We're not even scared.

589
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:02,467
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

590
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:05,345
He stabbed his sister
in the tits.

591
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:08,807
-Yuck.
-Right upstairs.

592
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:16,231
And sometimes,
when the wind blows just right,

593
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,234
we can still hear her ghost

594
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,444
calling out his name.

595
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,446
Oh, sh-she calls.

596
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:25,073
Mm-hmm.

597
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:28,493
Michael.

598
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:32,038
BOTH
Michael...

599
00:39:33,623 --> 00:39:35,250
Get out of my yard,
you little perverts!

600
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:40,547
-Wh
-What was that?

601
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,745
All right, let's go. Let's get
him into code room three.

602
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,788
-What have we got here?
-Internal bleeding,

603
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,623
lacerations,
but he's gonna make it.

604
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:17,208
Call Respiratory
for a ventilator.

605
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,793
-Officer Hawkins.
-Go. Go, go, go.

606
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:20,378
Make sure trauma two is prepped.

607
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,672
And I need help
getting him on the table.

608
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:40,857
Allyson. Allyson.

609
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,527
Hey. Can I speak with you?

610
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:46,821
Ask you a few questions?

611
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:54,829
I was always told
that I couldn't...

612
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:59,084
I couldn't talk about Michael.

613
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,587
I could never acknowledge
the tragedy.

614
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,798
It was as if
my mother's biggest fear

615
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,633
was that my grandmother
was right

616
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:09,344
and the Boogeyman was real.

617
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,179
For 40 years, he was waiting

618
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:12,722
to come and kill my mother.

619
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:15,183
He found where she lived.

620
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,560
He came to her house.

621
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:21,231
She put us in his path.

622
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:25,902
He murdered my husband.

623
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,655
That's what happened.

624
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,657
Well, so how did Michael know?

625
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:34,035
How did he know how to find
your grandmother?

626
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,620
He didn't.

627
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:37,247
It was his doctor.

628
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,374
Michael's doctor.

629
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,543
He is the one that...

630
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:43,878
He took him there.
He knew where to go.

631
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,007
And he's the one
that brought them together.

632
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:51,720
It was his obsession,

633
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:53,471
not Michael's.

634
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:55,140
But we got him.

635
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:58,059
Shot him in the face,
burned him alive

636
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:00,729
so he can't hurt anyone
ever again.

637
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:06,568
I'm sorry, Karen.

638
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,486
Thank you.

639
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:10,405
No one told you?

640
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:12,365
Told me what?

641
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:18,246
Michael Myers is alive.

642
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:19,289
What?!

643
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:22,083
Allyson, Allyson!
Allyson, are you okay?

644
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,960
-Oh, sorry.
-Slow down.

645
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:26,171
-Allyson, please wait.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

646
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:29,090
I'm so sorry. I just want to
help in any way I can, okay?

647
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:31,092
-He's still alive.
-We're going after him.

648
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:32,969
Me, my dad, you,
if you want to come.

649
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,929
-We're joining Tommy Doyle.

650
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:39,059
You need to get
everybody here now.

651
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,353
If he is alive,
he is on his way here.

652
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:43,104
Mom.

653
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:45,899
Honey, I want you to go
and sit in Grandmother's room

654
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,942
and wait there
until she wakes up, okay?

655
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:49,778
-No. -No, no, no.
She-she's coming with us.

656
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:51,237
-We're joining Tommy Doyle.
-She what?

657
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:53,198
I don't know if you've heard,
but they've...

658
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,949
No, the police officers should
be on their way here right now.

659
00:42:54,991 --> 00:42:56,701
Tommy's organizing groups,
groups of people that care.

660
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:58,370
We're gonna go after him.
We're gonna find Michael.

661
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:00,914
I'm going with them.
We're gonna hunt him down,

662
00:43:00,955 --> 00:43:02,791
-and we're gonna put
an end to this. -Yeah.

663
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:05,126
No, he is on his way here.
I keep telling them that.

664
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:08,088
He is stalking her, and we are
staying here to protect her.

665
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:10,757
He's infected your family,
he's infected my family

666
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:12,884
with grief and fear
for 40 years.

667
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,511
He's gonna die tonight.

668
00:43:14,552 --> 00:43:16,388
-He killed Dad. -Clear
the hallway! You have to move!

669
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:18,765
Excuse me! My husband,
he's been very badly hurt!

670
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:20,558
-Clear the hallway, people.

671
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,143
Go back to the waiting area.

672
00:43:22,185 --> 00:43:24,646
Go back to the waiting room.
Clear the hallway.

673
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:27,315
I'm not gonna pretend
this didn't happen.

674
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:29,109
I love Dad, and somebody loves

675
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,195
whoever is laying
under those sheets right now.

676
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:35,949
Look. Look at me.
We failed, baby.

677
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,076
We set a trap,
we set the whole thing on fire,

678
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:39,953
and he lived through it.
Think about that.

679
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:42,080
The police are out there
looking for him.

680
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:44,708
You think you're the one
that's gonna find him?

681
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:48,169
Sit in that room
and wait with your grandmother.

682
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:49,879
Now!

683
00:43:54,634 --> 00:43:56,594
Does the hospital have
security guards?

684
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:58,138
Do you have security guards?

685
00:43:58,179 --> 00:43:59,889
It seems like you should have
security guards

686
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:01,891
in case something
like this happens.

687
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:03,560
And this is happening right now.

688
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:06,521
I mean, my daughter is in here,
my mother is in here,

689
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:08,773
there is a madman
on the loose...

690
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,734
Oh! Oh, God!

691
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,118
Goodbye, Michael.

692
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:56,029
This is for you,
whenever you need it.

693
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:15,924
She's here. She's here.
We found her. Laurie's here.

694
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:18,426
She's in recovery.

695
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:19,803
It's lucky she survived.

696
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,554
I just heard from
one of the police officers

697
00:45:21,596 --> 00:45:22,972
at her compound.

698
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:25,100
11 dead bodies.
They're all first responders.

699
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:27,018
Holy shit.
Cameron's in there.

700
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,020
Three of his friends
were killed.

701
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,772
-It's a madhouse.
-All right, Lonnie, listen.

702
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:32,857
The only way
we're gonna stop this

703
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:34,818
is if we all come together
on this.

704
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:36,069
You're goddamn right.

705
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:37,821
-All right. All right.
-All right?

706
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:42,158
How about this sassy tackle?

707
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:45,161
You have a permit for all these?

708
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:46,246
Some of 'em.

709
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:48,873
-- Dad.
-- Hey, hey.

710
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:52,085
-Where's your girlfriend?
-Uh, she's okay.

711
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:53,920
-She's gonna stay
with her family. -Good for her.

712
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,505
-Hey, Mr. Doyle.
-Hey, buddy.

713
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:57,882
-Lonnie, check it out.

714
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:03,013
You guys are coming, too?

715
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:04,472
Couldn't let you have
all the fun.

716
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:06,224
So many victims
in our neighborhood.

717
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:07,726
Close friends of ours,
and we just want to help out.

718
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:08,977
I'm a doctor.
My husband's a nurse.

719
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,603
I should've guessed.

720
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:12,439
All right, we have to give all
these people protection.

721
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,149
-You got to share your shit,
Lonnie. -All right.

722
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,067
You coming with us?

723
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:18,111
Let's see what you got.

724
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,030
Yeah, just help yourself.

725
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:24,993
Michael Myers has haunted
this town for 40 years.

726
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,496
Tonight, we hunt him down.

727
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:36,504
Excuse me.
I need some good people.

728
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:38,548
People who aren't afraid
to get their hands dirty.

729
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,258
Everybody else needs to go home.

730
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:44,054
So, what do we do
if we find him?

731
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:45,764
Go inside. Go inside.

732
00:46:45,805 --> 00:46:47,515
It's not safe to be out. Go.

733
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:49,059
It's not safe to be out.

734
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,728
Man, I had an altercation
with Myers about an hour ago,

735
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,271
but he escaped.

736
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:55,023
Now, listen, boys,
there's strength in numbers.

737
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:57,108
You cover Spring Creek
to the bypass,

738
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,152
and then let me know
if you see anything.

739
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:02,280
This man is a threat,
and we need to stop him tonight!

740
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:05,867
Nobody ever took him seriously.

741
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:07,660
-Who?
-Dr. Loomis,

742
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:09,704
Michael's first doctor.

743
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:11,373
He knew a killer
when he saw one.

744
00:47:11,414 --> 00:47:13,291
Now, the only way to catch him

745
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,044
is to play by his own game--
the element of surprise.

746
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:17,837
So he thinks
you're going one place,

747
00:47:17,879 --> 00:47:20,090
then you pop up someplace else.

748
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:22,092
And keep your eyes open.

749
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:26,054
Eyes open.

750
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:33,728
Wait, what's going on
over there?

751
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,605
Baby, who is that?

752
00:47:35,647 --> 00:47:37,649
Looks like kids.

753
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:39,150
They all alone?

754
00:47:39,192 --> 00:47:41,277
Marion, give me the flashlight.

755
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:43,405
It's the wrong night to be out.

756
00:47:43,446 --> 00:47:44,572
Careful, Lindsey.

757
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:46,324
-Lindsey, I wouldn't go...
-Stay here.

758
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:51,413
Never fired a gun before.

759
00:47:51,454 --> 00:47:53,915
Right, so I don't even know
why they gave you a gun.

760
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:55,792
It's big, too.
Can you handle it?

761
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,085
-That's a no.

762
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:58,253
Give me, give me.
I shot this shit before.

763
00:47:58,294 --> 00:47:59,754
Okay. If you want it.

764
00:47:59,796 --> 00:48:00,839
I got it.

765
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,632
Okay. Fine.

766
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:06,469
Hey.

767
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:08,430
What are you guys
doing out here?

768
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:10,265
It's Halloween.
We've been trick-or-treating.

769
00:48:10,306 --> 00:48:11,850
-We got a whole bag of candy.
-You guys should not be

770
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:13,226
out here right now, okay?
It's not safe.

771
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:14,436
-You gonna kill me?
-CHRISTY No.

772
00:48:14,477 --> 00:48:15,603
Satan, not today.

773
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:17,772
-Oh, I'm so scared.
-Are you guys alone?

774
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:19,315
-Where are your parents?
-No.

775
00:48:19,357 --> 00:48:21,026
No, we're waiting
for our friend.

776
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:22,652
And, like, there's
a creepy man in a white mask,

777
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:25,405
and he keeps, like, trying
to play hide-and-seek with us,

778
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,615
-and he thinks...
-And I think he's a pervert.

779
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:28,908
Where did you see him?

780
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,160
He's just hiding behind trees.

781
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:31,286
And he pops out like,
"Peekaboo!"

782
00:48:31,327 --> 00:48:32,954
I mean, we're not
three years old.

783
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,289
-Come on, man!
-Oh, look, there he is.

784
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,000
-Oh, hello!
-Hello.

785
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:39,044
MINDY
What the hell are you doing?

786
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:43,006
You want some candy?

787
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:47,552
Is that Dennis's mask?

788
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,262
Run. Go home now.

789
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,306
Before he kills us all!
Get out of here!

790
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:53,141
Run! Do not turn around!

791
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:55,060
Keep going home!

792
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,395
Oh, my God.

793
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:59,314
What if someone is disabled?

794
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:01,149
-Like, that doesn't make any
sense... -Yeah, but...

795
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:03,068
-What the hell is that?

796
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:04,778
-What the fuck?
-It's Michael.

797
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:11,659
Fuck this bullshit! Drive!

798
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:13,161
Go! Go!

799
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:23,755
Drive the fucking...

800
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:26,841
God!

801
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:31,096
-No, whoa! Jesus, Marion.
-Marion, watch it!

802
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:37,143
-Marion, the door's locked!
-I don't want to die in here!

803
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:38,687
-Unlock the door!
-Unlock the door! -Oh!

804
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:40,605
-Come on! -Let me out of here!
-Move! He's behind you!

805
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:42,691
-The door's locked, Marion.
-Move!

806
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:48,530
Go, go!

807
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:49,364
Vanessa, go!

808
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:51,282
Get out of the fucking car!

809
00:49:51,324 --> 00:49:54,077
-I love you, baby!

810
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,454
No!

811
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:58,540
-Let go of her!

812
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:02,168
-Okay, come on. We got to go.
We got to go. -Oh, God.

813
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:06,214
MARION
No.

814
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:07,757
Shoot him! Shoot him, Marion!

815
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:09,217
Hey, Michael.

816
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:11,553
This is for Dr. Loomis.

817
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,187
-Oh, God. No!
-Marion!

818
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:32,949
Come on. Die.

819
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,744
Die, die, die!

820
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,418
-Mom. Oh, God. No, wait.

821
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,088
Stop, stop, please.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

822
00:53:33,129 --> 00:53:34,631
-I'm fine.
-You're not fine.

823
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:37,467
You had a knife
in your fucking stomach.

824
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,803
It's a paper cut.

825
00:53:39,844 --> 00:53:41,763
Where's Allyson?

826
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:45,350
She was supposed
to be in here, with you.

827
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:47,268
-You didn't see her?
-Nah...

828
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,813
I'm so geeked out
on pain meds, kiddo.

829
00:53:49,854 --> 00:53:52,315
Uh, uh, no.

830
00:53:55,235 --> 00:53:56,820
Is everything okay?

831
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,699
She probably just needed
some fresh air.

832
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:06,830
My God, they just leave your
bloody shirt just sitting here?

833
00:54:09,165 --> 00:54:11,042
Karen.

834
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:14,337
Karen.

835
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:17,507
Michael's gone.

836
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:20,010
We got him.

837
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:21,803
That's right. We got him.

838
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:25,598
We burned him
to the goddamn ground.

839
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,934
-Excuse us.

840
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:30,186
Pardon.

841
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:31,771
-Uh, over here.
-Frank?

842
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:33,982
-- Go a little further back.
-- Okay. Okay.

843
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:35,316
-Got the draw sheet?
-Yeah.

844
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:36,651
One, two...

845
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:38,236
-There you go.

846
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:39,696
Okay.

847
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:43,033
You knew my dad?

848
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:45,368
Yeah, I knew Ray.

849
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,329
He used to sell me peyote.

850
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:52,542
I remember once we were out
on Lake Cherokee in this canoe

851
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:55,003
with a shaman from Little Rock.

852
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:58,923
Your-your daddy got freaked out

853
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:00,759
by his own reflection.

854
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,303
He took off his pants,
and he jumped in.

855
00:55:05,096 --> 00:55:07,515
I stopped doing drugs with him,

856
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:10,393
but I'll
-I'll miss him.

857
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:12,228
-- Dad.
-- What? It's true.

858
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,314
No, no, no.
Dad, look, right there.

859
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,608
You see that? That's Tommy.

860
00:55:16,649 --> 00:55:19,069
-- Yeah.
-- Whose car is that?

861
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:21,404
Lindsey's. Shit.

862
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:26,534
Lindsey's car.

863
00:55:26,576 --> 00:55:28,453
It's covered in blood.
There's no bodies.

864
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:30,413
It's Michael.

865
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:32,248
He's here.

866
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,584
Come on, I need you guys.
Come on.

867
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:35,794
Be careful now, all right?

868
00:55:35,835 --> 00:55:37,212
Keep your heads up, eyes open.

869
00:55:37,253 --> 00:55:38,880
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

870
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:41,383
Lindsey!

871
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:43,593
-- Okay.
-- Just be safe, okay?

872
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,428
You, too. Lindsey!

873
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,555
Lindsey!

874
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:51,393
Lindsey!

875
00:55:51,434 --> 00:55:53,436
-- Marion!
-- Marion!

876
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:59,192
You guys be careful, okay?

877
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:00,902
Keep your heads up.

878
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:04,614
Oh, shit, Tommy.

879
00:56:08,284 --> 00:56:10,453
Oh, fuck.

880
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,168
Oh, God.

881
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:34,686
Fuck me.

882
00:56:34,728 --> 00:56:36,604
Yo, Dad, Dad.
What's over there?

883
00:56:36,646 --> 00:56:38,857
We found something.

884
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:41,776
Oh, God.

885
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:47,115
Oh, I'm sorry.

886
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:49,617
-That's Marion, Lonnie.
-He did this.

887
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:52,620
Oh, God, Marion.

888
00:56:52,662 --> 00:56:55,248
Tommy, what the fuck?

889
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:58,001
I'm gonna get you.

890
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:00,503
Come and get it, man.

891
00:57:07,135 --> 00:57:08,511
Over here.

892
00:57:08,553 --> 00:57:10,764
She's over here.

893
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:13,350
LINDSEY
I saw his face.

894
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:14,559
I saw everything.

895
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:15,810
He's still out there.

896
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:17,395
-She's lucky to be alive.
-I saw him.

897
00:57:17,437 --> 00:57:18,646
You saw his face?

898
00:57:18,688 --> 00:57:20,815
He's still out there, Tommy.

899
00:57:20,857 --> 00:57:22,817
You'll be okay, Lindsey.

900
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:24,361
You're gonna be okay.

901
00:57:24,402 --> 00:57:26,988
He's still out there.

902
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:32,035
Frank.

903
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:36,289
Frank, are you awake?

904
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:46,549
Do you remember that night?

905
00:57:46,591 --> 00:57:48,885
At the bar?

906
00:57:50,095 --> 00:57:52,389
You know, I-I never
said anything,

907
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:54,766
'cause I couldn't be sure.

908
00:57:57,602 --> 00:57:59,938
I was so messed up.

909
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,030
But you helped me.

910
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:14,911
I always liked you.

911
00:58:17,997 --> 00:58:20,875
-You so crazy.

912
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:22,877
Fuck you.

913
00:58:26,047 --> 00:58:27,590
Hi.

914
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:30,593
Hi.

915
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:34,305
I remember that night.

916
00:58:34,347 --> 00:58:36,141
Yeah.

917
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:39,561
I kissed you.

918
00:58:39,602 --> 00:58:41,563
Yeah.

919
00:58:41,604 --> 00:58:43,440
I remember.

920
00:58:43,481 --> 00:58:45,734
You held my hand.

921
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,903
That was it.

922
00:58:48,945 --> 00:58:51,823
Now, I was hoping for more.

923
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:56,453
But I knew you were sweet for...

924
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,832
Ben Tramer.

925
00:59:06,004 --> 00:59:07,380
Frank.

926
00:59:10,383 --> 00:59:12,218
We got him.

927
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:15,805
We killed Michael.

928
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:18,391
You ki...

929
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:23,146
Well, it's about time.

930
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:24,939
Ow.

931
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:27,567
-Ow. Don't make me laugh.

932
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:30,028
Oh, good. You're awake.

933
00:59:31,863 --> 00:59:33,698
Now, on a scale from one to ten,

934
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,493
what is your pain level,
with ten being the worst?

935
00:59:36,534 --> 00:59:37,994
Number 11.

936
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,538
This will make the pain go away.

937
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:44,292
Laurie.

938
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:47,087
Nurse, will you do me a favor?

939
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:49,631
Help out my friend here.

940
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:52,217
Make it a double.

941
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:54,719
You stood up to that monster.

942
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:56,763
I tried, Tommy.

943
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:58,807
You know, when we were kids,

944
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:00,809
we used to all dare each other

945
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,811
to sneak into
the old Myers house.

946
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:07,649
Lonnie was the only one
brave enough to do it.

947
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,442
I lied.

948
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:13,321
I never made it inside.

949
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,407
When they arrested
Michael that night,

950
01:00:15,448 --> 01:00:18,076
I was telling my wife
that my daughter was killed,

951
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:21,079
so I wasn't there to put
a bullet in his brain,

952
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:23,164
like we should have.
This is no time for prudence.

953
01:00:23,206 --> 01:00:25,500
How'm I supposed to know
if my brother's alive or not?

954
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:27,752
-I-I don't know. -I've been
waiting here for over an hour.

955
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:29,713
Who the hell's in charge here?

956
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:31,256
Authorized medical
and security personnel only.

957
01:00:31,297 --> 01:00:33,008
There's not enough medical
or security help.

958
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:34,509
-He's going to kill everybody!
-You need to relax.

959
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,094
We've requested backup officers
and medical staff

960
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:37,595
from Russellville
and Eaton County for support,

961
01:00:37,637 --> 01:00:38,930
but no confirmation.

962
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:40,849
We can't handle
this scope a crime scene.

963
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,892
My son.
My son Oscar, is he here?

964
01:00:42,934 --> 01:00:44,060
Uh, I got a call.

965
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:45,770
I'm his mother. Is he alive?

966
01:00:45,812 --> 01:00:47,147
I have no idea, but triage
expansion just opened up.

967
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:48,648
I'm gonna have you sign in
right here.

968
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,025
It's spelled B
-E
-R
-L
-U
-C
-C
-H
-I.

969
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:51,443
Clear the hallway, please.

970
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:52,485
Somebody help!

971
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:53,862
Please, emergency.

972
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:55,030
Take her to
the emergency room, please.

973
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:56,614
You're gonna be okay, Linds.

974
01:00:56,656 --> 01:00:57,907
He's still out there, Tommy.

975
01:00:57,949 --> 01:00:59,659
-Be careful.
-Karen.

976
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:01,411
How are you doing?
How's your mom?

977
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:02,954
-How's Laurie? Is she okay?
-Where's my daughter?

978
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:04,372
She's okay. She's fine.

979
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:05,457
She's with Lonnie and Cameron.

980
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:06,666
No, no, but he's coming here.

981
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:07,959
She's not supposed
to be with them.

982
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:09,919
He's coming here?
How do you know that?

983
01:01:09,961 --> 01:01:12,797
All right, secure a perimeter.
Hospital's on lockdown.

984
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:15,383
-All right, listen, folks.
Listen! -

985
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:16,885
Folks, please.

986
01:01:16,926 --> 01:01:18,553
-The Boogeyman is at large.

987
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:21,389
He's got no choice
but to emerge.

988
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:23,224
He is an apex predator.

989
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:25,560
When he surfaces,
there will be no pause.

990
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:27,062
There will be no empathy.

991
01:01:27,103 --> 01:01:29,731
This ends when Michael is dead!

992
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,941
Michael Myers will be
executed tonight,

993
01:01:31,983 --> 01:01:34,986
and it will not go
without witness!

994
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:38,323
We need all of you.

995
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:40,784
-Evil dies tonight!

996
01:01:40,825 --> 01:01:41,826
Evil dies tonight!

997
01:01:41,868 --> 01:01:43,745
All right, everybody, calm down.

998
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:44,871
The Sheriff's Department
has this...

999
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:45,997
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1000
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,332
Sheriff, we will not calm down.

1001
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:49,000
We have watched
your department fail...

1002
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:50,669
-fail tonight!
-Tommy's right!

1003
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:51,961
This is Haddonfield.

1004
01:01:52,003 --> 01:01:53,922
This is our town.

1005
01:01:53,963 --> 01:01:56,841
He killed my daughter

1006
01:01:56,883 --> 01:01:58,843
and desecrated her body.

1007
01:01:58,885 --> 01:02:00,095
Evil dies tonight.

1008
01:02:00,136 --> 01:02:01,596
Goddamn it, Brackett!

1009
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:03,765
I am the law, not you.

1010
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,934
-Fuck off, Barker.
-Jonesy, get over there!

1011
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:07,185
-Robin, I need you up there.

1012
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:08,853
I need you over here.
You two...

1013
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,230
-Laurie!

1014
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:11,815
-Tommy, you can't
go in there! -Tommy?

1015
01:02:11,856 --> 01:02:13,525
-Tommy, you can't go in there!
-Laurie. Laurie.

1016
01:02:13,566 --> 01:02:15,110
-Tommy!
-Tommy.

1017
01:02:15,151 --> 01:02:17,070
-Laurie. He killed Marion.
-Tommy.

1018
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:19,698
-And he attacked Lindsey, too.
-What? Karen.

1019
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:21,866
We didn't know for sure.
I didn't know what to tell you.

1020
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:24,327
Mom, I just want you to be okay.

1021
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:26,329
Listen, I just want you to know,
when he gets here,

1022
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:29,290
I'm gonna fucking kill him,
because 40 years ago,

1023
01:02:29,332 --> 01:02:31,793
-when I was a kid,
you protected me. -Yeah.

1024
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:34,254
So, tonight,
I'm gonna protect you. Okay?

1025
01:02:34,295 --> 01:02:36,631
Nurse.
You know, I appreciate you,

1026
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:38,675
but could you get out, please?

1027
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:40,593
Like, get out now!

1028
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:42,971
We had him.

1029
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:44,472
How did he escape?

1030
01:02:44,514 --> 01:02:45,974
I don't know. I don't know.

1031
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:47,642
What do we do? We don't
have the police support.

1032
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:49,310
We fight.

1033
01:02:49,352 --> 01:02:50,562
We always fight.

1034
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:53,231
-Go! Find him, Tommy!
-Yeah. I will. I will.

1035
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:55,191
-I... No.
-Mom, don't. Don't.

1036
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:56,735
I need you to listen to me.

1037
01:02:56,776 --> 01:02:58,445
You need to listen to me
right now, okay?

1038
01:02:58,486 --> 01:03:01,865
All right, a lifetime
of preparation, and for what?

1039
01:03:01,906 --> 01:03:03,742
Ray is dead.

1040
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:05,326
So many people are dead.

1041
01:03:05,368 --> 01:03:06,828
We're not equipped.

1042
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:09,664
Allyson's run off
with crazy Lonnie Elam.

1043
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:11,833
People are losing their minds.

1044
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,419
There are authorities
who are trained

1045
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:17,422
to deal with exactly
this kind of... this...

1046
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:19,966
There's a system.

1047
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,178
Well, the system failed.

1048
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:25,096
Now, get the fuck out of my way.

1049
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:27,015
-Don't. No. No.
-No, no, no. Get away.

1050
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:28,183
-What are you doing?
-Karen, no!

1051
01:03:28,224 --> 01:03:29,225
-Stop right now!
-Get away!

1052
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:30,810
I am not gonna let you do this.

1053
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:32,187
-No. Mom.
-Get out of my way.

1054
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:34,064
-Move! -Mom, please,
what are you doing?

1055
01:03:36,274 --> 01:03:38,693
Do you even know what that is?

1056
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,572
It makes the pain go away.

1057
01:03:48,953 --> 01:03:50,538
Let him come for me.

1058
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,748
No.

1059
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,042
Let him take my head
as I take his.

1060
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:56,795
-No.
-Maybe the only way he can die

1061
01:03:56,836 --> 01:03:57,962
is if I die, too.

1062
01:03:58,004 --> 01:04:00,715
-No.
-Karen, you and Allyson

1063
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:02,425
should not have to keep running

1064
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:06,137
because of the darkness
that I created, honey.

1065
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,723
So you just have to let me go.

1066
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:10,809
-Karen, move!
-Mom, stop. Stop, Mom.

1067
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:13,186
Listen. Mom.

1068
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:18,233
Stop.

1069
01:04:18,274 --> 01:04:21,486
I am not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1070
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,824
We want to get married.

1071
01:04:25,865 --> 01:04:27,992
Um...

1072
01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:31,121
Uh, I
-I guess, uh, right away.

1073
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:32,914
Right away, yeah. Right away.

1074
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:36,084
The waggle dance
is how bees communicate.

1075
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:38,086
They share the information
where the flower is

1076
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:39,921
with the rest of the colony.

1077
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:43,967
They communicate
the precise location

1078
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:45,427
by shaking their butts.

1079
01:04:45,468 --> 01:04:47,512
What is in that honey?

1080
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:49,889
WOMAN Hey, Mom,
he wants to talk to you.

1081
01:04:49,931 --> 01:04:53,018
Hello, Mom.
Seymour Moskowitz.

1082
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:54,894
Right. Jewish.

1083
01:04:54,936 --> 01:04:58,440
My mom kept bees
before she died.

1084
01:05:00,734 --> 01:05:02,736
I'm sorry.

1085
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:04,446
I'm sorry, baby.

1086
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:11,619
And now they're
at the back door.

1087
01:05:11,661 --> 01:05:14,789
Halloween's over, kids!

1088
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:22,547
I'll handle it.

1089
01:05:32,557 --> 01:05:33,975
Knock it off!

1090
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:42,150
Well, now they're
at the front door.

1091
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:51,659
Let's scare the shit
out of these kids.

1092
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:05,382
John.

1093
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:09,010
Don't you know
whose house this was?

1094
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:10,679
Huh?

1095
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,764
Honey, don't do anything stupid.

1096
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:14,599
We don't want to get sued.

1097
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:18,728
I bet those bitches
are in the bushes.

1098
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:22,732
Did you lock the back door?

1099
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:24,442
Uh...

1100
01:06:24,484 --> 01:06:25,735
I'll check.

1101
01:06:27,737 --> 01:06:30,448
Next time, I'm coming
with a pitchfork.

1102
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:47,340
Big John?

1103
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:49,718
Big John?

1104
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,765
Yes, Little John?

1105
01:06:57,392 --> 01:07:00,020
Someone's in our house.

1106
01:07:00,061 --> 01:07:02,772
And it's not a child.

1107
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:10,780
Fuck that.

1108
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:26,296
I got this knife.

1109
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:33,428
I got this knife.

1110
01:07:45,231 --> 01:07:47,025
-Fuck off, man.

1111
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:49,194
Get out of my face.

1112
01:07:49,235 --> 01:07:50,987
Lonnie, where are you?

1113
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:52,781
I'm at the hospital right now.

1114
01:07:52,822 --> 01:07:54,574
Yeah, I brought her in to E.R.

1115
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,328
Is that him?

1116
01:07:59,537 --> 01:08:01,623
I saw that guy on TV.

1117
01:08:01,664 --> 01:08:03,708
Back, back, back.

1118
01:08:11,341 --> 01:08:13,009
You know what I mean?

1119
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,471
I have no answer for you.

1120
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:19,516
Help me.

1121
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,227
Help me!

1122
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:28,525
Tommy, what's happening?

1123
01:08:28,566 --> 01:08:30,110
-I don't know.
-Who is it?

1124
01:08:30,151 --> 01:08:31,486
Um...

1125
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:33,780
-Help me! -Who is it?
Is it Michael?

1126
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:35,740
-Is it him? -I don't know.
-It's Michael.

1127
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:36,991
Michael's here.

1128
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:38,159
He's not wearing his mask!

1129
01:08:38,201 --> 01:08:40,245
-It's Michael.
-Michael!

1130
01:08:40,286 --> 01:08:42,831
Michael! Stop!

1131
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:46,167
Stop!

1132
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:47,377
Mom, Mom, you're not
going near him.

1133
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:48,920
-I'm gonna go.
-No, you're not.

1134
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:50,213
Block the doorway!

1135
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:52,382
Don't let him leave!

1136
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:54,718
-He's getting away.
-Tommy, get him!

1137
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:56,344
Excuse me.

1138
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:59,347
-Evil dies tonight!

1139
01:08:59,389 --> 01:09:00,724
-Evil dies tonight!
-Come on!

1140
01:09:00,765 --> 01:09:04,853
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1141
01:09:04,894 --> 01:09:07,480
Evil dies tonight!

1142
01:09:07,522 --> 01:09:10,400
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1143
01:09:10,442 --> 01:09:12,485
Evil dies tonight!

1144
01:09:12,527 --> 01:09:16,823
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1145
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:21,536
Little John?

1146
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:23,830
Big John.

1147
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:25,373
Yeah.

1148
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:40,055
Little John?

1149
01:09:40,096 --> 01:09:41,806
Big John.

1150
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:59,616
Little John, the study's clear.

1151
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:56,840
Big John!

1152
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:16,026
Big John.

1153
01:11:16,067 --> 01:11:17,318
No.

1154
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,779
Big John.

1155
01:11:25,827 --> 01:11:27,537
Michael.

1156
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,502
You've come home.

1157
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:44,262
No!

1158
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:56,941
No, no, no, that's not...

1159
01:11:56,983 --> 01:11:59,652
-That's not him. It's not him!
-It's not him? It's not him!

1160
01:11:59,694 --> 01:12:01,363
-That's not Michael!
-It's not him!

1161
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:03,531
-It's not him! It's not him!
-Get him!

1162
01:12:03,573 --> 01:12:04,574
It's not him!

1163
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:07,035
You fucking sheep, it's not him!

1164
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:09,788
-It's not him! It's not him!
-Get out of the way!

1165
01:12:14,376 --> 01:12:16,378
Mom, Mom, Mom!

1166
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:17,420
Mom. Mom.

1167
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:19,339
-Mom. Mom!

1168
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:20,882
I got to get you out of here.

1169
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:22,050
Tommy!

1170
01:12:22,092 --> 01:12:24,427
Get back here!

1171
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:27,389
Help! Help!

1172
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:30,058
Somebody help me!

1173
01:12:32,769 --> 01:12:34,437
-Mom! Okay.

1174
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:36,731
Okay. Okay, be careful.

1175
01:12:38,191 --> 01:12:40,151
-I got it, Sheriff.
-You're gonna be okay.

1176
01:12:40,193 --> 01:12:41,569
-- Come on.
-- Get him!

1177
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:42,946
-- It's not him.
-- I know, Mom.

1178
01:12:42,987 --> 01:12:45,115
I got her. I got her.
Go, go, go.

1179
01:12:45,156 --> 01:12:46,783
-It's... not him.
-Your arm.

1180
01:12:46,825 --> 01:12:48,535
-All right, let's get her...
-They're after the wrong guy.

1181
01:12:48,576 --> 01:12:50,537
-Let's get her into bed.
-It's not him. It's not Michael.

1182
01:13:02,757 --> 01:13:04,926
-Get out of the way!

1183
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,095
Okay, Mom. Come on.

1184
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:08,596
-We got you.

1185
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:10,015
All right, gentle. Careful.

1186
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:12,100
-Careful. I can handle this.

1187
01:13:12,142 --> 01:13:14,185
Be careful of your head.

1188
01:13:14,227 --> 01:13:16,271
Okay. All right.

1189
01:13:16,312 --> 01:13:17,355
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1190
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:18,898
All right, look, stay here.

1191
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,734
There's gonna be guards
outside the door, all right?

1192
01:13:20,775 --> 01:13:22,444
-Be careful. -I'm gonna get
a nurse to get you

1193
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:23,820
-all hooked up again, okay?
-You be careful.

1194
01:13:23,862 --> 01:13:25,780
Hospital staff sightings
on the second floor.

1195
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:31,119
Please stop!

1196
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:33,663
Please! It's not Michael!

1197
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:35,123
You don't know
what he looks like!

1198
01:13:35,165 --> 01:13:37,167
We're in the stairwell. Move!

1199
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:39,753
Watch it, asshole. Karen.

1200
01:13:39,794 --> 01:13:42,672
You okay?
Here, move over to the side.

1201
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,133
To the side with them.
Careful, careful.

1202
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:46,801
-He's up there!
-Stop! It's not him!

1203
01:13:46,843 --> 01:13:49,012
-Get out of my way!
-Tommy, stop! Chill out.

1204
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:51,014
Get a grip, Tommy!

1205
01:13:51,056 --> 01:13:53,266
Get the fuck out of the way!

1206
01:13:53,308 --> 01:13:56,353
-Knock it off!

1207
01:13:58,855 --> 01:14:00,899
-Tommy!

1208
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,650
We're gonna kill him!

1209
01:14:02,692 --> 01:14:04,152
CROWD
Evil dies tonight!

1210
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:07,155
-It's all happening.

1211
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:09,866
Michael's masterpiece.

1212
01:14:09,908 --> 01:14:12,911
He created this chaos, but...

1213
01:14:12,952 --> 01:14:16,539
I'm the one that brought it all
onto Haddonfield.

1214
01:14:16,581 --> 01:14:19,918
I could have made
all this go away.

1215
01:14:21,002 --> 01:14:24,631
It was that night
that you were attacked.

1216
01:14:24,673 --> 01:14:27,133
It's not your fault.

1217
01:14:27,175 --> 01:14:29,552
It's mine.

1218
01:14:33,848 --> 01:14:35,975
It was an accident.

1219
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:40,105
I was lost in my own regret.

1220
01:14:40,146 --> 01:14:41,648
Did Michael kill again?

1221
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,442
I saw the look

1222
01:14:44,484 --> 01:14:46,778
in Loomis's eyes.

1223
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:50,198
All he wanted was more blood.

1224
01:14:51,449 --> 01:14:53,451
More death.

1225
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:55,036
And I couldn't take it.

1226
01:14:55,078 --> 01:14:57,205
And then in that moment,
all I could think was that

1227
01:14:57,247 --> 01:15:00,667
inside that monster,
there was somebody's baby boy.

1228
01:15:02,085 --> 01:15:05,588
Purely and simply evil.

1229
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:08,550
No! Don't!

1230
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:11,803
I could have made
all this go away.

1231
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:15,181
It's not your fault.

1232
01:15:15,223 --> 01:15:17,434
It's mine.

1233
01:15:17,475 --> 01:15:19,769
But now I know...

1234
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:25,650
...there's nothing
inside that man but pure evil.

1235
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:27,777
It's not just Michael.

1236
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:30,989
It's what he's done
to this town, these people.

1237
01:15:32,115 --> 01:15:34,409
Decent people.

1238
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,244
You're a good man, Frank.

1239
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:37,829
You were doing your job.

1240
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:40,749
But now it needs to die.

1241
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:44,627
'Cause every time
somebody's afraid,

1242
01:15:44,669 --> 01:15:47,088
the Boogeyman wins.

1243
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:50,592
It needs to die.

1244
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:54,846
And I'm the one
that needs to kill it.

1245
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:24,417
It's not you.

1246
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:26,336
I know it's not you.

1247
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:30,674
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1248
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:42,352
I know you're scared.

1249
01:16:43,478 --> 01:16:45,355
They're scared, too.

1250
01:16:48,358 --> 01:16:50,985
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

1251
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:11,006
Okay.

1252
01:17:11,047 --> 01:17:13,842
-Okay. I know. I know.

1253
01:17:13,883 --> 01:17:16,594
I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna help you.

1254
01:17:16,636 --> 01:17:18,304
Okay, come on. Come on.

1255
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:21,725
Let go of my hand.

1256
01:17:21,766 --> 01:17:23,018
That's good.

1257
01:17:23,059 --> 01:17:24,728
I'm gonna lock these doors.

1258
01:17:27,564 --> 01:17:28,690
Okay.

1259
01:17:28,732 --> 01:17:30,400
Okay. Lock this behind me.

1260
01:17:31,526 --> 01:17:33,069
They're coming.

1261
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:35,196
They're coming.

1262
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:37,490
-Come on!

1263
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:47,959
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

1264
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:52,464
It's him.

1265
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:54,758
Get him! Get him!

1266
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:25,413
Evil dies tonight!

1267
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:26,664
Evil dies tonight!

1268
01:18:26,706 --> 01:18:29,793
-Evil dies tonight!

1269
01:18:40,428 --> 01:18:42,347
Evil dies tonight!

1270
01:18:45,183 --> 01:18:49,854
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1271
01:18:52,148 --> 01:18:53,775
Stop them!

1272
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:55,568
It's not him?

1273
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,528
-Move!
-Evil dies tonight!

1274
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:40,321
Evil dies tonight!

1275
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:44,367
-- Oh, my God.
-- He's dead.

1276
01:19:46,536 --> 01:19:48,329
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

1277
01:19:48,371 --> 01:19:50,331
Evil dies tonight!

1278
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:01,509
Leigh! Leigh!

1279
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:03,762
No. It's not him.

1280
01:20:03,803 --> 01:20:06,014
It's not him, Tommy.

1281
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:09,517
He's always worn a mask.
How do we know it's not him?

1282
01:20:09,559 --> 01:20:11,019
How do we know, Leigh?

1283
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,238
Now he's turning us
into monsters.

1284
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,310
I swear I was just trying
to do the right thing.

1285
01:20:53,311 --> 01:20:54,688
Look at me.

1286
01:20:58,608 --> 01:21:01,569
What I'm thinking is
the killer was choking him,

1287
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:03,738
Pete went for his gun.

1288
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,700
As he pulled it up, it went off.

1289
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:11,037
Give me your gun.

1290
01:21:11,871 --> 01:21:13,206
Don't look at it.

1291
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:16,001
Just be cool
and give me your gun.

1292
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:18,086
Take this.

1293
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:19,921
It was an accident.

1294
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:21,589
He shot himself.

1295
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:23,299
Got it?

1296
01:21:24,134 --> 01:21:25,427
Just because
your intentions are good

1297
01:21:25,468 --> 01:21:27,637
doesn't mean things
always work out.

1298
01:21:30,515 --> 01:21:32,100
I stood in the way.

1299
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:34,102
It was me.

1300
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:36,604
-It wasn't him.
-Let me find him, then.

1301
01:21:36,646 --> 01:21:38,106
He's after me.

1302
01:21:38,148 --> 01:21:39,899
No, he's not.

1303
01:21:39,941 --> 01:21:41,443
Frank.

1304
01:21:41,484 --> 01:21:44,237
-He's not.

1305
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:46,614
It was the doctor that took him
to your house tonight.

1306
01:21:46,656 --> 01:21:47,991
It wasn't Michael.

1307
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:50,326
It's not about you.

1308
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:53,121
-Doctor, get back in the car!
-No!

1309
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:55,290
I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

1310
01:21:56,624 --> 01:21:58,668
Mom! Mom!

1311
01:21:59,753 --> 01:22:00,920
Help!

1312
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:05,133
He's a six-year-old boy
with the strength of a man

1313
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:06,885
and the mind of an animal.

1314
01:22:06,926 --> 01:22:09,054
I know. I've seen his face.

1315
01:22:09,095 --> 01:22:12,307
I looked in his eyes
when I took off his mask.

1316
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:14,642
Did you know that
when he was a little boy

1317
01:22:14,684 --> 01:22:17,937
he used to stand
in his sister's bedroom and...

1318
01:22:17,979 --> 01:22:20,148
stare out the window?

1319
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:22,275
My partner died

1320
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:24,903
the night he stood
on that same spot.

1321
01:22:24,944 --> 01:22:27,113
But for an instant,

1322
01:22:27,155 --> 01:22:30,367
before his death, he knew.

1323
01:22:30,408 --> 01:22:33,161
Maybe he wasn't looking out.

1324
01:22:34,579 --> 01:22:36,623
Maybe he was looking in.

1325
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,959
At his reflection.

1326
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:41,795
At himself.

1327
01:22:42,712 --> 01:22:46,383
Who knows what makes him kill,
what motivates him?

1328
01:22:46,424 --> 01:22:51,721
But in his heart,
it always seemed to me

1329
01:22:51,763 --> 01:22:54,641
he wants one thing.

1330
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:57,268
He's going home.

1331
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,312
-He went from Laurie's
compound... -Mm-hmm.

1332
01:22:59,354 --> 01:23:01,189
...the victims
in her neighborhood,

1333
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:02,899
to the park, okay?

1334
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:05,902
If you track those locations,
that's a straight line,

1335
01:23:05,944 --> 01:23:08,029
basically an arrow
pointing straight

1336
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:11,449
to Lampkin Lane,
Michael's childhood home.

1337
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:15,412
I came face-to-face with
this asshole when I was a kid.

1338
01:23:15,453 --> 01:23:19,582
He creeps, he kills,
he goes home.

1339
01:23:23,086 --> 01:23:25,714
Then that's where we're going.

1340
01:23:25,755 --> 01:23:27,424
Yeah.

1341
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:36,808
Karen. Karen.

1342
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:38,059
Listen, I'm sorry.

1343
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:39,602
You were right, okay?
I'm sorry.

1344
01:23:39,644 --> 01:23:42,731
Tommy, you took my daughter
to chase a killer,

1345
01:23:42,772 --> 01:23:44,774
and an innocent man is dead.

1346
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:46,901
Fuck it.
None of us are innocent.

1347
01:23:46,943 --> 01:23:49,112
Karen, listen. Listen.
I fucked up.

1348
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:50,613
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

1349
01:23:50,655 --> 01:23:52,323
So, what now?

1350
01:23:52,365 --> 01:23:54,701
You're sorry? You're just gonna
stand here hating yourself?

1351
01:23:54,743 --> 01:23:55,869
No.

1352
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:57,912
I got to keep trying.

1353
01:23:57,954 --> 01:23:59,414
But if I go down,

1354
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:01,875
I'm gonna go down swinging.

1355
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:06,629
I need a car.

1356
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:09,341
I have a car.

1357
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:31,780
Okay, so the key is
we stick together.

1358
01:24:31,821 --> 01:24:33,448
No, I'm going in alone.

1359
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:35,116
-What?
-Mr. Elam.

1360
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:36,993
You fucking dummy,
you brought your kid

1361
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:38,870
-to the belly of the beast.
-Dad, no.

1362
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:40,538
Mr. Elam, with all due respect,

1363
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:42,791
you really expect me
to sit here while you go inside

1364
01:24:42,832 --> 01:24:44,793
and confront the man
that killed my father?

1365
01:24:44,834 --> 01:24:47,212
No, I don't expect you to.

1366
01:24:47,253 --> 01:24:49,464
But I'm asking, Allyson.

1367
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:51,800
For your sake and my son's.

1368
01:24:51,841 --> 01:24:54,636
Okay? Just stay here.

1369
01:24:54,678 --> 01:24:59,140
You see anything suspicious,
you honk the horn, all right?

1370
01:24:59,182 --> 01:25:01,476
But you stay safe.

1371
01:25:01,518 --> 01:25:03,269
All right?

1372
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:10,402
I will see you
at the finish line, buddy.

1373
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:08,251
Okay.

1374
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:19,304
This is so fucked up.

1375
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,811
-Cameron, let's go.

1376
01:26:26,853 --> 01:26:28,813
Come on.

1377
01:26:28,855 --> 01:26:29,939
Go, go, go, go!

1378
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:40,700
Okay.

1379
01:26:51,127 --> 01:26:52,879
Dad?

1380
01:27:03,139 --> 01:27:04,766
CAMERON
Allyson.

1381
01:27:04,808 --> 01:27:06,643
Over there.

1382
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:40,839
Dad.

1383
01:29:45,885 --> 01:29:46,636
Cameron?

1384
01:30:13,496 --> 01:30:15,915
Allyson!

1385
01:30:15,957 --> 01:30:16,958
Cameron!

1386
01:30:25,091 --> 01:30:26,968
Cameron!

1387
01:30:28,219 --> 01:30:29,679
No!

1388
01:30:30,388 --> 01:30:34,017
-Cameron! No!

1389
01:30:35,101 --> 01:30:36,311
Cameron!

1390
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:39,230
ALLYSON
No.

1391
01:30:39,272 --> 01:30:41,149
No, no, no, no!

1392
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:43,026
-No!

1393
01:30:43,068 --> 01:30:45,111
-Allyson!
-No!

1394
01:30:48,656 --> 01:30:51,159
Come and get me, motherfucker!

1395
01:30:51,201 --> 01:30:53,286
Come and get me.

1396
01:31:24,192 --> 01:31:25,318
Leave him alone!

1397
01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:28,613
No.

1398
01:31:28,655 --> 01:31:30,490
No. No!

1399
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:32,867
-No!

1400
01:31:37,038 --> 01:31:38,748
No!

1401
01:31:51,219 --> 01:31:53,763
Do it. Do it.

1402
01:31:54,556 --> 01:31:56,016
Do it!

1403
01:32:16,202 --> 01:32:17,871
Mom.

1404
01:32:31,009 --> 01:32:32,969
Mom.

1405
01:32:39,476 --> 01:32:40,769
No, Mom.

1406
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:42,270
You want your mask?

1407
01:32:42,312 --> 01:32:43,730
Come and get it!

1408
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:46,608
You want to fucking
kill someone, take me!

1409
01:32:46,649 --> 01:32:49,319
Mom. No, Mom.

1410
01:32:52,614 --> 01:32:54,574
I'm an innocent woman,

1411
01:32:54,616 --> 01:32:56,618
just like your sister was.

1412
01:32:56,659 --> 01:32:58,661
It was Halloween night.

1413
01:32:58,703 --> 01:33:00,580
She was in her bedroom.

1414
01:33:00,622 --> 01:33:02,791
And it was right here.

1415
01:33:02,832 --> 01:33:04,709
Your house.

1416
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:07,629
Can't you feel it?

1417
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:09,631
ALLYSON
No. No, Mom.

1418
01:33:12,717 --> 01:33:14,803
Mom, no.

1419
01:33:21,935 --> 01:33:24,688
Mom!

1420
01:34:03,059 --> 01:34:04,894
Gotcha.

1421
01:34:16,531 --> 01:34:18,491
Hey, Michael.

1422
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:20,118
It's Halloween.

1423
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,288
Everyone's entitled
to one good scare.

1424
01:35:04,162 --> 01:35:07,374
-- Light him up.
-- Let's take him.

1425
01:35:48,665 --> 01:35:50,250
We got this, Karen.

1426
01:35:51,668 --> 01:35:53,920
Go be with your daughter.

1427
01:36:17,902 --> 01:36:19,904
I always thought Michael Myers

1428
01:36:19,946 --> 01:36:23,992
was flesh and blood,
just like you and me,

1429
01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:25,869
but a mortal man
could not have survived

1430
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:27,412
what he's lived through.

1431
01:36:28,621 --> 01:36:30,749
The more he kills,

1432
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:32,500
the more he transcends

1433
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:36,171
into something else
impossible to defeat.

1434
01:36:36,212 --> 01:36:37,881
Fear.

1435
01:36:37,922 --> 01:36:39,883
People are afraid.

1436
01:36:39,924 --> 01:36:43,261
That is the true curse
of Michael.

1437
01:36:43,303 --> 01:36:46,014
He'll always be here, won't he?

1438
01:36:46,056 --> 01:36:48,224
Even when we can't see him.

1439
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:56,566
You can't defeat it
with brute force.

1440
01:36:58,068 --> 01:37:01,196
If we only knew then
what we know now.

1441
01:37:39,317 --> 01:37:41,569
It is the essence of evil.

1442
01:37:43,655 --> 01:37:45,573
The anchor that divides us.

1443
01:37:46,908 --> 01:37:50,620
It is the terror that grows
stronger when we try to hide.

1444
01:38:23,903 --> 01:38:26,448
If they don't stop him tonight,

1445
01:38:26,489 --> 01:38:28,783
maybe we'll find him tomorrow.

1446
01:38:28,825 --> 01:38:30,368
Or next Halloween,

1447
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:34,039
when the sun sets
and someone is alone.

1448
01:39:10,575 --> 01:39:14,162
You can't close your eyes
and pretend he isn't there.
