Elena.

488
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:15,521
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

489
00:34:17,692 --> 00:34:21,389
Is it working, Stefan?
Being around her? Being in her world?

490
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:24,430
- Does it make you feel alive?
- She's not Katherine.

491
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:27,567
Well, let's hope not.
We both know how that ended.
