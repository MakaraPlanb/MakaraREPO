337
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:41,051
You're kidding me, right?
There's no such thing as vampires.

338
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:43,823
Well, there's not
a lot of documentation...

339
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,558
...but stories have been told
since the Civil War.

340
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:49,202
My granddad
used to tell me these creepy stories.

341
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:52,236
And he said
that his granddad told them to him.

342
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,001
That would be folklore. Vampires are
a metaphor for the demons of the day.

343
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:58,872
- Which are?
- The Union soldiers.

344
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:01,378
I've read the stories.
They talk about the enemy.

345
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:03,346
The demons that attack at night.

346
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:05,609
That sounds like vampires to me.

347
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:08,788
Allegorical vampires,
which is what it is.

348
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,356
Creative expression
during a very volatile time.

349
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:15,023
I mean, a country at war
doesn't want realism, they want fantasy.

350
00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:16,686
Thus, vampire fiction.

351
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:20,564
Man, you're smart.

352
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:24,434
I gotta give it to you,
when I first saw you, I missed it. Heh.

Well, good luck on your paper.
I gotta get home.

357
00:22:37,818 --> 00:22:41,379
My great-grandfather actually showed
me a journal once of an ancestor.

358
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:44,422
And he had written
all of this creepy stuff about vampires.

359
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:46,457
It was actually really believable.

360
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,652

00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:40,117
No kiss?

501
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:42,785
I'm full of vervain.

502
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,855
I put it in everything I drink.

503
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:46,787
And you're telling me this. Why?

504
00:32:47,027 --> 00:32:49,495
Lexi was my friend.

505
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:52,360
How could you?

- Emily's grimoire, her spell book.

If you know how she closed the tomb,
the reversal will be in her book.

Well, you're not the worst company

520

- You should give yourself more credit.
- Seriously?

I don't know,
you were there in the road...

...all damsel-in-distress-like.

523
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:06,296
And I knew it would piss off Stefan.

524

And you're not the worst company
in the world, Elena.

525

- I used to be more fun.
- You did okay.

00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:20,316
I saved your life.

00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:24,951

- Hi.

530
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,271
You could have told me.

531
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:51,075
I wanted to tell you.

532
00:34:51,284 --> 00:34:55,186
You said no more lies, only the truth.

533
00:34:55,355 --> 00:34:57,687
I can handle the truth, Stefan.

534
00:34:57,858 --> 00:35:02,386
As crazy as it is,
I can handle the fact you are a vampire.

535
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:08,595
And you have a vampire brother
and that my best friend is a witch.

536
00:35:09,536 --> 00:35:12,630
I can accept the fact that
the world is a more mysterious place...

537
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:14,103
...than I ever thought possible.

538
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:16,434
But this?

539
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,510
This lie, I cannot take.

540
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,080
What am I to you?

541
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,547
Who am I to you?

542
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:26,685
You are not Katherine.

543
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:29,014
You are the opposite
of everything she was.

544
00:35:29,189 --> 00:35:31,180
And when did you figure that out?

545
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:33,519
Before you kissed me?

546
00:35:33,693 --> 00:35:35,320
Before we slept together?

547
00:35:38,098 --> 00:35:39,622
Before I met you.

548
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:41,960
What?

549
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:47,339
First day of school when we met.

550
00:35:48,341 --> 00:35:50,468
It wasn't for the first time, Elena.

551
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:56,645
- Then when was it?
- May 23rd, 2009.

552
00:35:56,883 --> 00:35:58,407
But that was...

553
00:35:58,618 --> 00:36:03,248
That was the day your parents' car
went off the bridge.

554
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:07,090
You were there?

555
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,388
Every couple of years,
I come back here.

556
00:36:10,564 --> 00:36:13,362
To see Zach and see my home.

557
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:19,597
And last spring, I was out in the woods,
by Old Wickery Bridge.

558
00:36:20,273 --> 00:36:22,605
And I heard the accident.

559
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:24,266
All of it.

560
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:27,777
I was fast getting there,
but not fast enough.

561
00:36:28,582 --> 00:36:31,574
Car was already submerged.

562
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,285
Your dad, he was still conscious.
I was able to get to him.

563
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:41,427
But he wouldn't let me help him...

564
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:43,760
Until I helped you.

565
00:36:44,531 --> 00:36:46,795
Oh, my God.

566
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:55,473
When I woke up in the hospital, nobody
could figure out how I got out of the car.

567
00:36:57,444 --> 00:36:59,173
They said it was a miracle.

568
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:01,439
I went back for them.

569
00:37:01,648 --> 00:37:04,412
But it was too late. I couldn't...

570
00:37:05,218 --> 00:37:07,345
I couldn't save them.

571
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:09,552
When I pulled you out...

572
00:37:09,723 --> 00:37:12,453
...I looked at your face
and you looked like Katherine.

573
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,526
I couldn't believe the resemblance.

574
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:18,664
After that, I spent months making sure
that you weren't her.

575
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:22,357
I watched you, I learned everything
that I could about you.

576
00:37:22,536 --> 00:37:25,699
And I saw that you were nothing
like Katherine.

577
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:30,366
And I wanted to leave town,
but, Elena, I couldn't...

578
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:33,638
I couldn't leave without knowing you.

579
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:37,839
I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you.
I wanted to.

580
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:40,578
But you were so sad and...

581
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:47,153
Why do I look like her?

582
00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:52,998
- Elena, you've been through so much.
- Why do I look like her, Stefan?

583
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,963
What are you not telling me?

584
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:58,033
It didn't make any sense to me.

585
00:37:58,238 --> 00:38:00,763
You were a Gilbert, she was a Pierce.

586
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:03,171
But the resemblance was too similar.

587
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:05,504
And then I learned the truth.

588
00:38:07,414 --> 00:38:09,405
You were adopted, Elena.

589
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:14,519

There you are.

00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:15,916
- Hey.
- Hi.

591
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:18,081
Okay, look.

592
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:21,056
I know I don't know you,
so don't ask me why I did this.

593
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:23,594
I just... Sometimes...

594
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:26,425
Well, mostly all the time,
I have this need to be right.

595
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,068
So I Googled and...

596
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:31,136
- What is it?
- Proof.

597
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:33,397
Sort of.

598
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:44,547
- What does this mean?
- Well, I only went as far back as 1942.

599
00:38:44,718 --> 00:38:48,552
And found that there's been
a string of animal attacks periodically...

600
00:38:48,722 --> 00:38:51,748
...in and around this town,
for the past 75 years.

601
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:54,085
It's consistent. Look.

602
00:38:54,594 --> 00:38:57,222
Here we go. In '62, five bodies found.

603
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,264
In '53, four people killed.
In '74, three people dead.

604
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:03,732
And there's been five this year.

605
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:07,239
All attacked,
all suffered major blood loss.

606
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:09,932
As in, drained of blood.

607
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,544
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font>
How do you know this?

608
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:19,077
Your birth certificate
from the city records.

609
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:22,346
It says Elena Gilbert,
Mystic Falls General.

610
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:25,786
But there's no record of your mother
ever being admitted.

611
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:29,190
There's no record of her
ever being pregnant.

612
00:39:30,297 --> 00:39:31,924
What else do you know?

613
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:35,124
I would've had to look
into the Pierce family.

614
00:39:35,302 --> 00:39:37,668
And I couldn't do that.
That's too much of a risk.

615
00:39:37,837 --> 00:39:41,000
If someone found out I was asking
about Katherine... Listen to me...

616
00:39:41,174 --> 00:39:42,607
...it doesn't matter.

617
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:46,370

Not with you.

I trust you to tell me the truth.

621
00:40:19,612 --> 00:40:22,046
Where were you?
And why did you lie to me about it?

622
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:26,311
- I thought we were closer than that.
- Now is not the time to talk about lies.

623
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:29,613
Don't do that, don't turn this on me.
I didn't do anything.

624
00:40:29,789 --> 00:40:32,917
