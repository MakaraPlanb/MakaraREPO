- It was for me. I'm gonna bring her back.

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:18,416
There's a tomb underneath the church.
A spell sealed Katherine in the tomb.

- Tell me how to get in.

- Where is it?
- Check the journal. Jonathan Gilbert's.

The Grimoire, it was Emily's, right?
That's what you need? I'll help you.

10
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:30,957

14
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,775
I wouldn't.

15
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,780
Don't try to escape. Don't even move.

16
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,955
Do you understand?

17
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,148
I understand.

18
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,231
- Seriously?
- I told her not to move.

19
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,667
I did that eye thing.

20
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,536

She dates a vampire.

24

Anna took Elena.

25
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,341
Yeah, I got that
from your 600 voicemails.

26
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,112

in town, I've been searching.

27
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,552
- What if your blood hasn't passed?
- At least you know you'll see her again.

28
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,455
Please.

29

What do you know?

30
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,195
You were with Anna,
you know where she's living. Tell me.

31
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,225
Nope.

32
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,096
You can go.

33
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,231
Really.

34
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,536
You know,
all I can remember is hating you.

35
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,736
Might have been different...

36
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,541
...but your choices erased
anything good about you.

37
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:41,783
But see, I also know that you have just
as much reason to hate me.

38
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,750
This all began with me.

39
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,888
Katherine got taken away from you...

40
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,154
...because of me.

41
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,325
And I'm sorry.

What's going on? Why are we here?

56
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,988
It must have something to do
with the tomb and Emily's spell book.

57
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,393
- Spell book?
- Damon said that it could open the tomb.

58
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,295
Why didn't I know about any of this?

59

Come to what?

61

They need a witch...

62

...to break the spell
and let the vampires out.

63
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,510
- No way.
- I know. I know. I know.

You wrote a speech?

105
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:25,009
Yes. It's a "You kissed me and I don't
want things to be weird" speech.

- It's pre-emptive.
- Ha, ha. Pre-emptive?

107
