I have lived in secret until now.

00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,967
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:12,737
<font color="#808080">JOHN :</font> As a founding family member, it's my
duty to report some distressing news.

5
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,005
- He's a Gilbert?
- Elena's uncle.

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,649
Mayor Lockwood, is it?
My name is Pearl.

7
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,217
- Hi.
- This is my daughter, Anna.

8
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:24,221
Maybe there is such a thing as vampires.
They're just different.

10
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,822
You got a problem with blood, Anna?

11
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:32,526
<font color="#808080">FORBES :</font> The coroner's office has officially ruled
Vicki Donovan's death a drug overdose.

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,167
- You don't think it was an overdose.
- Let it go.

13
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,530
Is there something
you're not telling me?

<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> I have this hunger inside of me
that I've never...

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,035
I've never felt before in my entire life.

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,113
I don't want you to see me like this.

18
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,909
I don't want you to know
that this side of me exists.

19
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,464
Nice car.

20
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,238
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> Well, it was a waste to leave it sitting
in the garage.

21
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,074
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> I didn't know you were coming back
today.

22
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,782
You know, I woke up this morning
and I was feeling great...

23
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:28,443
...and I figured it was time for me
to get back into things.

24
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,816
Does that mean you're okay now?

25
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,051
- With all the cravings?
- Yeah, I mean the worst part is over.

26
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:40,791
So now all I wanna do is just spend
as much time with you as possible.

27
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,435
I'm okay with that.

28
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,463
Hey, thank you.

29
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:51,136
For helping me get through
the rough patch.

30
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,468
You're welcome.

31
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,642
- We're gonna be late.
- Okay. You know what?

32
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,785
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> I'll catch up. I'm gonna grab my stuff.

33
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,387

- Okay.

34
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:30,181
<font color="#808080">FORBES :</font> There was a disturbance at the hospital.
Some of the supply was compromised.

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,182
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Compromised. You mean, stolen?

36
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,820
We almost missed it.
The inventory records were altered.

37
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,551
When the manager was questioned,
he had no recollection of changing them.

38
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,695
Meaning the vampire
used mind control...

39
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,228
...to hide the theft.
- I know what you meant.

40
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:49,390
John alerted us to recent discrepancies
at other hospital blood banks...

41
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,970
...in the county.
- How lucky for us we have John.

<font color="#808080">FORBES :</font> We're stepping up security,
giving the guards vervain...

43

44
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,175
<font color="#808080">JOHN :</font> Might I offer a suggestion? Why don't
Damon and I put our heads together?

45
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,748
We could track down
whoever's doing this.

46
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,853
Truthfully, I could use extra hands.
Is that something you'd be willing to do?

47
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,257
- Well, of course. I mean, if it will help.
<font color="#808080">JOHN :</font>  I think we'll make a good team.

48
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,824
Don't you, Damon?

49
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,087
Whatever I can do
to keep this town safe.

50
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,027

with you.

Okay.

52
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,900
This week,
we're gonna set aside our curriculum...

53
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:33,102
...for a lesson in local history
as we approach Founder's Day.

54
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:37,179
The community leaders feel that's
more important than World War II.

55
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,908
But, hey, what do I know?

56
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,177
Sorry I'm late.

57

at full occupancy.

00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,389
Right, Founder's Day.

60
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,225
What does it mean
to have a Founder's Day?

61
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:53,729
Well, if you turn your attention
to this exquisite diorama over here...

62
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,958
...that I spent all night
painstakingly...

You learned to use the bell.

65
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,372
- I am here on behalf of my mother.
- On behalf of or in spite of?

66
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,242
<font color="#808080">ANNA :</font> I'm sorry about what
the other vampires did to Stefan.

67
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,407
Abducting, torturing him.
It wasn't supposed to go like that.

68
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,612
You were playing house with half
of a tomb of really pissed-off vampires.

69
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,656
- What did you think was gonna happen?
- My mom is devastated.

70
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,157
They tried to overthrow her.

71
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,790
- Why isn't she here?
- She doesn't really do apologies.

72
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,058
Well, that's a coincidence.
I don't do forgiveness, so run along.

73
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,964
If you're gonna continue playing
house with your pets...

74
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,163
...you might wanna stop
robbing the blood bank dry...

75
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,932
...because they're on to it.

76
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,669
I haven't been to the local blood bank
in a week.

77
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,745
- It's the others.
- The others are gone.

78
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,781
- Well, where did they go?
- They weren't cut out for this town.

79
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,977
After what happened, my mom
kicked them out and they took off.

80
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,781

I just shouldn't know.

Major wardrobe confab needed, ASAP.

98

00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,219
They announced it today.
And you and I are both on it.

Oh, my God, we signed up for that
so long ago. I completely forgot.

103
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,824
So are you dropping out, then?

104
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,059
I can't.

105
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,595

You seem chipper lately.
Less doom and gloom.

113
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,232
Little more pep in your step.

114
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,961
And you think it's because
I drank human blood again.

00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,709
Not only is it possible,

<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Stefan, let's be serious for a second.

121
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:07,289
You've spent the last century and a half
being a poster child for Prozac.

122
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,894
And now you expect me to believe
this new you...

123
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,122
...has nothing to do with human blood.
Nothing.

124
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,429
I'm clean.

125
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,764

coming up, or that I would be in it.

129

<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font>
I'll be happy to escort you.

130
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,014
My mom was really into
this Founder's Day stuff.

131
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,088
She was even Miss Mystic in her day.

132
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,584
I kind of wanted do it for her.

133
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,457
Well, it'll be great. We'll have fun.

134
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,495
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

135
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,964

- I love you too.

136
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,222
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font>
Well, well.

137
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,364
He's a liar and a thief.

138
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,811
So when were you gonna share?

139
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,005
Go ahead. Help yourself.

140
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,846
No, I'm talking about the fact
that you're a closet blood junkie.

141
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,419
So I'm drinking blood again.

142
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,819
You're the one that shoved it on me.
What's your problem?

143
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,527
- I have it under control.
- Under control?

144
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,822
You robbed a hospital.

145
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,490
So, what's your point?

146
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,225
Fine. Whatever, man. Drink up.

147
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,234
Just remember,
we're trying to keep a low profile.

148
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,396
Why don't you walk up
to Sheriff Forbes, ask her to tap a vein?

149
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,101
Have my actions
negatively impacted you?

150
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,279
I can't imagine
what that must feel like.

151
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,108
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Yeah. What does Elena think
about the new you?

152
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,384
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> Nothing's changed.
I'm still the same person.

153
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,420
- Clearly.
- Elena doesn't need to know anything.

154
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,884
You've been off the human stuff
for years, Stefan.

155
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,187
- Lf you're having trouble...
