00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:19,378

<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> Katherine is dead.

8
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:21,951
And you hate me
because you loved her.

9
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:24,646
- I was hoping I'd see you again.
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> She's not a puppet.

She doesn't exist for you to feed on
whenever you want to.

to the Founder's Party?

163
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,150
Vicki Donovan...

164
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,817
...do you want me to ask you
to the Founder's Party?

165
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:33,328
No. It'll be stupid and lame.

166
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,863
<font color="#808080">TYLER :</font>
True.

167
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:38,160
But it'll be less stupid and lame
if you're there.

168
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,376
You realize you had to ask him
to ask you, right?

169
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,036
You figure if you dress
like a respectable lady...

170
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:51,238
...he'll finally treat you like one?

171
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,517
Screw you, Jeremy.

172
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:58,511
You know you're making wrong choice,
yet you make it anyway.

173
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:01,525
It's sad.

174
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,873
- Didn't know you were here.
- Going through Stefan's homework.

175
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,101
Boy, this country has dumbed down
in the last hundred years.

176
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,574
Why he wants to go to high school
is beyond me.

177
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:24,738
In the '70s, he went lvy League.
Harvard, I understood.

178
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,781
Actually, no. I didn't get that either.

179
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,087
Go ahead, purge.

180
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:31,949
Get it out. What's on your mind?

181
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,049
Why are you here, Damon?

182
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,296
To spend time with you, Zach.

183
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,891
Family's important.

184
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:47,000
I know you.
You always have a motive.

185
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:49,263
So tell me, what is it this time?

186
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:52,733
You are in no position to question me.

187
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:55,612
I didn't mean to upset you.

188
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,749
This is not upset, Zach.

What's going on?

190

Having a family moment, Stefan.
Spending some quality time.

- No, I'm not and neither are you.

193
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:16,133
How many have to die
before you see that?

194
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:19,202
- I see it, all right.
- Then why aren't you doing anything?

195
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:21,632
I can't, Zach.

196
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:22,830
I can't.

197
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,270
It would take human blood.

198
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:27,900
It's the only way that I could stop him
and I can't do that.

199
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:35,343
Vervain could weaken him
if he ingested it.

200
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:37,521
It would help get you the upper hand.

201
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,385
Vervain hasn't grown here since 1865.

202
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,458
Damon saw to that.

203
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:44,356
The little I had, I gave to Elena.

It's just something that's been
passed down through the generations.

00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:21,528
Blood only runs so deep
when you're related to vampires.

208
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,333
Damon would kill me

Tonight's gonna be a good night.

Don't let that stop you from telling me
whatever it is you wanted to tell me.

What if I tell you in the morning?
I don't want to ruin the night.

Okay, but it has to go in the vault
because Caroline will kill me...

00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,774
...if it gets back to Damon
that she squealed.

234
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,943
Apparently, Stefan has
a very interesting back story.

235
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:51,813
Uh-huh.

236
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,958
Do you know what happened
with Katherine?

237
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,287
I know that they both dated her
and that's why they have issues.

238
00:14:57,462 --> 00:15:00,693
Yeah, they both dated her,
only she chose Damon.

239
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,160
And that drove Stefan mad.

240
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,995
So he did horrible things to try
and break them up.

241
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,501
He manipulated Katherine.

242
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:09,605
He filled her head with all these lies
until it worked...

243
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:11,298
...and she turned against Damon.

244
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,569
Sounds like one person's side
of the story, meaning Damon's.

245
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,770
I just wanted you to know.

246
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,610
Anyway, his past relationships
are none of my business.

247
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,548

manipulative liar.

- Stefan is none of those things.
- Yeah? How do you know?

250
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,863
They still wear ties at this thing?

251
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:41,367
- Why are you even going?
- It's fitting. We were at the first one.

252
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:44,030
It's better if we don't draw attention
to ourselves.

253

Maybe Tyler took it.

Don't even play that card. You took it.

- Then why did you take it?

00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:03,389
I wasn't counting on it.

324
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:04,933
You knew it would fail.

325
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,900
Did what I wanted.
Lowered his guard.

326
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:09,096
He won't expect me
to try again so soon.

327
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,966
<font color="#808080">ZACH :</font>
I doubled what I put in the Scotch.

331
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,158
Caroline. You look smashing.

332
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:04,851
Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood.

333
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:06,792
This is my boyfriend, Damon.

334
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,056
Oh, well, come on in.

335
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,560
Lovely to meet you.
I've been looking forward to this party.

336
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:14,637
Well, enjoy.

337
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,139
Let's get a drink.

338
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:23,006
Wait here.

339
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,015
Really, you couldn't even change
out of the badge for this?

340
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,345
I'm working, honey.

341
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,010
Who's the date
you just tried to sneak past me?

342
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,486
Just some guy.

343
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:34,488
A little old for you, don't you think?

344
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,025
Because otherwise you'd approve.
I doubt that.

345
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:41,254
- Hi, Mayor Lockwood.
- Hey, come on in.

346
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:43,399
- Thank you.
<font color="#808080">LOCKWOOD :</font> Have fun.

347
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,933
Where's your dad?

348
00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:46,569
- Memphis.
- Good.

349
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:48,602
With Stephen.

350
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:28,535
Your parents?

351
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:31,741
There's a lot of history here.

352
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:48,255

Hello, Logan.

354
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:54,435
It's good to see you.

355
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:56,095
I thought I might see you here.

356
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,674
- You knew it.
- I dreaded.

357
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:00,435
But were secretly hoping.

358
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,237
And now that I have...

359
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:04,971
Whoa, hey, not so fast. I know you.

360
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,640
You have a lot more insults in you.
I can tell.

361
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,581
- Your hairline's receding.
- It's not.

362
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:10,982
- Wanna have lunch?
- Nope.

363
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:13,816
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Oh, yes, I have.

364
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:15,151
I'm meaner now.

365

367
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:25,493
Wow, look,
it's the original guest registry.

368
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,297
Look at all these familiar names:

369
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:31,430
Sheriff William Forbes,
Mayor Benjamin Lockwood.

370
00:23:31,642 --> 00:23:33,269
Is that Damon Salvatore?

371
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:38,277
And Stefan Salvatore?

372
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,383
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font>
The original Salvatore brothers.

373
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:44,081
Our ancestors. Tragic story, actually.

374
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:46,779
We don't need to bore them
with stories of the past.

375
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:52,461
It's not boring, Stefan.
I'd love to hear more about your family.

376
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:56,164
Well, I'm bored. I wanna dance.

377
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,859
- And Damon won't dance with me.
- Mm-mm.

378
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:00,901
Could I just borrow your date?

379
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,539
Oh, uh...

380
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:06,335
- I don't really dance.
- He does. You should see him.

381
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:09,035
Waltz, the jitterbug, the moonwalk.
He does it all.

382
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,316
You wouldn't mind, would you, Elena?

383
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:15,548
It's up to Stefan.

384
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:19,416
Well, sorry, but I'm not gonna take no
for an answer.

385
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,703
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font>
I wanna apologize to you...

386
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:41,937
...for being such a world-class jerk
the other night when I tried to kiss you.

387
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,646
There's no excuse.

388
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:49,946
My therapist says I'm acting out,
trying to punish Stefan.

389
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:53,153
- For what?
- I don't wanna bring it up.

390
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:55,917
Let's just say that the men
in the Salvatore family...

391
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:58,926
...have been cursed
with sibling rivalry.

392
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:02,088
And it all started
with the original Salvatore brothers.

393
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:06,861
Damon told you to ask me to dance,
didn't he?

394
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:09,801
And why would he do that?

395
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:11,874
<font color="#808080">MAN :</font>
Champagne, sir?

396
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,802
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font>
Would you like one?

397
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:17,077
Thank you.

398
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:20,243
Just tell me if you see my mom.

399
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:28,822
The Salvatore name was practically
royalty in this town until the war.

400
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:31,791
- There was a battle here...
- The Battle of Willow Creek.

401
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,797
- Right.
- I know, we talked about it in class.

402
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:38,901
Confederate soldiers fired on a church
with civilians inside.

403
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:41,560
What the history books left out...

404
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:45,266
...was the people that were killed,
they weren't there by accident.

405
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,502
They were believed
to be union sympathizers.

406
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:50,578
So some of the founders
on the confederacy side back then...

407
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:53,273
...wanted them rounded up
and burned alive.

408
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:57,848
Stefan and Damon had someone
they loved very much in that church.

409
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,787
And when they went to rescue them,
they were shot.

410
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,326
Murdered in cold blood.

411
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:07,929
Who was in the church
that they wanted to save?

412
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:09,531
A woman, I guess.

413
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:15,033
Doesn't it always come down
to the love of a woman?

414
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:21,944
I'm sorry that you and Stefan
have this thing between you...

415
00:26:22,112 --> 00:26:24,842
...but I can't get
in the middle of it, Damon.

416
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:27,181
I just...

417
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:30,353
I hope you two can work it out.

418
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:32,381
I hope so too.

419
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:40,454
So you wanna dance?

420
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:43,259
Me dancing? Not pretty.

421
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:48,900
Maybe you could show me around.
I mean, this place is amazing.

422
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:52,201
Yeah, if you like living in a museum.

423
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,579
Maybe I should just strip naked
and give Pastor Bill a lap dance.

424
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:02,581
That's why we're hiding
in a corner all night, isn't it?

425
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,983
You're scared of how I'm gonna act,
afraid of what your parents...

426
00:27:06,156 --> 00:27:07,987
...are gonna think about your date?

427
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:09,921
I don't care about what they think.

428
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,890
Great. Let's go say hi.

429
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:14,087
Knock it off, Vick.

430
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:16,596
Or we could just
sneak up to your bedroom.

431
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,529
As long as nobody sees us, right?

432
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:21,402
- Vicki, I swear...
- What's the matter, Ty?

433
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:24,063
You scared to stand up to your mommy?
It's pathetic.

434
00:27:25,242 --> 00:27:27,176
- Look, let go.
- Tyler.

435
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,738
We didn't get a chance
to say hello earlier.

436
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,349
It's Vicki, right? Matt's sister.

437
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:34,609
Yes, ma'am.

438
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:37,184
You'll have to forgive
my son's rudeness.

439
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:38,878
He gets it from his father.

440
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,114
Well, that's okay, Mrs. Lockwood.

441
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,919
Tyler and I
were just saying good night.

442
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:51,762
That's what you get
when you bring the trash into the party.

443
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:31,103
What'd we miss?

444
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:34,574
We were just chatting.

445
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:36,510
Drink, Damon?

446
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:39,109
No, thanks, I'll pass.

447
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,283
Stefan, do you have
another dance in you?

448
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,024
Absolutely.

449
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:08,000
They look so cute together.

450
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:10,043
Don't talk, please.

451
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:24,220
Don't shoot. Only need to refill.

452
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:28,796
- Shooting implies caring.
- Feigned indifference. I like it.

453
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,626
I'm over the banter, Logan.

454
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:34,133
I'd really rather you just left me alone.

455
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:39,632
I'm sorry, Jenna.

456
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,978
About your sister.

457
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:46,744
Thank you.

458
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:49,486
I came to the funeral.

459
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:52,851
I know. I saw you.

460
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,857
I didn't wanna push my way in,
but I wanted to be there for you.

461
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:01,361
And when I heard you were staying
in Mystic Falls, I thought maybe...

462
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:04,592
Well, maybe I could have
a second chance to make things right.

463
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:15,609
Her name was Monica, wasn't it?

464
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:39,762
I hope Damon
didn't drive you too crazy.

465
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:42,963
No, actually,
he was on good behavior.

466
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,736
He even apologized and explained
why he is the way he is.

467
00:30:49,146 --> 00:30:51,637
That it all goes back to Katherine.

468
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:54,006
Hmm.

469
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:03,719
So tell me about her. What happened?

470
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:08,526
Not something I like to talk about.

471
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:11,428
I get that. I do.

472
00:31:11,602 --> 00:31:14,093
I just want you to know that you can.

473
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:17,604
I mean, I burden you
with all of my drama...

474
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:21,108
...and I want you to do the same.

475
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,010
Um...

476
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:27,174
Thank you.

477
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:33,616
The truth is, Stefan, I don't really know
that much about you...

478
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,851
...and I'd really love it
if you would open up to me.

479
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:39,653
Damon said something, didn't he?

480
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,425
He likes to play games
and cause trouble, Elena.

481
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:46,865
This isn't about Damon,
it's about me trying to get to know you.

482
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:50,699
Look, you're the mystery guy
and I like that...

483
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:54,810
...but with mystery comes secrets,
and this thing with Katherine...

484
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:56,570
Let it go.

485
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,772
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Say something about yourself.

486
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,042
Anything.

487
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:04,654
Otherwise, I'm left with nothing
but what other people tell me.

488
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:07,653
Don't you see
what Damon has done here?

489
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,692
He's trying to get you
to turn against me.

490
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,396
Well, then I guess it's working.

491
00:32:28,545 --> 00:32:30,638
<font color="#808080">BONNIE :</font>
This is my fault. I planted doubt.

492
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:34,045
- I'm a doubt-planter.
- It's not your fault.

493
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:35,408
I feel terrible.

494
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:39,180
I said I wouldn't get in the middle of it
and that's exactly what I did.

495
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:42,048
I got all snotty.

496
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,750
<font color="#808080">CAROL :</font>
Elena, honey, there you are.

497
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:47,996
I notice the watch
still isn't in the collection.

498
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,657
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Lockwood.

499
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:54,827
I couldn't find it.

500
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:58,236
I guess, it's still packed up
in my parents' stuff somewhere.

501
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,935
I see.
Please let me know if you do find it.

502
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:04,173
Okay.

503
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:10,344
<font color="#808080">CAROLINE :</font>
Where have you been?

504
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:14,749
I've been looking for you.

505
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:18,283
Your brother barely danced with me
for five minutes.

506
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:22,159
Okay, just a minute. Stand right there.

507
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:32,206
Uh... You're not supposed to touch.

508
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:35,536
What is that?

509
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:37,407
Very important crystal.

510
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,549
Well, how did you know
that it was there?

511
00:33:39,716 --> 00:33:41,308
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Because I put it there.
- When?

512
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:42,543
A long time ago.

513
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:45,119
Tonight, I'm taking it back,
thanks to you.

514
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:46,380
Well, what's it for?

515
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:48,547
- Never you mind.
- You can't just steal it.

516
00:33:48,725 --> 00:33:51,193
- It's not stealing if it's mine. Come on.
- Well...

517
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:53,719
Vodka tonic.

518
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:05,504
Okay, I know that this is probably
gonna be strike three...

519
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:09,145
...but I hope you can see it
for what it is.

520
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,076
- And what is it?
- Persistence.

521
00:34:11,281 --> 00:34:14,114
Groveling, commitment.
Take your pick.

522
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,479
I fled town because of you. Fled.

523
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:20,316
I was young and stupid,
and then things changed.

524
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,654
Life got real.

525
00:34:24,828 --> 00:34:27,296
You'd know that better than anyone.

526
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:34,435
Hypothetically speaking, if allowed,
how would you make things right?

527
00:34:34,638 --> 00:34:36,799
Well, more groveling, of course.

528
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:40,273
A recap of the past few years
spent soul searching.

529
00:34:40,477 --> 00:34:41,637
Cheese fries.

530
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:45,046
Obvious.

531
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:47,445
I know my audience.

532
00:34:52,055 --> 00:34:54,888
Yes to lunch. Call me.

533
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,455
<font color="#808080">CAROL :</font>
Look around. What's missing?

534
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:04,131
Flames, the candles.
Why aren't they lit?

535
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:08,537
There's matches in the kitchen.

536
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:16,069
Bitch.

537
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:51,678
- Hey.
- Hey.

538
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,510
So how are things with Stefan?

539
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:57,414
Great. Just great.

540
00:35:57,587 --> 00:35:58,849
Really?

541
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:01,022
Well, my radar must be off...

542
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:04,592
...because I was getting all sorts
of other vibes.

543
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:08,261
What is that?

544
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,124
Don't.

545
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:14,063
- Caroline, what happened?
- Nothing, okay?

546
00:36:14,237 --> 00:36:15,363
That is not nothing.

547
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:17,404
- Did somebody hurt you?
- No, okay, it...

548
00:36:17,574 --> 00:36:19,337
Nothing, it just...

549
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,469
My mom would kill me.

550
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:26,243
- Did Damon hurt you?
- No.

551
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:28,213
Of course not.

552
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:31,854
Just leave me alone,
okay, Elena? God.

553
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:46,493
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

554
00:36:46,736 --> 00:36:50,672
You stay away from Caroline
or I will go to her mother, the sheriff.

555
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:54,741
You got it? Stay away from her.

556
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:04,447
I'm sorry.

557
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:06,181
I take it all back.

558
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:08,914
- You're right about Damon.
- What did he do?

559
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:12,027
There are bruises
all over Caroline's body.

560
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:15,631
Bite marks. And he has her all confused
and messed up in the head.

561
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:21,099
You don't look surprised.

562
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:26,170
I'm handling it.

563
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:29,640
Handling it? Stefan, you should be
having him arrested.

564
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:32,940
Elena, please, l...

565
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:36,552
- I don't expect you to understand.
- I don't understand anything, Stefan.

566
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,011
So why don't you
just clear it up for me?

567
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:41,987
Look, there are things
that you don't know, okay?

568
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,128
Things that I want to tell you,
but I can't.

569
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:47,626
And I may never be able to.

570
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,792
And I just need you to trust me.

571
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,332
Trust is earned.

572
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:56,131
I can't just magically hand it over.

573
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:05,975
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

What are you doing here?

576
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,733
I was thinking maybe I could
make one more wrong choice today.

577
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:34,741
I still have 17 minutes.

578
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,880
Don't.

579
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:52,191
She took it off
and I got flustered, okay?

580
00:38:52,362 --> 00:38:55,195
I didn't know what to say.
But I swear, I did not tell her.

581
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:58,095
I just told her
that you didn't mean to hurt me.

582
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:19,086
You make me crazy, you know that?

583
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:24,889
It's okay. I forgive you.

584
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:28,497
- I swear I didn't say...
- No, don't... Shh, shh, shh.

585
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:35,427
It's okay.

586

I knew I couldn't spike your drink.

589
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:11,337
So I spiked hers.
