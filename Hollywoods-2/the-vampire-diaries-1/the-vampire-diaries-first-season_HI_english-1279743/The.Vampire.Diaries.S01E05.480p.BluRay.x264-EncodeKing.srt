<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> For over a century,
I have lived in secret, until now.

3
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,871
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,704
<font color="#808080">CAROLINE :</font> How come you don't sparkle?
- Because vampires burn in the sun.

5
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:15,711
- You go in the sun.
- I have a ring. Protects me.

6
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:17,348
The pocket watch, where is it?

7
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:19,643
<font color="#808080">JEREMY :</font> It's mine.
<font color="#808080">FORBES :</font> Did you get the Gilbert watch?

8
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:21,376
- I can get it.
- Good. We need it.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,111
<font color="#808080">CAROLINE :</font> What is that?
- It's a very important crystal.

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,954
You're the mystery guy, and I like that,
but with mystery comes secrets.

11
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:32,289
- I just need you to trust me.
- Trust is earned.

12
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:33,624
Caroline, what happened?

13
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,357
- Nothing.
- Did Damon hurt you?

14
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:38,765
- There are bruises all over Caroline.
- I'm handling it.

15
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,201
<font color="#808080">ZACH :</font>
Vervain could weaken him if he ingested it.

16
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:43,671
It would help get you the upper hand.

17
00:00:44,176 --> 00:00:47,805
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> I knew I couldn't
spike your drink, so I spiked hers.

18
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:52,575

- They've come back.

Where's my ring?

20
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:11,731

22
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,001
- How long have I been here?
- Three days.

23
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:23,075
What are you doing?

24
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:25,580
During the Dark Ages,
when a vampire's actions...

25
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:29,310
...threatened to expose
or bring harm upon the entire race...

26
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:30,954
...they would face judgment.

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,422
They sought to reeducate them
rather than to punish them.

28
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:40,596
You know what will happen
if I don't feed on blood.

29
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,233
You'll grow weaker and weaker.

30
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:44,959
And eventually,
you won't be able to move or speak.

31
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:48,435
In a week, your skin will desiccate,
and you'll mummify.

32
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:50,199
A living corpse.

33
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,606
Unable to hurt anyone. Ever.

34
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:57,579
So, what, you're just gonna leave me
in the basement forever?

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,480
I've injected you with enough vervain
to keep you weak.

36
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,813
Once your circulation stops,
I'll move you to the family crypt...

37
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:06,856
...and then in 50 years,
we can reevaluate.

38
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,352
- I'm stronger than you think.
- You always have been.

39
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:15,596
But you're not stronger than the vervain,
and we both know it.

40
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:19,964
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:25,440
Didn't have to be this way.

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm almost done.

44

It's okay. Take your time.

45
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:30,136
I think you might be in trouble.

46
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:32,367
What'd you do?

47
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:36,139
- Elena saw me.
- I'm a drug-using delinquent.

48
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:39,250

Uh-huh.

52
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:52,759
- And you have no objection?
- He could be craftier about it.

53
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,700
At least make an effort
to sneak her in and out.

54
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:59,359
Oh, and just so you know,
I won't be home for dinner.

55
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:03,736
Ohh. So you're actually going to do it.
You're gonna go out with Logan.

56
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:07,343
I'm gonna show up
and torture him, yes.

57
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:09,575
And have you heard from Stefan?

58
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:14,018
Not since he left
that very vague message three days ago.

59
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:18,589
"Hi. Um, Elena, I, um...
I have something I have to do.

60
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,782
I'll, uh, explain in a few days."

61
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:24,358
- Haven't you called him?
- Nope.

62
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:26,224
Not going to either.

63
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:28,589
And you're okay with everything?

64
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:33,895
No, I'm not okay with any of it.
But I'm not gonna cry about it either.

65
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:36,574
I was gonna write in my diary,
and then I thought:

66
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:39,734
"What am I gonna write?"
I'm not gonna be one of those girls...

67
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:43,108
...whose world stops spinning
because of some guy.

68
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:44,775
Okay, then.

69
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,282
I'll be fine.

70
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:50,944
He's awake.
He's weak, but it's probably best...

71
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,318
...to stay out of the basement.
He's Damon.

72
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,425
I'm not sure how dangerous
he might be.

73
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,119
- You're going to school?
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> Came here to live a life.

75
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,465
Why haven't you called her?

76
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:05,899
What am I supposed to do,
feed her another lie?

77
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:09,438
I hate lying. I'm not good at it.
She thinks I'm hiding something.

78
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:12,839
What choice do you have? You came
back here because you wanted...

79
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:16,981
...to live as normal a life as you could.
You knew this was gonna be a part of it.

80

I remember the party.

81
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:23,616
Damon came up behind me...

82
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:29,056
...and he was kissing my neck,
or biting my neck.

83
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:31,355
I passed out.

84
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:33,827
It's like there's holes
in my memory lately.

85
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:36,297
It's just weird.

86
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:40,804
- Maybe I let him bite me.
- Why would you do that?

87
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,664
Can we just not talk about it?

88
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:46,777
Okay?
I just don't wanna talk about Damon.

89
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:49,937
I don't wanna talk about any of it.

90
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:52,606
Just want to go back to normal.

91

93
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,351
Nothing.

94
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,516
What's this?

95
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,719
<font color="#808080">CAROLINE :</font>
Damon gave it to me.

96
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:08,127
Or he was going to give it to me.

97
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,464
- All I know is it's mine now.
- It's ugly.

98

- Yes. Yeah.

to be upset with me.

- Sure. When?

- Okay.
- Thanks.

He has some serious apologizing to do.

119

He's gone, Caroline.

We're not family, Damon.
Only in the most dysfunctional sense.

breathing, loving family because of you.

00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,676
Hitting the hour mark.
Nothing's wrong, though.

164
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:50,948
Which means I'm not talking
boy problems with you.

165
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:55,678
Good. I mean, it's not like
we were ever best friends or anything.

169
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,256
- Is he a good guy?
- Why? What's he done?

170
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:07,864
Not any one thing.

171
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,627
He's just so secretive.
I think there's something...

172
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:14,135
...that he doesn't want me to know,
which makes me wanna know.

173
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,798
Like that he's a serial killer
and he keeps a clown suit in his trunk?

174
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:19,910
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font>
No, of course not.

175
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:22,638
But what do we know
about him, really?

176
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:24,681
He's great at football.

177
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,518
Little bit of a loner.

178
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,918
And as much as I hate saying it,
he might be a nice guy.

179
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:37,684
So you think I'm just being paranoid?

180
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,629

<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> Talk to who?

- I got held up.

183

- Is everything okay?
- There's this thing with my uncle.

184
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:54,577
You couldn't call and tell me
you're gonna be an hour late?

Okay. You two have fun.

- Okay.
- No. Elena, please.

189

gets a vague non-answer.

204
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:11,984
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font>
I tried.

205
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:14,148
I want so much to make things right...

206
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:18,294
...but every instinct in my body
is telling me to be careful.

207
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,091
What you don't know can hurt you.

208
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,062
Evening, sheriff.

209
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:28,805
- Anything?
- We went over the west side of the lake.

210
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:31,965
All the caverns by the falls were clean.
No signs of habitat.

211
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,769
Then they're staying in town.

212
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:36,436
We canvassed all abandoned buildings
and warehouses.

213
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:40,015
- There has to be a private residence.
- And that much harder to locate.

214
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:42,244
These creatures know
how to go undetected.

215
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,446
Someone who only comes out at night
should become obvious.

216
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:47,648
- What about the watch?
- I'm working on it.

217
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,284
I knew the Gilberts. That watch
is passed down to the men in the family.

218
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,556

- Dinner.

is one of your favorites.

234

And I happen to be a good cook.

235
00:14:44,849 --> 00:14:48,410
Italian roots demand it. I can even make
my own homemade mozzarella.

Only, tonight, it is,

what you're trying to accomplish.

You wanna know me, right?

239
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,167
Well, I figure
if you're gonna dump me...

240
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:06,269
...you should at least, um,
know who you're dumping.

241
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,607
- So let's start with Katherine.
- Stefan...

242
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:15,542
She was the most beautiful girl
that I had ever met.

243
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,176
She had this perfect olive skin.

244
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,581
And she had this laugh.
It was ridiculous.

245
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:25,086
I mean, her laugh made you laugh.

246
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,782
And she was fun.
She knew how to have a good time.

247
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:35,866
But Katherine was also very impatient
and entitled and selfish and impulsive.

248
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,729
Enter Damon.

249
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:41,462
He claims that he was with her first.
I don't know.

250
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:46,439
I do know that I did some things
that I'm not proud of.

251
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,180
And my biggest regret...

252
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:54,679
...is not being able to make it right
before she died.

253
00:15:57,822 --> 00:15:59,790
I miss her...

254
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:04,250
...but I'm no longer crippled
by her loss.

255
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,222

It was very nice what you did for Stefan.

256

- Well, I was feeling romantic.

257

260
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:21,803
Those are left over
from the car accident.

261
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:24,311
So she won't miss them.

262
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:27,978
No, not with that. That's an antique.

263
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:36,922

264

- That's the beauty of choice.
- Well, then let's choose not to.

265
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:43,934
I mean, we don't have to be high
all the time, right?

266
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:46,300
I hope you're not one of those guys...

267
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:49,872
...who, now that we're together,
tries to change everything about me.

268
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,865
No.

I love some good Grisham.

I think Seinfeld is the best American
television show of the past 50 years...

273
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:14,954
...but I Love Lucy is all-time.

274
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,396
The "Loving Cup" episode
is the best, I think.

When I first moved here,
I stayed at the Salvatore boarding house.

he was even here until the attack.

- His uncle got killed.
