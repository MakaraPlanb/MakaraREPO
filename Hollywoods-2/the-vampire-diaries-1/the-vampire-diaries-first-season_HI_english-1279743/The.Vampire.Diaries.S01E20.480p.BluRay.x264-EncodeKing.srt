00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:31,524
- I gave it to Damon.
- What?

316
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:35,432
I gave your device to Damon.
Why don't you ask him for it yourself?

317
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,369
He'd be delighted to give it to you.

318
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,874
And then, Mr. Gilbert,
may you rot in hell.

<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> Talk to me, Stefan.

Why are you doing this?

321

I'm making the decision
I should have made years ago.

322
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,250
What are you talking about?

323
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,993
You have to feed to complete
the transition.

I know that.

325
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,027
It was a choice I shouldn't have made.

326
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:16,743
Dear God.

327
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:19,348
Even in our death,
you only feel shame?

328
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:21,643
- You're one of them now.
- No.

329
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,752
Father, I came to say goodbye.

330
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,183
I watched you die.

331
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:28,184
You were there when we were shot?

332
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:30,189
I pulled the trigger myself.

333
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:32,427
You killed your own sons?

334
00:23:32,596 --> 00:23:35,565
You were dead to me the moment
you sided with the vampires.

335
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:38,565
I thank God your mother isn't alive
to see the disgrace.

She had this excitement in her eyes.

getting caught.

you're not exactly innocent.

In this important soul-searching and
cleansing of demons of Stefan's past...

417
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:58,980
...did you ever manage
to get the story?

- Yeah. That's an understatement.

- Damon, I've been to see Father.

426
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:37,685
He came at me.

427
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:42,029
I didn't know my own strength.
There was blood everywhere.

428
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,428
He was dying
and the blood was too strong.

429
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:46,797
I needed it.

430
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,460
- I had to have it.
- You fed.

431
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,469
Yes. And it's incredible.

432
00:29:50,674 --> 00:29:53,768
My body is exploding with power,
Damon.

433
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,405
- No.
- I can hear things from far away.

434
00:29:56,913 --> 00:30:00,474
I can see through the darkness.
I can move like it's magic.

435
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:05,121
And the guilt, the pain, Damon,
I can turn it off like a switch.

436
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:08,223
Katherine was right.
It's another world out there, Damon.

440
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:18,596

We can do this together.

447
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:28,070
The moment Stefan had his first taste of
human blood, he was a different person.

448
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:31,201
I suppose I should thank him.
It's been a hell of a ride.

449
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:35,978
Oh, my God.
He said he wanted to die.

450
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:38,671
That's why he won't feed.
Now I understand why, but...

451
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:40,275
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font>
His choice.

452
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,842
If he's stupid enough to make it,
so be it.

453
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:48,514
Don't do that, okay?
Don't pretend like you don't care.

454
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:51,655

461
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:43,610

00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,839

00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:22,367
It feels more like a gift.

479
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:25,642
- That will change.
- Why is that?

480
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:34,523
Because even in death,
your heart is pure, Stefan.

481
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:37,993
I sense that about you.

482
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:41,887
That will be your curse.

483
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,697
Emily, wait.

484
00:34:54,377 --> 00:34:55,537
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font>
Stefan.

485
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:03,378
Damon told me the rest of the story.

486
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,454
I thought I might find you here.

487
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:08,716
<font color="#808080">STEEFAN :</font> I should have died that night...

488
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:11,990
...just like I had chosen.

489
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:16,893
- I should have let Damon die too.
- But you didn't.

490
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:21,196
And if you die now,
it's not gonna change what happened.

491
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:25,303
Every single person that's been hurt...

492
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:29,237
...every single life that's been lost,
it's because of me.

493
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:36,875
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> The night that my parents died...

494
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,381
...I blew off family night
so that I could go to some party.

495
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:45,084
I ended up getting stranded,
and they had to come pick me up.

496
00:35:45,261 --> 00:35:48,458
That's why we ended up in the car
at Wickery Bridge.

497
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:50,292
And that's why they died.

498
00:35:52,168 --> 00:35:55,729
Our actions are what set things
in motion.

499
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:58,439
But we have to live with that.

500
00:36:02,945 --> 00:36:04,776
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> I made a choice, Elena.

501
00:36:04,947 --> 00:36:07,973
And because of that choice,
a lot of people were hurt.

502
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:11,917
You also made a choice to stop, to reject
the person that the blood made you.

503
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:14,784
- You made a choice to be good.
- No. Please don't do that.

504
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:18,188
That's the person who jumped
in the water to save the family...

505
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:21,194
...whose car had driven off the bridge.
- Don't make this okay.

506
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:23,332
That's the person who saved my life.

507
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:25,933
- You don't understand, Elena.
- Then tell me.

508
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:27,364
It hurts me.

509
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,437
It hurts me, knowing what I've done,
and that pain...

510
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,437
...that pain is with me all the time.

511
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:35,334
And every day, I think that if I just...

512
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:41,114
If I just give myself over to the blood,
I can make that pain stop.

513
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,946
It would be that easy,
and every day, I fight that.

514
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,646
And I am so terrified that one day...

515
00:36:47,824 --> 00:36:50,088
...l'm not gonna wanna fight anymore,
Elena.

516
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:52,885
The next time I hurt somebody...

517
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,866
...it could be you.
- There will be no next time.

518
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:02,027
- You don't know that.
- Maybe I don't.

519
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,705
But what I do know...

520
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:08,310
...is that you can take this...

521
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:11,208
...throw it in the quarry,
and let the sun rise.

522
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:14,373
Or you could take this ring
and put it on.

523
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,711
And keep fighting.

524
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,930
It's your choice.

525
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:44,377
Elena.

526
00:38:21,784 --> 00:38:23,775
- Thank you, Harper.
- You're welcome.

527
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,716
Annabel should be back in a minute.

528
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:28,254
You don't have to come with us
if you don't want to.

529
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:32,121
This was never my home, Miss Pearl.
I was just a soldier who was left to die.

530
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:34,593
You saved me. I'm coming with you.

531
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:37,892
Let me help you with these.

Good night, Damon.

- No, Stefan, thank you.

You're back on Bambi blood,
I'm the badass again.

538

- All is right in the world.
- I mean it.

Thank you.

540
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,045
For helping her take care of me.

541
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:34,223
You brood too much. Everything
on this planet's not your fault.

542
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,858
My actions, what I do, not your fault.
I own them.

543
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:40,621
They belong to me.
You are not allowed to feel my guilt.

544
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:42,757
Do you feel guilt?

545
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:47,132
If I wanted to, it's there.

546
00:39:58,147 --> 00:39:59,637
Emily waited till I turned...

547
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:03,216
...to tell me she'd been successful
protecting Katherine with her spell.

548
00:40:03,386 --> 00:40:05,479
She didn't want me to know
about the tomb.

549
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:07,589
She thought
it would impact my decision.

550
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,815
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> She didn't want either one of us
to turn.

551
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:11,357
She said it was a curse.

552
00:40:11,928 --> 00:40:15,159
Witches. Judgy little things.

553
00:40:16,232 --> 00:40:18,826
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want you to know.

554
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:21,162
Because I hated you, and I still do.

555
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:23,833
I know.

556
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:26,338
But not because you forced me
to turn.

557
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,570
Then why?

558
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,349
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Because she turned you.

559
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:39,813

00:40:40,756 --> 00:40:41,848
