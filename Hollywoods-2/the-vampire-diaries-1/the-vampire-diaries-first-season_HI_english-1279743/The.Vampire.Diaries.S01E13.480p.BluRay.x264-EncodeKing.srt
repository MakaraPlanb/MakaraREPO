<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Elena, a dead ringer for Katherine.

00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:13,190
You have no idea of the future
I have planned for us.

5
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:14,993
You, me and Damon.

6
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:17,602
Our love for Katherine
wasn't real, Damon.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,671
Katherine never compelled me.
I knew everything.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,070
I'm gonna bring her back.
Tell me how to get in the tomb.

9
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:24,732
- The grimoire.
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Where is it?

10
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:26,572
The journal. Johnathan Gilbert's.

11
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:29,374
- Your ancestor's journal?
- I gave it to my teacher.

12
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:30,709
- Alaric Saltzman.
- Damon.

13
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:34,216
The grimoire, it was Emily's?
You need it to reverse the spell?

14

- I'll help you.
- Okay.

15
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:38,250
I told Damon
that I'd help him get Katherine back.

16
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:40,449
- But it was a lie. I can't let him.
- Don't.

Now that we're all friends
and working toward a common goal.

48
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:11,432
So in order to open the tomb,
we need to find the journal...

49

you're on journal duty.

<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> Okay.

What exactly is a grimoire anyway?

59

It's a witch's cookbook.

60
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:45,505
Every spell a witch casts is unique.
Every witch would document their work.

61

- Yeah. Cookbook.
- What about our mystery vampire?

62
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:51,849
Dimwit, obviously,
wasn't working alone...

63
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:54,486
...so whoever is out there
knows who we are.
