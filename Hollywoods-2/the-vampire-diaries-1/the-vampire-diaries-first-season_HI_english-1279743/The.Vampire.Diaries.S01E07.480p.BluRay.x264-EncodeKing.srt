We never should've trusted that Logan...

- How many are we dealing with?

160

The coroner thinks one.
The wound radius and the jaw pattern...

161
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:58,399
Are we in danger? If it found the watch,
then it knows we know.

And should I even be saying "it"?

- Lf it has any historical knowledge of...

came from. Yes, we could be in danger.

- Just keep it quiet.
