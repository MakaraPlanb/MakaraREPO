I have lived in secret.

3
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:09,402
Until now.
I know the risk, but I had no choice.

4
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:10,599
I have to know her.

5
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:12,437
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.

6
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:15,044
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> I know. We have history together.

7
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:20,082

drove off of a bridge into the lake.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,495

14
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:35,262
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> Something bit her.
She's losing a lot of blood.

15
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:37,197
Somebody help.

17
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,066

- Stop it.

18
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:43,267
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Let's just go straight for Elena.
Imagine what her blood tastes like.

00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:44,466
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> Stop.

20
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:49,476
Stay away from Elena.

21
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,706
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> I take that as an invitation.

22

- Hey, did you hear that?
- Hear what?

23
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,298
I heard thunder.

24
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:11,833
- There's no thunder.
- Are you sure?

25
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:14,665
Because if it rains,
we won't be able to see the comet.

26
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:15,999
It's not gonna rain.

27
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:20,140
Listen, I got you a little something.

28
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,337

Dear diary  :

45
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:07,818
This morning is different.

46
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:09,248
There's change.

47
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:12,754
I can sense it. Feel it.

48
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,415
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font>
I'm awake.

49
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,561
For the first time in a long time...

50
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:21,165

and undeniably wide awake.

Sexy stewardess.

63
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:59,796
- Boozy housewife.
- Up it is.

64
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,473

73
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,864
She's lost a lot of blood.

74
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,508
Yeah, but she's gonna be okay, right?

75

Uh... It was passed down
through the family.

93
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,591
- Ah.
- I have lots of books. Go ahead.

94

- Keep it.
- Oh, no, l...

95

My ancestors were these really cool
Salem witch chicks or something.

101
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:56,143
Grams tried to explain it, but she was
looped on the liquor. I tuned out.

102
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:59,085
Crazy family, yes.
Witches, I don't think so.

103
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,921
<font color="#808080">CAROLINE :</font> Yeah, feel free to conjure up the name

106
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:09,596

- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

110

- Now get out of here.
- How bad is she?

111
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:32,946
What attacked her? Is she gonna
recover? Was she happy to see you?

112

- What room was she in?
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

Yeah, you keep saying that, but when
are you gonna actually do it? Huh?

it takes her to come rushing home.

<font color="#808080">MATT :</font> I know.

126
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,730

of some missing campers.

127
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:22,965
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> Did she say what kind of animal
it was that attacked her?

128
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:26,008

<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> What?

00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:30,046
<font color="#808080">MATT :</font> Yeah, she wakes up last night,
mutters, "Vampire," and passes out.

<font color="#808080">MATT :</font> Think she was drunk.

131
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:37,378
So, what's up with you
and the new guy?

132
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:44,420
Matt,
the last thing I wanna do is hurt you.

133
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,592
You know, I'm actually
gonna go back to the hospital.

134
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:52,203
I wanna be there when Vicki wakes up,
get the real story about last night.

135
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:54,502

if I remember correctly.

141
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:26,870
And you're related to the family how?
The mother's kid sister.

142
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,773
- Younger sister. Yes.
- Right.

143
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:35,071
Six classes? Are you sure?
I mean, that's kind of hard to do.

144
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:37,208
Not when you're on drugs.

145
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:40,577
It's his attempt at coping,
Miss Sommers.

146
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:45,712
And the signs are there. He's moody,
withdrawn, argumentative, hung-over.

147
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,987
Are there any other relatives
in the picture?

148
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:53,027
- I'm their sole guardian.
- Uh-huh.

149
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:54,926
Could there be?

150
00:08:57,969 --> 00:08:59,732
What are you suggesting exactly?

151
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:04,766
<font color="#808080">TANNER :</font> It's an impossible job, isn't it?
