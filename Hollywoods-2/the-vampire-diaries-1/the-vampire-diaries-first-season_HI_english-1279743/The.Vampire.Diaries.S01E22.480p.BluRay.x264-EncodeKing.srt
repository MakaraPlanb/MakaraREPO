I have lived in secret. Until now.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,037
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,545
But Damon does.
And you're gonna get it for me.

7
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,942
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel
so she can give it to John who's gonna turn around to kill me.

8

But it'll be useless.
Bonnie can take the spell off.

13
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,199

...with that whole "I'm insecure,

29
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,260
I'm still enjoying that.

Who else would've done it?

48
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,979
He doesn't understand, Anna.
It's who he is. He hates all vampires.

49
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,550
He's just doing what he thinks is right.

50
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,451
Are you defending him?

51
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,298
No. No way.

52
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:53,962
It's just...

53
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,658
I do understand where he's coming from.

54
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:01,796
He's convinced all the tomb vampires
want revenge on this town and he's just...

55
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,069
He's trying to protect it.

56
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,402
They do want revenge.

57
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,408
Or at least they did.

58
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,408
But that's why we separated from them.

59
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,350
My mom wasn't after revenge.
She just wanted her life back.

60
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,922
I have to get out of this town, Jeremy.

61
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,684
You're leaving?

62
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,196
But I've been thinking, you could come.

63
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,424
I could turn you.
You said you wanted me to.

64
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,100
Here.

65
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,564
It's my blood.

66
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,834
If you die with it in your system,
you'll come back.

67
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,435
- Anna...
- I know you.

68
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,136
What it's like for you.

69
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:46,183
Being alone, always feeling empty inside,
no one to understand.

70
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,613
But when you're a vampire,
you don't have to feel that way.

71
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,723
You can shut it off.

72
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,324
I can show you how.

73
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,064
I wanted to. I did.

74
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,963
But I don't think I can.

75
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,998
I'm sorry.

76

77

I really hope that it's not true.

85
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,203
What am I supposed to do?

86
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:50,281
Do I just confront him and say,
"Are you my biological father?"

87
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,352
Well, I guess when you're ready.

88
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,046
I'm never gonna be ready.

89
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,190
Stefan, I have enough problems
with the family that I actually care about.

90

Jeremy hates me. And why wouldn't he?

91

every single reason to.

He's never gonna forgive me for Vicki.

94
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,396
For taking away his memory,
for lying to him.

Stay part of the celebration.
They'll never see us coming.

for what our ancestors did in 1864.

155

160
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,183
Anna.

161
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,519
What are you doing here?

162
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,492
This is the only way.
Draw them out and kill them.

163
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,358

- No. Did he mention something to you?
- No.

171
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,566
Nothing worth repeating.

172
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,004

and that eye thing that you do.

- No. I did.

190

199
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:16,055

- Enlighten me, please.
- See, Damon...

210
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:53,656
...it's only real when it comes
from your desire to do the right thing.

211

For nothing in return.

212

491

495
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,025
<font color="#808080">FORBES :</font> There was internal bleeding.
They're taking her into surgery.

496
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,254
What else did they say?
Is she gonna be okay?

497
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,129
They're gonna do everything they can.

498
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,933
Tyler, have you talked to your mom?

499
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,600
I left her a message telling her I was here.

500
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,578
You need to call her.

501
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,439
What is it?

502
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,949
It's your dad.

503
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,448
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

504
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,280
- You just missed Elena.
- I was looking for you, actually.

I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire.

I hope you know that.

that things have to change.

510
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,834
Damon has to change.

511
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,335
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> We both want the same thing.

512

we care about.

513
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,780
The difference is, for you,
Damon is one of them.

514
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,748
You saw what I was able to do tonight.

515
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,547
I know who I am now.

516
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:03,886
And if Damon spills so much
as one drop of innocent blood...

517
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,188
...l'll take him down.

518
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,436
Even if I have to take you with him.

519
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,371

It's not important.

Thank you.

526
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,318
You know, I came in this town
wanting to destroy it.

527

Tonight...

528
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,384
...I found myself wanting to protect it.

529
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,029
How does that happen?

530
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,264
I'm not a hero, Elena.

531
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,697
I don't do good.

532
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,166
It's not in me.

for my brother and you and Bonnie.

Even though she has every reason
to hate me, still helped Stefan save me.

536
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,012
Why do you sound so surprised?

537
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,315
She did it for you.

538
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,689
Which means
somewhere along the way...

539
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,160
...you decided that I was worth saving.

540
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:50,698
And I wanted to thank you...

I'm sorry.

You know, I first met Isobel
when I was a teenager.

552
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,969
I fell in love with her instantly, although
I'm pretty sure she never loved me.

553
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,168
She was special.

554
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,905
Part of why I hate the vampires so much
is because of what she became.

555
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,077
How it ruined her.

556
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:20,150
And I never would've sent her to Damon
had I known she wanted to turn.

557
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,717
It's my fault.

558

I'm telling you this because I hope...

559
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,260
...maybe you'd understand.
