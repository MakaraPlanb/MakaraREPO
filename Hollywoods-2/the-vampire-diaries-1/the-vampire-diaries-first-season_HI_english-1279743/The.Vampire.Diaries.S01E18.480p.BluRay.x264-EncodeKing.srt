And it's a very special one this year.

474
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:59,018
The 150th birthday of our town.

475
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:03,288
And...

476
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:07,026
And I would like to welcome
back one of our town's favorite sons...

477

our official charter bell.

It's good to be home.

483

- Whose?

484
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:43,897
The town's favorite son.
Look at his ring.

- Yeah, and that'd be a big coincidence...

487
00:30:52,014 --> 00:30:55,108
...if he didn't just come back
from the dead five minutes ago.

488
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:58,844

Sorry about that too.

God, all I can do is apologize.
What's that about?

Get out of my way, please.

What happened?

My arm.

513
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:53,384
I lost my balance and fell.

514

- I can't do it anymore, Mom.

Just go, all right? You've done it before,
more times than I can count.

And I failed Vicki.

But I won't do it to you again.

532
00:35:21,483 --> 00:35:24,281

me or are you gonna let Mr. Saltzman?

More than you can imagine, Damon.

542
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:07,756
My knowledge of this town
goes beyond anything that you...

543
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,330
...or you or the council knows.

544
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:15,061
So if you were planning on some clever
high-speed-snatch-ring-vamp-kill move...

goes to the council...

...including a fascinating little tale
of the original Salvatore brothers...

548
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:26,904

to Mystic Falls.

How'd you get that ring?

550
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:33,851
I inherited one.
My brother Gray, the other.

551
00:36:34,022 --> 00:36:37,753
This was his. And I wouldn't
have given mine to Isobel...

...had I known she'd hand it to a guy.
- So you did know her.

553
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:43,596
Who sent her your way
when she wanted to become a vampire?

554
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:45,357
- You sent her?
- Guilty.

555
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:50,303
Why, did you think someone else
sent her? Maybe Katherine Pierce?

556
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:54,075
- How do you know about Katherine?
- How do I know anything?

But then Matt's mom,
she got hurt and she was bleeding.

That guy in the parking lot,
I wanted to feed on him.
