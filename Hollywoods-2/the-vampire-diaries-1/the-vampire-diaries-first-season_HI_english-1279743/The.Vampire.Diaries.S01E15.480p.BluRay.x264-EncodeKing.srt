Well, I haven't heard that name
in years.

165
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,274
How do you know her?

166
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,083
I think that, um, well...

167
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,418
Do you know if she had a baby
that she gave up for adoption?

168
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,598
Oh, my God.

169
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,793
You're her daughter.

171
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,799
I was just gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

172
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,942
- Sure.
- Uh, the kitchen's this way.

173
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,150
I wasn't gonna come.
I didn't think I was.

174
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,157
But I was driving,
and I hit this stoplight...

175
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:41,526
...and it made me think about
when I was learning how to drive...

176
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,430
...and my mom would always warn me
about this blind turn on the left side...

177
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,970
...and then I was thinking
about my mom and...

178
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,502
I had your address.
I'm sorry for barging in.

179
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,542
It's no problem.

180
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,546
Um, just a surprise, though.

181
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,516
- I haven't thought about Isobel in years.
- When was the last time you saw her?

182
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:04,816
About 17 years ago,
when she left to go have you.

183
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:09,859
We kept in touch for a while,
but, well, you know, people drift apart.

184
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,859
And you don't know
where she ended up?

185
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,623
She was in Florida for a while.

186
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,359
She was on her own.
I know it wasn't easy.

187
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,029
Do you have any idea
who my father is?

188
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,371
I could never get her to fess up.

189
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:34,319
Anyway, she finally pulled it together,
got into college on a scholarship.

190
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,212
- Where did she go?
- Somewhere in North Carolina.

191
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,551
Duke, I think.

No, but don't worry.

208
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,554
She'll come home eventually,
when she needs something.

- I've played that game.
- Are you playing it now?

- No.
- Then what are you doing home?

211

to come back?

- Jenna told you.

- Yeah.
- So it's true.

217
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,947
Your wife, Isobel,
was Elena's birth mother.

218
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,113
What does Elena know?

219
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,020
- About your wife?
- About everything.

- About you, your brother.
- She knows what I am.

And she knows
that you know about the vampires.

- No.

223
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,129
I couldn't tell her, not until I was sure.

224
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,871
- You said you'd help me.
- I asked Damon. He doesn't remember.

225
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,006
- Ask him again.
- Damon is not stable right now.

226
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,671
He murdered my wife,
or at least made a meal of her.

227
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,716
- When has he been stable?
- I'm telling you not to push this.

228
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,582
- Give me a reason not to.
- Your survival. How's that?

229
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,313
I'll handle it,
but for now, I need you to let it go.

is let me know what you're up to.

244
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,429
I was doing research,
and I dug up all this stuff...

245
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,597
...about this small town in Virginia
near where I grew up.

246
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,903
It's isolated, out of the way,
and quiet.

247
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,740
And every now and then,
people die mysteriously.

248
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:27,317
And they say that it's animal attacks,
except these bodies are drained of blood.

- It's vampires. It has to be.
- Okay.

- No.

- Ugh.
...we can get some sleep.

- Oh, no.
- Come here. Look, this is why I love you.

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,065

in all of this stuff...

except hotter and a girl.

334
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,537
Do you know that I am one of
Mystic Falls' most eligible bachelors?

335
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,137
- Huh.
- Yep.

336
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:00,938
- How are you doing?
- Never better. Yep.

337
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:05,105
What can I do for you?
I'm a barrel of favors today.

338
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:08,548
It's my newfound purpose.
How can I help people?

339
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:12,053
I'm just meeting Stefan.
We're going to the fundraiser.

340
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,186
Help a guy out, will you?

341
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,854
Can't get this...

342
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,768
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> So I found out who my birth mother is.

343
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,466
Ugh, who cares?

344
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,146
She left you.

345
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,144
She sucks.

346
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,151
Stefan, there you are.

347
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,984
Hey.

348
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,489
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Ugh. I need a bigger jacket.

349
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,688
Wow. You know,
an occasional sorority girl...

350
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:58,393
...might, um, you know,
help fill you out a little bit.

351
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,774
He's fine?

352
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,343
- He's Damon.
- This heartache will be good for him.

353
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,811
It'll remind him that he has one,
even if it doesn't beat.

354
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,343
Won't hold my breath.

355
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,517
So I went to see Trudie Peterson.

356
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,382
I know. I'm sorry, I didn't plan it.

357
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,858
- How was it?
- She has vervain.

358
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,931
She knows about vampires, Stefan.
It can't be a coincidence.

359
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:36,101
It isn't. This is Alaric's wife.

360
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,471
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> This is her, this is Isobel.
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> He gave this to you?

361
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,841
Everything he knows about vampires,
he learned from her.

362
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,779
He believes that she was killed by one.

363
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,144
Oh, my God.

364
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,324
Listen, there's a lot about Isobel
that Alaric can tell you...

365
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,451
...but I need you to hold off a little while
before you talk to him.

366
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,630
- Why?
- I know it's a lot to ask of you...

367
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,426
...but will you do that for me?

368

371
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,672
Yep, that's the one. Ha-ha-ha.

372
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,409
Hey, look, I'm, uh, sorry about earlier.

373
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,816
It was just kind of a shock.

374
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,288
No, I'm sorry for dropping it on you.

375
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,920
- I felt like you should know.
- No, I get it.

376
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,530
At some point,
maybe you and Elena could talk.

377
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,929
I'm sure she'd like to hear about Isobel,
what she was like.

378
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,801
- Yeah...
- Or not. No pressure.

379
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,165
I don't know if that's a great idea. Ahem.

380
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,107
At least not... Not for a while.

381
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,812
- Where'd our girlfriend go?
- She's on her way to the Grill.

<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> I, uh, wanted to talk to you.

383

This is the woman, Isobel,

384
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,553
- Remember her now?
- Who wants to know?

385
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,286
- I do.
- Who else wants to know?

386
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,434
- Did you kill her?
- Sorry, don't know her.

He's total cougar bait.

390
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,740
- Impressive.
- More like embarrassing.

Ha, ha. Hi, Mrs. Donovan.

392
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,845

- Ha, ha, hi, Kelly.

393
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,510
- Long time no see.
- How are you?

394
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,351
Same old.
Oh. Matty tells me you broke his heart.

395
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,085
- Mom.
- Just kidding. Calm down.

396
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,888
He found his rebound girl.

397
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,832
Well, here you go, sweetheart.
However many that'll buy.

398
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,934
I just hope I don't get Bachelor 3.
Dated him in high school.

399
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,663

404
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,952
You're making me think
I should buy a ticket.

Well, you are in charge.
You could always rig it.

Pardon me.

I ran the check on the history teacher.

You want this
before or after your debut?

00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,076
- How's it look?
- He checks out.

411
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,542
Couple of speeding tickets.
Rough story, though.

412
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,238
His wife went missing
years back in North Carolina.

413
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,542
North Carolina?

414
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,082
- She have a name?
- Yeah. Isobel.

415
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,322

Wow, that's quite a mouthful.

420
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,322
- What do you do?
- I'm a teacher at Mystic Falls High.

421
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,422
Oh, beauty and brains, ladies.
This one's a keeper.

422
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,390
What do you teach?

423
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,125
- History.
<font color="#808080">CAROL :</font> History.

424
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,600
Oh, well,
give us a fun fact about Mystic Falls.

425
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:27,965
Something crazy.

426
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,568
Uh, well...

00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,474
He's probably saving the best stories
for his date.

And last but not least,
Damon Salvatore.

<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Well, I'm tough to fit on a card.

Do you have any hobbies? Like to travel?

431
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:55,432
Oh, yeah. L.A., New York.
Couple years ago I was in North Carolina.

432
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,331
Near the Duke campus, actually.
I think Alaric went to school there.

433
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,801
Didn't you, Rick?

434
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,872
Yeah, because I know your wife did.

435
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,039
I had a drink with her once.

436
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,942
She was, phew. She was a great girl.
Did I ever tell you that?

437
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,178
Because she was...

438
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,618
...delicious.

439
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,757
Mm! Mm-mm-mm.

440
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,655
- Are you okay?
- I just need some air.

441
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,236
Elena.

442
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,966
He killed her?
Damon was the vampire that killed her?

443
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,202
I don't know.
They never found the body.

444
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,211
- Oh, my God. Stefan.
- I know, I'm sorry.

445
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,544
I wanted to tell you, but I just...
I wanted to know more.

446
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,743
I was feeling sorry for him...

447
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,787
...hoping that this whole Katherine thing
would change him.

448
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,884
- I'm so stupid.
- He doesn't know the connection to you.

449
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,893
- I thought about confronting him, but...
- Why are you protecting him?

450
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:03,659
Because you're not the only one
hoping that he might actually change.

451
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,672
That man.

452
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,738
I saw that man outside of Trudie's.

453
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,808
Get back inside. Come on.

454
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:29,055
And Bachelor Number 3
goes to 37458.

This thing you're doing, this nice thing?
It's fake.

461
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,709
Like you, like your mom.

462
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:54,409
And for some reason, Matt fell for it,
but that doesn't mean that I will.

463
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,110
I don't like you, okay?

464
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,281

468
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,129
I was starting to think there was
something redeemable about you.

469

- Elena.
- Am I missing something here?

470
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,802
Did I forget to mention earlier
when we were talking...

471
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,968
...about my birth mother,
the one that gave me up?

472

Mm-hm.

473
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,980
Her name was Isobel.

- She's alive?

Don't you think it's time
to let this vampire crap go?

500

The research, the trips.
It's become an obsession.

501

- This is important to me, Rick.
- Why? Why is it so important?

Explain it to me.
I mean, make me understand.

I mean, what's the point of this?
You don't want kids.

You're barely ever home.
I want us to be normal people.

It's Pete.

He's gone. And it's all my fault.

- I did it. I always do it.
- No, you didn't, Mom.

It's not your fault.

What have you done?

Want me to tell you I killed her?
Will that make you happy?

528

- You know what happened.
- I saw you feeding on her.

529

Not an inkling?
Never considered the possibility?

534
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,310
I turned her.

But there was something about her.

- Something I liked, something special.
- You turned her because you liked her?

539
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:04,318
No, I slept with her because I liked her.
I turned her because she begged me to.

But you knew that too, didn't you? Hm.

541
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,871
I guess she wasn't happy at home.
Wasn't happy with life in general.
