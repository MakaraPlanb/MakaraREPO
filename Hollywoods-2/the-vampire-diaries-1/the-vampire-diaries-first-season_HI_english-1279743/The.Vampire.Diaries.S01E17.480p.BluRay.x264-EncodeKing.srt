A spell sealed Katherine in that tomb.

I'm gonna bring her back.

6
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:17,573
- She's not here!
- You saved everyone in the church?

7
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,945
We've taken up residence
just outside of town.

8
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,983
- All 25 vampires?
- Some.

different from the way we thought.

Agh!
You got a problem with blood, Anna?

17
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,740
I knew this girl, Vicki.
She was attacked, a bite to the neck.

18
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,781
- Then I saw your face.
- Why would you confront me about it?

19
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,250
Maybe it's true about Vicki.
And also because I want you to turn me.

That's only Dracula.

25
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,034
Yeah, he was a complete wuss.

26
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,138
Never showered. Very smelly.

No, you don't.

Why do you even want this?

37
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,290
Give me one good reason.

38
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,797

I might be able to go out.

- What did that get you?

00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,981
Your girlfriend, Bethanne, is dead.
You have no one to blame but yourself.

55
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,956
We cannot live our lives
about revenge.

56
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,963
We have to have better control
of our emotions.

57
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,065
I understand, Miss Pearl.

58
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,667
I just wish I knew
what you were up to.

59
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,602
I'm gonna make an exploratory visit
into town tomorrow...

60

...to assess who's under the influence
of vervain and who isn't.

61
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,384
Anna tells me
that the players haven't changed much.

62
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,780
It's still the Lockwoods,
Forbes, the Fells...

63
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:45,185
- We should kill every last one of them.
- We are smarter than that, Frederick.

64
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,655
These people are not our enemies.

65

The fact that you think it's possible...

00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,931
...to keep that a secret from your own
family is proof that you're not ready.

106
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,933
Not ready is a step up from no.

107
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,163
And a million steps down from maybe.

00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,475

No, but I don't see
why it would be a problem.

Why don't you keep this?

Do you even know

a one-way ticket out of loner-hood.

One, we need someone
to do our dirty work.

Two, revenge.

Three, boredom, but, you know,
that never turns out well.

And then, you know,
there's the obvious one.

259
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,696
That you love someone so much...

260
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,866
...that you would do anything
to spend all eternity with them.

Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't fit

Stop.

488
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,902
What's going on here?

489
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,653
- What did you do?
- Me?

490
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:21,519
Your merry little band of vampires
spent the day torturing my brother.

491
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,553
Trust me, the parties
responsible for this will be dealt with.

492
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,962
Our arrangement doesn't work
unless you learn to control them.

If I had a good side,
not a way to get on it.

Stefan. He's dead.

00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,291
How are you doing?

498
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,692
Uh, I'm okay.

499
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,325
The wounds have mostly healed.

500
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,990
Good.

501
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,633
- Elena.
- Yeah?

502
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:21,676
What you did today,
coming to help me...

503
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,073
...you could have been killed.

504
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,345
I know.

505
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,481
And what I did, I'm sorry that, uh...

506
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,255
I'm sorry that you had to see it.

507
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,030
I've just never...

508
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,461
You were like this other person.

509
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,868
- And it's my fault, I made you...
- What? No, no, no.

<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> You didn't make me do anything.
You were saving my life.

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,784

Are you?

520
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,044
Is there anything I can do?

I just, uh...

522
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,661
