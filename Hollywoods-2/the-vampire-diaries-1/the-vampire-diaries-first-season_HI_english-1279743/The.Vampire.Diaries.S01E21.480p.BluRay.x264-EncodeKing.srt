Wish it would've been more effective.

157
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,912
- Human life means that little to you?
- It means nothing to me.

158
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,151
It's just part of being what I am.

159
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,864
No, it's not. I know other vampires.
That's not true.

160
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,968
You mean your boyfriend over there
by the pool table?

161
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,763
Stefan Salvatore.

162
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:42,271
Why Stefan?
Why didn't you go for Damon?

163
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,965
Or do you enjoy them both...

164
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,878
...like Katherine did?

165
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,610
- We should be in there.
- No.

166
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,120
Isobel made it clear
we're not to step foot inside.

167
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,782
- I'm not gonna kill her in a restaurant.
- You're not gonna kill her, period.

168
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,952
She ruined your life.
You wanna protect her?

169
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,030
She's my wife.

170
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,632
Was. Was my wife.

171
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,635
I looked for the woman I married,
but she wasn't there. Whoever that is...

172
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,904
...is cold and detached.
- Yeah.

173
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,342
- She's given up her humanity.
- See, I don't get that.

174
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,474
Stefan has his humanity.
He's a good guy.

175
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,979
You kill people,
but I see something human in you.

176
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,640
But with her, there was...

177
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,577
There was nothing.

178
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,357
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> You can turn it off.
It's like a button you can press.

179
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,517
I mean, Stefan's different.
He wants the human experience.

180
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,391
He wants to feel every episode
of How I Met Your Mother...

181
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,031
...so he shuts his feelings out.

182
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,896
The problem is, as a vampire,
your instinct is not to feel.

183
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,334
Isobel chose the easier road.

184
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,703
No guilt, no shame.

185
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,206
No regret. I mean, come on.
If you could turn it off, wouldn't you?

186
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,679
- You haven't.
- Of course I have, Ric.

187
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,841

John had a crush on me for years.

He was the first one
that told me about vampires.

197

So, what made you wanna be one?

198
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,405
It's a very long list of reasons, Elena...

199
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,609
...all of which
I'm sure you've thought about.

200
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,052
That was your first lie.

It's inevitable.
You're gonna get old, Stefan won't.

202
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,423
Forever doesn't last very long
when you're human.

203
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,398
I'm sorry, but I don't have
what you're looking for.

204
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,469
Sit down.
And tell your boyfriend to walk away.

- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.

206

I know that. But Damon does.

207
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,679
- And you're gonna get it for me.
- He's not gonna give it to me.

208
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,955

- Yeah, I'm sure. Why?

I read a section about Damon erasing
my memory about what happened to Vicki.

Jeremy, please, you don't understand.

The night that Vicki died,
it was like Mom and Dad died all over again.

It was all over your face.
And it hurt so much to see you like that.

519
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,578
You act like you don't care,
and yet here you are hunting me down.

520
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,317
I'm leaving.

521
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,958
I just thought I'd say goodbye.

522
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,926
You couldn't be bothered the first time,
so why now?

523
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,691
- You hate me. Good.
- Does that make it easier for you?

524

What is the point of this exercise?

525
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:07,699
What did you expect? You spent
all this time trying to track me down.

526
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,434
- What did you think you would find?
- The woman who gave me this.

527
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:16,240
You act like you don't care, but you cared
enough to protect me after you left.

00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,442
I was a different person back then.

529
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,316
Right, right, right,
and that person is gone.

530

The woman I married, the woman I loved,
she's just... She's gone.

531

You expect me to believe that?

532
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,128
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm ring-free.

533
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:43,467
I'm vervain-free.
So either kill me or compel me, because...

534
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,499

I did.

it hurts.
