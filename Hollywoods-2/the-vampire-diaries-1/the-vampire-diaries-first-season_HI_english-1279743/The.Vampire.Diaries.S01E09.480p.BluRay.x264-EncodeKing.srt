I have lived in secret, until now.

3
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:08,613
I know the risk but I have to know her.

4
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:10,772
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font>
Elena. She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,611
- Hello, brother.
- Damon.

6
00:00:12,785 --> 00:00:17,813
He killed Zach, he killed Tanner,
he turned Vicki. I have to kill him.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,187
- No, you can't do that.
- You were right to stay away from me.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,828
<font color="#808080">CAROLINE :</font> What is that?
- A very important crystal.

9
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:27,056
It belonged to one of the most powerful
witches of our family...

10
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:29,291
...Emily Bennett.
- I want my crystal back.

11
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:30,730
- Bonnie has it.
- Get it from her.

12
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:32,700
Don't be giving that back to anybody.

13
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:37,133
<font color="#808080">TEACHER :</font> Today we're going to talk
about shadow reckoning.

14
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:40,710
This is a method of measuring heights
by the sun's shadow.

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,316
Let's say, for example, that we're going
to measure the distance of the shadow.

16
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:49,181
We're gonna take
this measurement here...

17
00:00:49,355 --> 00:00:51,880
...measure the length.

18
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:56,650
And we're going to multiply that
by the height of the source.

19
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:00,060
Building height can also be measured
using a clinometer...

20
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:02,496
...which we're going to make
in class tomorrow.

21
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:05,865
I've already given you the handout,
but I want to remind...

22
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:27,219
<font color="#808080">BONNIE :</font>Hello?

23
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,908
- Please help me.
- Who are you?

24
00:02:21,447 --> 00:02:23,278
I'm Emily.

25
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,575
You know that.

26
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,277
We're family.

27
00:02:28,454 --> 00:02:30,251
Where am I?

28
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:34,285
This is where it started.

29
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:37,958
And this is where it has to end.

30
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,395
No. This isn't real.

31
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,127
Help me.

32
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:46,168
<font color="#808080">TEACHER :</font>
What is similar about these methods...

33
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:50,434
...is that the right triangles
help give us an accurate measurement.

34
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:52,975
What are you looking at? Turn around.

35
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:56,911

<font color="#808080">CAROLINE :</font> No, I'm mad at her.

- She needs to make the first move.
- Be the bigger person.

39
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,559
Ugh, impossible in her presence.

40
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:20,671
- Why are you so pissed at her anyway?
- She's a thief, that's why.

41
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:23,672
I gave her my necklace
and she refuses to give it back.

42
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:27,744
- It's a matter of principle.
- All right, I tried. I'm officially out of it.

43
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:31,575
Good. Your turn. Where's Stefan?
Have you talked to him?

44
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,741
- He's avoiding me.
- Why?

45
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:35,377
It's complicated.

Are you okay?

53
00:04:13,392 --> 00:04:18,489
- ZMAN.

54
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:21,926
Alaric Saltzman.

55
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,627
It's a mouthful, I know.
It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.

56
00:04:25,804 --> 00:04:28,398
Saltzman is of German origins.

57
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:31,907
My family immigrated here in 1755
to Texas.

58
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:34,602
I, however,
was born and raised in Boston.

59
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,274
Now, the name Alaric belongs
to a very dead great-grandfather...

60
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:41,442
...I will never be able to thank enough.

61
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,747
You'll probably wanna
pronounce it Alaric...

62
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:47,050
...but it's "Alaric," okay?

63
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:49,626
So you can call me Rick.

64
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,224
I'm your new history teacher.

Peace offering.

69
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:03,966
Come on,
you need it for blood circulation.

70
00:05:04,142 --> 00:05:05,234
Does dead flesh good.

71
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:10,414
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Step aside, please.

72
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:14,479
I got the town off our back.
It was for the greater good.

73
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:16,621
But I'm sorry.

74
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:22,288
And to prove it, I'm not gonna feed
on a human for at least a week.

75
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:25,487
I'll adopt the Stefan diet.
Only nothing with feathers.

76
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:29,623
Because I realize that killing your closest
and oldest friend is beyond evil...

77
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,464
...and yet somehow
it's worthy of humor.

78
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,967
- Are you mimicking me?
- Yes, Stefan.

79
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:40,634
Now that the secret society
of vampire-haters is off our back...

80
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:45,306
...I can go back to my routine of "how
can I destroy Stefan's life this week?"

81
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:49,520
And I can go back to sulking
and Elena longing and forehead brooding.

82
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:51,155
This is fun. I like this.

83
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:54,053
And I will finally reveal
the ulterior motive...

84
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:58,287
...behind my evil and diabolical return
to Mystic Falls.

85
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:00,454
Yeah, I'm done.

Do you believe in ghosts?

93
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,479
- Two weeks ago, I'd say no, but now...
- I think I'm being haunted.

94
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,318
I don't get it. Why Emily?

95
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,391
Grams said she was a powerful witch
in the Civil War days.

96
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,188
This medallion was hers.
It's a witch's talisman.

97
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:33,354
It all started
when you got the necklace?

98
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:35,864
I think she's using it
to communicate with me.

99
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:38,366
- What does Grams say about it?
- I can't call her.

100
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:41,404
She's gonna tell me to embrace it.
I don't wanna embrace it.

101
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:42,767

but I've been trying to turn them around.

we're halfway through a semester...

...and half of fail is still pretty bleak.

116

This is the part where you say,
"What can I do to change that?"

I'm glad you asked.
How do you feel about extra credit?

- Good. Write me a paper then.

- History.

120
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:50,598
Pick a topic. Keep it local.
No Wikipedia regurgita.

121

These old towns
have a lot of rich history...

- Uh, yeah, deal.

- What is what?
- The "hey."

132
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:33,217
Now it's twice. That is two heys. That...

133
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:35,683
Do you have any other words
in your vocabulary?

134
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:38,482
- What's wrong with hey?
- It reeks of awkward subtext.

135
00:08:38,657 --> 00:08:40,124
You spent the night in my bed.

136
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:44,126
There was cuddling, and then you snuck
out so you wouldn't have to face me.

137
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:47,959
Which I must say is a total lame-guy
move that I did not appreciate.

138
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,862
And now with the "heys," seriously?

139
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:53,994
I mean, I may have been some pathetic,
insecure mess after the party...

140
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:56,640
...but do not mistake that
for me being a pushover.

141
00:08:56,808 --> 00:09:00,073
Because I do not let guys
mess with my head anymore.

142
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:03,076
I heard your mom
and didn't wanna get you in trouble...

143
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:04,714
...so I went out the window.

144
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:07,147
You went out the window.
Another lame-guy move.

145
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:09,753
Your mom's the sheriff.
And as for the "heys"...

146
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:13,823
...l'm pretty sure it's what I've said
to you every day since the first grade.

147
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,827
Oh.

148
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:20,658

Lame-girl move.

149
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:36,542
- Hi.
- You weren't in class, I was worried.

150
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:39,946
Yeah, I got your messages
and I'm sorry I didn't get back to you...

151
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:43,519
...but what I wanna say
shouldn't be said over the phone.

152
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:46,680
A simple, "I didn't kill my brother" text
would have sufficed.

153
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:50,851
I didn't kill my brother,
as much as he deserved it.

154
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:53,122
He has you to thank for that.

155
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:54,730
What did you wanna tell me?

156
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,429
I won't be coming to school anymore.

157
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,036
I'm gonna back off
and keep my distance.

158
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:01,638
It's the right thing to do.

159
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:07,402
Back off from school? Or from me?

160
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:16,315
Thank you for telling me.

161
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:19,082
- It's better this way.
- Yep, I got it.

162
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:25,552
You're angry, that's good.
Be easier if you hate me.

163
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:35,234
Okay, it's your last chance.

164
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,432
- I'm gonna scream.
- Oh, no, don't do that.

165
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:38,769
Let's stay on point.

166
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:41,640
Listen, I want my necklace.

167
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:43,144
You can't have it.

168
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:46,512
I can't take it, but you can give it to me.
I'm trying to help you.

169
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:49,586
- I don't want your help.
- You do and you don't even know it.

170
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:52,780
You've stumbled into something
you need to stumble out of.

171
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,121
- Just leave me alone or I swear...
- Nope, no threats.

172
00:10:56,294 --> 00:11:01,698
Look, A, you hurt me last time,
B, I wish you no harm.

173
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,801
Believe it or not, Bonnie,
I wanna protect you.

174
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,961
Let me help you
get Emily off your back.

175
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,599
- How do you know?
- I know a lot of things.

176
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:12,800
I know more about that crystal
than you do.

177
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:17,813
And I know that she's using it
to creep inside of you.

178
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,477
Huh? See how scared you are?

179
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:22,984
You should be,
because I will get that crystal...

180
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:26,851
...even if I have to wait for Emily
to give it to me herself.

181
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:32,622
So next time she comes out to play,
you tell her...

182
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:35,197
...that a deal's a deal.

183
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:46,305
He's bad news, Elena.
He really scared me.

184
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:49,345
You need to stay as far away
from Damon as possible.

185
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:52,141
I'm trying. He just keeps showing up.

186
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:56,781
I don't want you to be alone.
You're sleeping at my place tonight.

187
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:59,583
We can make a whole night out of it.

188
00:12:04,262 --> 00:12:05,593
Whoa...!

189
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:10,362
Where are you going?

190
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,432
<font color="#D900D9">(GRUNTS)</font>

191
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:26,681
- Are you okay?
- Now I am.

192
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:29,149
All my problems
are because of that thing.

193
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,721
- Can't believe I didn't do that sooner.
- What's your grams gonna say?

194
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:36,190
Grams isn't the one being haunted
by a 150-year-old ghost, is she?

195
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:39,489
Okay then.

196
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,726
<font color="#808080">JENNA :</font>
I like a man who can dine alone.

197
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,165
Quiet strength.

198
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:49,332
Thought you were still
in that Logan-depression thing.

199
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,134
I've sworn off men forever.

200
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:53,903
Doesn't mean I can't observe them
from a safe distance.

201
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:55,909
Well, I can introduce you.

202
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:04,518
Hey.

203
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:08,885
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font>Thanks for coming. I wouldn't
have called if it wasn't important.

204
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,857
I know that.

205
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:15,859
- He threatened her.
- What would Damon want with Bonnie?

206
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:20,061
She has this necklace. Caroline got it
from Damon and she gave it to Bonnie...

207
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:21,728
...and now Damon wants it back.

208
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:23,931
- He's tormenting her.
- Over a necklace.

209
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:28,044
It's not just any necklace.
It has to do with Bonnie's heritage.

210
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:32,775
It belonged to one of her ancestors
who lived here during the Civil War...

211
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:37,921
When you and Damon lived here.

212
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:40,216
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font>Her name was Emily.

213
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:43,383
She was Katherine's handmaid,
and a witch.

214
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,262
You know?

215
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:47,455
About Bonnie?

216
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:51,624
The first night that you invited me over
for dinner, I made the connection.

217
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:53,896
And now Damon knows.

218
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:56,870
And for some reason,
he wants that necklace.

219
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,235
What does it look like?

220
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,473
- It's, um, an antique iron setting with...
- With an amber crystal.

221
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,480
I know it. It belonged to Katherine.
Emily gave it to her which means that...

222
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:09,215
What?

223
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:13,450
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
Let me talk to Damon.

224
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,388
Will he tell you?

225
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,897
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font>I'll... I'll get it out of him.

<font color="#808080">JENNA :</font> No, not yet.

227
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:30,774
It's gotta be local
and non-lnternet research, so...

228
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:33,604
- That's easy, you got all your dad's stuff.
- What stuff?

229
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:36,269
How-the-Gilberts-came-over
on-the-Mayflower stuff.

230
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:38,278
All that family lineage from way back.

231
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:41,475
Your dad really loved
all that family-history stuff.

232
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:44,346
It's all boxed up in the closet.

233
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:51,592
- Mr. Saltzman.
- Jeremy, what's up, man?

234
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:55,494
- This is my Aunt Jenna.
- Alaric Saltzman. It's nice to meet you.

235
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,135
Jeremy was just telling me
about his paper.

236
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,100
Thanks for giving him another chance.

237
00:15:00,271 --> 00:15:01,602
Oh, you know, it was my first day.

238
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:03,764
I wanted to make a good impression.
Ha-ha-ha.

So, Stefan...

240
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:14,315
...you know, I've been thinking.
I think we should start over.

241
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:16,385
Give this brother thing another chance.

242
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:20,320
We used to do it,
oh, so well once upon a time.

I don't, Damon.

244
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:23,858
I can't trust you to be a nice guy.

245
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:28,397
You kill everybody and you're so mean.
You're so mean and...

246
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:33,128
You're really hard to imitate and then
I have to go to that lesser place.

247
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:36,364
Can I get a coffee, please?
So, what's with the bottle?

248
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,999
I'm on edge. Crash diet. You know,
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

249
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:44,376
You could just leave, find a new town to
turn into your own personal Gas 'n' Sip.

250
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:45,641
I'll manage.

251
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:48,179
Thanks.

252
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,549
You don't have to keep an eye on me.

253
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:54,089
- I'm not here to keep an eye on you.
- So why are you here?

254
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:56,055
Why not?

255
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,378
I'm sorry. There, I said it.

256
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:17,446
If you want the ugly-ass necklace,
keep it.

257
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:19,674
It's yours.

258
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,317
Will you hate me
if I tell you I threw it away?

259
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,355
- You threw it away?
- I know it sounds crazy.

260
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:30,221
- The necklace was giving me nightmares.
- You could have given it back to me.

261
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:32,693
Why? So you could give it back
to Damon?

262
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:37,392
Screw Damon. Are we doing manicures
or what? Who has their kit?

263
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:39,468
Mine's in my bag.

264
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:44,302
So, Elena, how long do you think
this fight with Stefan's gonna last?

265
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:47,069
Is it like a permanent thing?

266
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:49,873
I don't know, Caroline.

267
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:53,282
Why are you such a little liar, Bonnie?

268
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:54,884
- What?
- Caroline.

269
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:12,296
- I'm not lying to you, Caroline. I swear.
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> It's true.

270
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,303

00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:17,641

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:19,106
- Who's Emily?
- The ghost.

273
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:21,306
Oh, the ghost has a name now?

274
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:24,546
- Caroline, please.
- I wonder why she won't leave me alone.

275
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:28,015
Okay, what is going on? Why am I
not a part of this conversation?

- Yes, it is.

- I can't talk to you, you don't listen.
- That's not true.

279
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:39,554
- I'm a witch.
- And don't we all know it.

280
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:43,724
See? That's what I'm talking about.
I'm trying to tell you something.

281
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:45,334
You don't even hear it.

282
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:50,501
I listen. When do I not listen?

283
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:54,535
Jeremy totally ditched me.

284
00:17:54,712 --> 00:17:56,737
- Where'd he go?
- Home.

285
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:58,506
It's not far. He can walk it.

286
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:00,981
So are you from here?
Are you a townie?

287
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:04,553
I'm a returnee.
Left town for a while and now I'm back.

288
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:06,622
- Why'd you leave?
- School.

289
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:14,226
- And then there's the real reason.
- Ha-ha-ha. Okay.

290
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,391
I was wronged. Guy named Logan.

291
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:19,695
- What'd he do?
- The basics.

292
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:22,396
Lied, cheated, lured me back in,
left me again.

293
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:28,703
- Your turn. Any sad relationship stories?
- Ha, ha.

294
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,782
The basics. Ahem.
I fell in love, married young...

295
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:35,212
...wife died.

296
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:38,319
Oh. Wow.

297
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:42,683
Yeah. That's always
a good conversation stopper.

298
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:44,885
What happened?

299
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:47,531
You, me and the, uh,
North Carolina Police Department...

300
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:52,533
...are all wondering the same thing.
It's what's known as a cold case.

301
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,574
- So why'd you move here?
- A change of pace, new scenery.

302
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:03,043
I like it here. It's got a rich history.

- You're beating me.
- Yeah, because I'm better than you.

306
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:18,118
I'm onto you. Reverse psychology?

307
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,890
It's a little transparent
but I admire the effort.

308
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:23,625
You prefer the brooding forehead?

309
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:26,793
Seriously,
what game do you think you're playing?

310
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:28,728
That's a funny question...

311
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:32,842
...considering the fact that
I have been asking you that for months.

312
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:37,915

- Touche.

That's all it takes

Because I consider you
to be my best friend.

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,520
But I'm listening now.

323
00:20:24,362 --> 00:20:26,353
- Okay?
- Okay.

324
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:29,056
Elena, you can come in now,
we're done.

325
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:37,204
Well, there is just way too much drama
in this room.

326
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,275
So, what do you guys wanna do?

327
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:41,104
Huh! I have an idea.

328
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,679
- Why don't we have a seance?
- Uh...

329
00:20:43,848 --> 00:20:45,975
- I don't think that's a good idea.

- How can you bring Katherine back?
- Before Katherine was killed...

417
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:16,899
...remember what it was like
in this town?

418
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:20,407
- I remember the fear and hysteria.
- Townspeople were killing vampires.

419
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:22,739
When they came for Katherine,
I went to Emily.

420
00:27:22,913 --> 00:27:25,746
Said I'll do anything.
Name your price, just protect her.

421
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,747
She did.

422
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:30,447
- How?
- She did some spell with the crystal.

423
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:33,954
While the church was burning,
we thought Katherine was burning in it.

424
00:27:34,124 --> 00:27:36,649
- She wasn't.
- But I saw her go inside.

425
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:38,658
There's a tomb...

426
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:42,788
...underneath the church. The spell sealed
Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.

427
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:46,027
- Katherine's alive?
- Well, if that's what you wanna call it.

428
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:49,969
She's been trapped in a mystical holding
cell for the last century and a half.

429
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,974
You're an expert on starving a vampire,
so how you think she's doing, Stef?

430
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:58,777
Did you know that
witches can use celestial events...

431
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:02,476
...to draw energy into their magic?
Me either.

432
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,184
But in order
to give the crystal its power...

433
00:28:05,356 --> 00:28:08,553
...Emily used the comet
that was passing overhead.

434
00:28:08,726 --> 00:28:11,695
And in order for that crystal
to work again...

435
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,826
The comet had to return.

436
00:28:13,998 --> 00:28:16,990
Downside,
long time in between comets.

437
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,795
And a couple of hiccups along the way
with the crystal.

438
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,666
But the comet passed
and I got the crystal.

439
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,900
Then Caroline got the crystal,
and now Bonnie has the crystal...

440
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:27,168
...and here we are.

441
00:28:27,344 --> 00:28:29,312
Why would Emily...?
Why would she do this?

442
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,573
She knew they were gonna
come for her too.

443
00:28:32,683 --> 00:28:35,550
And she made me promise
that her lineage would survive.

444
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:38,187
I remember. You saved her children.

445
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:41,518
It's the only thing keeping me
from ripping Bonnie's throat out...

446
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:43,489
...to get my crystal back.

447
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:45,492

448
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:47,954

- What did she say?
