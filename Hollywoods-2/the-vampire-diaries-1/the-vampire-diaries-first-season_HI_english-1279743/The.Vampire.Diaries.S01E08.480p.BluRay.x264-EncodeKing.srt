I have lived in secret. Until now.

3
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:08,467

but I have to know her.

for Katherine.

- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

6

I've been 17 years old since 1864.

7
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:19,242
I promise I will keep your secret,
but I can't be with you, Stefan.

8
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:22,077
- Five bodies all drained of blood.
- They've come back.

9
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:24,116
- Hello, brother.
- Damon.

10
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:27,088
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font>
She's transitioning.

11
00:00:27,256 --> 00:00:28,416
- Into what?
- A vampire.

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,989
Vicki, what the hell?

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,024
- Why does everybody die on me?
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> Can you make him forget?

14
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:36,857
- What do you want him to know?
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> That Vicki left town.

15
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:40,331
He's gonna miss her,
but he knows it's for the best.

- What are you doing here?

How could you even ask that?

23
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,607
I missed you.

I'm headed to New York
for the weekend.

Bon Jovi, in The Garden.

Hey, do you think
that he would actually remember us?

That was a pretty crazy
weekend, huh?

We can make him remember us.

Come on. Let's go.
I mean, what's keeping you here?

40
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:52,426
I told you. Her name is Elena.

41
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:56,764
Well, let's hope she's better
than the last girl you got all sprung over.

<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font>
You didn't even know Katherine.

Because if I did I'd kick her ass,

00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,901
Speaking of, where's Damon?

45
00:03:04,113 --> 00:03:06,775
- Inflicting misery somewhere.
- Uh-huh.

46
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:10,578
Hey, you gonna be okay here? Alone?
I got some things I gotta take care of.

47
00:03:10,752 --> 00:03:13,084
Well, it's not exactly
like I can go anywhere.

48
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:17,588
And you and Damon are the only ones
with these nifty little daylight rings.

49
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:20,591
I have a mood ring from '75.
Trade you?

50
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,291
Doesn't work that way
and you know it.

51
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:25,626
- Yeah.
- Hey, Lex.

52
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:29,328
- I'm really glad that you came here.
- What are we doing for your birthday?

53
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:34,306
It's not every day

- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

55
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:41,840
- Where did Vicki say she was going?
- She didn't.

56
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:44,178
Did she tell her brother
where she was going?

57
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:45,716
No, she didn't say anything.

58
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:47,946
She told Jeremy to tell me
she was leaving.

59
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:50,614
Is there anyone that may know
what happened to her...

60
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:52,282
...prior to her leaving town?

61
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:56,123
Stefan Salvatore may know. He came
to see her but she wouldn't talk to him.

62
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:58,198
- What was he doing?
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> Trying to help her.

63
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:02,064
I knew Elena was worried about
her brother and he was dating Vicki...

64
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:04,637
...and she had a drug problem,
so I tried to help.

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,831
You got involved
because Elena asked you to?

66
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:08,237
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font>
I asked Stefan to help.

67
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:11,640
I thought that by helping Vicki,
he was helping my brother.

68
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:14,646
What was her behavior like
those last days before she left?

69
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:17,683
Up and down. Very sketchy.

70
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:20,981
Like she was coming down
from some major partying.

71
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,317
Any signs of aggression or violence?

72
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,953
Not that I remember.

73
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,491
- No.
- No.

74
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:29,357
So you believe
Vicki really has left town?

75
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:32,029
- Yes.
- Yes.

76
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:35,226
- Yes.
<font color="#808080">JEREMY :</font> I'll miss her...

00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:37,770
...but I think it's for the best.

78
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:52,509
I was trying to help her, Matt.
That's all.

79
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:01,760
- I'll meet you guys at the car.
- Okay.

80
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:09,527
You okay?

81
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:12,037
I don't think
the sheriff suspected anything.

82
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:13,504
Jeremy had no memory at all.

83
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:15,700
All he knew
was what Damon made him know.

84
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:19,110
Thank you.

85
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,539
I can't do this, Stefan.

86
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:24,218
Every time I look at Matt or Jeremy...

87
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:27,719
...all I think is that
Vicki is never gonna come back.

88
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:30,252
And they'll never know why.

89
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:33,053
Around you, people get hurt
and people die and I just...

90
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:35,526
I can't. It's just too much.

91
00:05:35,697 --> 00:05:38,666
- Why don't we go and talk about it?
- No.

92
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:42,127

from me.

What an unexpected surprise.

97
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,456
"Unexpected surprise"?

98
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:06,753
The wrong brother
went back to high school.

99
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:09,692
- How long you here for?
- Just for Stefan's b-day.

100
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:12,195
You mean you didn't come all this way
to see me?

101
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,335
That's it, Damon. After a century...

102
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:18,269
...I finally realized death means nothing
without you.

103
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,464
Do me.

104
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:23,306
Oh, why are you so mean to me?

105
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:26,175
Have you met you?
You're not a nice person.

106
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:29,839
- Well, because I'm a vampire.
- But you're only the bad parts.

107
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:31,880
Teach me to be good.

108
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:34,686
I'm older and that means stronger.

109
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,688
- I'm sorry.
- Don't ruin my time with Stefan.

110
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:39,326
Because I'll hurt you.

111
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:41,519
- And you know I can do it.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:54,407
You leaving?

113
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,736
Dad doesn't like it
when I stay here too much.

114
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:59,745
Because he misses you
or because he doesn't trust me?

115
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:02,541
Your father's problem is
he lacks imagination.

116
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:06,245
He thinks I'll fill your head
with all my witchy juju.

117
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:08,149
- He's right.
- He's always right.

118
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:10,018
That's his other problem.

119
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:13,217
You need to be wearing that.

120
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:15,795
I gotta get it to Caroline.
It doesn't belong to me.

121
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:18,296
It does. It was your ancestor's
and now it's yours.

122
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:20,992
Emily was your ancestor too.
Why don't you wear it?

123
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:24,536
It didn't find me, it found you.
Protected you.

124
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,504
A witch's talisman is a powerful tool.

125
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:30,645
Don't be giving that back to anybody.

126
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:32,245
Okay.

127
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:39,649
I just wish it was prettier.

128
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:46,923
- You're wallowing.
- So are you.

129
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:49,586
My wallow is legitimate.
I was dumped.

130

Yeah, well, Logan's a jerk.

131
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,736
You didn't get a brush-off e-mail saying,
"I'm leaving town. See you."

Wanna keep it down over there?

133

- Why? What are you doing?
- Homework.

134
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,543
Since when do you do homework?

135
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:07,910
I gotta finish this. I'm way behind
and I have a quiz tomorrow, so...

136

What do you think? Alien?

137
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:14,715
Some sort of replicant.

138
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,881
He can hear you.

139
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:24,254
Yeah?

140
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,930
Send him in.

141
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:30,130
Mr. Salvatore. Come on in.

142
00:08:30,338 --> 00:08:32,203
- Could you get the door for me?
- Sure.

143
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:36,070
I understand from Mrs. Lockwood
that your uncle's out of town.

144
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:39,839
Yes, he is, but I spoke with Zach
and he filled me in...

145
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:43,507
...and asked if I could bring this to you.

146
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:56,196
- Vervain.
- It's all we have at the moment.

147
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:58,161
I hope it's enough.

148
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:04,468
It's a small circle.

149
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:07,237
Founding families, a few city officials.

150
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,933
And your deputies, of course, right?

151
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:13,175
Are we any closer?

152
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:16,113
I think our facts are wrong.

153
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:20,786
We've always believed that vampires
can only come out in the dark.

154
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:23,981
- What if that's changed?
- So is that even possible?

155
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,059
We've exhausted every other option.

156
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:29,662
We have to consider the vampire
may be walking around during the day...

157
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:32,129
...right in front of us.

158
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:37,802
So, what's the next step?

159
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:42,069
We're now looking at anyone
new to town since the deaths began.

160
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:43,869
Should turn up a suspect or two.

161
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:46,912
And I, of course,
will do anything I can to help.

00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:08,330
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:10,732
- Are you gonna stay in there forever?
- Yep.

169
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,400
Move over.

170
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:21,038
I'm officially worried.

171
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:23,575
What's going on?

172
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,250
I'm tired of thinking, of talking.

173
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:32,450
Can I get a one-line version
so I can pretend to be helpful?

174
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,753
Stefan and I broke up.

175
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,763
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

176
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:40,595
Right. Stupid question.

177
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:46,336
I know I've been kind of MIA
when you need me the most.

178
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:48,035
I suck.

179
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:50,143
You wanna make it up to me?

180
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:52,369
Get my mind off of it.

181
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,406
Just remember you asked for it.

182
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:08,761
Hey.

183
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:14,397
- Be patient.
- Okay.

184
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:16,961
I need to swear you to secrecy.

185
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,304
It's a bad week for that kind of stuff.

186
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:21,635
Swear. I'm not supposed
to be showing this.

187
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,104
- Okay. I swear.
- Okay.

188
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,439
There's no windows open, right?

189
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:27,878
- Right.
- There's no fan, no air conditioning.

190
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,607
None. What are you doing?

191
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:32,947
Grams just showed me this.
You're gonna love it.

192
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:34,782
You ready?

193
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,603
Bonnie, what's going on?

It's true, Elena.
Everything my grams told me.

196
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:28,540
It's impossible, and it's true.

197
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:31,736
I'm a witch.

198
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:36,310
I believe you.

199
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:48,158
Look, dungeon boy,
I'm done being your little slave girl.

200
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:52,326
You seriously hurt me
and I will be damned if you think...

201
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:57,696
Oh, my God, where have you been?

202
00:12:57,872 --> 00:12:59,897
- It's really good to see you.
- Much better.

203
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,908
You wanna throw a party
here at the Grill tonight.

204
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:05,007
Why don't you do it?

205
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,205
Because then Stefan
and his BFF won't come.

206
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:09,883
I need a lot of people. Big crowd.
Invite everyone.

207
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,009
And why am I having this party?

208
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:16,089
Because you are gonna help me solve
this town's little vampire problem.

209
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,224
And I want my crystal back.

210
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:20,224
Oh, but Bonnie has it.

211
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:23,628
I know that. Get it from her.

212
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:29,626
So this Elena girl.
She'll come around. I'm sure of it.

213
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:31,867
- Have you had sex yet?
- No.

214
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,701
Sex always works.

215
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,402
You'll rock her world so hard with
your vamp sex, she'll be yours forever.

216
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:41,538
Yeah, but see, this isn't about
sex or compulsion...

217
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:43,581
...or any of our other tricks.

218
00:13:43,752 --> 00:13:47,051
She has to want to be with me,
on her own terms.

219
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:50,055
Wow. That sounded all mature
and grown-up.

220
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:51,919
Well, I'm not getting any older.

221
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:05,103
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

222
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:07,332
Relax. I didn't kill anyone for it.

223
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:11,033
This phlebotomist I went out with
a few times, he's my supplier.

224
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:13,671
Oh, don't judge, okay?

225
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:16,840
Listen, I tried the animal diet,
lasted three weeks.

226
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:20,145
Doesn't matter. If I started again,
I would just... I don't know.

227
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,186
You could stop.

228
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,950
Lexi, I'd never judge you.

229
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:29,062
I'm just jealous of your restraint.

230
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,926
I have none. I delight in hedonism.

231
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:35,364
Speaking of which,
what are we doing tonight?

There's a party. At the Grill.
You'll love it.

234
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:45,104
Banquettes, tacky wait staff.
All of Stefan's friends.

235
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,874
- Yeah, I don't want a birthday party.
- It's not for you.

236
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:51,017
It's a "party" party.
No one's gonna know it's your birthday.

237
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,316
- Caroline's throwing it.
- Damon, stay away from Caroline.

238
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:55,683
We're friends. It's cool.

239
00:14:55,857 --> 00:14:59,520
It's important for the town to see us
out and about like normal folk.

240
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:01,093
We need to blend.

241
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:05,532
Ugh.

242
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,100

I'm a freak now, do you?

248
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:30,384
No, of course not.

249
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:33,050
Bonnie, I just...
I don't understand, though.

250
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:36,629
If your grams asked you to keep this
a secret, why did you tell me?

251
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:40,494
You're my best friend.
I can't keep secrets from you.

252

I'm almost ready.

253

I can't believe you think
that we should go to this thing.

254
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:52,779
It's not like I'm asking you to run
outside, midday, without your ring.

255
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:56,906
- I mean, seriously, it's a party.
- A party that Damon wants us to go to.

256
00:15:57,151 --> 00:15:59,711
So my question is, why?
I think he's up to something.

257
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:03,584
Who cares? What can he possibly do
in front of people in a public place?

258
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:06,192
He knows how to keep a low profile.
Believe me.

259
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:08,556
Okay, so he'll behave.

260
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,925
Come on. One day a year I get you.

One day that you're not brooding
and existing in your own head.

- It's my birthday, huh?
- It's my day.

And that guy that jumped naked
in the Trevi Fountain...

264
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:23,969
...and got drunk on the torch
of the Statue of Liberty?

265
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:27,409
That guy can take a break
from all of his worrying for one night...

266
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:29,311
...and go to a stupid party.

267
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:33,113
So quit your whining
and go get ready.

No, it's not what you think.
She's not Katherine.

285
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:02,640
Then they're related
because they could be twins.

- I don't know.
- You don't know?

- You didn't find out?
- No, maybe I don't wanna know.

to tie Elena to Katherine.

is what drew me in, but that's it.

may look the same on the outside...

291
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:24,020
...but on the inside
they are completely different.

then, huh?

And she's caring and she's selfless.

And it's real.

298

I completely forget what I am.

Right. The girl in the towel.

Nothing romantic. Ever.

327
00:20:37,832 --> 00:20:41,962
Oh. Okay, well, she kept staring at me.

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,895
Unlike the rest of the global universe.

502
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:54,963
Are those curly fries?

503
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:58,293
Coffee for the drunk girl.

504
00:33:01,107 --> 00:33:02,506
Bad night, huh?

Baddest.

507
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:07,136
Am I shallow?

508
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:11,984
- Is that a trick question?
- I don't mean to be.

509
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:14,244
Yeah, I wanna be deep.

510
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:18,951
I wanna be, like, The Abyss deep.

511
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:23,419
No offense, Car,
but deep's really not your scene.

512
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:28,230
Well, it's true.

513
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:29,659
I'm shallow.

514
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:33,602
I am worse than shallow.

515
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:35,775
I'm a kiddie pool.

516
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:37,967
You're not a kiddie pool.

517
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:41,238
You're not a kiddie pool.

518
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:43,611
Can I just go home?

519
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:45,250
- Yeah.
- Okay.

520
00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:47,352
I'll take you. Come on.

521
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:56,125
Hey, you're okay. She's all right.

522
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:58,161
Hold still, hold still. I got it.

525
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:13,504
- She's drunk?
- As a skunk.

526

Are they serving you in there?

527
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:19,542
I'll take her home. It's on my way.
I haven't been drinking.

528
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:23,082
I would appreciate that, Matt.
Thank you.

529
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:27,157

All right, the shots are a bribe.
I need you to answer a question.

532
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:45,668
What are you really doing
in Mystic Falls?

Wins awards.

Okay.

What is it?

538
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:02,390
If I told you, it wouldn't be
very diabolical, would it?

539
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:07,729
Okay, look around.
Let me know if you see anyone.

- Yeah.

- Lady, I checked everyone's ID.
- Yeah, apparently you didn't.

553

You're pretty handy with that stake.

554
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:31,906
Just a reflex.
Guess the adrenalin kicked in.

- Yeah.

been able to ID the vampire.
