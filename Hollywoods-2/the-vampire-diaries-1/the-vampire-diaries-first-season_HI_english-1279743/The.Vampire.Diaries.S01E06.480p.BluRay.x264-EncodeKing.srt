I have lived in secret. Until now.

3
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:08,550
I know the risk but I have to know her.

for Katherine.

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,821
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> Is that Damon Salvatore
and Stefan Salvatore?

6
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,250
The SALVATORE original brothers.

7
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:17,891
1864. You and Katherine
were the perfect couple.

8
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:19,287
They've come back.

00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:21,486
- You get the Gilbert watch?
<font color="#808080">LOGAN :</font> I can get it.

<font color="#808080">VICKl :</font>
Whoa, whoa. I got you. Ah!

12
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:28,330
<font color="#808080">MAN :</font> I know you.
- I think you have the wrong person.

13
00:00:28,504 --> 00:00:30,131
You haven't aged a day.

14
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:34,275
There are things that you don't know,
things that I want to tell you but I can't.

15
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:37,071
Are you sure the man you knew
was Stefan Salvatore?

16
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:39,008
- Yes.
- When was this?

17
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,512

Dear diary, I'm not a believer.

19
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:51,989
People are born, they grow old,
and then they die.

20
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:54,459
That's the world we live in.

21
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:57,932
How can I deny
what's right in front of me?

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,501
Someone who never grows old,
never gets hurt.

23
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:05,234
Someone who changes in ways
that can't be explained.

24
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:07,364
- Girls bitten.

What are you?

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,933
- You know.
- No, I don't.

32
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:47,940
Yes, you do, or you wouldn't be here.

33
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:50,937
It's not possible.

34
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:52,471
It can't be.

35
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,953
Everything you know...

36
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:06,288
...and every belief that you have
is about to change.

37
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:09,223
Are you ready for that?

00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,090
What are you?

39
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm a vampire.

00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:30,250

- No.

- No.

No.

43
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,484
How did you do that?

44
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,685
- Please don't be afraid of me.
- Let me go.

45
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,420
There's things you have to know.

I would never hurt you.

You're safe with me.

51
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,688
All those animal attacks,
those people who died?

52
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:48,329
No. That was Damon.

53
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,724
- Damon?
- Yes.

54
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,160
I don't drink human blood.

55
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,824
That's not how I choose to survive,
but Damon does.

56
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,062
I'll explain everything to you,
but I beg you, Elena...

57
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:58,967
...do not tell anybody.

58
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,266
How can you ask me that?

59
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:04,538
Because you knowing this is dangerous
for so many reasons.

60
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,007
You can hate me,
but I need you to trust me.

61
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,449
Just go.

Just go, please? Go.

63
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,755
If you mean me no harm,
then you'll go.

64
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,362

- I'm at the Sizzler.

00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:50,713
- Where's my ring?
- I don't have it. What have you done?

69
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,045
No, what have you done?

70
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:56,987
You locked me in the basement
and starved me, so whatever I've done...

71

is this town gonna believe, huh?

73
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:03,826
I know how to cover my tracks.

74
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:06,398
- Where's my ring?
- I gave it to Zach to hide.

75
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,530
Probably shouldn't have killed him.

76

Ah, you almost got me. Where is it?

77
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:19,975
- I'll get it back, but I need time.
- What, did you FedEx it to Rome?

78
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,242
I want my ring, Stefan,
or my next stop's Elena's.

79
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,045
I already want you dead.
Don't give me another reason.

80
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,655
- Don't give me a reason to rip you apart.
- Yeah?

81
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,384
Is that before or after
you get your ring back?

82
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,050

You said you would explain everything.

Hi. Here are your drinks.

91

- We have rings that protect us.

92
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:28,634
- Crucifixes?
- Decorative.

93
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:30,641
- Holy water?
- Drinkable.

94
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:32,108
- Mirrors?
- Myth.

95
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:35,340
- You said you don't kill to survive.
- Animal blood keeps me alive.

96
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:39,510
- I'm not as strong as Damon.
- You let him get involved with Caroline?

97
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:42,657
Forcing Damon not to do something
is much more dangerous.

98
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:45,452
- He was hurting her.
- He was feeding on her.

99
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:49,723
He was able to take away her memories
of being bitten using a mind compulsion.

100
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:51,866
She never knew what
was happening to her.

101
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:54,695
- Lf he wanted to kill her, he would.
- That make it okay?

102
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,633
No. No, none of this is okay, Elena.

103
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,000
I know that.

104
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:06,878
Are there any others,
aside from you and Damon?

105
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,675
Not in Mystic Falls, not anymore.

106
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:10,808
Not anymore?

107
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,690
There was a time when this town
was very much aware of vampires...

108
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:19,724
...and it didn't end well for anybody.

109
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:23,091
That's why it's important
that you don't tell anyone.

110
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:25,828
I can't promise that.

111
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,431
Elena, give me today.

112
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:34,935
I will answer any questions
that you have...

113
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,601
...and when it's over,
you can decide for yourself...

114
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:40,542
...what you wanna do
with what you know.

115
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:42,114

Damon was trying to make you think
that I was still heartbroken.

Wait, I'm confused.
How did we get here?

211
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,838
We met in the woods.
You were drunk. I attacked you.

212
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:53,538
I killed all your friends, brought you here.
Gave you blood. You loved it.

And now we're gonna party
till the sun goes down.

214
00:17:58,052 --> 00:18:00,885
Okay. But first, can I have another hit?

215
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:04,124
That blood was so good.

216
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:05,485
Only if I can.

219

...Katherine was with him too.

220
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:31,012
So he stole her from you,
not the other way around?

221
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:36,917

- But you're not afraid.
- Get away from me. Get away.

232
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:54,834
It doesn't change the way
