that Logan guy I killed in here.

7
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:18,212
- Covering it up.
- It's a small circle.

8
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:22,349
- Founding families, a few city officials.
- I will do anything I can to help.

- Thanks. It was my father's.

11
00:00:28,324 --> 00:00:30,986
I have to leave.
Too many people have died.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,685
- I can't be a part of your life anymore.
- Don't go, Stefan.

13
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:34,920
Goodbye, Elena.

14

You know what,
I'm not gonna invite you in.

15
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,096
- Some other time then.
- I was dumped.

16
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:40,393
Yeah, well, Logan's a jerk.

Aren't you gonna invite me in?

Why are you here, Logan?

21
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:55,609
I missed you. I was out of town.

22
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:57,979
Yeah, I got that e-mail.

23
00:00:58,787 --> 00:01:00,220
You got an e-mail?

24
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,489
You didn't send an e-mail?

25
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:09,087
I can explain. Just invite me in
and I'll tell you everything.

26
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:11,494
I'm not gonna invite you in. Forget it.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,396
Come on, Jenna, it's me.

28
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:17,369
- The answer is no.
- I know you.

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,868
You're always one step
from a "maybe."

30
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:24,409

I watch you every night.

Well, I used to. I mean,
you've been missing from my TV.

40
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:22,328
- I took some time off.
- I noticed.

41
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,266
I'm Daphne.

Because I know
that the night brings death."

- You're kidding.
- Nope, but don't say a word.

50

he'll put it away.

And you and Stefan?

- Update?
- He knows how I feel and where I stand.

54
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,068
And I know where he stands,
but it doesn't matter.

55
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,366
He's leaving, moving away.

- He's back.
- Ugh.

61
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,379
- I didn't let him pass the front door.
- I hope you slammed it in his face.

62

- Ah, medium slam.
- Three-strike rule, Jenna.

You're not even allowed
to watch the news.

64
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,218
Exactly. No more Logan "Scum" Fell.

65
00:04:28,397 --> 00:04:30,627
So any idea of where you'll go?

66
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,494
I don't know. London, maybe.

67
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:35,067
- See some friends.
- You don't have any friends, Damon.

68
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:37,705
You're right, Stefan. I only have you.

69
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,307
- So where are we going?
- "We" are not going anywhere.

70
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:44,777
I'm gonna live my life
as far away from you as possible.

71
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:47,916
But we're a team.
We could travel the world together.

72
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,880

for The Amazing Race.

Mm. That's funny.

Seriously, where are you going?

75
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:55,716

in this town.

Come in.

82
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:24,784
I hope you understand the secrecy.
Stefan doesn't know about this yet.

83
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:26,944
- I'd like to keep it that way.
- Of course.

84
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:30,785
- Kids are too young to be brought into this.
- So, what do you need?

85
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,790
There's been another attack.

86
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:36,124
A female victim, her throat torn out,
completely drained of blood.

87
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:38,823
- It fits the pattern.
- I'm sorry. I don't understand.

88
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:43,199
I thought we solved that problem
when I staked the blond one.

89
00:05:43,372 --> 00:05:45,363
I'm thinking she must have turned
someone.

90
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,371
Or multiple someones, I don't know.

91
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:49,373
The story is another animal attack...

92
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:51,978
...but I'm not sure how long
we can keep lying to them.

93
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,843
The Council is in an uproar.
We thought we were past this.

94
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:59,143
So, uh, what do we do?

95
00:05:59,354 --> 00:06:01,515
You're the only one
who's taken on a vampire.

96
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,181
We were hoping you could tell us.

97
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:12,198
<font color="#808080">MATT :</font> And then the ballet dancer
and the crunker did the salsa.

98
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:13,664
I was awake for that part.

99
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:16,497
Well, I don't know
when you fell asleep.

100
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:18,935
Um, did you see the Celine Dion waltz
about cancer?

101
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:20,904
Those always make me cry.

102
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,600
Yeah.

103
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:27,077
Then the loud judge kept screaming
and I couldn't take it so I turned it off.

104
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:31,079
I sat through Family Guy,
so you owed me.

105
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,015

- She needs someone nice like him.

108
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:40,224
As opposed to a homicidal vampire
like Damon.

109
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:43,260
Yeah, how are you doing
with all that?

110
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:45,059
I'm freaked out.

111
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,861
Damon attacked me.
I could be dead right now.

112
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:50,470
- But I'm also grateful.
- Hmm?

113
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:54,107
- To Stefan. He saved my life.
- Mm.

114
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:57,442
Have you seen him?

115
00:06:57,612 --> 00:07:01,639
Not since he told me he was leaving.
For all I know, he's already gone.

116
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,984
He wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

117
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:06,985
Yes, he would.
He thinks he's protecting me.

118

Clean break and all that.

119
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:09,885
So, what are you gonna do?

120
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:12,959
What am I supposed to do?
I already begged him not to go.

121
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:15,562
If I ask again, I'm being selfish.

122
00:07:15,764 --> 00:07:17,755
- It is what it is.
- Oh. Maybe it's for the best.

123
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,059
What? Why?

124
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:23,466
I mean, what kind of future could you
have had with him, even if he stayed?

Hi.

144
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,682
We need to talk.

145
00:08:46,354 --> 00:08:49,016
- So, what's up with you and Forbes?
- Nothing's up.

146

I saw you two in the hall today.
Don't even try and deny it, bro.

- No. It's not like that.

148
00:08:54,496 --> 00:08:56,862
Never is. Till you become we people.

149

- "We people"?
<font color="#808080">TYLER :</font> Yeah.

150

"We don't like the color red."

153
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,002
We hung out, like, twice.

154
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:11,609
Like I said, "we."

155
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:15,514
So you have no idea who it could be?

156
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:17,379
None.

157
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:20,779
But it must be somebody new,
because leaving a body like that...

158
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:23,753
...they're either sloppy
or they're trying to send a message.

159
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:27,520
- And you're sure it's not Damon?
- Well, I'm never sure about Damon...

160
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:31,757
...but he's been trying to keep a low
profile so it doesn't make sense to me.

161
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:34,526
So, what are you gonna do?

162
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:36,534
Damon is tracking them right now.

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,789
In fact, why don't we just skip past
all that "who turned me" stuff...

328
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,197
...and get the answer that I want.

329
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,064
How can I turn into a day-walker?

330
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:39,706
Damon and I
are the only two that I know of.

331
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,104
But you're both very cagey
on the how.

332
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:44,073
Which tells me that there is a way.

333
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,581
You know, in case you hadn't noticed,
I'm quite the celebrity in this town.

334
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,919
It would be very, very easy for me
to expose you.

335
00:19:57,592 --> 00:20:01,028
You wanna know
how you can walk around in the sun?

336
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:02,286
I do.

337
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:06,630
You can't.

338

Don't ever threaten me again.

339
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,940
When Logan came to the house,
what did he say?

340
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:25,677
Oh. Fake flattery, stupid dimpled grin,
puppy-dog eyes.

341
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:27,013
I'm serious, Jenna.

342
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:30,281
- How did he act? What did he say?
- He was the usual Logan.

343
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,484
He was charming,
a little more manic than usual.

344
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:36,458
He kept trying to convince me
to let him in.

345
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:39,361
What?

346
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:41,865
Okay, listen to me very carefully.

347

Do not, under any circumstances,
talk to him again.

348
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:46,972

349
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:51,568

I don't know.

00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:12,275
I, uh, thought that was weird
with your dad.

499
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:13,743
What he did.

500
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:18,445
Is he like that all the time?
Is that what you gotta go through?

00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:09,126
I wanted to be a writer.

My mom sort of pushed me
into that direction...

514

bought me my first journal.

And then she died.

517
00:30:24,752 --> 00:30:28,779

being a writer anymore.

all of this bad stuff into my life...
