00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,660
(A collection of ZGDX's crazy event quotes
of a week ago)

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,560
(Look,)

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,000
(seeing you in danger,
I rushed over as fast as I could.)

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,080
(Yet you never came to
assist me on top lane.)

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,910
(Come on, come on. Look, I'll challenge him.)

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,960
(I'll challenge him, challenge…)

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,880
(I'm dead?)

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,720
(Challenge him, keep challenging.)

9
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,880
(You don't love me anymore.)

10
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,070
(Watch out, watch out.)

11
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,510
(The opponent's jungler
has gone to your side.)

12
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,550
(Grass, grass.)
[*"Grass" is pronounced the same as "damn it".]

13
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,480
(Who are you cursing?)

14
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,600
(I mean watch out in the grass.)

15
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,550
(Oops, I'm dead again.)

16
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,030
(I…)

17
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,320
(You dare ambush me?)

18
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,960
(I'll punish you for that.)

19
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,120
(You dare ambush your Chubby grandfather?)

20
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,600
(I'll show you who I am.)

21
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,000
(Son of a Biscuit.)

22
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,670
(Beat him, beat him.)

23
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,200
(Quick, quick, straight forward. Nice!)

24
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,150
(In one breath. In one breath.)

25
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,110
(In one breath. In one breath.
We can beat them.)

26
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,070
(We can go back for dinner after the fight.)

27
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,070
(Beat him, beat him.)

28
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,840
(Come on.)

29
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,790
(Come on, where's Cheng?)

30
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,920
(Cheng, where are you going?)

31
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,960
(Cheng, Cheng, nice.)

32
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,790
(Cheng, why aren't you talking?)

33
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,320
(I feel like I'm in preschool.)

34
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,670
(My head is exploding.)

35
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,670
I want to empty my bowels.

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,060
=Falling into Your Smile=

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,860
=Episode 11=

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,350
Okay, now both sides
have sent out their lines.

39
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,310
Let's look at the middle lane.

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,200
Susabi is in the middle lane.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,360
Susabi is a roaming assassin shikigami.

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,800
Although

43
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,310
he's not particularly tough
in the early stages.

44
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,400
But he has the skills of control,
teleport and can also cause damage.

45
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,400
Since such a shikigami has been chosen,

46
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,400
if his enemy fails to contain him properly
in the early stages

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,360
and lets him get strong in the late stages,

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,680
it will be especially tough to deal with.

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,430
(To be honest…)

50
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,120
Teammates,

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,520
I'm not going to lie.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,710
The opposing jungler is my ex-boyfriend,

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,800
the kind that
didn't break up with me peacefully.

54
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,030
I guess he will come to beat me up later.

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,870
Um, K.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,750
If you don't come to help me in this round,

57
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,870
I will kill myself.

58
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,840
I mean it.

59
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm a jungler.

60
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,280
I'll come to you when I need to.

61
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,120
Tong Yao.

62
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,000
I really can't stop thinking about the posts

63
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,430
about your e-sports version of
The White Snake Legend.

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,240
What's so funny about that?

65
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,430
(I won't offend people
before they offend me.)

66
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,430
(If people offend me…)

67
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,800
You are Xu Xian,

68
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,710
saving the dead and helping the wounded.

69
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,750
Heal him, see what a poor thing he is.

70
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
Chubby, let's pick a fight.

71
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,470
You go up and undertake the damage
to fool the other side.

72
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,190
Okay.

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,000
Go, go.

74
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,710
(Chubby's Kuro Douji)

75
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,360
(took two skills from the opponent
and has only half health left.)

76
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,190
Protect him, can you protect him?

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,800
(Chubby makes a skill instead.)

78
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,680
(Butterfly is slowed down.)

79
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,910
(Chessman goes forward
with a set of moves.)

80
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,520
(First Blood Assist)
(Butterfly is killed.)

81
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,470
(Nice!)

82
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,430
Control the attack player for me.

83
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,590
Here it comes, controlled.

84
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,630
(Double Kill Assist)
Chubby controls Wang again.

85
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,590
Chessman outputs the damage,

86
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,680
directly completing the double kill.

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,750
God, the other side had no time

88
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,590
to fight back Chessman's moves.

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,150
Long live the captain.

90
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,000
Tong Yao.

91
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,080
It's a pity that
the first blood is not your ex.

92
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,750
Okay, Smiling in the middle lane
is also doing well.

93
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,590
But Hua seems to be a bit anxious.

94
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,280
It's not worth it
to consume his power just now.

95
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,470
Yang has arrived in the middle lane.

96
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,800
Will he catch her or not?

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,030
Okay, Yang is on.

98
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,830
K.

99
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,600
Coming.

100
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,780
(Sacrifice)

101
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,160
Yang, what's wrong with you?

102
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,720
Smiling is good.

103
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,310
We have to change the way we play.

104
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
We'll change the way we play.

105
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,800
Okay.

106
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,120
(Is Jian Yang coming to
ambush on the top lane?)

107
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,270
(Sure enough.)

108
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,800
(Defeat Assist)
(Cat was killed by Yang.)

109
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,310
From what we saw,

110
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,600
they may have to pick a team fight
against the monster

111
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,720
for the previous mistake.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,800
ZGDX should have given up on

113
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,920
the monster.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,630
(We can see that
Yang is going on quite well.)

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,950
(After he gave up
the middle and bottom lanes,)

116
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,120
(he killed someone ganking
two times in the top lane.)

117
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,190
(He's going on quite well.)

118
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,430
But in fact, the middle and bottom lanes

119
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,000
are the most difficult to deal with.

120
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,720
Chessman has already

121
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,920
contained Butterfly
to the point where he can't fight back.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,800
Is the bottom lane ready yet?

123
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,560
I'm coming. I'm coming.

124
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,390
Let's pick a fight.

125
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,430
Go.

126
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,360
(- Smiling is going to the bottom lane.)
(- The bottom lane is already in a fight.)

127
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,680
(Smiling released her ultimate skill
from the grass.)

128
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,310
(Chessman's ultimate skill continues
to output damage. Got it.)

129
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,160
Let me kill someone.

130
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,000
I came all the way to the bottom lane,

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,120
just to have you to take my credit.

132
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,750
I never want to be
in the same lane as you again.

133
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,800
Save your words.
I'm afraid you'll shit your pants.

134
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,600
Can't you just forget about it?

135
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,360
I can't.

136
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,830
Then at least don't remind me.

137
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,300
(Defeat Assist)

138
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,630
(Rampage)
(That owed a lot to Smiling just now.)

139
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,310
(She attacked them by surprise.)

140
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,360
(CK's bottom lane
was completely collapsed at last.)

141
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,750
They win! They win!

142
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,310
Look, my daughter has won!

143
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,240
OK, OK, OK.

144
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,360
What are you talking about?

145
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,120
Why are they still playing then?

146
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,390
It's only for Chessman

147
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,160
to be able to kill someone.

148
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,240
Don't get excited.

149
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,680
That's not easy either.

150
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,480
It's easy for you guys to cooperate.

151
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,430
Do you know there is also a lane

152
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,560
called the top lane in our game?

153
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,630
Good Luck confronts me.

154
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,600
He took a buff in the beginning.

155
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,800
It's hard for me to fight back.

156
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,920
How can I play like this?

157
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,630
K, you and I play very well together

158
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,270
when we're at the base.

159
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,560
But you didn't even come to help me
in the formal game.

160
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,310
What a dog.

161
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,830
We're not Siamese twins.

162
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,390
Okay, fine.

163
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,870
Come to the top lane next.

164
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,240
Okay, I'm coming now.

165
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,270
Let's go.

166
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,720
K, you and Cat

167
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,920
go destroy the defense tower in the top lane.

168
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,680
All right.

169
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
(At this time, Good Luck's Hannya
hasn't freshened his ultimate skill.)

170
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,630
(He's quite fragile now.)

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,040
(ZGDX had good timing.)

172
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,070
(But Hua and Yang
have also supported the top lane.)

173
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,750
(Both sides' middle, top laners and junglers)

174
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,560
(have picked a small-scale team
fight in the top lane.)

175
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,560
(Cat's second skill picks the team fight
and controls Good Luck.)

176
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,510
(Smiling just plays her ultimate skill
after the continuous playing of first and second skills.)

177
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
(Good Luck is killed.)

178
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,940
(Defeat Assist)

179
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,480
Come hit Orochi.

180
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,240
Copy that.

181
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,040
Coming.

182
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,510
K, save your skill.

183
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,870
Chubby, save your ultimate skill.

184
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,300
(Mulan in E-sports)

185
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,870
(Why do I feel that today's Chessman)

186
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,870
(leads the team to play at such a fast pace?)

187
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,740
(Successfully sealed)

188
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,670
(My God, it's too fast.)

189
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,030
(It was dazzling just now.)

190
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,150
We're sure to win.

191
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,150
Come on, keep playing. Keep playing.

192
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,390
Gather in the middle lane
and destroy the base turret.

193
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,600
Okay, copy that.

194
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,440
Push through the middle lane.

195
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,440
Go, go, go. Confront it.

196
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,030
ZGDX is already marching in the middle lane.

197
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,240
The victory is coming so soon?

198
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,200
ZGDX has marched to the base turret.

199
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,270
They're on the base turret.

200
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,030
Come on.

201
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,360
Come on.

202
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,550
(Hit the base!)

203
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,790
(It's exploding!)

204
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,630
(That was so fast. Nice.)

205
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,000
Awesome!

206
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,270
(The game is over!)

207
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,440
(Let's congratulate ZGDX)

208
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,320
(for the first victory in the opening round.)

209
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,630
Chessman is so cool!

210
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,000
(Smiling was also)

211
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,080
(quite eye-catching in this round.)

212
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,480
(That's right.)

213
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,670
(As expected, she is the No.1
Tamamo-no-Mae on the Chinese server.)

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,670
It's okay, it's okay.

215
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,720
Let's dedicate ourselves to the next round.

216
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,750
♪Who will come for you♪

217
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,440
♪Come for a pilgrimage♪

218
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,150
(Smiling.)

219
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,000
(Smiling.)

220
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,630
Jian Yang was so poor in this round.

221
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,440
♪We'll be your heroes♪

222
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,320
♪We'll be your heroes♪

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,550
Yang, what's wrong with you?

224
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,840
You were completely distracted in that game.

225
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
You were either slow to react

226
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,750
or you couldn't catch
your teammate's signals at all.

227
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,750
You let them kill you like crazy.

228
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,440
You didn't follow

229
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,360
our pre-game strategy at all.

230
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,440
I'm sorry, coach.

231
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,910
I don't want you to be sorry.

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,790
I want you to pull yourself together

233
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,600
for the next round.

234
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,840
Last game,

235
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,750
ZGDX employed a fast-paced way of play.

236
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,510
I noticed that
Chessman wasn't in a good state

237
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,150
either in the last game.

238
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,320
So let's hold them off for the late stage

239
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,750
in the next game.

240
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,960
Okay?

241
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,550
Got it.

242
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,120
Hua.

243
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,910
Yang.

244
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,200
How does it feel to be beaten up
by your old rival and your ex-girlfriend?

245
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,390
Is it as heartbreaking as if
your own cabbage

246
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,270
was ruined by a pig?

247
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,390
No.

248
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,550
I feel like I got a myocardial infarction.

249
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,550
I've read this.

250
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,390
It's over?

251
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,320
Did you read the Weibo?

252
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,600
The E-sports Industry Farm says

253
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,200
there are two crazy dogs

254
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,510
that lost control in ZGDX.

255
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,270
Really?

256
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,670
I never read that.

257
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,550
This is so funny.

258
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,960
Smiling.

259
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,960
If you don't read Weibo,
then why are you putting on make-up?

260
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,910
People are watching the game.

261
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
No one is watching you.

262
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,790
As a crazy dog that gets a lot of attention,

263
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,790
I have to look beautiful.

264
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,080
Tong Yao.

265
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,670
Your psychological burden as an idol
has outweighed Cheng's.

266
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,000
I think

267
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,600
you've been assimilated by K.

268
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,150
Focus on the crazy dog.

269
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,320
Don't mention me.

270
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,840
What's wrong with me mentioning you?

271
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
It's boring.

272
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,630
Cheng, you've got a fever?

273
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,510
Then let's get it over
as soon as possible.

274
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,870
Really?

275
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,270
Cheng has a fever.

276
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,870
Tong Yao is having a diarrhea.

277
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,910
What should we do in the next game?

278
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,960
Why do I feel that Chessman

279
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,390
is not in the right state
in terms of this operation?

280
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,750
That's right,
it is not as good as in the last game.

281
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,030
(He has been contained by Butterfly
since the early stage.)

282
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,390
We can play more concentratedly
in the bottom lane.

283
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:27,910
Okay. Okay.

284
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,630
(Chessman seems to be out of shape.)

285
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,390
Cheng, step back. I'll help you.

286
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,270
Come down to the bottom lane.

287
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,240
Come on, come on.

288
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,910
Go. Yang's Snorunt should follow too.

289
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,320
(He has killed Lu Sicheng.)

290
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,440
(Chubby's Ichimoku Ren
escaped with little blood in a flash.)

291
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,000
(CK's bottom laner and jungler
make a perfect match.)

292
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,030
Cool.

293
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,320
Nice, nice.

294
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,200
Captain, are you okay?

295
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,150
Yes, I'm fine.

296
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,670
Chubby, go support other lanes.

297
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,790
I'll develop myself in the bottom lane.

298
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,720
Okay, be careful then.

299
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,630
Come here. Take Orochi.

300
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

301
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,300
(Overlord of Jungle, Yang
CK Our Faith)

302
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,080
Do you think CK is going to
take Orochi this time?

303
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,150
Is it dangerous to do that now?

304
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,200
It should be okay.

305
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,870
(Look, Chessman has just resurrected.)

306
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,630
(And CK's got good lines on the lower lane.)

307
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,150
They're taking Orochi.

308
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,870
Don't go yet, wait for us to join you.

309
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,840
(And if CK wants to pick up
a team fight here,)

310
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,670
(they'll face a five-against-four situation.
According to the data,)

311
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,150
(ZGDX is looking for a risky victory.)

312
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,790
(Where is Smiling going?)

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,270
(Does she want to fight
against five people alone?)

314
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,630
(She's on. She's on.)

315
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,270
(Smiling has already rushed up.)

316
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,030
Watch out for people coming.

317
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,360
Side up, side up.

318
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,750
Watch out, Butterfly.

319
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,480
(Smiling anticipated
Butterfly's displacement position)

320
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,200
(and is making her ultimate move.)

321
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,000
(Butterfly was hit and fell to the ground.)

322
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,270
Cat, come here now.

323
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,120
We can take over this Orochi.

324
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,270
Okay, I'm coming now.

325
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,720
I'm coming.

326
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,360
I'm on my way too.

327
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm coming. Hold on.

328
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,200
(Cat makes his ultimate move
and rushes into the Orochi's pit.)

329
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,510
(His third skill stuns Yang.)

330
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,150
(A skill of Smiling directly kills Hua,)

331
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,870
(completing a Double Kill.)

332
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,550
Keep fighting. Keep fighting.

333
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,270
Don't run away.

334
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,550
(Wang makes his ultimate move.)

335
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,550
(Jian Yang and Good Luck
rush towards Smiling.)

336
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,030
(Smiling dodges a skill in a flash,)

337
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,510
(but is hit by Good Luck.)

338
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,600
(Chubby rushes out at the critical moment.)

339
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,510
(Triple Kill Assist)
(Smiling is safe now.)

340
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,030
(Good Luck is slowed down. Triple Kill!)

341
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,120
What are you doing?

342
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,360
(Good Luck is slowed down. Triple Kill!)

343
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,320
Withdraw. Withdraw.

344
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,480
Tong Yao is awesome.

345
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,240
Oh my God.

346
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,390
Let's go back and take Orochi.

347
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,120
Okay, come on.

348
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,670
(CK's players are dying one after another.)

349
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
(Three opponents killed with no sacrifice.)

350
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,600
(ZGDX has played really well this time.)

351
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,670
(Yeah, especially Smiling.)

352
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,510
(She is so fierce.)

353
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,480
(She's always fighting at the drop of a hat.)

354
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,270
(And her anticipation of
the ultimate moves is perfect.)

355
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,420
(She is really the No.1 Tamamo-no-Mae
on the Chinese server.)

356
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,030
In one breath. In one breath.

357
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,120
We can just go destroy the turret.

358
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,720
Okay, here we go.

359
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,120
Cheng, can I go sacrifice myself?

360
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,120
Chubby, have you got
your ultimate skill ready?

361
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,840
In five seconds.

362
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,510
Okay, then I'll go sacrifice myself.

363
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,960
Three, two, one.

364
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,120
Go.

365
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,600
(Keep a distance. Keep a distance.)

366
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,080
Don't be in a hurry.

367
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,150
(ZGDX looks like
they want to make an ultimate move.)

368
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,150
I'll move back a bit.

369
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
You guys go undertake the damage.

370
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,750
Don't rush.

371
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,360
I'll take the damage.
You guys can attack however you want.

372
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
In two seconds. In two seconds.

373
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,150
We'll wait for you.

374
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
Guard the turret! Guard the turret!

375
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,720
The turret is important.

376
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,240
Go, K, follow.

377
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,780
(Unremitting Assistance)

378
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,960
Run down, run down.
Protect Shooter. Protect Shooter.

379
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,030
(Double kill!
Smiling has made another double kill!)

380
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,150
Just join in the fight.

381
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,550
Don't stretch the battle line so long.

382
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,720
Everyone, keep closer.

383
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
(Unremitting Assistance)
(Retreat back to the base.)

384
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,910
(But K is right behind him.)

385
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,120
(Smiling makes an ultimate skill.)

386
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,510
(Triple kill!)

387
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,670
- Nice.
- Hit the turret! Hit the turret!

388
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,720
Just destroy their base turret.

389
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,150
Team fight. Team fight. Over there.

390
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,140
(Unremitting Assistance Assist)

391
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,630
(Congratulations to ZGDX for their victory!)

392
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,580
(Legendary)

393
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,550
Yes!

394
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,150
Lazy Girl has made a big comeback today.

395
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,910
Yes!

396
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,240
Yes, Smiling acted so fiercely.

397
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,120
With Chessman in bad shape,

398
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,030
ZGDX

399
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,790
still showed their superb fighting power.

400
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,270
That's why Smiling is
the No. 1 Tamamo-no-Mae.

401
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,750
(That team fight was just excellent.)

402
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,480
(Unexpectedly skilled!)

403
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,020
(Victory)

404
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,240
Great!

405
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,550
Now they've won!

406
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,840
Our daughter's won, Tong.

407
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,080
My daughter is so great.

408
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,150
That's for sure.

409
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,960
Think about whose daughter she is.

410
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,360
No more objections?

411
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,510
All right. All right.

412
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,670
Keep your mouth occupied.

413
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,820
(Mulan in E-sports)

414
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,720
Smiling.

415
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,500
(Come on)

416
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,120
Awesome!

417
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,870
Tong Yao.

418
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,270
K.

419
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,510
Sorry.

420
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,360
I'm too nervous today.

421
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,360
I meant to say

422
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,440
you played well.

423
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,390
Thank you.

424
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,360
Let's go.

425
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,550
Congratulations.

426
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,240
Congratulations.

427
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,640
Congratulations.

428
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,200
Let go.

429
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,640
You've gotten better.

430
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,440
Yes, I have.

431
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,070
That's why I'll shake hands with you
more often from now on.

432
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,310
Until you retire.

433
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,200
Let go.

434
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,160
That's not polite.

435
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,960
See you at the next game.

436
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,350
Go for it!

437
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,960
Smiling! Smiling!

438
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,440
Let's welcome Chessman and Smiling

439
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,110
to our interview area.

440
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,160
Welcome, Tong Yao, welcome, Cheng.

441
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,550
Today,

442
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,000
both of you have won

443
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,590
MVPs in two consecutive games.

444
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,960
I want to ask Tong Yao.

445
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,680
Today I heard that

446
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,480
you were so nervous before the match

447
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,160
that you talked out of turn
and got included in the event quotes.

448
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,070
Is that true?

449
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,270
I...

450
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,350
It's the first time
for a country girl to go to the city.

451
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,030
It's normal for her to be nervous.

452
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,110
Then I'd like to ask Cheng.

453
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,270
Today's game was a quick one.

454
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,310
Is it to avenge
the final of the Spring Playoff?

455
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,960
Not really.

456
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,110
It's just a normal game.

457
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,830
Then, Cheng.

458
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,830
Please comment on the new middle laner,
Tong Yao's performance

459
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,590
in the opening round today.

460
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,680
She won MVP in the second game today.

461
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,920
Did she meet your expectations?

462
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,790
Not bad.

463
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,880
Okay, thank you both for the interview.

464
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,160
Thank you, Cheng. Thank you, Tong Yao.

465
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,030
Thank you.

466
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,590
Thank you all for coming today.

467
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,960
This is the end of today's MVP interview.

468
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,750
There were four people on the top lane
in the last team fight.

469
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,550
I just went straight in.

470
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,270
You're finally here.

471
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,550
We're waiting for you.

472
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,440
How childish are you?

473
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,160
That's right.

474
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,830
- We can't win without me.
- Where's Cheng?

475
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,640
Cheng went back first because of fever.

476
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,350
Hurry up and get packed up.

477
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,680
Don't be late for the carnival later.

478
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,880
You're so boring.

479
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,350
What's wrong?

480
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,030
Rui, can I not go to

481
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,680
the event tonight as well?

482
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,920
What's wrong with you?

483
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,200
Are you going down with Cheng?

484
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,200
I…

485
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,720
I…

486
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,510
My pants are dirty.

487
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,400
You shit your pants?

488
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,270
No.

489
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,110
I'm on my period.

490
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,110
I just called a special car to

491
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,030
take Cheng back on Didi.

492
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,920
He probably hasn't gone far yet.

493
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,880
I'll call him back now.

494
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,920
Sir, yes, it's me.

495
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,550
Maybe you need to come back.

496
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,160
Another one of us has gotten ill too.

497
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,590
Right, right, sorry.

498
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,480
He'll be right back. Just a moment.

499
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,510
Thank you, Rui.

500
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,160
What's up?

501
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,200
Your manager said
I should come back to pick up someone.

502
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,960
What's wrong?

503
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,960
You're not feeling well,
so I'm here to take care of you.

504
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,200
I have a fever.

505
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,640
But I don't have a brain fever.

506
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,680
What's wrong?

507
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
My pants are stained.

508
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
You shit on your pants?

509
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,110
Then stay away from me.

510
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,550
Your nose is stuffed up, you can't smell it.

511
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,830
Seeing you is bad enough.

512
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,310
Miss.

513
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,750
Don't forget to fasten your seat belt.

514
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,960
Okay.

515
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,000
Mr. Li, how come it's you?

516
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,270
What a coincidence!

517
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,790
Do you want to consider becoming

518
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,590
my private Didi chauffeur?

519
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,110
In fact,

520
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
it doesn't matter if people now
buy a car or not.

521
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,510
With our special car,

522
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,640
it's like you own a private car.

523
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,510
Not only is it environmentally
friendly and green,

524
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,680
but it also saves on parking fees, right?

525
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,590
Yes, yes.

526
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,400
Hey, Jinyang?

527
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,270
I'm telling you, Yao.

528
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,160
You're so cool today.

529
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,680
Where are you?

530
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,200
Why did you disappear so quickly?

531
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,510
I'm on my period.

532
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,880
I'm anxious to get back to take care of it.

533
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,480
I'm hanging up.

534
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,880
Sit tightly, you two.

535
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,680
I'm about to drive.

536
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,440
Okay.

537
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,160
(I went to the opening round of
the National League today.)

538
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,160
(After the game, when shaking-hands,)

539
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,960
(Yang)

540
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,000
(wouldn't let go of Smiling's hand.)

541
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,030
(I could see it clearly from the first row.)

542
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
(Yang and Smiling.)

543
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,590
(Make more people
see this, quickly, quickly.)

544
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,790
(Watch Cheng take his medicine.)

545
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,620
(Rui)

546
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,750
(What a big boy he is.)

547
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,110
(He can't take it by himself?)

548
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,920
(He won't take it himself if you ask him to.)

549
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,880
(We can't help it. Just be tolerant.)

550
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,640
(If he dies, we won't have a captain.)

551
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,030
(I'll help the sycophant Chubby
to be the captain.)

552
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,110
(Then when you quarrel with Lu Yue,)

553
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,070
(there will be no one to help you.)

554
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,160
(Chubby can't control Lu Yue.)

555
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,680
(Recently, he has been
very obedient to Lu Yue)

556
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,070
(suffering from guilt.)

557
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,550
(He has pick up food for Lu Yue's.)

558
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,240
(Where's the medical kit?)

559
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,340
(They're on the refrigerator)

560
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,060
(Compound Acetaminophen Tablets (II)
Relieve Fever and Pain)

561
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,880
Captain, it's time for you
to take medicine.

562
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,960
Why are you sneaking around in my room?

563
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,240
Rui asked me to watch you take your medicine.

564
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,070
Leave it there. I'll take it myself.

565
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,510
Finish it before you go to sleep.

566
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,350
Here.

567
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,440
The water's too hot. Fill it again.

568
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,400
You know what?

569
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,400
The pain a woman feels during her period

570
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,270
multiplying by three it's just
as much as the pain of childbirth.

571
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
You know how painful it is
for a woman to give birth, right?

572
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,350
It's like lifting your bottom lip up

573
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,590
and using it to cover your whole head.

574
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,720
That's probably how painful it is.

575
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,480
So whenever this happens,

576
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,510
even if Godzilla were to invade the earth,

577
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,510
I could kick him back into the sea.

578
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,160
It's because it

579
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,030
disturbs me being a quiet, beautiful girl.

580
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,720
So drink the water, take the medicine.

581
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,680
Don't be high-maintenance.

582
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,480
Take another sip.

583
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,400
You're supposed
to drink more hot water when sick.

584
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,480
By the way,

585
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,070
you can't take pills with an empty stomach.

586
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,270
I'll order takeaway. What do you want to eat?

587
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,400
I want to die.

588
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,240
That can work.

589
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,920
It's just that it's not the right time.

590
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,270
Your Majesty, you have to die after

591
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,240
the treacherous traitor Lu Yue, right?

592
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,550
What do you want to eat?

593
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,480
Braised Chicken and Rice, spicy hot pot?

594
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,070
Japanese food or Korean food?

595
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Don't say no.

596
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,350
Why do you still have
such a good appetite during your period?

597
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,790
And why the hell would you eat
Japanese food during your period?

598
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,640
I order it for you.

599
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,790
Congee is ok for me.

600
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,830
I also want congee.

601
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,070
I want the congee,

602
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,350
the kind with brown sugar.

603
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
Order takeaway.

604
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,160
We have brown sugar in the kitchen.

605
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,200
Eat congee by yourself when it arrives.

606
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,270
What's wrong?

607
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,590
There is no congee in all these stores.

608
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,640
The only ones that
cook congee have bad reviews.

609
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,550
Forget it, I'll just cook it myself.

610
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm not used to congee of takeaway either.

611
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,200
You can sleep for a while.

612
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,110
I'll wake you when the congee is ready.

613
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,240
Can the patients in the base get well?

614
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,550
What are you doing?

615
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,960
Why did you come down?

616
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,880
If you want to drink water,
text me on WeChat.

617
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,200
I will send it up to you.

618
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,750
Get out of the way.

619
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
What's going on?

620
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,030
When Godzilla invades the Earth,

621
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,240
women can't touch water.

622
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,200
Tell me when it's ready.

623
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,070
I'll go upstairs first.

624
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,830
Why did you suddenly turn around?

625
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,000
Why are you following me?

626
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,750
Cheng, do you have a girlfriend?

627
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,920
No.

628
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,830
I'm not that curious anymore.

629
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,640
I was just asking.

630
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,400
If you don't want to tell me…

631
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,240
No, I don't.

632
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,960
I lived at home when I was in school.

633
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,680
There were always a few days in a month

634
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,070
when I was at her beck and call.

635
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,000
So I was brought up with the idea that

636
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,160
a woman has the right
to be the center of everything

637
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,440
on certain days of the month.

638
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,720
Yeah, right.

639
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,480
Then you must have had a hard time.

640
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,750
That's why I lived in school later.

641
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,200
I didn't go home even
when it was hot in the summer.

642
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,960
You're really good.

643
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,070
I don't fall in love with anyone easily.

644
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Oh, yeah.

645
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,510
It looks like

646
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,480
you don't like humans either.

647
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,480
What did you say?

648
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,350
It's not that I don't like humans.

649
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,750
I like games.

650
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,830
If I were to fall in love,

651
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,310
I would like to find someone
who can play games better than me.

652
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,200
(A human who can play games
better than Chessman?)

653
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,750
(A woman?)

654
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,640
(How?)

655
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,790
I'm screwed.

656
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,200
Cheng either doesn't like women

657
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,110
or else he doesn't like humans.

658
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
(How can you tell?)

659
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,590
He said he wants to find someone

660
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,310
who plays games better than him
to have a relationship with.

661
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,920
(Do Tetris, Onmyoji,)

662
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,440
(or "The Untamed" mobile game count?)

663
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,960
(He didn't specify which game.)

664
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,160
(If you feel a pain,)

665
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,030
(just lie down for a while,
drink some hot water.)

666
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,920
Why are you here?

667
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,400
Keep sleeping for a bit.

668
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,350
The congee isn't done yet.

669
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,440
What are you doing?

670
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,200
I'm watching the live stream.

671
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,920
Is my live stream too noisy

672
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,960
for you?

673
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,920
I'm sorry.

674
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,510
I'll turn it down a bit.

675
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,440
You can go back to sleep for a while.

676
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,110
No, I'm fine.

677
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,720
I thought you got burned by the congee.

678
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,350
How come?

679
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,440
I'm not that...

680
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,200
Why not make a hot water bag yourself?

681
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,960
I...

682
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,960
How would I know
there are hot water bags in the base?

683
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,270
How would you know if you don't ask?

684
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,200
Wait for me here.

685
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,400
(As the idol of e-sports,)

686
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,440
(Cheng is not so talkative in games.)

687
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,550
(Except for the necessary commands,)

688
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,160
(he always quietly does his own thing,)

689
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,480
(listening to his teammates' crap)

690
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,680
(most of the time.)

691
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,350
(Or he may turn on the auto-block function.)

692
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,240
(Maybe he can't hear)

693
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,160
(their nonsense at all.)

694
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,220
(Lu Sicheng)

695
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,310
This is…

696
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,400
From the fans.

697
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,030
How could you just

698
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,590
suddenly touch a young girl's stomach?

699
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
I can't touch a tiger's stomach?

700
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,680
In ancient times,
you would have had to marry me like this.

701
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,880
I thought I was doing a good deed.

702
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,510
Why do I have to be punished like this?

703
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,270
In ancient times,
I would have married you 800 times

704
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,720
and then repudiate you another 800 times.

705
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,830
Marry me and repudiate me.

706
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,240
And then repeat it 800 times.

707
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,270
How mean are you?

708
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,880
I don't know.

709
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,640
Maybe it's because of
my intermittent blindness.

710
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,740
(Lu Sicheng)

711
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,960
Cheng.

712
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,440
I'm sorry.

713
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,590
I was supposed to take care of you.

714
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,800
And now you're taking care of me.

715
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,280
When?

716
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,800
Who did you agree to take care of me for?

717
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,800
It's obvious you came back here

718
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,440
because you were so desperately in pain.

719
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,590
Why isn't your fever gone?

720
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,510
What kind of miracle medicine do you think

721
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,960
you gave me?

722
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,440
Let's go, let me take care of you.

723
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:32,960
This time…

724
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,920
Your stomach doesn't hurt anymore?

725
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,590
It hurts.

726
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,440
Forget it then.

727
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,840
I don't want a blue-faced person

728
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,590
rolling around on the carpet in my room.

729
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,550
But you need to be taken care of.

730
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,320
I don't.

731
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,030
You do.

732
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,710
I don't.

733
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,630
You do.

734
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,760
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

735
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,230
I don't.

736
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,110
You do, you do.

737
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,230
I really don't.

738
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,150
Rebuttal not accepted.

739
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,000
Let's go.

740
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,280
I don't.

741
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,150
You do.

742
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,880
I don't.

743
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,880
You do.

744
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,840
I don't.

745
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,670
I said you do.

746
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,230
Hurry up.

747
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,000
We're coming back.

748
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,880
Come on.

749
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,550
We're back.

750
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,030
We've brought you some good food.

751
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,190
Where are the people?

752
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,360
They didn't fall asleep
after taking the medicine, did they?

753
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,760
I have to go check on Cheng and Tong Yao.

754
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,480
Ming.

755
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,630
What are you doing?

756
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,630
Did you bump into a ghost?

757
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,000
I...

758
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,110
went upstairs…

759
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,110
Did my brother die of the illness?

760
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,760
Really? Go check on him.

761
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,760
What are you doing?

762
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,960
What's wrong?

763
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,920
Did you bump into a ghost?

764
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,920
It's even scarier than a ghost.

765
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,630
