1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,360
Stop talking.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,910
Watch out not to poop your pants.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,710
I got my pants stained.

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,870
Did you poop your pants?

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,750
Stay away from me.

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,270
No.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,400
It's my period.

8
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,670
I know you are sick,

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,000
so I volunteered to help take care of you.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,030
I have a fever,

11
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,600
but my mind is clear.

12
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,000
The water is too hot. Refill it.

13
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,000
Don't be picky.

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,000
Take another sip.

15
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,200
Drink more hot water when you are sick.

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,670
Go to sleep now.

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,710
I'll wake you up when the porridge is ready.

18
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,620
=Falling Into Your Smile=

19
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,460
=Episode 12=

20
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,150
I.

21
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,750
Cheng, are you in there?

22
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,870
Yeah?

23
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,430
No, nothing.

24
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,680
I thought you might want to sleep longer.

25
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,870
Keep it down, she's still sleeping.

26
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,710
She soiled her bed

27
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,960
and came here to share my bed.

28
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,080
What's the fuss about?

29
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,280
Cheng.

30
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,310
Inside the house.

31
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,120
Apart from your bed and hers,

32
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,750
there are many other spare ones.

33
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,310
She's afraid to soil other beds too.

34
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,030
Cheng, listen to me.

35
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,680
Although it is 2020 now,

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,590
you are both single of the opposite sex.

37
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,470
Right?

38
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,030
Cheng, way to go.

39
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,280
I see you being silent most of the time.

40
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,870
Once you are not, you make quite big news.

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,360
You even hooked a young lady
into your bed this time.

42
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,710
Awesome.

43
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,430
She has graduated from college.

44
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,240
She's eligible for marriage.

45
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,150
That's the point?

46
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,840
That's not the point.

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
This is indeed not the point.

48
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Then what's the point?

49
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,240
It's not against the law
if they are grown-ups.

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,310
Cheng, this is sexual harassment
in the workplace.

51
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,000
If you do this,

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,680
how am I going to explain it to her parents?

53
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,630
No, no.

54
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,190
You gotta wake her up first.

55
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,310
How?

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,040
This is inappropriate.

57
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,190
This is so not Cheng.

58
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,070
Cheng, watch your mouth.

59
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,160
Or I am going to call the police.

60
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,480
You go downstairs first.

61
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
I will wake her up later.

62
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,310
Are you satisfied with this attitude?

63
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,190
Yes.

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
Incredibly satisfied.

65
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,360
Then go if you're.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,720
Let's go.

67
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,120
- Let's go.
- No, I don't want to.

68
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,750
You go first.

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,270
Come on, or it's going to be awkward.

70
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,430
Go, go, go.

71
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,430
I'm going. I'm going.

72
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,190
- Let's go, let's go.
- Are we really leaving?

73
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,510
- For sure.
- Let's go.

74
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,070
Go.

75
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
- Leaving. Hurry.
- Come on, let's go.

76
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,560
Isn't this my room?

77
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,750
Get up.

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,480
Get up.

79
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,510
So sorry, Cheng.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,310
Last night, I was

81
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,510
too sleepy and cold.

82
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,630
And then, I crawled…

83
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
If we were in ancient times,

84
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,950
you'd have had to be dipped
in a pig's cage for punishment, wouldn't you?

85
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,430
May, maybe.

86
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,830
Or would this have been the 801st time
that I should marry you?

87
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,120
You are such a trouble-maker.

88
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,190
Are you committing fraud for the bride price?

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,510
Bride price?

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,190
What bride price?

91
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,950
Are you proposing to me?

92
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,160
I mean, are you…

93
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,160
Never mind, I was trying to be sarcastic.

94
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,270
What fraud for the bride price?

95
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,480
I am employed with
an annual salary of 800 thousand yuan.

96
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,830
Why would I care for your bride price?

97
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,310
It turns out there really is something
called girlish embarrassment.

98
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,510
What are you looking for?

99
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,800
To see if you stained my quilt.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,750
What are you doing?

101
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,600
Stop it.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,270
I will help wash it if it got stained.

103
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,270
Come on, can you be more dependable?

104
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,190
Let's do the math. How many times
have I taken the blame for you?

105
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,360
Yeah. Hooray for the Captain.

106
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,430
How about my being your slave
in the next life?

107
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,160
No, I insist on checking.

108
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,430
No, give it to me.

109
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,360
Stop looking.

110
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,830
- No.
- Give it to me.

111
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,950
- Give it to me.
- No.

112
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,600
- Give it to me.
- No, I won't.

113
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,040
Give it to me, just give it to me.

114
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,920
Give it to me.

115
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,070
Cheng, do you want to
have some prawn dumplings?

116
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,000
Cheng is not in the room?

117
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

118
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,750
He's out.

119
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,310
Cheng.

120
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,000
Cheng.

121
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,720
You….

122
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,070
Stop mumbling.

123
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,630
The quilt is fine.

124
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,830
I'll wash it if it is not.

125
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,870
Who was that just now?

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,870
Chubby.

127
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,510
Why is he back?

128
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,830
Prawn dumplings?

129
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,270
I want to have some.

130
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,750
Do you need to get changed?

131
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,830
You just sweated.

132
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,830
Don't get a cold.

133
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,720
So sorry, Cheng.

134
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,510
Last night, I was

135
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
too sleepy and cold.

136
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,750
And then, I crawled…

137
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,440
Or would this have been
the 801st time that I should marry you?

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,200
You are such a trouble-maker.

139
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,440
Are you committing fraud for the bride price?

140
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,080
(Cool.)

141
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,870
(Thanks for the presents, thank you.)

142
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,080
(Thanks to this bro for your present.)

143
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,510
(Underage users are not allowed
to reward hosts.)

144
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,790
(Such a severe damage.)

145
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
(Please, Cheng, equipment synthesis.)

146
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,960
(Thank you bro, for so many presents.)

147
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,030
(Check this out bro,
check out my live streaming.)

148
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,670
Calm down, calm down.

149
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,080
I am in the ambush; I am in the ambush.

150
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,270
Wait, wait, wait.

151
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,630
Wait for me, wait for me.

152
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,120
Gank me again. I may hit you.

153
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,630
Still clinging to it?

154
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,550
Want to gank me?

155
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,390
Wait, I can't return.

156
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,360
Nice try.

157
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,720
I will be the bait.

158
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,030
Let's go.

159
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,360
Why is everyone on the air?

160
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
So diligent.

161
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,080
Since you have time to ask me that,

162
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,910
how about calculating your own airtime?

163
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,200
No time left at the end of the month,
ever heard of that?

164
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,390
Only 45 hours for a month.

165
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,320
I shouldn't have much time left.

166
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,510
When did I sign the contract?

167
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,790
Besides, Rui said

168
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,270
that I could take some days off.

169
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,870
3 five-hour days this week.

170
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,600
Plus last week.

171
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,630
25, 30.

172
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,630
Oh my God.

173
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,270
I have 32 hours to go.

174
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,240
You figured that out?

175
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,080
Welcome to the hell.

176
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,300
(ZGDX_Smiling)

177
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,870
Your specially focused ZGDX Smiling

178
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,910
is now on live streaming.

179
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,510
Open the application and have a look.

180
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,270
Hello, this is Smiling.

181
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,630
I'm on live streaming now.

182
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,510
Today is the legendary

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,870
no-time-left-at-the-end-of-the-month series.

184
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,510
Yeah.

185
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,320
I won't go to bed
until I am on live streaming for 8 hours.

186
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,360
Thank you to this lovely user
who just sent a finger heart.

187
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,080
So have you guys missed me

188
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,360
since I haven't been live for so many days?

189
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,670
Although I didn't do live streaming
for a couple of days,

190
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,510
we were actually practicing on a daily basis.

191
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,150
Captain.

192
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,910
Is it good?

193
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,480
Of course.

194
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,790
Of course?

195
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,790
No matter how good it is,
she is your ex already.

196
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,320
Keep watching, I am off now.

197
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
What if my live streaming time
is not long enough?

198
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll get my wages deducted.

199
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,630
However, poor people like me,

200
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,440
are not going to let the manager
have the chance to do that.

201
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,840
So, maybe for a long time,

202
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,150
you guys will be seeing me a lot

203
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,200
in the studio.

204
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,510
Enough of this. Let's start the ranking.

205
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,320
I'm the first to ban a shikigami?

206
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,960
Let me see, which one to ban?

207
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,000
Tai is your opponent with another account.

208
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,060
(Burial, Spoilme, Keityou Shu)

209
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
Why did you ban Umibozu that

210
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,840
no one's possibly going to use?

211
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,320
My hand got out of my control.
I made a mistake.

212
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,910
Is that your mindset?

213
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,820
(Shikigamis selected by Blue)

214
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,630
You select Enma while your enemy has Aoandou.

215
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,480
Are you out of your mind?

216
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,390
Select Marisha Ray.

217
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,380
(Kuro Douji, Itsumade, Marisha Ray, Hakurou, Ichimoku Ren
vs. Ibaraki Douji, Yasha, Aoandou, Youko, Yama Usagi)

218
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,910
From the moment I mentioned Tai,

219
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,440
there have been 7 waves
of lanes and 28 minions

220
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,480
of which you missed 15.

221
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,870
If I were your teammate, I would've quit.

222
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,080
Stop talking.

223
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,840
My minion.

224
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,080
Now it's 16.

225
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,480
Another minion and you will reach level 6.

226
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,390
The jungler is on his way.

227
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,360
What are you rushing for?

228
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,340
(First Blood  Assist)

229
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,120
(You're supposed to
have quick hands for being single.)

230
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,000
Why are you running away
once you are under attack?

231
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,360
And why didn't you
check your teammate's position

232
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,150
and only focus on your own EXP bar?

233
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,480
What an amateur.

234
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,080
What did Tai do to you?

235
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,390
Did he kill someone or what?

236
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Why are you so afraid of him?

237
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,870
Stop whining, I am about to carry.

238
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,080
(How dare you talk to Cheng like that?)

239
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,030
(My sweetheart is the best.)

240
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,000
(Great move.)

241
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,390
Look at you.

242
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,030
Open your eyes. Take a look at your enemy.

243
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,120
Where is Tai?

244
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,840
Lu Sicheng, what's wrong with you?
Why are you scaring me?

245
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,120
How I miss the time
when you were trembling on the bed

246
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,720
who didn't dare to say a word.

247
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,630
Cheers.

248
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,480
What are you talking about?

249
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,320
(No.)

250
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
(I didn't.)

251
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,390
(How's that even possible?)

252
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,080
(How can you believe that?)

253
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,320
I will close the live streaming
if you keep typing question marks.

254
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,000
(You sullied Cheng.)

255
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,550
This user with an ID
called "Lu Sicheng's Wife".

256
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,080
I guarantee you he's still your "husband".

257
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,120
I didn't sully him.

258
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,720
As for whether he's innocent or not,

259
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm not so sure about that.

260
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,630
At least I didn't sully him.

261
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,630
Ask him yourself.

262
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,540
(What have you done?)

263
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,120
How did you sully him?

264
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,270
My legs are not as long as his arms.

265
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,360
How could I force him?

266
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,750
(Come on.)

267
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,510
(I should really get you some washing powder)

268
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,550
(and wash your brain thoroughly
for 10,000 years.)

269
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,030
- Morning.
- Good morning.

270
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,750
Boring. Let's begin training.

271
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,390
What happened to him?

272
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
The jungler of our team

273
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,720
couldn't help loving the enemy's midsolo.

274
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
If he likes her so much,
why did they break up?

275
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,030
Now that she is with ZGDX

276
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,440
and sits next to Lu Sicheng,

277
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,510
it's like giving away his beloved one.

278
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,960
If I were a girl,

279
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,720
I would root for Lu Sicheng.

280
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,910
If you were a girl, who wouldn't you like?

281
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,670
You.

282
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,150
I disdain you.

283
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,670
You can't say that.

284
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,750
Last time we got our butts kicked by ZGDX,

285
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,510
it was not Yang's fault.

286
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,600
His performance was fine.

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,150
At least 50-50 compared with K.

288
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,030
The two bottom laners didn't get along

289
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,120
while the jungler is obsessed with
the midsolo from another team.

290
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,550
We are doomed.

291
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,550
Can we begin our training?

292
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,510
Yeah, yeah.

293
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,000
Then get your ass down here.

294
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,510
All right.

295
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,720
I had a cold while
she had her period yesterday.

296
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,150
So we skipped the events
after playing the game and came straight back.

297
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,550
During that time,
she took every possible means to stay on my bed.

298
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,480
How could I ignore her?

299
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,960
If she dies, we won't have a midsolo.

300
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,960
We have yet another game the next day.

301
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,390
Lu Yue?

302
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,400
Lu Yue's not as good as her.

303
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,270
What the heck?

304
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,200
(So, do you actually
have a girlfriend, Cheng?)

305
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,720
(You are too old to play e-sports
with such a cold stare,)

306
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,750
(acting like you hate human beings.)

307
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,510
(Doesn't your family worry about you?)

308
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,000
Is this "Hair of a Little Zongzi" your friend?

309
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,400
How do you know?

310
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,480
She said I hate human beings,
which sounds familiar to me.

311
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,350
Why do you have a face

312
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,200
that looks like you hate human beings then?

313
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,030
Stop slandering.

314
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,750
What if I really couldn't find a wife?

315
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,960
Shut up, stop babbling.

316
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,030
(Big news.)

317
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,920
(It's true the two Center players of ZGDX
slept together in one bed.)

318
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,720
(No, Cheng was forced upon by Smiling?)
(Cheng was even talking about this on streaming.)

319
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,030
(Obviously, he's open-hearted
but couldn't stop talking dirty.)

320
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,030
(Why would I fall in love with)

321
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,030
(an e-sports player
who doesn't like human beings?)

322
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,100
(Zizhen Yuan)

323
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,480
What can I do for you?

324
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,550
I am here for someone.

325
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,750
Looking for someone?

326
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,720
Who?

327
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,750
Make a phone call
and ask the person to pick you up.

328
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,200
I didn't bring my phone.

329
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,400
Can I borrow yours?

330
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,880
Thank you.

331
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:47,920
Hello?

332
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,310
Hello, who am I speaking to?

333
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,000
Hello?

334
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,480
Weird.

335
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,790
Why is this person not talking?

336
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,310
Hang up if no one is talking.

337
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,680
(Did you see the minions
making their way towards the turret?)

338
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,720
(Stop talking, Lu Sicheng.)

339
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,640
(My minions.)

340
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,960
Hello, Yao, it's me.

341
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,590
Hello.

342
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
I am at the gate of your base.

343
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Can you come out for a sec?

344
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,550
What? The gate of our base?

345
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,590
The security guard won't let me in.

346
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,000
Why are you here out of blue?

347
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,070
Hold on.

348
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,590
Lu Yue, come help me with the rest of it.

349
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,750
I need to go out for a sec.

350
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,070
Okay.

351
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,070
Who is it?

352
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,790
Jian Yang.

353
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,070
Why is he here?

354
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,440
How am I supposed to know?

355
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,350
(Cheng, I guess it was
because of what you said.)

356
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,440
(With all due respect,)

357
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,240
(everyone here is trash
who couldn't get to the point.)

358
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,030
If one day the jungler from CK

359
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,030
is playing together with
the midsolo from ZGDX during a game,

360
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,480
then it's basically game over.

361
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,160
Wow, the bullet screen seems to know a lot.

362
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,880
Shut up.

363
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,830
Thank you.

364
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,790
You are welcome.

365
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,960
Is your girlfriend coming to get you?

366
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,640
It seems to be getting dark.

367
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,440
Go in there.

368
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,750
Don't let her go too far.

369
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,720
Thank you.

370
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,200
Babe.

371
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,790
I really have no idea about this.

372
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,400
You see, Yao is not coming, how about me?

373
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,110
Tong Yao.

374
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,830
Come on, come here.

375
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,590
Ai Jia?

376
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,160
Why are you here?

377
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,550
I'm here waiting for you.

378
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,510
Here's my heads-up.

379
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,590
There is an old saying:

380
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,270
Don't go back once you are determined
to move forward.

381
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,240
And don't mess around with your ex.

382
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,110
Someone also said that

383
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,440
she would never fall in love with
any e-sports player.

384
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,110
Ok, ok, I got it.

385
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,480
I'm not getting back together, I am not.

386
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,640
Why would I do that?

387
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,720
But he's here drunk.

388
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,270
I gotta send him back, right?

389
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,590
Or the news is going to be like:

390
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,750
CK jungler died on his way to ZGDX.

391
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,720
That won't sound good, right?

392
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,240
All right.

393
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,830
How about Ai Jia going along?

394
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,110
Why am I involved in this?

395
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm not going, I am not.

396
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,550
What's the use of you?

397
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,750
Tong Yao.

398
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,070
Babe.

399
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,830
I will make it live streaming for you soon.

400
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,440
Very interesting.

401
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,400
What brought you here?

402
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,590
Jian Yang, what are you doing?

403
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,920
Screw you.

404
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,510
Let go of me.

405
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,000
Quiet.

406
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,510
I'll talk to you later.

407
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,880
Are you drunk?

408
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,480
Are you really in a relationship
with Lu Sicheng now?

409
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,830
What relationship?

410
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,960
Didn't he explain the whole thing clearly

411
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,480
during the live streaming?

412
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,550
Did you take a cab across half of Shenzhen

413
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,720
just for this?

414
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,960
If you're here for gossip,

415
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,440
you may as well call a Didi and leave.

416
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,270
Take care and I'm not seeing you off.

417
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,480
Then why would he say those ambiguous words

418
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,070
and be so misleading
during the live streaming?

419
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,830
Now the whole panel is talking about you,

420
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,720
saying the two of you're in a relationship.

421
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,480
It makes me crazy

422
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,440
every time I see it.

423
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,880
That's just my teammates joking around.

424
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,200
Besides, why does it have
anything to do with you?

425
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,960
Jian Yang.

426
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,590
I think

427
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,440
I made it very clear before.

428
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,550
About what?

429
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,510
We are over.

430
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,030
Seriously.

431
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Wasn't the previous time happy

432
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,350
when you were a professional player

433
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
while I was a student?

434
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,400
Nobody cared about each other.

435
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,880
Why have you become agitated
ever since I became a professional player?

436
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,440
I haven't become agitated.

437
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,240
At least you should give me
a chance to explain.

438
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,790
It was my bad to lie to you.

439
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,270
But I was afraid you would be overthinking.

440
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,310
That's why I didn't tell you.

441
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,270
I really didn't do a thing.

442
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,030
I went straight back after getting drunk.

443
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,790
If you don't buy it,

444
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,070
you can go ask Good Luck
and the rest of them.

445
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,160
Why would I bother asking them?

446
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,440
Besides,

447
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,200
the general plot is all about
fooling around after getting drunk.

448
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,310
What happens in the TV show is not true.

449
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,350
How can a person still be
conscious enough to do anything else?

450
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,660
(A report from someone unknown)

451
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,030
(A report from someone unknown.)

452
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,000
(The midsolo in your team just went across
the line and is in an early relationship.)

453
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,480
(I beg Your Captain to terminate
the relationship on the spot.)

454
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,440
(Onmyoji Arena Pro League)

455
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,830
(is a dreamland,
and we never nurse a viper in our bosom.)

456
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,030
(They are hugging, darn it.)

457
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,510
(That is so outrageous.)

458
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,030
Brother, where are you going?

459
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,350
To buy some candies.

460
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,960
How can you eat it when you have
a medical history of genetic disease?

461
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,960
I am buying them just to look at them.

462
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:18,750
Yao.

463
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,590
Hold it there.

464
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,510
Tong Yao, my name is Tong Yao.

465
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,920
Tong Yao.

466
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,720
Just give me another opportunity.

467
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,640
Will you?

468
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,240
I didn't mean to hurt you.

469
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,680
You didn't know
what it's like to be a pro before.

470
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,350
Now that you are one of us,

471
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,920
You should know how hard it is.

472
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,000
When your life is exposed

473
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,720
under the watch of your fans and media,

474
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,640
it is really hard

475
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,880
to try to protect those you love.

476
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,030
I didn't want to

477
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,640
expose you in front of the fans

478
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,440
because I was afraid that
they might hurt you.

479
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,790
Yao, I miss you.

480
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I miss you so much.

481
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,680
I was even dreaming that one day,

482
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,480
we could both make it to the finals

483
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,030
with you looking at me down there.

484
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
The moment I hold the trophy up,

485
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,240
I would propose to you.

486
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,720
Jian Yang, don't you understand?

487
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,350
I can play it myself right now.

488
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,030
Cheng?

489
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,960
I want to buy some candies,
but I have no money.

490
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,350
Lend me some
and I'll give it back to you later.

491
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,960
We are now using Alipay, aren't we?

492
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,270
Okay, here you go.

493
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:30,880
By the way,

494
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,830
I don't have an issue with you guys flirting.

495
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,640
But I think

496
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,550
it is necessary for me
to clarify one more time objectively.

497
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,350
First,

498
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,680
this Shorty is indeed going to the finals.

499
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,590
However,

500
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,030
she is there to play the game.

501
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,750
So she probably has no time
to sit down there,

502
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,830
watching your team play.

503
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,440
Second,

504
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,350
ZGDX

505
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,270
has already been carved
onto this year's trophy.

506
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,070
And I choose Youko as the skin. Thank you.

507
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,640
I am done, you guys go on.

508
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,270
So what are you trying to tell me

509
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,880
to be here?

510
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,550
Is it possible that

511
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,920
we would've been together

512
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,920
if I didn't become a pro
at the very beginning?

513
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,960
Jian Yang, don't you understand?

514
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,750
It wasn't your decision
to become a pro or not

515
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
that ended our relationship.

516
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,830
It's about me.

517
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,030
You have never treated me as someone

518
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,640
whom you can spend the rest of your life with

519
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,750
from the very beginning,

520
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,590
or even someone in the same position.

521
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,310
You had your dream.

522
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,830
And I had my goal.

523
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,880
We were far from being in sync.

524
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,830
That's why, Jian Yang,

525
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,480
we are not the ones for each other.

526
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,400
What makes you say that?

527
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,920
Yao, I thought we used to be good, didn't we?

528
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,440
Jian Yang.

529
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,110
Call it a day, will you?

530
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,240
You are drunk.

531
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,510
Let me take you back to your base.

532
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,790
This does not look good to your fans.

533
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,510
Let's go.

534
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,880
So what's our relationship now?

535
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,240
Friends.

536
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,750
If we are still friends,

537
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,790
remove me first.

538
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,590
What?

539
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,720
From your blacklist.

540
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,740
(Remove Sunflower from blacklist)

541
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,200
Done.

542
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,880
But if you keep saying

543
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,200
strange stuff in the future,

544
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,720
I will still blacklist you.

545
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,030
What strange stuff?

546
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Like getting back together,

547
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,480
watching you growing up, things like that.

548
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,000
Okay.

549
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,440
Since we are back to friends
from the next second on,

550
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,310
let's have a final hug.

556
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,240
All right.

557
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,720
You had the hug.

558
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,960
And you are removed from the blacklist.

559
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,590
Let's go, I'll take you back.

The car is here, time to go back.

565
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,640

How are you?

580
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,110
How are you?

581
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
We just moved here and live next door.

582
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,790
Hello, hello.

583
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,960
I am sorry.

584
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,030
The decoration process has lasted
for two months. Is it bothering you?

585
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,000
No, we can understand that.

586
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,110
What's the name of your son?

587
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,350
Yang.

588
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,070
Yao, say thank you to your brother.

589
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,510
Thank you.

590
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,070
I am not going back to school.

591
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,400
I will stay there
and play professional e-sports.

592
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,260
(Zizhen Yuan)

593
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,830
(Listen to my very own comforting playlist.)

594
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,790
(Have a good dream.)

595
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,750
(Tomorrow is another day.)

596
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,320
Cheng.

597
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,630
Have you been reconciled with him?

598
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,590
No.

599
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,800
Then why would he hug you?

600
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,670
How did you see that?

601
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,000
Why do you care?

602
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,280
It's a hug of friendship.

603
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,760
I'm not dumb.

604
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,760
Captain.

605
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,070
Then why are you here?

606
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,280
Did I say that already?

607
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,510
For the candy.

608
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,710
Why would I think
you are here to ruin something?

609
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,110
Ruining what?

610
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,320
What makes you say that?

611
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,280
My sixth sense.

612
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,000
How would a dumbass girl like you

613
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,110
have the sixth sense?

614
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,590
Show me your wallet.

615
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,280
Why do you want that?

616
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,920
Who gave you the courage?

617
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,230
Fish Leong.

618
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,800
Childish.

619
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,880
Why are you back together?

620
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,480
Where is your Yang, Shorty?

621
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,630
Are you back together?

622
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,590
Or did you turn him down

623
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,110
and go together with my brother?

624
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,710
It's a coincidence, okay?

625
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,110
Jian Yang left already.

626
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,550
We are not getting back together.

627
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,440
And talking about being together
with your brother?

628
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,550
I want to live a few years longer.

629
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,920
That's why I will never start a relationship
with an e-sports player.

630
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,150
Can you be tenderer as a girl?

631
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,840
No, I can't.

632
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,590
Your performance is the worst.

633
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,280
Wait.

634
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,460
(Support needed for our junction)

635
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,710
Lu Yue,

636
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,800
you son of a gun.

637
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,070
Stop ruining my account.

638
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,030
You asked me to play it for you.

639
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,590
I didn't ask you to play it like that.

640
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,360
How am I going to turn the table?

641
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,280
I am okay.

642
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,510
I am about to carry, ok?

643
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,400
No way.

644
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,630
Quiet!

645
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,590
Why don't you eat your candies
since you bought them?

646
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,630
I don't want them all of a sudden.

647
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,550
He wasn't going to buy the candies anyway.

648
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,510
Look.

649
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,880
He's still got lots of them here.

650
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,550
Right?

651
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,400
What?

652
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,510
I had been at the base for a long time.

653
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,800
I couldn't go out for a walk?

654
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,230
Some fresh air is good for my health.

655
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,280
I buy that.

656
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,070
The goal for our team
is to win the Grand Championship.

657
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,280
Say no to early relationship.
Say no to betrayal.

658
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,800
All right.

659
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,190
(Don't tell me that)

660
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,110
(the sequel of E-sports White Snake Legend
is the Cowherd and The Girl Weaver.)

661
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,670
(I ran into Jian Yang making
a sudden appearance in the ZGDX base.)

662
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,590
(The E-sports Industry Farm)

663
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,000
(is a proper manufacturing base
of the e-sports gossip.)

664
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,700
(Jinyang)

665
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,710
Hello?

666
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,320
How's your relationship with Jian Yang?

667
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,630
What do you think?

668
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,880
I removed him from the blacklist

669
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,230
and then let him go.

670
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,280
Good girl.

671
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,230
Wait.

672
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,070
As for the fact that Cheng came to us today,

673
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,760
if I'm correct,

674
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,320
did you tip him off?

675
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,550
We sure are good friends, spot on.

676
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,630
From today's tip-off,

677
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,880
I could definitely tell Cheng
has special feelings for you.

678
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,190
No way.

679
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,480
Then explain to me

680
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,230
what happened between you and Cheng?

681
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,280
And what's going on
with his mysterious speech

682
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,150
about you two on the bed?

683
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,630
Even if this is a joke, it's too much.

684
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,440
You have no idea.

685
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,590
Now that people are super misled

686
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,550
on Weibo and Special Group.

687
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,710
And now look at him.

688
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,760
I have already told you.

689
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,400
He would sometimes talk dirty.

690
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,800
Then how do you explain

691
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,800
why he stopped you from getting back
together with Jian Yang?

692
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,710
Probably because he really didn't want me

693
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,760
to be distracted because of
such trivial stuff as a relationship.

694
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,920
I mean, it doesn't seem like

695
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,670
anyone's got a girlfriend in our team anyway.

696
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,630
I can smell the hypocrisy through the screen.

697
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,230
Do you really think what Lu Sicheng did

698
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,800
is only for the team score?

699
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,030
Enough girl, I am not gonna buy that.

700
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,590
Stop brainwashing me.

701
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,670
The boys in our team

702
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,190
are all followed by a huge number of fans.

703
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,550
Especially Cheng.

704
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,960
Endless queues of fans.

705
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,550
Besides, he is handsome
and from a noble family.

706
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,000
If he was into me,

707
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,360
he might be bewitched by me.

708
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,920
You are a really good girl.

709
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,440
Why would you not have enough self-esteem?

710
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,070
Why would I think

711
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,920
when you are comforting me firmly like this,

712
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,280
I feel like blacklisting you even more?

713
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,670
Your princess is so tall,
good-looking and elegant,

714
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,440
I can't believe you are blacklisting me.

715
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,070
That won't make Amao's dad
less mentally disabled.

716
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,110
You are right.

717
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,230
Then see it as

718
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,710
me doing something good to help build
my self-image for the rest of my life.

719
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,190
In my next life,

720
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,510
if my husband

721
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,760
was more handsome than
young Leonardo DiCaprio,

722
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,630
it's all up to the good fortune that
I accumulated for the rest of my life.

723
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,360
All right, I gotta go.

724
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,280
I feel sleepy now.

725
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,630
Okay, good night.

726
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,400
Good night.

727
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,590
Do you really think what Lu Sicheng did

728
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,110
is only for the team score?

729
