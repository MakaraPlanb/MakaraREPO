1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,510
(Whether it's e-sports or her,)

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,800
(I just want to love what I love.)

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,670
You executives can let the ZGDX players down.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,750
But I can't.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,280
Because I'm the captain.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,480
Hey, tell me.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,470
(What have I done wrong?)

8
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,180
=Falling into Your Smile=

9
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,940
=Episode 28=

10
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,950
During the whole game,

11
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,760
YQCB's flawless defense and zero turnovers

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,310
are the reason for their victory.

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,710
On the other hand,

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,120
there were frequent errors in positioning,

15
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,510
bad coordination,

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,950
and slow support efficiency in our team.

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,030
The main problem is condescension.

18
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,030
Youko can't be the best choice in that game.

19
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,400
But this is also my problem.

20
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,080
I shouldn't have connived at you guys.

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,190
The next game is crucial.

22
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,360
Cooperation.

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,590
We can't lose any of the three lanes.

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,800
Take defense as attack.

25
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,910
If they want to keep it steady,

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,400
we have to keep it steadier than them.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,800
Cheng, pay attention to the development
and lead the line in the early stage.

28
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,630
Don't let Hierophant take advantage of it.

29
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,430
Cheng.

30
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,910
I know Lee Gun-hyeok very well.

31
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,560
If we don't restrain him in the early stage

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
to prevent him from developing,

33
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,520
it'll be incredibly tough for us

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,400
to fight in the late stage.

35
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,520
This is why you chose Youko?

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,590
Youko can easily beat up Chin in the same line

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,560
before reaching level 6.

38
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,960
As long as he's not with
high-burst-of-damage equipment in the late stage,

39
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,310
we can easily crush him in team fights.

40
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,030
So we must make the fight a quick one.

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,240
You're all silent now?

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,800
Welcome back.

43
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,430
This is the gaming scene of

44
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,910
the second match

45
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,360
between ZGDX and YQCB.

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm Fan, the commentator.

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm commentator Chen Yao.

48
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:54,960
Okay.

49
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,560
We now see the players of both teams

50
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,430
are ready to play.

51
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,240
YQCB first

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,470
banned Kosodenote, Yamakaze and Tamamo-no-Mae

53
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,280
while ZGDX banned

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,590
Aoandou, Yama Usagi and Shuten.

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,750
Then let's see

56
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,710
what midsolo

57
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,560
will Smiling choose?

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,960
I guess basically she will choose Ootengu again.

59
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,120
Yuki Onna?

60
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,190
(Oh my god, she chose Yuki Onna.)

61
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,600
(Is this the time to play
four-preserving-one tactics?)

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,630
Yuki Onna.

63
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,480
(To be honest, I don't get)

64
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,630
(why she chose Yuki Onna now.)

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,630
(She should know their opponent is YQCB.)

66
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,310
(Can the tactics work?)

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,870
(I don't understand it either.)

68
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,630
Cheng.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,630
Hannya.

70
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,360
Okay.

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,390
What?

72
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,680
(After Smiling chose Yuki Onna,)

73
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,390
(ZGDX actually picked Hannya!)

74
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,950
(What kind of lineup is this?)

75
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,430
According to the current lineup,

76
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,720
I think this should be the case.

77
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,950
Hannya and Ibaraki Douji go to the bottom lane.

78
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,950
And the midsolo is Yuki Onna.

79
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,560
The topsolo would be Onikiri.

80
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,040
Onikiri as midsolo?

81
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,870
What in the world is this?

82
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,750
(I'm a little baffled now.)

83
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,680
(The players in this season
are too unpredictable.)

84
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,560
(Everything I say may be refuted.)

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,720
(I am a bit autistic and
don't want to talk anymore.)

86
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
(Okay, now we see that)

87
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,830
(it's been 13 minutes since the match started.)

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,000
(In ZGDX…)

89
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,750
YQCB is too patient.

90
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,000
It's been over ten minutes.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
They have just hit and lead the lines.

92
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,800
I'm even not used to the fact
that no one has ambushed me.

93
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,310
We have similar gold and equipment.

94
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,800
They are now waiting for their chance.

95
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,600
Now it depends on who'll slip up.

96
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Plus the lineup is very confusing.

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,310
Chubby, go make me a vision.

98
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,190
I'll come over.

99
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,920
Okay.

100
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,750
K is here.

101
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,390
I'm coming too. I'm coming too.

102
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,480
Me too.

103
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,390
Get in.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,800
What?

105
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,360
Where is the promised friendly development?

106
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,600
Four people actually came.

107
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,870
I can't hold my Barrier for long.

108
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,750
Cheng has only half of blood now.

109
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,750
I'll be right there. I'll go around the back.

110
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,630
Wait for me, don't be impulsive.

111
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,480
(Okay, now we see)

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,680
(Yuki Onna made
an ultimate skill to stall for time.)

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,270
(Onikiri and Ibaraki Douji used Shift.)

114
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,920
Retreat.

115
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,070
Lu Sicheng is not full-bloodied.

116
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,920
You want to be killed under the turret
in the bottom lane by Smiling?

117
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,830
I don't want to sacrifice my ad.

118
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,270
Tong Yao.

119
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,630
Are they afraid of you?

120
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,040
Why did they retreat as soon as you came?

121
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,560
They left the moment I came.

122
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,270
Shoot.

123
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,950
Then my gold was wasted all the way here.

124
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,430
YQCB team is so restrained.

125
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,120
If they wait another half second
when my barrier vanishes,

126
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,270
they can totally kill captain with several hits.

127
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,630
YQCB is now playing differently than before.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
They want to fight a long battle with us now.

129
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,070
So when it comes to late team fights,

130
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,360
we must be cautious.

131
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,310
(On the contrary,)

132
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,920
(ZGDX players)

133
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,190
(are famous for quick reaction, strong positioning)

134
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,390
(as well as stronger awareness to support.)

135
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,950
(It's still a familiar playing style.)

136
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,920
(It doesn't)

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,070
(look good now.)

138
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,390
It depends on

139
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,750
who has more stamina in the following match.

140
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,310
(However, it seems to be the other way around)

141
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,360
(in today's game.)

142
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,680
Ai Jia.

143
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,190
Come and stall with me in the middle lane

144
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,390
to cover Hierophant and others over Orochi.

145
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,240
Okay.

146
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,830
They'll come steal it.

147
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,870
Yasha is not as fast as me.

148
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,240
I'm saving my ultimate skill for Smiling.

149
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
As soon as she comes, I'll kill her.

150
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,430
YQCB's ad and jungler are together hitting Orochi.

151
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,480
We can't let them have it.

152
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,160
Doumeki and Youtou Hime
are too fast hitting Orochi.

153
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,430
I may not be able to steal it even if I enter with Subdue.

154
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,750
Yeah, let's lead the line separately.

155
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,430
No, we can't let them have it.
Cat, pick up a team fight.

156
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,750
I'll flank it

157
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,630
and kill Menreiki first.

158
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,160
You have to slap my face like this?

159
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,120
They got me killed in a second.

160
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,480
They came for Orochi in a hurry.

161
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,270
Watch your positions!

162
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,390
Rong, you stop Hannya.

163
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,430
Make sure Hierophant will get Orochi.

164
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,920
K will definitely come to reclaim it.

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,190
Kim Eun-seok, use Subdue first.

166
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,070
K, come for it.

167
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,310
Okay.

168
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,240
(Unstoppable)
(K jumps into the snake pit for Orochi.)

169
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,310
Youtou Hime has Orochi. Retreat!

170
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,800
They have Kirin with them.
We have no advantage.

171
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,380
(Successfully sealed)

172
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,390
(They didn't get it.
YQCB already got Orochi.)

173
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,870
We're all dead, go back!

174
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,920
Youtou Hime is out of blood.
Onikiri, come and get it.

175
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,220
(Double Kill)

176
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,310
Let's go. We can't fight this.

177
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,190
We can't even touch the back row.

178
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,950
Besides, Doumeki has tremendous damage.

179
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,560
Retreat, Tong Yao is running out of blood too.

180
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,000
(Retreat! Retreat!)

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,270
Let's go. Cheng, we don't have enough blood.

182
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's go. I can't protect you.

183
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,920
I can fight.

184
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,190
I can fight.

185
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,800
I can fight.

186
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,040
I can fight.

187
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,600
Yes.

188
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,920
(If they don't retreat and got aced,)

189
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,830
(the result of this match)

190
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,160
(would be obvious.)

191
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,720
(I can fight.)

192
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,870
(Bravo!)

193
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,510
(Chessman and Smiling worked together)

194
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,960
(to kill Rong in seconds.)

195
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,870
(Smiling was killed
by Hierophant's set of skills.)

196
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,030
(Chessman is still holding on.)

197
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:12,150
(Hierophant! Hierophant! Hierophant!)

198
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,030
(Ace!)

199
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,320
(Pushing up to the base turret.)

200
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,000
(ZGDX base has exploded.)

201
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,150
(Let's congratulate YQCB)

202
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,960
(for winning the game!)

203
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,080
(Congratulations to YQCB.)

204
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,120
Nice!

♪If I'm pressed, I'll make them pay♪

206
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,720

- Yes.
- Nice, nice.

212
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,550
Good for you.

213
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,390
That's a must.

214
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,750
Let's go, let's go.

215
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,480
Let's go.

216
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,390
Thank you for your hard work.

217
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,200
Thank you for your hard work.

00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,150
Thank you for your hard work.

221
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,790
Come on, thank you.

222
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,000
Congratulations.

223
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,870
Good job.

224
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,150
Go for it.

225
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,630
Cheng.

226
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,480
Good job.

227
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,200
It's amazing that a girl can do like this.

228
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,270
Thank you.

229
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,960
Chessman is suffering from his hand injury?

230
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,750
Smiling.

231
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,510
Take good care of him.

232
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,150
All right, all right.

233
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,030
Don't look like it's the end of the world.

234
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,240
It's just a loss in the regular season.

235
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,030
It's nothing.

236
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,080
Winning and losing is a common thing, right?

237
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,080
Even though we lost this game,

238
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,960
as long as we win the next game,

239
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,150
we're still able to make it, right?

240
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,200
Really.

241
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,240
Respond to me.

242
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,150
Look at me.

243
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,200
One game is really nothing.

244
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,630
What does that say about us?

245
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,320
It's just that we'll be watching less Weibo

246
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,200
and do less live streaming.

247
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,840
Right?

248
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,150
Ming.

249
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,120
Let's put our minds at ease for a while.

250
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,600
Tomorrow we can analyze
the reasons why we lost the game.

251
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,960
The reason for the loss.

252
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,840
Before we split the blame today,

253
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,320
shouldn't we settle some other stuff?

254
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,000
Cat.

255
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,790
What's wrong?

256
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,510
I can't talk?

257
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,750
Rest early today.

258
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,790
Prepare for the game tomorrow.

259
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,880
Prepare for the game?

260
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,750
Captain.

261
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,240
That's it, right?

262
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,480
Don't you have anything

263
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,920
you have to explain to us?

264
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,680
What do you want me to say?

265
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,160
Cat, calm down.

266
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,000
Then I'll say it.

267
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,960
You've been out early and back late these days.

268
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,720
What are you doing?

269
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,440
You're distracted.

270
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,960
When Ming was talking about the tactics,

271
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,590
was your soul here though your body was here?

272
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,680
How much of the tactics have you heard?

273
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,750
And

274
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,440
what the hell happened today?

275
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,880
Why didn't you do what we had trained for

276
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,750
to take Komatsumaru?

277
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,270
Why did you take Youko?

278
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,920
Why did you change Ming's tactics?

279
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,880
We're so confused.

280
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,640
Aren't you going to say anything?

281
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,440
Don't tell me

282
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,720
you took Youko just to show off to Hierophant.

283
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,790
Before the game

284
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,550
I was in the hallway.

285
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,240
I heard you said that to Ming.

286
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,000
Cat.

287
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,750
Cheng.

288
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,880
I just need an explanation.

289
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,110
Before the race,

290
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,880
Cheng came to see me alone.

291
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,000
Ming.

292
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,680
I can't take Komatsumaru in this match.

293
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,880
Let me take Youko.

294
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,960
We don't have time now

295
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,070
to train new tactics.

296
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,350
At least you can tell me why.

297
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,350
No reason.

298
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,830
It's because I don't want to
take a shikigami for a long battle.

299
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,160
Youko can contain Hierophant in the early stage.

300
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,750
If I don't let him develop well,

301
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,720
we might be able to finish the game
as soon as possible.

302
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,830
Why do you want to finish the game
as soon as possible?

303
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,240
I thought I told you before.

304
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,200
It's a tough fight.

305
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,240
It's a long battle.

306
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,680
We need to compete in
endurance and physical strength.

307
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,310
Ming.

308
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,550
I can't fight a long battle.

309
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,510
Give me an explanation.

310
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,510
There is none.

311
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Hierophant is my corresponding opponent.

312
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,880
Before the game, Cheng told me

313
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,960
he wanted to take Youko.

314
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,000
But Cheng,

315
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,110
I need an explanation.

316
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,000
You've all got him wrong.

317
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,830
Cheng actually had a relapse of his hand injury.

318
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,550
Your hand is injured?

319
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,550
That's why Cheng wanted a quick fight.

320
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,480
Cheng.

321
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,160
Say something!

322
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,590
What did you do?

323
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,000
Why did you hurt your hand before the game?

324
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,310
Yesterday's training match was not so good.

325
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,440
Cheng played ranking overnight.

326
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,240
Played ranking overnight
just because a bad training match?

327
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,000
Captain.

328
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,030
The whole world knows

329
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,640
your hands can't take this.

330
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,510
Have you forgotten how Ming retired?

331
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,350
You felt guilty?

332
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,000
Then what had you done?

333
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,830
You thought the short training time
affected how you performed.

334
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,350
Here is the question.

335
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,200
What have you been doing all this time?

336
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,030
Cheng went to solve what happened to Tong Yao.

337
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,920
Solve what happened to Tong Yao?

338
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,750
How? How to solve it?

339
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,480
Cheng seeked a relationship in the police

340
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,310
and found out about
the background of "Momo is a big devil".

341
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,590
It turned out this person is in Shenzhen.

342
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,590
What's the result?

343
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,680
The result is

344
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,510
the same as Cheng predicted.

345
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,790
She is a specialized troublemaker.

346
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,270
She didn't commit suicide at all.

347
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,680
She's not a junior either.

348
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,270
Now she's at the police station.

349
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,000
Be prepared, Tong Yao.

350
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,790
We'll go to the police station in several days

351
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,070
and confront this girl in person.

352
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,720
I...

353
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,350
I was ready to apologize.

354
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,310
Captain.

355
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,030
Is it true that if Rui hadn't got this call,

356
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,590
you'd have planned to
hide for the rest of your life?

357
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,750
What the hell is wrong with you?

358
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,510
You didn't tell us about your hand injury.

359
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,920
You solved what happened to Tong Yao alone.

360
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,960
You didn't tell us either.

361
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,030
Are you worried that we wouldn't let you go?

362
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,480
Or are you worried that we had to
ask you to take the Komatsumaru shit

363
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,160
regardless of your hand injury?

364
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,790
Why didn't you

365
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,440
talk with us

366
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,480
about this in advance?

367
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,960
Is it you wouldn't want to talk about it

368
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,590
or you just didn't trust us,

369
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,350
didn't trust your teammates at all?

370
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,510
That's right.

371
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,960
Tong Yao is your girlfriend.

372
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,790
But have you ever thought

373
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,680
she's not just your girlfriend,

374
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,590
but also our teammate.

375
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,480
She's been wronged by the public.

376
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,240
She has been treated unfairly.

377
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,550
Would we ignore it?

378
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,110
Would we not let you go?

379
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,830
That's right.

380
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,640
We just lost

381
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,030
one game today.

382
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,000
But do you know I'm upset?

383
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,790
It's not because we lost today.

384
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,880
It's because I found out that you,
Lu Sicheng, all this time,

385
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,270
you don't trust your teammates at all.

386
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,110
If you don't need your teammates,

387
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,400
then I would like to say,

388
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,440
we don't want a captain like you at all.

389
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:42,960
Cat.

390
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,750
- Cat.
- Cat.

391
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,310
Hurry up!

392
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,960
Cat!

393
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,680
What are you doing?

394
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,960
- What are you doing
- What are you doing?

395
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,590
Cat!

396
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,750
What else can I do?

397
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,070
Let's all go home and find our own mothers.

398
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,880
You just said this because you're angry.

399
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,270
It's not like that.

400
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,920
You should know

401
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,880
I'm almost going to retire after this year.

402
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,200
If I'm not going to get
a World Championships ticket this year,

403
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,110
there is no hope for

404
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,720
my e-sports career.

405
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,440
You know what?

406
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,440
My parents don't even
agree with me playing e-sports.

407
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,310
If I don't get any accomplishment this year,

408
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,350
how am I going to face my family?

409
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,480
In this case,

410
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,480
will we be forced to withdraw again this year

411
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,550
like what we did
because of Ming's hand injury last year?

412
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,510
Are you afraid?

413
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,680
Are you afraid?

414
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,510
You're not afraid, I am.

415
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,640
Don't go, Cat.

416
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,270
Cat.

417
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,110
Cat.

418
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,790
Cat.

419
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,920
These are words out of anger.

420
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,110
No one said we'd withdraw.

421
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,640
Cheng is just having a relapse of hand injury.

422
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,480
It's not like it's broken.

423
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,160
Why do you think it's so serious?

424
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,200
I sat next to him at the game today.

425
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,400
I observed it the most clearly.

426
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,070
It was only in the late stage

427
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,480
that he slipped up a little.

428
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,790
If he didn't tell you,
you wouldn't have noticed it, would you?

429
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,440
Right?

430
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,000
So,

431
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,000
take it easy.

432
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,640
Love and peace.

433
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,510
The most important thing now
is to face it together

434
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,720
and solve the problems.

435
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,880
How can we face it together after all this?

436
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,070
Does he ever want to take us with him?

437
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,110
Cat.

438
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,510
You are playing games for yourself,

439
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,680
not for others.

440
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,030
That's what you said yourself.

441
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,790
Have you forgotten?

442
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,750
My dream

443
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,510
is to win every game

444
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,680
on the field with my bros.

445
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,070
It's not like this now.

446
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,270
That's what I want, too.

447
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,920
Yes.

448
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm also pretty mad today.

449
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,510
Cheng didn't even tell us

450
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
before he made the choice alone.

451
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,110
But if you think about it from another angle,

452
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
isn't everything he's been doing

453
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,160
for the team?

454
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,310
He's been the only one
to suffer all the pressure.

455
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,750
He is used to bear the burden himself.

456
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,510
That's why he felt

457
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,960
he must carry.

458
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,830
He doesn't trust us at all.

459
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,920
How can we work together

460
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,750
in the future?

461
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,480
Sometimes

462
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,750
I wonder

463
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,070
did we choose the wrong person from the beginning.

464
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,480
You mean Tong Yao?

465
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,680
I don't think so.

466
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,920
She proved to be very good.

467
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm not saying she's technically challenged.

468
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,030
I'm talking about

469
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,440
the effect she's had on other people.

470
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,310
The club was looking for big news before.

471
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,550
And now there's a lot of news coming on us.

472
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,720
Tong Yao does have an effect on us.

473
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,240
But I think

474
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,510
she is the one who made the whole team,

475
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,960
and Cheng

476
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,270
become better.

477
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,830
It's just that

478
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,590
they probably haven't even realized it yet.

479
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,270
Cheng.

480
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,880
Cheng.

481
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,400
Cheng, does your hand still hurt?

482
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,790
Open the door.

483
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,110
Let me apply the medicine for you.

484
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,550
Cheng.

485
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,160
Tong Yao.

486
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,750
I want to have some quiet time.

487
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,160
Okay.

488
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,750
Then open the door when you've figured it out.

489
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,110
I'll be here with you.

490
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,640
Come on, come on. Catch up.

491
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,110
- Come on.
- Destroy the turret.

492
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,790
Keep up, keep up.

493
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,920
- Break down the turret.
- Break down the turret.

494
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
- In one breath.
- Hurry up.

495
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,070
In one breath.

496
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,720
- Nice.
- Nice.

497
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,790
(Guys!)

498
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,200
(- This is a good one.)
(- Yes.)

499
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,830
Cheng.

500
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,640
When I first came to the team,

501
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,720
and officially met you,

502
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,480
you shut me out.

503
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,790
At that time, I was thinking

504
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,030
oh no.

505
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,200
The captain is so bossy.

506
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,590
What if we don't get along well in the future?

507
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,000
If I don't perform well in the future,

508
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,310
you must judge me every day.

509
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,160
Later,

510
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,440
as expected,

511
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,440
you judge me every day.

512
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,400
But I seem to be used to it

513
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,270
because what you say is right.

514
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
No matter if you call me a loser,

515
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,640
or criticize me for beating the girl.

516
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,440
The truth is

517
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,960
you are right.

518
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,680
So

519
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,030
I seem to have gotten used to it.

520
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,030
I'm used to listening to you,

521
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,310
used to relying on you,

522
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,110
thinking you can do anything.

523
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,480
You've always been the captain of ZGDX,

524
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,830
the top 3 ad in the world.

525
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,350
You're competent.

526
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,440
It's like you can solve everything

527
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,350
by yourself.

528
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,200
But

529
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,440
I still have to nag around you.

530
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,590
Although you are the captain,

531
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,070
don't be like a hen protecting her chicks,

532
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,960
protecting everyone under your wings.

533
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,160
You are a human being,

534
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,750
not a god.

535
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,200
There will always be things that you can't bear

536
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,590
or are difficult to solve.

537
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,070
You said before

538
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,680
you were afraid that you were no longer

539
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,720
the perfect man I thought you had been.

540
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,110
Actually, it's not like that.

541
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,880
Although I've seen you in cheap T-shirts,

542
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,830
without shaving and cutting your toenails.

543
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,720
You are

544
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,880
still irreplaceable

545
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,240
in my heart.

546
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,550
There is one more thing

547
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,160
I didn't tell you.

548
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,960
It's about when you made the love affair public.

549
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,510
As your girlfriend,

550
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,680
I'm really touched

551
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,550
because you ignore the judgments of the world.

552
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,110
It proves that you care about me.

553
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,790
You love me.

554
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,270
I'm really happy.

555
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,400
You know what?

556
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,240
I'm really grateful to you

557
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,680
for helping me find that girl

558
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,480
and find out the truth.

559
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,550
In fact, Rui told me in secret

560
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,310
what the club planned to do.

561
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,920
I said it's okay.

562
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,110
I have to take care of the overall situation.

563
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,510
I was ready to be scolded

564
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,960
and apologize on the internet

565
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,200
because there are always so many people telling me

566
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,750
you are a public figure.

567
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,440
When you enjoy the glory of the spotlight,

568
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,590
you have to learn to bear
the dark side behind the light

569
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
no matter how much you've been wronged,

570
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,350
how much accusations you've suffered.

571
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
But you

572
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,400
gave me a different answer.

573
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
You tell me

574
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,030
I don't have to be so aggravated

575
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,830
because you got my back.

576
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,590
Ming.

577
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,070
You know what?

578
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,550
I feel bad.

579
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,200
I feel bad.

580
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,880
I can't do anything

581
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,640
about what's going on.

582
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,830
I know.

583
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,070
I know I'm just a housekeeper.

584
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,640
Manny.

585
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,720
But I still believe,

586
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,510
I still believe that we can win the championship.

587
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,480
You know what?

588
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,310
I don't care what pressure the company puts on me.

589
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,240
And I don't care what people say about me.

590
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,200
You know what I care about?

591
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,160
I care about you guys.

592
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,110
I care about you.

593
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,830
I don't want to lose each and every one of you.

594
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,070
Do you understand?

595
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,790
Lu Sicheng.

596
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,440
If you don't pull yourself together,

597
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,440
I will blame myself so much

598
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,200
and feel so guilty.

599
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,880
If Cat is disappointed because of this

600
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,440
and left,

601
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,400
I will feel that it is my fault.

602
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,680
I don't seem to be able to

603
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,240
handle this well.

604
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,310
I easily get vulnerable.

605
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
If something really happens to the team

606
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,640
because of this.

607
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:06,720
I...

608
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,960
Will you blame me?

609
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,360
Yes.

610
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,230
I would probably go nuts.

611
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,550
And I'm a very resentful person.

612
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,400
Maybe

613
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,070
I'll hate you for the rest of my life.

614
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,400
I can imagine your face through the door.

615
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,840
I used to think

616
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,280
I could handle everything.

617
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,000
I didn't care what anyone thought.

618
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,110
Cat was right.

619
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,840
I was wrong.

620
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,510
I thought I could handle everything.

621
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,590
I was wrong.

622
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,670
I'm not fearless.

623
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,630
I can be scared too.

624
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,880
I hesitate too.

625
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,920
I guess

626
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,110
this day will come.

627
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,320
I need you.

628
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
I need you.

629
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,400
(Base, 2:00. See you there.)

630
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,580
(ZGDX Group)

631
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,460
(Best ADC Lu Sicheng)

632
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,550
About the ban in the previous game,

633
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,320
I didn't think it through to pick Youko.

634
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,070
I hadn't discussed with you

635
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,480
before I changed Ming's tactics.

636
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,360
It's my fault.

637
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,760
I'm sorry to you.

638
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,510
You don't have to indulge me like this

639
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,360
in future games.

640
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,400
If I have done something wrong,

641
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,550
just tell me.

642
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,800
I will correct it.

643
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,670
As the captain of the team,

644
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,920
it's my fault for leaving the team
without permission.

645
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,920
I just hope you can give me a little time

646
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,880
so that I can slowly learn

647
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,760
to correct my series of problems
such as assertive character,

648
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,000
team bully,

649
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,190
ego

650
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,320
and caprice.

651
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,360
The team is a whole.

652
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,550
I can't fight alone,

653
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,920
not to say do everything

654
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,150
all by myself.

655
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,800
I admit

656
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,030
I need you guys.

657
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
I hope you can accept my apology.

658
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,800
From now on,

659
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,400
I hope we can face whatever we may encounter

660
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,960
all together.

661
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,000
I will focus on the following games

662
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,320
and trainings.

663
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,000
ZGDX

664
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,590
isn't my team alone.

665
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,480
It's a team for all of us.

666
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,550
I hope we can fight to the end

667
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
with no regrets

668
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,400
and no grudge.

669
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm sorry.

670
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,800
I apologize again to you

671
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,800
for my ego and caprice.

672
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,590
Our Cheng.

673
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,230
I don't know why

674
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,360
I feel very scared now.

675
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,960
Forget it.

676
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,280
Cheng.

677
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,670
I never thought I'd see
you apologize in my lifetime.

678
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,000
My life is worth it. I have no regrets.

679
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,630
Cheng.

680
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,030
Do you want to apologize for getting me killed

681
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,710
just because you didn't cure me to save your skill

682
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,590
by the way?

683
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,230
Chubby, don't go too far.

684
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,550
Let go of Cheng. You want to strangle him?

685
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,590
He should apologize.

686
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,440
Cat, why are you acting like a statue?

687
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,760
Who woke up early in the morning,

688
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,510
saying Cheng wouldn't call you?

689
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,030
Cheng, you scared me.

690
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,480
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you.

691
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,630
I'll never yell at you again, Cheng.

692
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,880
Don't cry anymore.

693
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,510
I'm not crying.

694
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,760
You didn't cry? Then I feel at a loss.

695
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,710
My brother doesn't cry.

696
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,360
Think about it.

697
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,190
This is nice.

698
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,110
That's right.

699
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,960
A family should be in one piece.

700
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,920
No one should be left behind.

701
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,860
(Mrs. Lu)

702
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:48,920
Hello?

703
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,100
(Police Station)

704
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,960
- Hello.
- Here we are. Let's get in.

705
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,440
Let's go.

706
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:11,920
Are you nervous?

707
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,360
Don't worry, I'm here. Let's go.

708
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,940
(Mediation in accordance
with the law, fair and just.)

709
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,070
You both know the details of the matter.

710
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,920
(Peace is beautiful.)
We arranged you to meet today

711
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,510
(Peace is precious.)
to solve the problem.

712
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,110
Lin Mo

713
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,440
is the holder with the Weibo ID
of "Momo is a big devil".

714
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,920
This is her parents.

715
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:33,590
After our investigation,

716
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,320
the delivery of the razor blade

717
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,070
is indeed sent by Lin Mo.

718
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,880
Young people today

719
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:41,030
do things without caring about consequences.

720
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,070
We deal with about one or two

721
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,400
prank delivery cases like this

722
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,760
every month.

723
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,360
Have you examined the injuries here?

724
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,840
(Please take a look.)

725
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,710
Usually it ends with an amicable settlement.

726
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,840
After all, the child is young and act wild.

727
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,630
She's been scolded.

728
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,920
I think she's pretty scared too

729
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,840
and has learned a lesson.

730
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,670
She probably doesn't dare
to do so anymore in the future.

731
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,590
That's true.

732
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,280
She's young and act wild.

733
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,070
My daughter is only 18 years old.

734
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,710
She is re-enrolling this year,

735
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,800
preparing to take
the college entrance examination.

736
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,550
Yes, yes.

737
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,630
We'll teach her well when we get back.

738
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,400
We'll cover all the medical expenses.

739
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,150
It's a shame

740
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,920
to take what happened online into reality.

741
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:28,630
Right?

742
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,280
And our child

743
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,110
came crying all the way here today.

744
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,360
She was called out of her school like this.

745
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,480
When she gets back,

746
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,590
her classmates may say something bad about her.

747
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,360
And her father and I still have to go to work.

748
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,230
No reconciliation.

749
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,280
Your kid is in her early 18s.

750
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,110
My girl is only in her early 20s too.

751
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,190
If we're going to let it go

752
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:48,880
just because your kid is young and acts wild.

753
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,190
What about

754
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,480
the injuries and grievances my girl suffered?

755
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,630
She not only posted hater posts
on the Internet to spread rumors

756
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,920
but also sent a razor blade

757
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,400
and make up her misery on the internet,

758
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,590
saying she was depressed and
wanted to commit suicide out of nowhere.

759
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,190
This has brought more insult and trouble

760
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:01,710
to my girl.

761
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,150
How can we settle this?

762
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,320
So, we don't want to reconcile.

763
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,030
Apologize now!

764
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,280
I... I didn't mean it.

765
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,440
I was wrong.

766
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,630
I won't dare to do it again.

767
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,880
Please forgive me.

768
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,150
Don't be nervous.

769
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,320
It's not a controlled blade.

770
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,230
And you can only be locked up for a few days

771
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,190
for lying and spreading rumors on the Internet.

772
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,550
It's just you'd have a stained document.

773
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,480
We will educate you

774
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,030
and have you compensate for her moral damages.

775
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,030
She just messed around on the internet.

776
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,320
Is it that serious?

777
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,920
It's not so serious.

778
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:38,670
Well,

779
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,550
if I break your daughter's hand

780
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,590
before her college entrance exam,

781
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,710
is it not so serious either?

782
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:43,840
After all, you can take it next year.

783
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,070
What are you talking about?

784
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,840
We didn't mean to do it.

785
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,320
Watch out.

786
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
This is the Public Security Bureau.

787
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:51,480
No more nonsense.

788
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,920
That's right, no more nonsense.

789
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,880
I'm talking about you.

790
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,670
Our opinion is not to reconcile.

791
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:58,920
Let's go.

792
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,510
Why are you so unreasonable?

793
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,320
Why did they leave?

794
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,000
Comrade police.

795
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,710
If they don't reconcile,

796
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,230
will our kid have a stained document?

797
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,030
That's right.

798
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:12,880
Then, if there are too many such records,

799
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,840
will it affect her college entrance examination?

800
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,320
What does she mean by too many such records?

801
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,670
You feel sorry for the little girl?

802
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,150
I'm a little girl too.

803
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,670
You're the only girl in our family.

804
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,800
Detention?

805
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,510
How can she be detained?

806
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:29,800
She can't be held in custody for even a day,

807
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,150
let alone five days.

808
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,880
My child still has to go to school.

809
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,440
Last time it was fine.

810
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,110
How come she has to be detained this time?

811
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,710
It's obviously the same thing.

812
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,670
Madam,

813
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,320
how can you say that?

814
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,960
As a parent,

815
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,550
you didn't properly educate your children.

816
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,880
The first thing you think of

817
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,400
is how to avoid punishment irresponsibly
in face of a problem.

818
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:48,840
This is not the first or second time

819
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,230
she did this kind of thing.

820
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,110
Three months ago, she wrote
a threatening letter to someone,

821
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,880
just for dissing her idol.

822
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:56,510
Does that make sense?

823
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,230
No, it's just a letter.

824
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,590
What can she threaten?

825
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,230
What can she threaten?

826
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,920
You have no sense of law at all.

827
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:04,710
You're afraid that
your child will be detained.

828
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,230
Doesn't the other kid have parents?

829
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,280
Last time, they didn't hold you accountable
and let you pay for it.

830
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,190
But it doesn't mean that she is not at fault.

831
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,110
I don't think I can mediate

832
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,000
with this kind of attitude of yours.

833
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,710
Let's go through the procedure next.

834
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,590
You have worked hard.

835
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,670
We'll contact you later.

836
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,230
How can they do that?

837
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,360
No way. I don't believe it.

838
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,590
She'll be detained like this?

839
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,510
How is it?

840
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:33,800
What a surprise.

841
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,840
This little girl

842
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,800
was sued before

843
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,760
for sending threatening letters to others.

844
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,550
This time,

845
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,070
I'm afraid that she will be detained.

846
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,320
According to Article 20
of the Public Security Management Punishment Law,

847
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,280
anyone who violates public security management
in one of the following circumstances

848
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:45,400
shall take heavier penalty.

849
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,280
Those who have been previously punished

850
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,960
by public security management within six months.

851
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,030
Article 42,

852
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,440
anyone with one of the following acts

853
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:51,800
shall be punished by detention
for less than five days

854
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,320
or a fine of less than five hundred yuan.

855
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,550
Which in more serious cases,

856
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,920
shall be detained for more than five days
or less than ten days

857
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,630
with also a fine of less than 500 yuan.

858
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,360
One of them, write a threatening letter

859
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,960
or by other means

860
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,710
threaten the personal safety of others.

861
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:06,480
She has reached eighteen years old

862
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,070
with a previous conviction within six months.

863
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:09,800
Just deal with it the way it should be.

864
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,190
You memorized it from Baidu last night?

865
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:14,920
How do you know she has a previous conviction?

866
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:15,880
How would I know?

867
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,230
Then how come you memorized it so well?

868
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,510
I graduated from
the University of Political Science and Law.

869
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,480
I heard it from Lu Yue before.

870
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,190

871
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:24,920
