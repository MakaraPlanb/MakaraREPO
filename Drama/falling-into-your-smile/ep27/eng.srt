Excuse me.

37

38

You said it'll be an hour
before you get here.

67

It just happened that someone asked me
to get on and play a game.

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,190
what's going on today?

76
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,190
So fierce.

77
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,510
I broke up with Ai Jia.

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,360
Didn't you say just a while back

79
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,310
that you guys will think seriously
about the future?

80
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,000
Why did you break up?

81
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,270
Out of my league.

82
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,360
No more talking.

83
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,160
I want to go shopping.

84
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,270
Go with me. Let's go.

85
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm really done with him.

86
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,750
All he does is play games all day,

87
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,560
is a game more important than girlfriend?

88
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,040
I have been back to China
for a few months now,

89
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,870
and I finally caught a time
when he had no training.

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,310
I told him I was in a bad mood.

91
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,480
Guess what he said?

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,190
I lost the training. I'm also in a bad mood.

93
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,240
Boo-hoo.

94
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,720
I said I want to see him.

95
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,040
He said, "Okay, honey."

96
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,750
I'll turn on the camera
when I live stream tonight,

97
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
come and see me,

98
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,240
and send me some gifts while you're at it.

99
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,070
Mwah.

100
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,240
I said I'm really tired from class.

101
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,680
I'm also tired from playing games.

102
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,480
Tong Yao.

103
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,830
What? You asked me to guess.

104
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,480
I really can't bear you people

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,310
who are obsessed with games,

106
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,070
even your dates are about gaming.

107
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,360
And not just playing games,

108
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,310
he even despised my skills.

109
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,240
Please.

110
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Isn't it good for woman to be cute?

111
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
If there's a creature

112
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,390
that's cute

113
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,070
and can play games well,

114
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,190
then what's the point of
having e-sports youth like you guys?

115
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,560
I told you not to say yes

116
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,870
to that professional e-sports boy.

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,240
As the saying goes,

118
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,310
There's no such thing
as falling in love in e-sports.

119
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,750
There's no such thing
as falling in love in e-sports.

120
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,950
Isn't your ex-boyfriend, Jian Yang,

121
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,560
also a professional e-sports player?

122
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,800
That's because I was young and frivolous.

123
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,160
That's the past.

124
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,430
Don't mention it.

125
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,800
Anyway, I'm serious this time.

126
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,870
I've spent three years
to complete my master's

127
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,390
abroad and came back.

128
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,310
Ai Jia still looks like a teenager
with internet addiction.

129
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,310
If only I knew earlier,

130
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,120
I might as well stay abroad
and not come back.

131
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,070
Tong Yao.

132
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,510

Oh my God.

138

Someone's asking me
to play e-sports professionally.

139
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,160
That's really damned.

(Hi, friend, you want to come to play OPL?)

141
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,430
That has to be a liar, right?

142
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,360
But why would he lie to me about this?

143
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,480
Who knows?

144

I've seen Lu Sicheng in pajamas.

170
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,840
The point is,
why doesn't the liar type Chinese?

171
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,840
May be his phone broke
and he can't type Chinese.

00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,000
He asked me to play professional e-sports.

184
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a very famous team.

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,390
I also received a call today

186
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
saying that I won a Rolls Royce

187
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,840
by buying fish in the supermarket.

188
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,360
The 2020 Onmyoji Arena Pro League

189
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,200
Spring Final

190
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,630
will launch in Shanghai in recent days.

191
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,000
(Live Onmyoji Arena)
The two teams participating in the duel

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,600
are ZGDX and CK.

193
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,910
This grand game is expected

194
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,480
to attract thousands of people.

195
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,440
Actually, being a professional player

196
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,480
and winning the championship on stage

197
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,080
seems to be a pretty cool thing.

198
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,750
I don't think being cool
is a factor to consider

199
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,960
when choosing a career.

200
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,720
You've graduated,

201
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,630
you're going to work soon,

202
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,840
and you're still all about games.

203
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,600
Mom.

204
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,630
You're so naïve.

205
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,670
Talking about hiring you
to play professionally.

206
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,670
Did you wash your hands?
If not why did you start eating already?

207
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,840
Give it to me.

208
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,910
Look at you.

209
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,870
You are a girl.

210
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,200
Touching the keyboard all day long
and you reach for the food.

211
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,000
If you don't think that's dirty, I do.

212
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,840
Give me a hand.

213
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,870
Food's ready, Tong.

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Coming.

215
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,120
Nice food today.

216
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,870
Mom,

217
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,480
what if someone was really
looking for me to play professionally?

218
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,150
So I worked so hard

219
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,320
to pay for your degree from a key university,

220
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
so that you can go play games
after you graduate?

221
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,000
If you're so free,

222
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,360
I'll just work harder

223
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,080
and pay for your tuition
until you get to post-doc.

224
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,460
((Onmyoji Arena))

225

(Skill 2: Fox Fire)

227
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,960
What should I do?

228
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,720
Why aren't you responding?

229
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,150
Biscuit, do you think I should go?

230
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,660
(Amao's Mom)

231
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,960
(How's it? Did you tell them?)

232
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,390
(Did auntie tear you into pieces?)

233
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,120
(Didn't turn out so well.)

234
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,870
(Don't get discouraged.)

235
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
(I'm surprised that you are still alive now.)

236
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,870
(You're still thinking about it, too, right?)

237
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,840
(What if we head to Shanghai
to watch the game first?)

238
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,200
(Didn't you say)

239
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,240

about professional gaming first?)

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,910
(Shanghai has Lu Sicheng, in real person.)

241
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,670
...has achieved very impressive results.

242
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,780
(Live (Onmyoji Arena))
It is worth noting that

243
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,720
professional e-sports that
young people are paying attention to

244
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,030
may also become a sports competition

245
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,440
that will walk on the world stage
in the future.

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,080

255
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,600
Yep, I am the one who contacted you.

257
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,440
Hi, Mr. Rui.

258
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,200
No don't be silly, that's not our style.

259
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,120
Just call me Rui.

260
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,360
Here, a room card for you.

261
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
Thank you.

262
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,750
By the way,

263
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,870
Cheng and the others,
do they live here too?

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,550
Yeah,

265
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,750
but they are not here now.

266
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,840
They went out for a training match.

267
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,480
You want to meet them?

268
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,080
No, no, no. Not at all.

269
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,000
Why?

270
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,910
Trainees who used to come to our base

271
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,600
were eager wait to see Cheng
and the others right away.

272
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,080
I want to see them, too.

273
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,440
But I didn't wash my hair today.

274
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,550
It's here! Here!

275
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,200
Let's go!

276
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,030
Cheng!

277
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,270
Here he comes, Lu Sicheng.

278
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,270
Cheng!

279
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,080
This is like a tour.

280
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,320
Don't know where the media

281
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,480
got the news that

282
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,600
Ming is retiring.

283
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,240
So they've been acting crazy these two days

284
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,270
and want to capture headlines.

285
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,960
Ming is retiring?

286
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,510
Because of his hand injury?

287
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,240
Oh my God, but that's Ming.

288
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,670
That's why we need you, Tong Yao.

289
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,150
How is it? Have you considered it?

290
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,440
Do you want to join us at ZGDX?

291
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,600
It's okay, take your time to think.

292
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,480
Answer in no hurry.

293
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,200
But you have to know,

294
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,240
if you join us,

295
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320

Cheng,

351
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,550
I'm feeling a bit nervous
with you looking at me like this.

352
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
I bought only one bucket of water.

353
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,480
How about I go and get another one in a bit?

354
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,550
There's only one bucket of water left
in the supermarket.

355
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,790
I saw a dwarf hiding it in the top shelf

356

with my own eyes.

357
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,200
Do all dwarves in the world

358
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,750
think that it's safe to hide somewhere high?

359
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,510
I can see with my chin,

360
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,510
and it's so dumb that
even I feel embarrassed for her.

361
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,680
How is there a water thief in a supermarket?

362
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,310
I literally hid it in the back of the shelf,

363
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
and still got found out!

364
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,400
I'm so mad!

365
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,590
It's okay.

366
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,590
You've died about 800 times
already from anger just now.

367
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,030
Let me ask you,

368
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,680
are you staying in the same hotel

369
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,640
with Lu Sicheng?

370
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,590
Yeah.

371
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,790
That's good.

372
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,240
Why?

373
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,270
You need to raid Lu Sicheng.

374
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,640
I don't think that's a good idea.

375
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,750
Think about Ai Jia, at least a little bit.

376
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,310
I'm not happy to hear that.

377
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,270
Why should I consider the feelings of my ex?

378
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,720
A woman's heart is the most poisonous.

379
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,270
How about you just sign the contract?

380
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,400
You happen to be good at the middle position.

381
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,480
The thought of you

382
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,790
beating up Ai Jia

383
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,590
when you are in a game

384
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,590
makes me bubble in happiness.

385
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
But you said

386
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,440
e-sports took away both your boyfriend

387
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,750
and your girlfriend.

388
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,830
Correct.

389
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,640
I must have had a grudge
against e-sports in my last life.

390
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,510
First my boyfriend, then my girlfriend.

391
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,510
Alright, alright.

392
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,680
You've said this many times.

393
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,750
Anyway, once you're done beating Ai Jia,

394
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,750
the two of you can go
on my blacklist together.

395
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,640
Sounds about right.

Why are there so many girls?

426
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,110
You'd think that an idol
is having a concert here.

427
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,720
I'm so annoyed with these girl fans.

428
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,750
They can't even understand the game,

429
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,830
but they have to mess around with the fun.

430
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,750
What's the point?

431
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,030
Look at those girls over there,

432
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,000
I don't even think
they recognize all the shikigamis.

What are you talking about?

434
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,270
Oh, you're the best
because you know how to play games?

435
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,550
So you're saying those
who don't know how to play

436
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,200
don't deserve to come and watch the game?

437
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,270
Yes, everyone is here to watch the game,

Why are you being so rude?

440

How do you know that
they don't even recognize all the shikigamis?

441
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,920
Maybe you've been torn in the game

442
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,310
by a girl before.

443
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,750
That's right, maybe you can't even beat me.

That's not we meant.

445

It just there aren't many girls
who can play the game well.

446

Yeah, we didn't mean that.

the time when these girls

477
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,270
sent your boyfriend a big sword as a gift

00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,960
We won't let you down.

547
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,270
CK! Yang! Yang!

548
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,270
Next,

549
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,030
let's do an interview with Captain Cheng.

550
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,400
As the captain of ZGDX,

551
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,240
before the game,

552
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,310
do you have anything to say with your team?

553
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,350
Do your best.

554
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,350
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

555
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,400
Our Cheng is really too profound.

556
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,440
Our competition is about to begin,

557
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,830
let us look forward to
their wonderful performance.

558
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,640
Fight on!

559
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,070
Fight on!

560
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,510
Alright.

561
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,680
To all at the venue
and in front of the screen,

562
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,960
greetings!

563
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,750
We're now live at

564
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
the 2020 Onmyoji Arena Pro League
Spring Final!

565
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,790
I am Dudou, someone who's been narrating
the games this entire spring,

566
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,440
and has yet to become popular.

567
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,240
I am today's commentator, Fan.

568
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,240
Let's take a look.

569
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,400
Our players

570
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,590
have entered the competition area.

571
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,270
That's right.

572
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,400
Fan, take a bold guess,

573
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,200
CK vs. ZGDX,

574
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,400
who's going to win?

575
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,750
Well from what we're looking at now,

576
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,550
these two teams

577
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,310
are very different in the ways they play.

578
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,550
Although they are both classic teams,

579
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,030
but they have different styles.

580
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,720
I'm guessing CK.

581
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,510
Okay. CK.

582
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,200
But I don't think so, actually.

583
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,070
Because ZGDX is now ranked first in points.

584
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,310
I think they have a good chance of winning.

585
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,510
Let's just wait and see.

586
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,110
Just wait and see.

587
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,270
Ok, then next up,

588
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,000
let's give the time to the audience.

589
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,070
Let's take a look at the lucky ones
who got picked by the director today.

590
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,750
Who would it be?

591
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,510
Let's see!

592
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,480
Kiss! Kiss!

593
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,550
That was PDA!

594
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,640
Too much!

595
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,830
Come on, Director, let's continue!

596
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Come on, keep going.

597
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,920
We got two ladies this time.

598
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,960
Look at the screen.

599
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,310
The director is quite something.

600
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,030
Is the director doing this for himself?

601
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,830
The girls present are very beautiful.

602
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,400
They'll blush
when the director gets to them.

603
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
What is it, Yang?

604
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,030
Sorry. Sorry.

605
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,590
Your water splashed on my keyboard.

606
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,830
Why did she come to Shanghai?

607
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,790
Who?

608
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,310
My ancestor.

609
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,110
Ancestor?

610
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,510
That's awesome.

611
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,110
Your ancestor will give you luck
and help you win!

612
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,200
The ancestor who's here to collect my debt,

613
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,920
and prays that
I'd get my legs and arms torn apart.

614
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,030
Really?

615
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,110
Ex-girlfriend?

616
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,350
Okay, the game officially starts.

617
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,240
First, we've arrived at the BP sector.

618
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,200
To be friendly to

619
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,310
our new players,

620
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
we'll briefly introduce

621
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,240
the meaning of ban pick.

622
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,920
It means to select shikigamis and ban them.

623
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,200
Coach, this version of Yamakaze
is very strong.

624
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,110
Let's disable it.

625
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,830
Yamakaze banned.

626
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,790
ZGDX chooses to ban

627
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,480
the strong version Yamakaze.

628
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,640
Ban K's Kosodenote.

629
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,030
It's too stable
to choose this in the beginning.

630
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,550
Okay.

631
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,510
Ban Miketsu.

632
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,440
Bye bye.

633
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,880
Ban Enma.

634
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,400
(The latter two teams have banned)

635
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,880
(Kosodenote, Miketsu, and Enma.)

636
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,830
CK will probably ban Aobouzu.

637
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,310
Let's ban Satori.

638
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,400
Perfect.

639
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,070
Give the last ban position to a Aobouzu.

640
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,720
Okay.

641
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,830
Okay.

642
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,000
Now that the two sides
have entered the pick section,

643
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,680
Cat, choose Menreiki for Ming.

644
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,000
Got it.

645
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,590
They've chosen the strong version

646
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,480
Menreiki.

647
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,310
Next up, CK

648
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,590
will probably choose a shikigami

649
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,310
that targets Menreiki.

650
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,830
Well to face someone
with weaker clearance ability in the early stage

651
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,830
like Menreiki,

652
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,510
I'd choose Tamamo-no-Mae.

653
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,110
Yang,

654
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,000
choose Tamamo-no-Mae.

655
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,440
(Yes, I've seen her games)

656
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,960
(and witnessed her mind-blowing operations.)

657
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,510
(Really powerful)

658
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,550
(and full of spirits.)

659
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,110
(Right?)

660
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,110
(If you didn't target her in the early stage,)

661
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,750
(and allow her to develop,)

662
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,350
Yang.

663
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,160
Yang!

664
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,270
What are you thinking about? Lock it.

665
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,720
(Why is Yang hesitating?)

666
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
(Haven't locked it yet.)

667
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,160
(Choose Tamamo-no-Mae.)

668
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,960
Tamamo-no-Mae, Tamamo-no-Mae.

669
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,790
Tamamo-no-Mae, Tamamo-no-Mae.

670
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
(Selecting)

671
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,720
My God, what happened?

672
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Yang ended up picking Ootengu!

673
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,110
It seems like his hand trembled.

674
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,350
Jesus. What did you get me?

675
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,510
What're you doing?

676
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,550
It's over, all gone. Can't understand it.

677
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,550
You really made a wish before you came.

678
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,790
OK, OK, everyone calm down,
and do your best.

679
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,720
What's going on there
with Ootengu, Ming?

680
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,480
I don't get it.

681
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,070
Maybe it is to increase the difficulty
of the game by taking a step back.

682
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,400
Maybe his hand trembled
and clicked it by mistake.

683
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,240
Shut up.

684
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,160
It's starting.

685
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,920
Fight on! Fight on!

686
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,830
Come on, fight on! Fight on!

687
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,350
Steady down the bottom lane.

688
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,830
Don't come over.

689
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,830
Yang, squat in the grass for me.

690
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,270
Okay, coming.

691
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,310
(Yang! Yang! Yang!)

692
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,000
(Hua is deliberately
sending damage under Ming.)

693
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,400
Yang, what are you doing?

694
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,880
It's okay, don't panic.

695
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,960
Yang, stay.

696
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,030
Go.

697
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm coming.

698
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,790
(But Ming of ZGDX used the skill.)

699
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,480
(After a series of acts by K, Jian Yang died.)

700
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,350
(Congratulations.)

701
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,270
Cool. Beautiful.

702
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,400
- Beautiful!
- Ming, awesome!

703
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,510
(But we don't know
what's going on with Jian Yang,)

704
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,920
(he seems completely out of state.)

705
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,030
(Yang, what are you doing?)

706
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,680
(Okay, Yang is also resurrected again)

707
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,720
(and arrived at his jungle.)

708
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,510
(Not knowing that
K and Cat are squatting on him,)

709
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,750
(the two rushed out,)

710
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,030
(and with a set of perfect coordinated moves
they attacked Yang once again.)

711
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,440
(We can see)

712
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,750
(there's very tacit understanding.)

713
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,110
(At the same time,
Yang is being a little careless.)

714
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,720
(K attacks again and with
this wave of strong kill, Yang died again.)

715
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,200
(Rise to Prominence)
(Yang was caught and killed again.)

716
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,720
(Yang is really not in the mood today.)

717
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,400
What's up with Jian Yang today?

718
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,110
Probably a cramp in the hands.

719
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,270
Zero kills, eight deaths, and two assists.

720
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,240
This data is suffocating.

721
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,480
Yang, please don't give any more lives away.

722
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,240
Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.

723
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,270
Take a big snake after this wave.

724
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,400
We can take it back.

725
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,750
Let's go for a snake group fight.

726
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,270
- Got it.
- Got it.

727
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,160
K, get ready to yield.

728
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,110
Coming.

729
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,310
They're taking snakes,
shall we harass them?

730
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,030
Yang.

731
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,480
Yang, wait for us, Yang!

732
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,830
(Jian Yang marked Lu Sicheng with a skill,)

733
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,550
(but it was avoided by Lu Sicheng.)

734
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,880
(Is he going to do one vs. three?)

735
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,880
(Yang gets killed once again.)

736
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,310
(Yang's operation is too impulsive.)

737
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,200
Chubby, follow me.

738
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Cat and K, get prepares to wrap the back.

739
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,960
(Legendary)
Okay. Roger that.

740
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,200
Come, retreat!

741
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,270
- Shooter, shooter retreat.
- Can't do it!

742
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,350
(Seal · Double Kill)
(Cheng is on fire!)

743
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,720
(Killed Jian Yang and got)

744
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,030
(the lives of Butterfly and Good Luck.)

745
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,790
(Chubby slowed down Wang and Hua.)

746
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,920
(K hits Hua.)

747
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,680
(Goes big next on second skill, beautiful.)

748
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,590
(Hua got killed.)

749
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,400
(They still want to go.)

750
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,000
(Let's see how they'll choose.)

751
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,680
(Yeah.)

752
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,400
(Looks fierce,
seems like another wave is coming.)

753
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,680
A wave to push it up.

754
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,270
The last wave is coming.

755
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,030
Head up, head up!

756
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,270
(Line approaches.)

757
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,960
(Breaks into middle lane base turret.)

758
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,070
(The other party is still resurrecting.)

759
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
(Can this be the wave?)

760
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,480
(Nice!)

761
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,060
(Victory)

762
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,550
(Congratulations to ZGDX
for winning the first game!)

763
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,070
ZGDX is awesome!

764
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,440
Good.

765
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,110
Let's go.

766
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,840
Thank you, Yang.

767
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,800
What's up with you?

768
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,960
Go.

769
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,880
- What's up today with Captain?
- Yang.

770
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,880
What's up with him?

771
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,840
I don't know.

772
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,000
What's wrong?

773
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,590
Really made no progress.

774
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,000
His ex-girlfriend came to watch the game,

775
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,280
must be really stressed.

776
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,670
Well,

777
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,400
do you think there are any tricks behind

778
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,760
your invitation to the game by ZGDX?

779
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,920
Go away!

780
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,030
Put away your weird conspiracy theories.

781
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,760
Hold this for me.

782
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm going to the bathroom.

783
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,670
To the bathroom?

784
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Bad kidney.

785
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,630
Thank you, Yang.

786
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,440
Sign for me.

787
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,190
Tong Yao!

788
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Sorry. Sorry.

789
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,440
Why did he leave?

790
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:49,960
Yang.

791
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,230
- Who's that girl?
- Tong Yao.

792
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,670
What a coincidence.

793
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,150
Why did you come to Shanghai?

794
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,230
Did you come to see me play the game?

795
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
For you?

796
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,630
I saw you just now,

797
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,510
so I thought you would
definitely come to the bathroom.

798
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,590
So I waited for you here.

799
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,280
Anything you need?

800
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,000
Not really.

801
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,000
Just want to see

802
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,150
how you've been lately.

803
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,000
Pretty good.

804
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,190
You're still mad at me.

805
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,630
I really didn't mean to not call you.

806
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,670
Our phones were put away

807
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,920
during training.

808
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,920
They were all placed with the coach.

809
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,110
Jian Yang, I'm really not mad at you.

810
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,230
I just want to tell you calmly

811
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,590
that we're over.

812
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,070
You don't need to explain this to me.

813
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,760
No, Yao.

814
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,590
Stop, don't.

815
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,800
Don't call me that.

816
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,070
Sounds weird.

817
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,000
Anything else?

818
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,760
If not, I'm leaving.

819
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,880
Tong Yao,

820
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,550
for a girl like you,

821
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,000
if you didn't come here
to see me play the game,

822
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,230
what else would you be here for?

823
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,480
Although I don't need to
explain to you either,

824
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,920
I'll still tell you.

825
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,880
I came because

826
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,030
ZGDX is asking me to play professionally.

827
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,150
Don't be kidding me.

828
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,960
How can a girl like you
play professionally with us?

829
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,400
Jian Yang, why are you still so silly?

830
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,400
Why can't girls play professionally?

831
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,400
Your absurd operation just now

832
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,190
was shameful enough.

833
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,670
How do you get the guts to belittle me?

834
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,800
(Mannendake!)

835
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,880
(Yang ended up choosing)

836
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,280
(the shikigami he's best at, Mannendake.)

837
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,760
Why did Yang

838
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,880
decide to choose Mannendake

839
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,920
when it's weaker in this version?

840
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,510
Well, because this shikigami, Mannendake,

841
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,590
truly requires

842
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,840
- precise operation and timing.
- Right.

843
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,320
If you can't seize advantage
in the early stage,

844
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,880
it'll be difficult to besiege

845
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,110
the opponent's core position later on.

846
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,150
If ZGDX doesn't establish an advantage
in the early stage of the game,

847
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,630
it'll be hard for it to catch up later on.

848
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,030
- Go!
- Go go go!

849
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,000
Don't just push forward.

850
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,590
Ban it. Ban it.

851
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,510
Retreat, retreat!

852
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,230
Come on, keep up.

853
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,320
The opposing jungle
is working on the top lane Kirin.

854
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,590
Watch out, Ming and Cat.

855
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,710
Okay. I got it.

856
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,360
I'm going to squat.
You guys watch out for a chance.

857
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,920
(Was that a slip due to Ming's hand injury?)

858
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,360
K, Yang is not in his own jungle area.

859
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,320
You need to watch out.

860
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,000
Okay.

861
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,550
(Is the best part coming up?)

862
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,440
The bottom lane Kirin has been robbed.

863
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,920
(Here we go.)

864
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,150
(Yang with the Kirin is leading by a little.)

865
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,670
(Nice shot. First blood.)

866
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,070
(Yang took out K.)

867
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,920
K, hang on.

868
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,760
Let's stall for time to develop ourselves.

869
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,880
(Let's see what Yang is doing at this point.)

870
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,880
(He showed his spot.)

871
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,630
Ming, lean to the left.

872
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,960
Jian Yang is in the grass to your right.

873
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,480
Looks like Yang's about to
get something going.

874
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,670
Hua, go up to seduce Ming.

875
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,400
Okay, okay.

876
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,630
(Hua is seducing.)

877
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,320
Yang is using his ultimate skill.

878
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,920
Hua, attack!

879
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,670
Copy that.

880
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,620
(Sacrifice)

881
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,230
(No, why is Cheng in the middle lane?)

882
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,760
(That's odd.)

883
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,510
(Nice! That's my boy.)

884
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,320
(That was too awesome.
He was able to dodge 80% of the skills)

885
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,110
(in a one-on-two situation.)

886
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,550
Why didn't you tell me that
Cheng came to the middle lane?

887
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,190
Your account was banned?

888
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,230
I saw Chubby on the line.

889
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,400
I thought Cheng had gone home.

890
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,480
(After gaining some advantages,)

891
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,590
(the other side chooses to advance.)

892
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,630
(The game has reached the middle stage.)

893
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,440
(The longer it stalls the less ideal
it will for CK.)

894
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,280
Cheng, I'll go steal a monster.

895
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,360
- Go.
(- CK will not be able to beat ZGDX)

896
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,030
(without a surprise move.)

897
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,960
(K over there seems to have a new move.)

898
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,510
(The direction of the monster.)

899
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,550
That was a nice containment by K.

900
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,960
K is going to hit the monster.

901
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,840
(Should we fight or grab the monster?)

902
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,880
Yang, make a decision.

903
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,800
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

904
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,710
Grab the monster.

905
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,360
(CK didn't attack the base by force.)

906
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,230
(Killed off monster)
(They're going back for the monster instead.)

907
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,550
K, surround them.

908
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,030
Coming.

909
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,630
Make it quick!

910
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,480
Yang, they're catching up.

911
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,110
Are we on?

912
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,440
Prepare for a counter-kill.

913
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,400
(Yang has showed his ultimate skill.)

914
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,230
(Get ready to start the teamfight.)

915
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,070
Kill Ming first.

916
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,920
Ming, watch out.

917
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,480
(Legendary)
(Quickly cut into the enemy lineup.)

918
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
(Ming got killed.)

919
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,670
(Ming was a second too slow.)

920
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,920
Stretch the battle line.

921
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,440
Find your position.

922
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,960
I got ultimate.

923
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,800
(Yang and the others are killing like crazy.)

924
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,030
(Cat was also killed by Butterfly.)

925
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,150
(Unremitting assistance)
(If the shield guard can be released in advance,)

926
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,800
(they can withstand the damage.)

927
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,880
(Now ZGDX is in danger.)

928
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,150
(Seal · Double Kill, Assist)
(Yang's first skill is followed by his second skill.)

929
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:46,880
(A normal attack.)

930
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,070
(Triple Kill.)

931
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,630
(ZGDX got destroyed.)

932
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,800
(Okay, we can see that CK)

933
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,590
(has entered ZGDX's base,)

934
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,760
(taking time to demolish the base.)

935
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,840
(ZGDX has no chance anymore.)

936
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,400
(Congratulations to CK
for winning the second game.)

937
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,880
(Victory)
The score is tied at one to one.

938
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,360
(Nice.)

939
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,710
Nice. Nice.

940
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,800
We won.

941
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,030
♪All the panic started because of you♪

942
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,800
♪Lost in your beauty♪

943
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,400
Come on, come on.

944
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,000
Nice, nice.

945
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,440
♪I can go back trapped♪

946
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,360
(Okay, the third game now begins.)

947
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,110
(Yang has focused on Ming.)

948
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,150
(He's either catching him)

949
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,550
(or on the way to catch him.)

950
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,710
Cat, K, come and help me.

951
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,400
Coming.

952
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,820
(Defense tower requires support)

953
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,320
Cat and K.

954
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,150
Come on, up.

955
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,960
Watch out. Watch out.

956
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,710
Move back, move back.

957
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,110
(It's a fight. Hua is targeting Ming again.)

958
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,070
K turned around and blocked for Ming.

959
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,030
Yes, this is a good spot.

960
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,760
Yes, yes.

961
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,150
(Ming has killed Hua.)

962
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,000
(Oh my God, that was great coordination.)

963
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,230
Hit the snake now!

964
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:41,880
Right. Come on.

965
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,920
Let's fight.

966
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,110
(What a surprise.)

967
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,670
(Ming remains calm in this round.)

968
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,440
Let's team up on the big snake together.

969
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,400
Chubby, come with me.

970
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,070
Copy that.

971
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,320
(ZGDX is taking advantage of)

972
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,510
(to hit the big snake.)

973
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,000
(If they take the big snake,)

974
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,630
(I think they'll be)

975
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,510
(the champion of this Spring Final.)

976
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,150
Taking the big snake.

977
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,880
Yang, you going? Yang.

978
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,670
I'll go, I'll go.

979
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,150
Let's go.

980
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,840
Together.

981
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,800
Chubby, protect Ming.

982
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,480
Stand on his left.

983
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,320
All right.

984
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,280
(Go ZGDX. Go ZGDX.)

985
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,320
(The rest of CK's players
are also moving towards the snake pit.)

986
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,550
(They're gone.)

987
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,280
Watch the grass.

988
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,070
Go, go. Hit it.

989
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,400
(They have a chance.)

990
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
(Nice. Yang successfully reclaimed the snake.)

991
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,510
That was nice.

992
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,110
(Cool.)

993
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,150
(They took back the game.)

994
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,110
Good luck. Make a team fight.

995
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,000
Stretch the battle line.

996
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,190
They got the big snake, move back.

997
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,320
I'll take it, you guys retreat.

998
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,590
(A team fight broke out
after the snake is reclaimed.)

999
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,920
(ZGDX doesn't want to fight.)

1000
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,840
Wang, protect the shooter.

1001
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,550
Okay.

1002
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,710
(The two sides swap skills.)

1003
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Come on, let's go.

1004
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,480
Coming.

1005
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,960
(Ming unexpectedly made a mistake just now.)

1006
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,960
(Did he have a relapse of his hand injury?)

1007
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,000
(Good luck's Kuro Douji)

1008
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,510
(is slowly moving forward to find a position.)

1009
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,280
(Chubby backhanded Kuro Douji.)

1010
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,320
Hold on. No one panic.

1011
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,760
Butterfly, watch your position.

1012
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,230
Got it.

1013
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,000
(If I'm right,)

1014
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,670
(K's ultimate skill is not ready yet.)

1015
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,110
(The command is a bit risky.)

1016
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,590
Hua, join the fight. Quick!

1017
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,150
Okay.

1018
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,360
(Lu Sicheng went big as well,)

1019
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,400
(kill off Wang and Butterfly.)

1020
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,710
(Double Kill.)

1021
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,230
(So now we've only got
Jian Yang and Lu Sicheng left on the field.)

1022
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,840
(Let's see how this will work out.)

1023
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
(Seal · Triple Kill, Assist)

1024
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,440
(Jan Yang killed Lu Sicheng.)

1025
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,280
(ZGDX has been aced.)

1026
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,960
(Ultra Kill for Jian Yang. Oh my God.)

1027
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,150
(What a pity.)

1028
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,360
(CK is pushing up to the front
of the base in one go.)

1029
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,960
(ZGDX can't make a comeback.)

1030
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,840
(Okay, we see that)

1031
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,190
(Ming is coming back to life.)

1032
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,800
(Does ZGDX still have a chance?)

1033
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,710
One last go.

1034
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,150
(Ming's Higanbana came back to life.)

1035
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,280
(No chance.)

1036
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,840
(Congratulations to CK.)

1037
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,400
(Nice.)

1038
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,760
Champion, champion, champion.

1039
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,000
Yang, Yang, Yang.
Champion, champion, champion.

1040
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,400
Champion, champion, champion.

1041
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:55,880
CK, Champion. CK, Champion. CK, Champion.

1042
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:56,960
Are you okay?

1043
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,400
I dragged you guys down.

1044
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,840
What nonsense is that?

1045
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:41,480
CK. CK. CK.

1046
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,000
Let's go.

1047
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:12,880
Ming is back.

1048
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,670
What's wrong?

1049
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,590
Why is he back?

1050
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,400
What's up?

1051
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,070
Let's sit.

1052
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,800
Today,

1053
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,630
I have to apologize to you.

1054
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,510
Some of you may already know.

1055
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,590
I

1056
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,630
finally decided to

1057
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,150
say goodbye to this stage for the time being.

1058
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,840
A few years ago,

1059
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:41,920
I was just

1060
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,110
a newcomer in the professional team.

1061
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,710
Yes.

1062
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,070
When I was the same age as you.

1063
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
At that time, to most people,

1064
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,510
playing e-sports

1065
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,320
was not a proper job,

1066
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,630
and it had no future.

1067
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,800
Of course,

1068
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,840
my family thought the same.

1069
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,280
They asked me,

1070
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,440
what's e-sports?

1071
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,150
Is there a future for e-sports?

1072
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,030
I really didn't know how to answer it

1073
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,230
at that time.

1074
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,280
But I didn't want to give in

1075
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
when I saw the looks on their face.

1076
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,590
My heart told me

1077
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,150
that this was my dream.

1078
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,510
Professional e-sports

1079
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,320
will definitely have a promising future.

1080
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,030
So,

1081
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,480
I fought with my family,

1082
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,840
gave them the silent treatment.

1083
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,550
I even left without saying goodbye.

1084
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,510
I got on a train to Shenzhen,

1085
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,400
came to ZGDX,

1086
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,670
and became a professional e-sports player.

1087
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,760
In this time of struggle,

1088
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,840
I've fallen down

1089
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,400
and got back up

1090
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,030
with Lu Sicheng,

1091
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,960
Cat, K and Chubby in our team.

1092
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,590
I've also defined and oriented myself

1093
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,000
through these honors and setbacks

1094
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:53,150
in my life.

1095
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,150
Unfortunately,

1096
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,400
I have to put my dream down

1097
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,030
today.

1098
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,030
The reality of losing today's game

1099
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,480
meant that it's time for me

1100
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,110
to let go of the persistent

1101
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,230
that may have only touched myself,

1102
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,880
and to give way to the young generation.

1103
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,670
Although I can't make it,

1104
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:18,960
I know that

1105
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,920
as long as the dream lives on,

1106
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,440
there will always be someone

1107
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,960
to take my place on this stage

1108
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,590
and go on the path carrying my dream.

1109
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,760
I hope that this person

1110
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,480
can make a decision soon.

1111
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,150
I hope that one day,

1112
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,590
when ZGDX

1113
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,400
gets the trophy,

1114
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,960
I'm still here.

1115
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,630
You guys,

1116
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,880
as well.

1117
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:50,960
Now.

1118
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:52,920

1121
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,590
officially register to retire

1122
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,480
after this Spring Final.

1123
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,230
Fight on, Ming!

1124
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,150
Fight on, Ming!

1125
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,280
Ming, we will always stand by you!

1126
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,360
Fight on, Ming!

1127
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:42,630
Fight on, Ming!

1128

(The Dream Never Dies)

1136
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,030
- I'm sorry.
- Take a look.

1137
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,880
- I'm sorry, not now.
- Sign for me.

1138
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,840
Sign for me, too. Yang.

1139
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,760
- Tong Yao.
- Yang.

1140
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,710
Excuse me.

1141
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,670
I'll wait for you at the door.

1142
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,440
Call me if you need anything.

1143
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,150
I really care about you.

1144
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,440
That's why I said
those things to you just now.

1145
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,590
Why did you join ZGDX?

1146
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,840
Who is this girl?

1147
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,280
Why is Yang talking to her?

1148
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,480
She's not pretty, either.

1149
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,360
I know right?

1150
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,710
Who are you?

1151
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,480
Why is she so close to Yang?

1152
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,070
I know.

1153
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,630
Let's go.

1154
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,670
Let go of me.

1155
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:06,510
Are you serious?

1156
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:07,880
Did you really sign with ZGDX?

1157
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:08,760
Yes, I did.

1158
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,110
It should have been announced
officially by now.

1159
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,840
I thought you didn't want me
to be a professional player.

1160
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,150
Then why did you come to be one yourself?

1161
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,230
Because I want to.

1162
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,150
What does it have to do with you?

1163
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,000
It doesn't.

1164
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,920
I was just curious about

1165
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,550
why you didn't tell me
you were going to be a professional player.

1166
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,800
Isn't it better for you to join our team

1167
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,320
than ZGDX?

1168
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,630
Why should I tell it to you?

1169
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,710
And why should I join your team?

1170
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,150
Because I'm there.

1171
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,400
One more time,

1172
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,670
who are you?

1173
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,630
I taught you how to play.

1174
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,670
I was the one who downloaded the app

1175
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,590
in your computer.

1176
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:35,550
If you want to be a professional,

1177
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,360
you should come to my team.

1178
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,920
Come on, how many times have I told you?

1179
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,920
It has nothing to do with you.

1180
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,800
You always remind me that
you taught me how to play.

1181
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,400
What? You want to get some tuition?

1182
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,230
Tong Yao.

1183
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,800
You want to piss me off, don't you?

1184
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,630
Jian Yang.

1185
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,920
You should just focus on your career.

1186
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,800
Look how you got yourself killed

1187
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,440
on three roads in the first game.

1188
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,920
It's so embarrassing.

1189
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,280
What's wrong with that?

1190
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,320
If you had told me earlier
that you joined them,

1191
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,630
I could've continued doing that
in the second and third game.

1192
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,710
Consider it a gift for you.

1193
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,760
How nice would it be
to give your future boss a championship?

1194
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,030
We don't need you

1195
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,280
to give us the championship.

1196
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,030
We can get it ourselves.

1197
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,190
Yao.

1198
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,670
Let's talk, okay?

1199
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:14,150
Did you join ZGDX to piss me off?

1200
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,000
How many times have I told you?

1201
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,070
It's my dream to
play e-sports professionally.

1202
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,590
It has nothing to do with you.

1203
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,150
Okay.

1204
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,440
In that case,

1205
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,800
I won't show you any mercy

1206
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,320
on the battlefield in the future.

1207
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,480
Okay, I'll see you there.

1208
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,440
Cheng, what are you doing here?

1209
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,550
Eating a lollipop.

1210
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,800
I just found out we have a new player
on our team as well.

1211
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,800
You guys know each other?

1212
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,800
You heard us?

1213
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,070
It was so loud.

1214
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,550
It's hard not to.

1215
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,480
Interesting.

1216
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,030
I'm saying the newcomer in our team,

1217
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,190
she's interesting.
