95
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,510

in today's training match?

122
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,440
That was just a polite
and humble concession from me.

123
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,750
Next time I won't lose.

124
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120

127
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,270
Don't cry on your Support's shoulder then.

128
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,960
How about you,
will you hug and cry to your midsolo?

129
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,360
A person who could even get lost in a mall

130
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,720
now pays attention to our midsolo.

131
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,000
Good for you.

132
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,080

00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,720

136
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,550
- Chubby, Chubby, go for it.
- Pretty easy.

137
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,790
It's 2:0.

138
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,000
How can you fight with me?

139
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,120
The changeable weather is really exciting.

140
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,960
I hope Cheng drove his car there.

141
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,200
My brother's car was sent to be washed.

142
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,840
Nice move.

143
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,000
- I can't quite take it...
- 2-0.

144
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,270
thinking of Cheng getting drenched later.

145
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,510
Isn't it, Biscuit?

146
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,720
Guys, who's going to
bring the umbrella to Cheng?

147
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,670
He's in the next-door mall.

148
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,080
Go on, keep playing.

149
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,510
Come on.

150
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,030
Tong Yao?

151
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,150
It's not appropriate.

152
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,270
I'm busy.

153
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,790
You're not busy, you're the one to do it.

154
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,320
Remember to bring an extra one later.

155
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,670
The one from the other team
didn't bring an umbrella either.

156
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,630
And

157
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,510
it was Cheng who took you to the mall
to buy daily necessities

158
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,550
in the midst of
presenting affairs at the time, right?

159
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,510
You should know how to repay his kindness.

160
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,480
Isn't that right, Biscuit?

161
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,790
I'm an ingrate.

162
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,630
Don't make excuses, go.

163
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,270
Okay, I'll go.

164
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,120
But it will take me
about 20 minutes to get there.

165
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,550
Because my legs are too short to walk fast.

166
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,910
I hope he won't freeze to death

167
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,000
in that time.

168
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,910
Go, watch out.

169
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,630
Come on. Another round.

170
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,870
Are you sleepy?

171
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,630
Hello, the number
you have dialed is turned off.

172
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,790
Sorry, the number

173
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,510

174
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,910
Why are you here?

175
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,960
I finally found you.

176
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,910
Where's our shooter?

177
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,030
He's with our shooter.

178
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,440
Thank you, please take me there.

179
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,240
Let's go.

180
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,910
It's true that
if a pretty boy is not with a beauty,

181
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,030
then he must be with another pretty boy.

182
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,630
You're here.

183
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,960
I told you to bring an umbrella,
but you didn't.

184
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,600
And now you're having someone
come to pick you up?

185
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,270
Sorry to keep you waiting.

186
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,030
I gave you all the dolls.

187
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,960
He said he was sorry to keep you waiting.

188
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,440
These dolls are for you.

189
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,160
What are you looking at?

190
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,880
Nothing.

191
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,480
Here.

192
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,000
This is for you.

193
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,960
Here.

194
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,000
Well. Let's go. It's cold.

195
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,720
Take it.

196
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,440
Let's go.

197
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,480
Go back and take a hot shower
to get rid of the cold feeling.

198
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,270
Tomorrow we have to go to
the National League Draw.

199
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,070
Don't catch a cold.

200
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,480
Oh yeah, we have the draw ceremony tomorrow.

201
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,200
I almost forgot.

202
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,590
What are you thinking about?

203
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,750
None of your business.

204
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,200
I hope that we won't be drawn
in the same group as you

205
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,550
in tomorrow's draw.

206
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,350
Although we are relegated
in the spring season,

207
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,310
we still dream about

208
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,920
the National Final Championship.

209
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,030
But even if it's not us,

210
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,550
it will be CK.

211
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,720
But CK is not as invincible as you are.

212
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
We won a training match
against them recently.

213
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,590
CK. No.

214
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,750
You can win.

215
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,510
You beat CK?

216
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,680
That's good.

217
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,720
Did you hear that, Shorty?

218
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,310
They said we are invincible.

219
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,720
Look how good he is at talking.

220
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,550
See? You're sneezing.

221
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,590
That's because you're too proud.

222
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,400
See you on the field.

223
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,350
See you on the field.

224
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,480
It's not even close for you

225
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,440
to reach your live stream duration
target this month.

226
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,440
You're still eating.

227
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,270
Eating comes first.

228
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,270
I won't have the energy
to broadcast if I'm not full.

229
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,790
You're back?

230
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,640
Didn't you two bring umbrellas?

231
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,200
How come you still got caught in the rain?

232
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,880
Four people with two umbrellas.

233
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,880
What's the use of that in such heavy rain?

234
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,550
You caught a cold?

235
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,590
I don't know.

236
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,920
You should take medicine for that.

237
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,160
The draw ceremony will be held tomorrow.

238
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,200
Are you going with a runny nose?

239
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,160
It's just a cold, why should I take medicine?

240
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,550
I'll go up and take a hot bath.

241
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,880
What's this?

242
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,720
Cheng's jacket.

243
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,880
I mean this.

244
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,030
It's a rabbit.

245
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,790
Where did you get it?

246
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,920
Thanks to our Cheng

247
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,960
and the shooter from next-door team,

248
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,510
they stopped
in the children's playground area,

249
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,200
whose combined height reaches
almost four meters.

250
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,480
And they galloped in the battlefield
in front of the crane machine,

251
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,880
trying to get all the dolls

252
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,030
in the whole mall.

253
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,400
This is how the rabbit came.

254
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,030
Professional players have nimble fingers.

255
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,350
They're really good at grabbing these.

256
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,480
I have been with Cheng for so long.

257
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,880
He didn't even give me a rabbit.

258
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,070
Give it to me.

259
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,920
No.

260
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,640
- Give it to me.
- No.

261
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,480
Give it to me.

Hello, everyone.

292
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,030
I am the host of today's draw ceremony, Sen.

293
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,750
Hello, I'm Jinyang.

294
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,110
The much-anticipated National League
draw ceremony

295
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,590
- will now begin.
- Liang Sheng,

296
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,960
- Let me come up to the stage later.
- Now right here,

297
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,070
- I want to take a picture with my girlfriend.
- let's see

298
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,270
- the rules of this season's draw.
- It's up to you.

299
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,440
Please watch the big screen.

300
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,830
<i>Draw rules</i>

301
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,550
We can see,

302
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,880
according to the rankings in Spring Playoffs

303
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,070
of the Onmyoji Arena Pro League,

304
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,880
there will be four seed pools.

305
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,440
The first and second place
will be at the first seed pool.

306
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,550
The third to the sixth place
will be at the second seed pool

307
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,160
while seventh to tenth place

308
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,350
will be at the third seed pool.

309
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,030
- We're in that seed pool.
- The 11th and 12th place

310
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,350
-will be the fourth seed pool.
-OK.

311
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,750
We will draw in the order

312
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,830
of A-B-A-B Groups.

313
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,110
First of all, let's invite

314
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,110
the two teams in the No. 1 seed pool
to come up and draw lots.

315
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,070
Since CK is the champion of
the Spring Playoffs,

316
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,480
the first team to draw will be CK.

317
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,510
Let's invite the captain of CK,

318
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,640
Yang, to the stage to draw lots.

319
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,440
Group B.

320
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,750
Here is the captain of ZGDX,

321
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,310
Chessman comes to the stage to draw lots.

322
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,790
Although the result is already settled,

323
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,510
let's ask Cheng to come up to draw lots

324
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,510
for the procedure.

325
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,240
Cheng, handsome.

326
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,200
All right.

327
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,070
Group A.

328
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,440
Okay, thank you. Please take your seat.

329
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,110
So next,

330
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,480
we will have

331
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,350
Red Arrow from the second seed pool
to draw lots on stage.

332
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,830
Please.

333
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,880
Cheng looks so scary.

334
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,270
What's going on?

335
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,830
He looks so angry.

336
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,480
That's right.

337
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,400
Cheng, what's wrong with your upset face?

338
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,480
I'm holding back my coughs and sneezes.

339
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,350
It's too uncomfortable.

340
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,070
That's why you look so angry.

341
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,550
Your face looks so black as
the bottom of a pot

342
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,030
that you won't sneeze or cough?

343
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,240
What's with your idol management?

344
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,240
Cheng.

345
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,680
Are you sure you don't want to take medicine?

346
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,480
No.

347
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,920
But the competition is in two days.

348
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,070
How can you command it
with your voice so muffled?

349
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,590
I'll be fine the day after tomorrow.

350
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,350
Shorty.

351
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,440
What's going on
between you and Jian Yang from CK?

352
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,030
Is it still not over?

353
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,000
What kind of look did he just give you?

354
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,070
What?

355
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:13,960
It's already over.

356
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Completely and utterly.

357
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,240
And we're not in the same arena.

358
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,270
If we are to meet, it'd be in the final.

359
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,880
We'll play against CK

360
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,510
in the opening match of the National League.

361
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,310
Next, let's invite

362
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,750
today's last team.

363
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,200
The dark horse of
this year's relegation team.

364
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,400
- YQCB.
- It's our turn.

365
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,110
Please come up to the stage and draw lots.

366
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,110
- YQCB, please.
- Go for it.

367
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,070
Go. Come on.

368
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,510
Come on.

369
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,440
Stand up and take a picture.

370
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,110
Honey, hug.

371
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
What are you doing?

372
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,880
Okay, here, let's take a look.

373
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,350
Congratulations, Group B.

374
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,640
Okay, thank you. Please take your seat.

375
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,070
Ai Jia.

376
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,110
Nice.

377
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,680
Handsome.

378
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,240
- Bro, look at this.
- All right.

379
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,350
Now the 12 teams…

380
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,720
- I look ugly.
- have all finished drawing lots.

381
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,200
So, what's the grouping arrangement

382
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,110
of AB groups?

383
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,920
Please watch the big screen.

384
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,200
First is Group A.

385
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,000
ZGDX, FNC, Red Arrow.

386
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,640
KING, Lan, Obsidian.

387
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,790
Next is Group B.

388
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:04,680
CK, YQCB, Orcs of Doom.

389
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,030
Alpha, DQ.Five, ANT.

390
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:18,460
<i>Winner to be determined</i>

391
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,480
From the current personal stats
and performance

392
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,270
of Lu Yue and Tong Yao,

393
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,510
as well as the matching of
shikigami pools and lineups,

394
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,960
Tong Yao is more suitable to be
the starting player in the National League.

395
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,480
The club has finally decided

396
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,110
Tong Yao will be the starting player
in the National League.

397
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,750
Lu Yue will rotate with Tong Yao
as a substitute.

398
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,160
I've already informed
the official Weibo account.

399
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,720
The official Weibo account
will announce it soon.

400
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,550
What are you looking at?

401
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,830
Focus on the game,

402
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,920
or else you may go back to
the water dispenser at any time.

403
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,160
Tong Yao is going to fight alongside us.

404
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,240
Tong Yao, go for it.

405
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,310
Go for it.

406
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,160
Tong Yao.

407
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,680
Whether we'll go to Shanghai
to eat real meat in October,

408
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,070
or just drink soup in front of the computer,

409
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,680
it's up to you.

410
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
The opening game
is on the day after tomorrow.

411
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,640
As the starting player,
you have to work hard.

412
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,240
Tong Yao, welcome to ZGDX.

413
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,510
K.

414
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,960
I've already joined it.

415
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,920
Then I'll shut up.

416
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,110
Go for it.

417
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,030
Lu Yue.

418
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,550
I'm fine.

419
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,640
The data is objective.

420
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,790
My overall strength is not as good as

421
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,640
that Shorty's now.

422
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,680
I'll work hard later.

423
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,880
I'm confident that I can surpass her.

424
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,720
Keep a good attitude.

425
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:44,960
Go for it.

426
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,070
Go for it.

427
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,200
Let's go.

428
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,640
We've already played with the FNC,

429
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,070
who was assigned to our arena, this year.

430
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,310
The topsolo can occasionally suppress Cat

431
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,160
to the point where
he can't take care of himself.

432
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,920
It's pretty good.

433
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,960
KING is a rising team
from the Spring Playoffs.

434
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,920
I heard that their turnaround rate
in inferior games

435
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,480
can reach 80%.

436
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,640
And Obsidian

437
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,160
has played in the relegation tournament
this year just like the next-door team.

438
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,680
But now since the next-door team can beat CK,

439
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,070
what else is impossible?

440
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,550
Forget it.

441
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,740
<i>Go for the game the day after tomorrow</i>

442
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,270
<i>To be honest,</i>

443
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,550
<i>I feel like my wife is getting married.</i>

444
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,400
<i>You're wrong.</i>

445
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,750
<i>It's obviously the feeling of
marrying off my own daughter.</i>

446
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,240
<i>Hope my daughter can contribute
at her in-laws' home,</i>

448
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,680
<i>scumbags who say e-sports belongs to men.</i>

449
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,070
<i>At the same time,
there is a kind of feeling that</i>

450
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,110
<i>since my daughter is so great,</i>

451
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,440
<i>why should I send her to you to be spoiled?</i>

452
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,030
<i>Baby.</i>

453
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,440
<i>Your husband will be waiting for you

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,790

ordinary but unforgettable moment.

00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,230
Today is Tong Yao's first game

545
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,920
as the starting midsolo

546
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,880
She must be very nervous.

547
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,000
Hope she can make big news.

548
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,280
The tough topsolo Cat.

549
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,630
Looking at his muscular body,

550
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,190
he's really tough to deal with.

551
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,320
The calm jungler K.

552
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,510
His face is so pretty that
even an assassin would be frightened.

553
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,280
And also, the only girl among the boys,

554
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,110
the starting female e-sports player in China,

555
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,280
the much-anticipated first midsolo, Smiling.

556
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,400
We finally get to see her true face.

557
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,590
She looks so cute with short hair.

558
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,760
And the gold-medaled support, Chubby.

559
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,150
It's very reassuring to see

560
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,880
his chubby appearance.

561
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,800
Okay, finally

562
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,510
here comes the Incredible Shooter, Chessman.

563
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,800
Let's welcome them

564
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,920
with our greatest enthusiasm.

565
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,880
Okay, now our two teams

566
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,590
are both ready.

567
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,760
Before it gets too late,

568
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,400
let's ask the two teams
to return to their seats,

569
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,550
preparing to present a battle of the century

570
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,070
for our guests and friends.

571
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
CK.

572
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,960
Go, CK!

573
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,320
Go, go, go!

574
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,760
Hello everyone, I'm your host Chen Jinyang.

575
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm honored to

576
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,000
have Fan and Chen Yao

577
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,960
to commentate with me

578
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,000
on the first match of
the National League today.

579
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,590
Hello, I'm Fan,
the commentator for this match.

580
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,550
Hello, I'm Chen Yao.

581
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,760
Jinyang

582
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,670
is dressed in a very Japanese style.

583
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,030
You're imitating Youtou Hime, right?

584
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,030
Do you

585
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,230
like cosplay in your daily life?

586
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,480
No.

587
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,480
Tong Yao.

588
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,030
What are you doing, bro?

589
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,150
So nervous?

590
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,760
It's not easy today...

591
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,190
I'll be honest.

592
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,710
I'm so nervous that
I'm going to throw up my lunch.

593
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,670
You'll scare her away
before the game even starts.

594
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,320
You're really nervous.

595
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,150
We didn't even have time for lunch today.

596
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,840
Why don't you just throw up in the air?

597
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,710
That's right.

598
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Let's get this over with.

599
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,070
He's an experienced man.

600
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,030
Are you two looking forward to today's game?

601
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,550
Yes.

602
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,190
I don't think it's just the two of us.

603
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,360
Yes, the fans here

604
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,110
and the general public
are very much looking forward to

605
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,880
the opening match of

606
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
CK vs. ZGDX.

607
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,920
I think we haven't forgotten

608
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,760
the recent Spring Playoffs

609
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,670
was like,

610
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,710
like…

611
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,280
A bloody storm.

612
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,230
- That's right.
- That's right.

613
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,480
That's right, a bloody storm.

614
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,550
Jinyang has made

615
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,920
an accurate summary.

616
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,510
- Yes.
- After all, there are so many things to see

617
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,880
about these two teams

618
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,280
in the National League.

619
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
In today's first game,

620
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
let's take a look at

621
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,880
whether ZGDX

622
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,440
can complete their revenge
after the Spring Final

623
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,800
and if CK will be able to

624
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,880
continue their miracle of victory.

625
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,760
And

626
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,070
there is something else exciting.

627
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,760
The new attack player of ZGDX
who just joined the team this year

628
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,110
is a girl.

629
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,360
Have you ever seen a girl as a professional?

630
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,510
No, I really haven't.

631
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,070
Don't mention me.

632
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
I feel now that there are
a lot of people looking at me.

633
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,110
Focus on the big screen.

634
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,030
Why are you looking at me?

635
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,110
But today from the situation
at the site of the competition,

636
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,920
why do I have a feeling that

637
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,960
Smiling seems a little nervous.

638
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,190
- Yes.
- Do you think it's because

639
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,230
she is the only female player

640
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,190
in such a big competition?

641
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,710
It's possible.

642
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,590
Anyone who plays on stage
for the first time would be nervous.

643
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,110
It has nothing to do with

644
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,360
whether she is a girl or not, right?

645
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,320
That's right.

646
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,960
- Well done, sister.
- That makes sense.

647
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,510
Okay, now we've entered
the BP section of the game.

648
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,960
Let's see who will be banned.

649
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,800
The battle is about to begin.

650
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,070
Let's go for it, Smiling.

651
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,630
CK first banned

652
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,030
the Tamamo-no-Mae which is Smiling best at.

653
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,320
They seem to have learnt about it thoroughly.

654
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,670
Yes, after all, this is not
an ordinary Tamamo-no-Mae.

655
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,840
This is No.1 Tamamo-no-Mae
on the Chinese server.

656
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,510
- Right.
- Come on.

657
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,710
Let's ban Good Luck's palm civet first.

658
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,190
Okay, goodbye, palm civet.

659
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,920
ZGDX has banned

660
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,590
palm civet which Good Luck's best at.

661
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,800
It seems that both sides

662
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
have put in a lot of efforts in banning.

663
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,920
That's true.

664
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,400
Enenra.

665
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,400
Aobouzu.

666
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,360
Oh my God.

667
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,880
The two teams have banned four midsolos of

668
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,800
Enenra, Tamamo-no-Mae

669
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,670
Marisha Ray and Shiro Douji.

670
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,360
Four positions were used to
restrain each other team's midsolos

671
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,590
out of six banned positions.

672
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,230
It seems that it'll be a challenge
to each other team's midsolos.

673
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,760
It's also a test to see

674
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,280
who's better at shikigamis this time.

675
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,190
What the hell?

676
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,710
People who are good at limited shikigamis

677
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,440
wouldn't dare to come up and play.

678
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,710
I'll pass on your words

679
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,840
to the one who is guarding
the water dispenser.

680
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,030
Come on, let's get Susabi
and Youtou Hime first.

681
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,920
Give me Youko.

682
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,230
Cheng, according to the opponent's lineup,

683
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,960
it'll be hard for you to play with Youko
in the later period.

684
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,840
You can take Hakurou.

685
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,800
We won't make the game last
till the later period.

686
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,320
I said make it a quick one.

687
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,590
There is no later period in this game.

688
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,320
Assertive Captain Lu. Hail to Captain Lu.

689
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,960
What? Chessman has chosen Youko.

690
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,630
Let me tell you.

691
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,110
This is a risky move.

692
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,960
If they don't get an advantage
in the early stage,

693
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,760
it'll be impossible for them
to make a comeback in the late stages

694
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
with this lineup.

695
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,630
I know.

696
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,000
He wants a quick victory

697
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,710
to give CK a surprise.

698
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,800
This is a risky move.

699
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,360
- Who
- Okay, now we see

700
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,320
- can fight with me?
- the lineups of both sides have formed.

701
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,480
First of all, let's take a look at CK.

702
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,960
Topsolo Banruo has chosen Yasha,
the midsolo has chosen Susabi.

703
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,360
The bottom lane is a combination
of Ichimoku Ren and Chin.

704
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,190
This lineup was chosen

705
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,960
to postpone the game to its late stage.

706
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,550
On the other hand, let's see ZGDX.

707
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,230
The opposing team has a superior lineup
in the later stage

708
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,000
while we're all in the early stage.

709
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,110
Are we too condescending, man?

710
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,000
I have a headache.

711
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,320
I want to back to sleep after the game.

712
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,070
I Second that.

713
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,030
What's wrong with you?

714
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,510
I have a stomachache.

715
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,840
I want to mmm…

716
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,000
What's that?

717
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,630
It's kind of a strong urge

718
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,880
to respond to the call of nature.

719
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,400
I want to empty my bowels.

720
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,760
I think you want to be
in the book of competition quotes.

721
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,070
Competition quotes?

722
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,150
What's that?

723
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,880
Did you guys backstage hear that?

724
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,440
Live updates.

725
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,880
Less than 30 seconds after the game started,

726
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,480
our midsolo…

727
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,880
Don't say that.

728
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,840
Backstage staff,

729
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,150
Please be kind

730
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,590
and cut that part out.

731
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,590
I'll kneel down to pay my respects to you.

732
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,440
Stop yelling

733
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,320
in case you shit your pants.

734
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,630
A patient and a girl who wants to take a poo.

735
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,360
Guys,

736
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,840
can we play the opening game well?

737
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,760
I'm not playing anymore.

738
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,960
You guys go get Lu Yue here.

739
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:00,800
I want to go home.

740
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,710
It's too late.

741
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,190
All right, we're online.
