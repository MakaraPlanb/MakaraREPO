3
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,800
Grandpa

4
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,350
What about the female coach

5
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,440
Also came

6
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,420
Hello, Grandpa Jun

7
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,540
Forget it. Forget it. I know all of you

8
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,720
Let me be straightforward then

9
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,390
Who is the female coach

10
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,030
Why doesn't he play according to the rules

11
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, I was a little caught off guard, too

14
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,390
I am

15
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,480
How can it be you

16
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,800
You are Su Nuanxia

18
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,150
Mr. Jun

20
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,120
No need for a massage

21
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,900
Come and talk to me

24
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,960
Girl

25
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,910
I can understand all that you said.

26
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,080
I just don't understand my smelly grandson

27
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,780
He had never laughed so happily on anything else.

28
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,690
This is probably the charm of basketball,

30
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,550
Then you should talk about this basketball.

31
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,210
What is the charm of what,

34
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,540
Why do we love basketball

35
00:03:50,600 --> 00:04:03,980
Under the spotlight, the pull rod slipped past four opponents and threw the ball, still trying to imitate the rhythm of Michael Jordan's running dash on the baseline. Stop, stop, stop, how did you start the poem recitation?

37
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,570
Because I really want to convince you

38
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,830
Let Jun play basketball with us at night.

39
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,690
It took me a lot of time to get Jun night to join our team before.

40
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,860
It seems that I have to try it on you.

41
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:25,110
Then tell me if my grandson likes basketball better.

42
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,710
Or you

43
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,110
That likes me better

44
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,600
But I like him playing basketball

45
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,500
This is what's answer.

47
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,340
Grandpa, you see

48
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,990
Ah, wear the ball

49
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:46,240
In fact, liking basketball is the same as liking a person, which will make us concentrate.

50
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,640
And can't help it

51
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:54,670
You see, even if they are in wheelchairs, they cannot stop their love of basketball.

53
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,330
Do you really want to limit your night

54
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,990
So

55
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,050
Your next match

56
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,660
I will sponsor

57
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,400
Really

58
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,070
Thank you, Grandpa

59
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:28,420
Myth vs. Green Dream Season 3 Is this a variety show? This is different. Junshi Group specially sponsored 2 million donations to wheelchair children.

60
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:36,580
I support public welfare and handsome men. Then you stand at night or Chu Ran. Suddenly, we are all looking forward to him playing. Yes, yes, yes.

61
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:50,750
The competition between the basketball team of Qingmeng University and the basketball team of Myth University will now begin.

62
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,280
Come on

63
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,360
Pass me

64
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,840
King's Night

68
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,240
You don't have a chance, not necessarily

69
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,660
Mine

70
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,780
Not necessarily

71
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,810
Brother Qiang

74
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,100
Anna

75
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,840
Qi Feng is saluting you

76
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,860
Don't pay any attention to him to help you against Wei

77
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,940
Is this six-to-zero climax a bit lucky?

78
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,550
Luck is also the luck of myth. If you start playing at night, myth will not lose only six points.

79
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,000
Green Dream Green Dream Green Dream Green Dream

80
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:28,480
Note that the number of fingers dribbled by Xiaoqiang Xia Ze is proportional to his speed.

81
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,590
Buy one get one free

82
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,980
Funny

83
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Get him

97
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,970
Everyone is so energetic today.

98
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,130
Is this the power of love

100
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,320
Anna, when will you give me a light?

101
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,800
Cowen

102
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,920
This monarch night is really too difficult to prevent. If you can't do it, you can't do it three times in the morning.

103
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,020
Referee, isn't that a foul

104
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,590
I didn't think it was good for Phantom to pass the ball and steal it. Your opponent is me. Don't play for yourself. It's Xia Ze's time now.

105
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,920
A good shot

107
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,880
Xia Ze, you taught him this hand. I just said the essentials.

108
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,010
It is Xia Ze's own talent to master the super-far three points.

109
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,300
What about Xia Ze? It's good

110
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,820
But the real starting point of this counterattack is Jiang Yichen.

111
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:03,300
Only when the center controls the backboard can Xia Ze have unlimited firing rights.

112
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,150
Only when we regain the backboard can we have a chance, but Qi Feng and Jiang Yichen's center have no advantage against each other.

113
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,100
Then it's your Ling Xuan's turn to play.

114
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,120
Ling Xuan, you are not worthy to tell me about rebounding.

115
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,520
Who wants to rebound with you

118
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,720
This is what's style of play.

119
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,780
Wonderful, warm summer. You designed this trick called what again.

120
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,980
Wingman's tactics are hard for you to think of.

121
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:38,250
To put it bluntly, the rebound competition is to play rascal Jiang Yichen's height, strength and even talent.

122
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,850
Everything is above Qi Feng, so it can form a suppression on him, and Ling Xuan is the one who breaks the suppression.

123
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,670
Ling Xuan's physical quality is genius level, although it is not enough to grab the backboard on Jiang Yichen's head.

124
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,640
But with his amazing jumping ability

125
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,340
It interferes with his possession of the ball as long as Jiang Yichen does not get the first landing point.

126
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,880
Qi Feng can reap the benefits of

127
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,570
What wingman tactics

128
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,420
Isn't it just two people who make me one?

129
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,920
I don't know who took three defenses and one against you just now.

132
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,920
If it weren't for Lao Zi

133
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,880
You can score goals

134
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,360
Or is my brother Feng hard

136
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,930
Sometimes man-to-man friendships

137
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,770
It also makes me jealous.

138
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,180
If you even want to rot your boyfriend, then you are really scum.

139
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,060
It is also quite good to rot.

140
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,270
The provincial iron Hanhan has nothing to do with Anna's cuteness.

141
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,720
None of you smelly men is reliable.

142
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,820
Is

143
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,750
They are all too low in quality.

144
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,240
Including you

146
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,040
A good shot

147
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,190
No.6 thug fouled Qingmeng team free throw

148
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,190
Qingmeng Qingmeng Qingmeng Qingmeng Two Penalties for the First Time

150
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,830
Don't be so cold to your own players,

151
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,380
Leave you alone

154
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,210
 

155
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,040
Sisters, shout

156
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,090
Green Dream Green Dream Youth High-spirited Dream for Nine Days

157
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,580
How does Coach Su play Qingmeng, who is three points ahead,

158
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,730
You know

159
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,620
Coach Han

160
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,560
Shen Yingliang is going to start work.

161
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,560
You think the same mistake

162
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,680
Will I do it again

163
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,700
Not Important

164
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,000
Stare at Shen Yingliang and don't let him shoot again.

165
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,480
Stare at me first

166
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,560
Jun Fun Run

167
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,500
I won't let you in if I break the rules.

169
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,120
No chance to foul

171
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,570
Do you forget how you fell last time when you fought like this?

173
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,140
That's right

174
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,970
This is the tactics we arranged before the match. We all knew it from the last match.

175
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,010
To maintain God's three-part load

176
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,740
Shen Xuechang must maintain his physical fitness for about 10 minutes, which is the case.

177
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,870
It can only be said that

178
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,730
Shen Xuechang is really hard at it.

179
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,190
And you

180
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,300
How am I

181
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Very thief

182
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,080
I think Chu Ran will definitely play in the last five minutes of the match.

183
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,440
So what do you think is the safest point difference if before he goes on stage,

184
00:14:52,440 --> 00:15:03,110
If we can lead by 10 to 15 points, we should be able to score. No, not enough. Twenty points are needed. Why do I know Chu Ran's strength if he makes a ball every 30 seconds?

185
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,910
Then he can score 20 points in five minutes.

186
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,400
In other words, a 20-point difference in our hands is theoretically safe.

187
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,980
Twenty cents

188
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,490
It's too difficult

189
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,110
What about your strength when I hang up

190
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,990
I have a plan

191
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,530
In the last few minutes of the first half

192
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,250
Shen Xuechang Begins to Score

193
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,420
Even if the physical strength is 70%,

194
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,190
Halftime break can also be restored for a period of time.

195
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,180
Hmm

196
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,870
Coach's right

197
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,460
That way I can play the whole game

198
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,350
Even if there is an accident, there are still substitutes to top it.

199
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,790
Warm summer

200
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,500
Your delay tactics

201
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,140
Did you learn from the professional league

202
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,980
No

203
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,420
It was inspired by Hua Bai's stages.

208
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,500
Throw your own seniors and iron your hands.

209
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,320
Thanks

211
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,520
If you want to throw three points, you must bend your knees and lean back.

212
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,150
Ding Lei now blocks all angles behind you. You only need to lean back. He has 100 ways to grab your ball.

213
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,050
And now

214
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,880
I can pass the ball

215
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,400
Xiao Qiang

218
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,210
Is it Shen Xuechang who has no physical strength

219
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,170
It's not

220
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,660
Then why can Ding Lei take his ball

221
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:18,290
Didn't you say last time that Shen Xuechang can choose his height and timing at will and won't be cut off? Because Xia Ze and Ding Lei are also great pitchers.

222
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,930
Under the condition of two people assisting in defense,

223
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:26,430
Almost all the exit points are transparent. The area around Shen Yingliang is equivalent to forming a network without dead corners.

224
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,610
What should I do then? It's over

226
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,440
Come on

227
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,150
Green Dream Green Dream Green High-spirited Dream for Nine Days

234
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,550
Compared with the last one,

235
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,690
Everyone's performance today is commendable.

236
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,880
Sorry

237
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,840
My Hua Bai staging tactics did not pull the difference apart.

238
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,340
My condition is also normal.

239
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,730
Anna Anna didn't even look at me

240
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,190
Rabbit Rabbit

241
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,200
Give me a boost

242
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
Here you go

244
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,710
How about you at night

245
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,710
I play normally

249
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,700
King's Night

250
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,470
What's wrong with you today? You don't seem very excited.

251
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,570
In addition to such chu ran

252
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,700
I have to make a video for Grandpa later.

253
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,020
The only sponsor of this competition is your grandfather.

254
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,560
Of course I want to record it for him.

255
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,780
If he didn't see you go all out, he might not agree with us.

257
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,600
Good

258
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,140
Then I'm excited

259
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,350
Refueling

270
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,560
A 13-point advantage of 13 points is not safe.

271
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,710
Someone needs to stand up

272
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,380
King's Night

273
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,410
Don't forget what I just said

279
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,090
A meal is as fierce as a tiger. A look at the lead of 25, 25 points and a five-minute advantage.

280
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,850
Lu Ye, what do you think? According to this trend,

281
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,390
Qingmeng has the probability of winning,

282
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,260
Probability, you are really very strict. The opponent is Chu Ran.

283
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,680
You can't help being strict

284
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,070
Coach Han

285
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,200
Then you wait for me

286
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:23,560
Myth Team No.7 Chu Ran Replaces No.4 Gu Yuan

290
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,940
Do you want to lose one-on-one again? It depends on whether you have the skill.

293
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,410
You've reached the limit

294
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,500
But I'm stronger

296
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,150
Qingmeng Team Requested Suspension of

297
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,410
Come on, come on, come on

298
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,090
We must take action on Chu Ran's dominance.

299
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,710
Otherwise, it will be defeated.

300
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,780
Not necessarily, not necessarily, after all, we still have an advantage of 18 points.

301
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,120
So in the last four minutes or so

302
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,660
I think we should defend the attack.

303
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,140
We still have Qi Feng's secret weapon.

306
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,680
Pause End

307
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,880
One, two, refuel

308
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,830
King's Night

311
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,420
Your wingman can no longer fly

312
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,540
As a center, you should know that the most important task is what to hold the backboard.

313
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:03,540
Yes, you also have to win the opponent's rebounds and dunk with your height and strength should be strong points.

314
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,690
You see here, every time you grab the backboard face to face with Jiang Yichen, you will take off a little later than him.

315
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:16,030
These few tenths of a second are negligible in time, but are crucial in the competition. These two matches

316
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:22,240
You shot a lot more than you rebounded and dunked. I found that you did the same in your usual training.

317
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,710
It's just that your shooting percentage is relatively high.

318
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,730
So it makes up for the lack of rebounds slightly.

319
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,850
Qi Feng

320
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:35,170
Can you explain why, coach Qi Feng? He actually suffered an Achilles tendon injury, so I went to the school doctor.

321
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,350
Bring out your medical records

322
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,830
Your injury was not very serious at that time, and now you have recovered.

323
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,230
So it doesn't affect your take-off and dunk at all. Come on, Qi Feng

324
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,400
This air battle does not require wingmen.

326
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,020
 

327
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,540
How did you do it? Come again

328
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,110
Qi Feng, you will never dunk in your life.

332
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,300
This is difficult

333
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,420
Qi Feng's deduction just now, if he can score, the situation will be reversed.

334
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,190
Unfortunately, on the basketball court

335
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,490
No ifs

337
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:26,290
In the next four minutes, let all the people on the court have a fear of being dominated by Chu Ran.

338
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,560
There is still a 16-point advantage.

339
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,330
Hold on

340
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,650
You can't wait to die. Brother, you and Ling Xuan put in the basket and wait for me to send you shells.

341
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:37,780
What Chu Ran is doing now is a tail-lowering blow.

342
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,820
Break up your opponent's best moves and you will collapse.

343
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,640
Churan, are you a monster

344
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,350
Zhang Xiaoqiang, you have already scrapped the fate, right

346
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:52,230
Qi Feng's hard dunk could have controlled the whole match.

347
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:56,850
Now the confidence hit by Chu Ran has no look at Zhang Xiaoqiang.

348
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:01,050
His proud flexibility has now become stiff.

349
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,060
Lu Ye Chu Ran's style of play is a bit different from yours.

350
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,860
I am replicating my opponent's stunts and winning by surprise.

351
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,870
But Chu Ran is better

352
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,290
He is fundamentally destroying his opponent's confidence.

353
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,360
Frankly speaking

354
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,680
I can't do this kind of crushing.

355
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,740
Lu Ye summed up well. In fact, this move also has a particularly domineering name called

356
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,820
It's called plunder. I said uncle

357
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:34,010
Your rest area is over there. It's boring for you to come to us as a coach to give an explanation. Alas, Coach Han is such a vulgar taste.

358
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,220
Every time I feel that my opponent is going to die,

359
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,270
You can't help running over to humiliate

360
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,510
Particularly annoying

362
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,930
Qi Feng and Zhang Xiaoqiang have lost their competitiveness

363
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,950
Old captain, do you still insist on what? Is this what you mean by feelings?

364
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,880
Not at all.

365
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,990
I just want to see how you will rob me of my ability.

366
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,630
I can see that your left hand is injured, and if you throw it again, you will not be able to hold the scalpel.

367
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,750
Why don't you prevent it? You can't make it

368
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,860
Again

371
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,460
 

382
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,360
Don't be too arrogant to fight one on one.

383
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,450
You are too weak

384
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,160
Junye, give me the ball

385
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,709
Come on, let me see how strong you are

386
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,340
The mythology team has been chasing 31 points in a row.

387
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,440
And Qingmeng

388
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,050
I haven't earned a cent for half a day.

389
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,100
What are you doing at night

390
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,720
I said you wanted to fight, didn't you? Come on, you have the will to fight

391
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,940
It is better to win the competition together.

392
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,070
It's only six. We're still in time

393
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,090
If you play well

394
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,940
Can still win

397
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,621
Come on, Qingmeng Team

399
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:06,755
Warm Summer Warm Summer Do you think they can really win back

402
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,350
Grandpa, look

403
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,320
This is my favorite Jun Night

412
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,260
Normal

417
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,530
Come on, go on

426
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,510
Bad luck just now

427
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,340
Just now I was a little bit close, or I'd have won, Brother Qiang.

428
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Refueling

429
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,400
In fact, this game

430
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,000
My tactics are too radical.

431
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,080
Especially after Chu Ran plays, he should be the main defender.

432
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,450
No one is talking to you. Ling Xuan, come on, Jun, come on, come on, come on

434
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,400
Let's finish the last ball and see if I agree or not.

436
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,690
King's Night

437
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:45,290
Come on, Qingmeng, Qingmeng, Youth, High-spirited Dream for Nine Days

438
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:51,250
Green Dream Green Dream Youth High-spirited Dream for Nine Days

448
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,180
You can't beat me one on one

451
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,960
 

452
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,520
 

453
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:57,840
Hello, everyone, welcome to the special plan of the survival guide for straight men who know you are warm in summer night. I am my mentor Qingzi. Today we come to the training session of boyfriend's survival desire.

454
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,950
As straight men, many people do not understand girls' obsession with hairstyles.

455
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,380
Especially in the face of how to do my hair cut so ugly ah

456
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,500
This kind of soul topic is even more caught off guard and will step on thunder every minute.

457
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:15,610
In today's training class, Qingzi will teach everyone to rise up and save themselves. Please see the scene reappear.

458
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,780
What shall I do

459
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:22,190
I cut my hair so ugly today. I'm ashamed to go to school.

461
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,840
Have you finished or not

462
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,570
This is the thirty-seventh time you have asked

463
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,760
Do you really want how

464
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,840
Get out of here

465
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,780
In fact, there is another form of the common straight man model.

466
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,370
How do I do? I cut my hair so ugly today

467
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,210
I'm ashamed to go to class.

469
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,000
Baby is afraid of what

470
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,670
Anyway, you already have someone in love.

471
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,980
Don't worry about it anymore

472
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,920
Go away and leave me alone

473
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,840
Help

474
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,540
This kind of sending proposition boy how answer is the right one. Let's look at the right way to open it.

475
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,060
What shall I do

476
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,370
I had my hair cut ugly today

477
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,140
I am ashamed to go to class.

478
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,010
Have you finished or not

480
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,680
This is the thirty-seventh time you have asked

481
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,940
You lower your facial value a little bit.

482
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,240
Leave a way for others

483
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,070
Can't you
