1
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,970
Thank you for your hospitality

2
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,210
You are the most edible I have ever seen.

3
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:28,160
In the future, we will often come to eat. Sorry, I will not entertain you. You have been blacklisted by our store because you eat too much. You will not be sent.

5
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,150
Then don't do marketing with me. Come out

6
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,000
 

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,170
I'm going to photograph their store and send it to my friends to tell them not to come.

9
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,960
What if it rains so hard

10
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,840
What are you doing

12
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,260
The manager gave it to you

13
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,790
He said there were no umbrellas

14
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,760
You go in and borrow your umbrella and phone.

16
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,100
I told Jason Chung

17
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm going to buy this place

19
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,700
Change into a public toilet

20
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,620
No

21
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,260
Is that exaggerating? Let me explain to someone

22
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,570
Jason Chung said

23
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,990
The area of this place is too large

24
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,870
Can't change

25
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,240
You want to change what

27
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Fortunately, it can't be changed. No, no, no, no, no

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm teasing you

29
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,510
Just your skin

30
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,708
No, we have to figure out how to get there

31
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,180
Think it over

33
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,850
Are you ready

34
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,600
1

35
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,670
2

37
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,480
You, you

54
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,620
Her Majesty

55
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,110
Why are you looking at me all the time

56
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,940
I'm proud of you

57
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,820
Where are you going? You haven't signed up yet.

58
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,460
I can't even beat a girl

59
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:23,400
Also join the what basketball team so as not to drag your feet. When you were three years old, you started to contact basketball. Ordinary people can't beat her. It's not uncommon for you to lose to her.

60
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,240
With your physical quality

61
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,700
Good training can definitely become Hanato Sakuragi. I just want to be Jack Ma.

62
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,300
Not interested in becoming Hanamichi Sakuragi Goodbye

63
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,970
People like you who have no brains and only know how to rush blindly.

64
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:42,220
It's better to do your pick-and-roll honestly and watch me play. Who do you say has no brain and team harmony?

65
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,330
Do you believe it or not when I order 100 cups of milk tea after the competition

67
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:52,740
Considering that Ling Xuan's foot injury has not fully recovered, our training will not be so intense for me.

68
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,880
Come on, come on

69
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,350
Now you can take the initiative to increase training.

70
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,860
That's because of you

71
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,630
I want to be a hero in your life

72
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,180
You have always been

73
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,480
Hmm

74
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,520
Not enough

76
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,720
Wait a minute, you continue

77
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,080
I'll watch you practice here, okay

78
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,700
Come on, go back to rest early. You were on the sidelines.

79
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,920
I'm not focused

80
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,010
Then I'll catch Qi Feng and Zhang Xiaoqiang to accompany you.

84
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,000
Why

86
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,160
What are you doing

87
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,900
I remember there was a hotel over there.

88
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,860
We can get a room first

89
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,850
Have a change

90
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,880
Don't catch a cold

91
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,630
Open a room

92
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,390
Go

93
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,960
Wait a minute

94
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,880
This way, this way

95
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,990
Brother Qiang, I was knocked down again.

96
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,520
Can you help you five times in one round?

97
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,680
This way, this way

98
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,680
After drinking, go back to training quickly. Now Ling Xuan is more diligent than you. Yes, or is your Ling Xuan brilliant?

99
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,310
Don't come to herd sheep with us.

100
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:29,960
Sister Rabbit teaches well. Drink quickly. Drink quickly. Ling Xuan is very lonely to practice alone now.

101
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,090
Rabbit, don't sprinkle dog food any more, will you

110
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,130
There is really no way to use the team's public account card.

111
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,220
Just explain it to the rabbit later.

112
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,490
There is only 1,999 yuan left for the honeymoon suite.

113
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,730
Is that all right

114
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,140
Let's do this first

115
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,410
Don't catch a cold

116
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,060
Hmm

118
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,800
Let's practice again.

119
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,520
I want to play in this year's match.

120
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,840
The strength of Qingmeng is indeed stronger than that of each other.

121
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,260
Only when you play can you ensure victory.

122
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,500
Especially their monarch night

123
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,200
He is also a player with special character.

124
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,640
Coach Han

125
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,360
Come to the point

126
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,950
I mean, you came from Qingmeng

127
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,542
You have a better understanding of their internal situation.

128
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,920
Do you think there is a possibility

129
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,940
Put a little more psychological pressure on them

130
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,560
I have no objection to psychological warfare

132
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,550
But the breakthrough is not necessarily Junye

140
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,780
You go first, you go first

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,080
Have caught a cold

146
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,660
What are you doing

147
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,470
Japanese Roast Rotary Sushi

148
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,590
Mu Si cake

149
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,950
Why are you looking at this

150
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,160
Me

151
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:22,450
If you want to eat some snacks, you can't. How can athletes eat these casually?

152
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,960
The competition is coming soon.

153
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,940
You see, your biceps are not firm at all.

154
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,800
Get up and train quickly

155
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,620
Here

156
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,520
Training is right. Otherwise

157
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,120
You have to change your clothes quickly.

158
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,070
Let's do a set of push-ups first.

160
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:55,490
I'll find some equipment. You give it to me. Be good. Don't be lazy.

170
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,020
Bunny Bunny Help King wants to open a room with me at night.

171
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,400
The address is sent to you. Come on

172
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,540
Let your girlfriend be your coach.

173
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,440
Probably this kind of experience

174
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,540
Despicable and shameless

175
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,530
What did you say you did to our warm summer

176
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:11,710
My brother is also a victim. Well, I also want to ask how your warm summer has done to my brother.

177
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,500
Night God

178
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,240
Teach me the secret of love. I want to go to a canteen. Anna won't go with me.

179
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,320
Don't blame the senior for being too busy, ah, have you taken any safety measures?

180
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,870
Hmm

181
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,720
It's a good match

183
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,530
Let's join you

186
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,820
Coach, I don't have to

188
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,620
I'll count it for you

189
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,880
You are strong enough but not flexible enough.

190
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,440
Xiao Rabbit, hurry

191
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,920
Had I known I wouldn't have come to save you

195
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,150
Well, in order to encourage everyone, I will join you all in the national movement.

196
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,430
Refueling

204
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,040
I think

205
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,550
I can have another group

206
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,950
Get up and train for me

207
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,090
Shen Xuechang, get up

208
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,410
Zhang Xiaoqiang

212
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,520
It's time for dinner

213
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,570
Otherwise, I will not be energetic today.

215
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,370
Normal period

216
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,220
Why didn't you say so earlier

217
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,310
You shouldn't have practiced with us

219
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,140
I don't have that kind of food

220
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,160
Let's go. I'll take you back to the dormitory. No, I have to train this afternoon.

221
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,760
Let's go and want ice cream.

222
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,260
After eating, I will be resurrected with blood.

225
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,500
I was joking

226
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,420
He really ignored me

229
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,640
Why haven't you come back yet, cheapskate

230
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,920
What for

231
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,400
Get out of the way

234
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:34,230
Don't give me too much, Junye. Don't make a fuss about it. It's training.

235
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,760
Training

236
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,440
Me

238
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,290
Is it delicious

240
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,840
Have another bite

241
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,820
It's disgusting. You swallow it

242
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,820
Give me another bite

243
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,420
It's my favorite taste. It's hard to buy.

244
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,840
No wonder you've been there for so long, and you're still angry

245
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,020
If I had known, I wouldn't have bought it for you.

246
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,270
Buy any of them when you run so far.

248
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,760
Today's warm summer is not feeling well.

249
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,860
This afternoon's training should be cancelled. You have no discussion who will allow you.

250
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,340
Hello

251
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,550
I'll fight you one-on-one at night.

252
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,420
No time

253
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,400
If I win, it proves that I am no worse than LaCrosse.

254
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,880
I need to adjust my tactics.

255
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,880
I can't do it if I'm the core.

256
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,830
The war is imminent, even if it needs to be changed.

257
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,580
We have to wait for the end of the match. We have been cooperating for so long. It's not a half-set of tactics. Maybe it's better to change it.

258
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,510
More powerful

259
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,230
Don't be funny. Three-year-olds don't do that

260
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,170
You have been menopausal recently. You are so angry.

261
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,750
You can't play a joke. Don't make any noise,

262
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:04,540
Everyone is one of their own quarrelling with what. There is no need for everyone to compare internally. They are all the same. They just perform their respective duties.

263
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,430
Is it really as good as before? No time for nonsense. One-on-one fight can change tactics. No

264
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,550
Another day

270
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,590
Didn't you take me back to the dormitory? Do you think I will believe that you will have a good rest when you go back to the dormitory?

271
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,560
I also want to go back and deepen my tactics.

272
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,440
What happened to you this morning was my negligence

273
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,470
But now the training is over

274
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,000
Under my control

275
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:15,370
Is it hard

276
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,880
Brown sugar and ginger water

277
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:24,430
Can I, can I, can't stand it? I'm going to suffer from heatstroke.

279
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,150
I'm telling you, there's really no what on your period.

280
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,700
Believe me, I'm going to perform a sit-up for you now. Look

281
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,560
No, you must keep warm at such times.

282
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,120
First, you can't drink cold water.

283
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,750
Second, you can't do strenuous exercise.

284
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,980
Otherwise, it will leave the root of the disease behind.

285
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,470
Who told you

286
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,400
Internet

287
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:51,400
Not everyone is like that. Like me, I may just eat less.

288
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,090
And every time I especially want to drink my mother's motherwort soup.

289
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,050
How do I learn

290
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,970
It's over. I almost forgot

291
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,970
My mother is coming to bring me soup tomorrow.

292
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,850
That's good

293
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,840
It's not that she didn't know we were in love and then

294
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,660
She said she would come and meet you

295
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,810
That

296
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,600
It's good

298
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,240
We can have dinner together. Dinner should not be available.

299
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,560
She came to see me at the airport on a business trip with her colleague.

300
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,560
What time should the plane be free for two or three hours in the afternoon

302
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,240
Isn't it

303
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,430
It's a little too sudden. Then I'll help you later.

304
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,190
No need to refuse. No problem

305
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,800
Really? Are you sure you're okay

307
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,830
Then let me take you back to the dormitory first.

308
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,050
I have another business matter to deal with later.

311
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,480
Go ahead

312
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,680
You can't even patronize our little shit at night.

313
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,860
It's about what

314
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,080
Explain it first

315
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,670
I came to see you

316
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Never let warm summer know

317
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,560
That's right

319
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,920
Today's performance of aiming at Ka is not particularly good.

320
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,830
Consultation fee

326
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:38,320
As half of your fans, I can't wait to help you. Then tell me what you think, Li Tao. You can't overturn if you win.

327
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:51,090
Li Tao, I don't ask Li Tao to discuss rationally. You will win. Remember, don't KY, press the camera, press the camera, plus my assists. There is absolutely no problem.

328
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,180
When speaking Chinese, I always forget that you are not in the pink circle.

329
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:02,170
If you should be quiet, just be quiet and don't say anything wrong.

332
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,800
But in just three hours

333
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,530
I have to make the best impression. No problem

335
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:22,750
Isn't the shopping mall near the school under your name? Take your aunt there. No woman doesn't like shopping, but she can also show the strength of your family in an advanced way.

336
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,320
You see, your conditions are so good in all aspects. Don't worry, aunt is absolutely satisfied with you.

337
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,040
By the way, that

339
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:40,380
I should wear what's clothes. It's not easy. Just look simple, generous, low-key and stable.

341
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,720
How about that? Is everything goe well

342
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,350
It went well

343
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,110
You can do it tomorrow.-Oh, take it easy

344
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,790
In my dictionary

345
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,420
There is no word nervous.

346
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,080
I believe you, Mua Da

359
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:02,910
Pompous

361
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:16,600
Immature

366
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,070
Look, it makes you nervous.

367
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,750
See the future mother-in-law monarch night is no different from ordinary people

368
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,500
Your move really worked

369
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,160
How come she didn't buy it in what herself

370
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,820
I only chose a skirt for warm summer.

371
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,030
It is that the shopping mall is not big enough.

372
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,860
Or is the brand I introduced not good enough?

373
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,160
The shopping mall is very large, and the brands are complete and upscale.

374
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,770
But

375
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,710
I want to tell you a truth

376
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,240
Say

377
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,850
Don't guess what a woman's mind is

378
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,920
Is it because his mother is not satisfied with me, and if she is not satisfied with you, she will not be satisfied.

379
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,510
Don't worry

380
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,590
You are an open monarch. You must be stable at night.

384
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:43,440
It did commit suicide. As a strong bank card, it has never met such a strong opponent and been treated so cruelly.

385
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,290
It has lost face to the world. Rest in peace, little Kaka.

387
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,240
Get up

393
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,430
Naked abuse

394
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,150
Sure enough

395
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,760
There is no better way to know a woman than a mother.

397
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,730
I must strictly follow my aunt's instructions.

398
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,610
It's Ms. Xia's style,

399
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,400
You continue

400
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,160
Daughter

401
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,290
Do you think you are rubbish

402
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:48,000
Since it's not why you have to pack yourself in garbage bags every day, aunt, this poison tongue ability is simply amazing.

403
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,720
Admire

409
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,870
You tortured me for most of the day

410
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,650
Now you can tell me

411
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,420
Why? Auntie, tell me

412
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,220
After meeting you night, she found that her military ability was very strong.

413
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,380
Steady, reliable and patient, it is simply not better.

414
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,080
This is a good thing, but aunt is afraid that you are not worthy of being alone and dying.

415
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,080
He also said that it was too much for you before,

416
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,390
I have neglected my discipline of you.

417
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:42,390
I don't know if it's too late to make up for it, and my aunt and I are both afraid what if some coquettish bitches run out of what and rob you night.

418
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:48,730
It's not as serious as you think. Girls should be self-reliant so that they can live a wonderful life.

419
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:54,940
Also, I like Junye because I like his inner part. I believe he should think so too.

420
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,460
Let's go in warm summer

422
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:06,790
Afraid of being filmed again, of course I have to report to Aunt Xia.

423
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,880
I also want to tell her what you two think of each other.

425
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:20,810
I think you can now lead the most lovely warm summer in the world.

427
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,060
Auntie said

428
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,760
Remember to be gentle with other boys and don't bully others.

429
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,310
What's the matter with Ms. Xia? I am still not her own daughter.

430
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:38,010
Why not toward him or me? Did Aunt Xia say what

431
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:43,570
Is there any place in what where I can help? No, no, my task is completed. Go and play.

432
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,160
I will not follow you and shine. Bye

433
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,210
Aunt Xia bought you this little skirt

434
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,430
It's beautiful.

435
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,430
Dressed so beautifully today

436
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,840
Where do you want to play

437
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,790
Don't waste it

438
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,550
Do you also think

439
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,630
I was not good enough like that before.

440
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,180
How could it be

441
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,950
Actually

442
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,890
I've always wanted to give you something

444
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,780
In the future, I want you to wear my uniform when I play games.

445
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,990
No problem

446
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,560
You just asked me

447
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,040
Do you think you're not good enough

448
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,880
Then I want to tell you now

449
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,390
I don't need you to make any changes

450
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,850
I want you to be yourself, really

452
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,910
Can you find a girlfriend like a man's wife? How can you be like a man's wife?

453
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,160
You are cheerful

454
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,630
Straightforward, naive and warm

455
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,540
I'm also worried that I'm not romantic enough.

456
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,210
Not considerate enough

457
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,480
Not worthy of you

458
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,790
Are you stupid? How can you be worthy or not? Only love or not

459
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,470
How much do you love me

460
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,240
Not too much, is it

461
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,600
But

462
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,520
It will take 100 years to consume energy.

470
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:40,540
If I and your mother fall into the water at the same time, who do you save first, save my mother first, and then I will save you

471
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,590
I can't imagine that the senior Chu Ran, whom I have always liked, is a mother treasure man.

472
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,660
You can say whatever you want. This cosmic problem is wrong anyway.

473
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,910
Then I will change to a meaningful question.

474
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,830
Which is more important, me or basketball

475
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,540
Fortunately, I was already prepared.

476
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,200
To answer such questions, uh, we must have a clear-cut stand.

477
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,240
Of course it's you

478
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,800
He answered without even thinking about it. What if you have to choose one?

479
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,560
After all, the dimensions are different, one is sports and the other is emotion.

480
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:25,210
It should be said that you are as important as basketball. I can't imagine that my weight in your heart is just a 600-gram ball. I also said that what's love, marriage, graduation, house purchase and what's

481
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,190
Think about it and think it's frivolous. Let's break up.

482
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,210
Sister

483
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,770
Give me a break. I'll do whatever you want. All right

485
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,810
Good

486
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,360
Then let me ask you

487
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,950
Is Su warm in summer good-looking or am I good-looking? I am ready to answer this question.

488
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:48,810
It must be firmly stated that it was you who answered without even thinking about it. It must be perfunctory to me. I want to go to Qingmeng to see what she looks like.

489
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,030
I don't object to her. Her eyes are big.

490
00:30:52,100 --> 00:31:03,170
The temperament is a little similar to yours. You actually compare your current girlfriend with your ex-girlfriend. There is no me in your heart. She is not my ex-girlfriend. Then you are what's relationship. Qingzi, don't worry.

491
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,720
I'll explain it to you slowly

492
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,620
Yes

493
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,910
 

494
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:14,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll clean it up for you right away

496
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,720
If I do it with her

497
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,430
Who will you help

498
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,290
I'll pull you away

499
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,400
Can't you stand up for me, rival what's price

500
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,500
I can't believe you are so cool and snobbish.

501
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,630
Do waiters deserve to be looked down upon

502
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,470
I advise you to eat inside and pick outside, then I will help you beat her savagely.

503
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,520
If we both don't calm down, what if something happens afterwards

504
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,090
I called the manager
