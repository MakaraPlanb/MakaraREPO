1
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,600
No appetite. What's wrong

2
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,000
I think we abuse dogs. It's not me who loses weight.

3
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,600
Losing weight is not your style.

4
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,610
Our Ling Xuan needs to eat more

6
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,550
Open one's mouth

7
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,880
Good boy, sweet

12
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,710
Score the last three shots

14
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,280
Good

15
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,740
Let's call it a day

16
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,980
Everyone adjust their status and continue tomorrow.

17
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,610
Try again in warm summer

19
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,560
I want to practice again

20
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,460
Everyone is under a lot of pressure when you are away at night, especially Shen Xuechang.

21
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,010
Good

22
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,730
Then practice another two-to-two

23
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,960
Go

25
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,870
Are you all right? How's it going, seniors

26
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,700
Mr. Shen, I'm sorry

27
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,200
Little strong ball, I subconsciously

30
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,050
It's okay

31
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,530
Play ball

32
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,090
There will inevitably be friction.

33
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,530
I'm a medical student

34
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,780
It doesn't matter if it's a minor injury

35
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,680
Then you remember to go back and wipe the medicine. Are you sure it's okay?

39
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,820
Your bruise is a bit serious

40
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,200
After I finish packing

41
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,580
Try not to use your left hand these two days.

42
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,700
A good doctor

43
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,110
Attention

49
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,830
This is the result of your research for three months. If you do another experiment, the success rate will be less than 10%.

50
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,360
What happened to your hand

51
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,350
It's okay. The teacher accidentally fell while playing basketball.

52
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,310
Tell me you have something so important that you still play what ball.

53
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,160
Teacher

54
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,540
This time I was distracted. I just wanted to start over.

65
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,230
How did you dial out

66
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,120
Feed warm summer

67
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,560
Is that you, Junye

68
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,210
Warm summer

69
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,550
Grandpa knew I was going to compete, so he kept me at home 24 hours a day.

70
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,510
Connect cell phone

71
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,990
Feed, feed

73
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,680
Warm summer

74
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,900
I can hear you

75
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,210
Grandpa knew I was going to compete.

76
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,130
Twenty-four hours to keep me at home

77
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,790
Even the cell phone signal was blocked by me.

78
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,160
I didn't mean not to go

79
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,410
Don't be angry

80
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,000
I know I'm not blaming you

81
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,170
I didn't know your grandfather was so opposed to you playing basketball. If I had known this, I wouldn't have forced you to join the Youth Dream Team.

82
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,470
I am sorry for you

83
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,240
King's Night

84
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,810
Are you still there

85
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,530
In

86
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,360
I don't regret joining the team at all.

87
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,010
I'll be back soon

88
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,850
You have to wait for me. I'll feed you soon. You speak up. I can't hear you. Hey, hey

89
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,850
The signal is not very good.

90
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,600
Jun night I miss you

91
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,910
Ah

92
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,360
You said what

93
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,320
I said I missed you. I missed you very much

94
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:28,800
You miss me

95
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:42,050
Yes, everyone misses you. Then I

98
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,260
You are not ashamed of Su Nuan's summer.

99
00:07:51,260 --> 00:08:04,470
What, what said

105
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,530
Somebody

106
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,050
Somebody

107
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,160
Is there anyone

108
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,020
Xiao Jun, what's wrong with you

109
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,920
I feel bad

110
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,540
Call me a doctor at once

111
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,140
It's too late. Let's get to the hospital.

112
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,120
Walk

113
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,960
Bring me the stretcher. Okay

114
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:52,010
Water, I want to drink water. Okay, okay, I'll be right there.

118
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,060
Received Received Not Received Exception

119
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,800
There he is. Come on

122
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,820
Immediately retrieve the monitoring to confirm the taxi license plate number

123
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,500
Shifu, stop in front of

124
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,410
So fast, it's only a kilometer away now.

125
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,540
Feed warm summer

126
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,100
Listen to me first

127
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,550
Now you go to the five-star hotel near the school immediately.

128
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,080
Take your ID card with you

129
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
Let's talk about the rest when we meet.

135
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,450
A bunch of people

136
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,360
Even a college student can't keep up with it.

137
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,600
What do you eat

138
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,240
A bunch of rubbish

139
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,410
This unfilial grandson

140
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,170
This is to make me angry and inherit the inheritance.

141
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,030
Chairman of the Board

142
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,770
I'm afraid Brother Xiaoye is not interested in inheriting the group, is he

143
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,130
I don't care what he wants

144
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,770
This legacy

145
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,060
He must inherit

146
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,460
I can't lock your men

147
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,450
I can't lock your bank card yet

148
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,670
You

149
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,360
Immediately

150
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,730
Stop his bank card

151
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,620
Yes

154
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,800
I'm telling you, your grandfather is too scary

155
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,820
Thanks to your wit

156
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,690
Can't escape, I said let you help me open the room

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,080
If I register with my ID card

158
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,420
My grandfather is sure to find out

159
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,720
Go ahead

160
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,420
With this card

161
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,260
Or this one

162
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,460
Go ahead

165
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,930
How do you do, Miss hello

166
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,720
Excuse me, miss.

167
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,040
It seems that you have stopped paying for these two cards.

168
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,220
What to do

169
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,700
No.33

170
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,780
What for

172
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:09,130
Now, as a penniless person, don't pick and choose for me here. In such a short time, I can find the nearest rental house to the school, which is the result of my personality explosion.

173
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,540
I think

174
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,600
I can still spend

175
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,160
Excuse me. Struggle for a while

176
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,470
Yes, if you can accept it, you can still apply for a naked loan.

179
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,780
Not bad

180
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,040
Hmm

181
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:52,100
In this extraordinary period, you, the poor and rich second generation, can only make do with me here, for the sake of the overall situation of the team.

182
00:12:52,180 --> 00:13:00,760
I have already taken out all my last savings to settle you, so please show kindness and show kindness to cooperate with this coach's work, ok

183
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,840
Coach Su

184
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,400
And I have something what needs to cooperate with

186
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,690
Clean it up first

187
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,950
I'm so hungry

188
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,930
Why don't you order takeout first? It's so poor. You eat what takeout

189
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,840
Hungry, huh

190
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,060
Go downstairs to buy vegetables

191
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:19,910
Economize

193
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:33,990
People like you don't understand the meaning of saving money in this vegetable market at all.

194
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,810
First of all, if you want not to be trapped, you need a reliable outfit.

195
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,740
Like what famous brand and limited edition, none of them can work.

196
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,940
Like the one I arranged for you

197
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,350
Beautiful

199
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,030
As a basketball coach

200
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,700
How do you know that

201
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,300
This is not in charge. I don't know that oil and rice are expensive.

202
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,890
Since the team was formed, Rabbit and I have been calculating these things every day.

203
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,870
And

204
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,060
Buying vegetables is like playing basketball.

205
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,040
The timing of the move is very important.

206
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,400
What Meaning

207
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,700
For example, in the morning, uncle and aunt were in a dark state. It was estimated that they could not be robbed.

208
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,790
This lunch is too expensive to give up.

209
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,550
Coach Nasu

210
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,060
Why should we come now

211
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,800
Now there is still half an hour before closing time, which is definitely a prime time when people are few, cheap and easy to bargain with.

214
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:47,170
Not only that, you have to judge whether the food is good or bad according to the state of the vendor. What dozes off and then plays with his mobile phone. Either the food is not good or the vendor is not authentic.

215
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,260
Give up decisively. Do you hear me

216
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,120
Young man

217
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,940
This cucumber is very fresh today. Do you want some

218
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,560
This is good

219
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,820
There is dew on this one.

220
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:04,310
Idiot, it's getting dark. Where's the dew coming from? If you want to say such common sense again next time, don't go with me.

224
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,040
Young man, pick some and sell it cheaply.

226
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:22,800
You see, this one can't do it either. The rope for tying vegetables is thick and long. There must be something fishy about it. What kind of vendor

227
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,600
To believe it

228
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,240
Just like a good player, the equipment must be clean and tidy.

229
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,940
Put it neatly

230
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,280
Go

231
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,200
Hmm

232
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,170
Would you like some tomatoes

233
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,570
Take it easy

234
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,520
Buying vegetables is like choosing players. You have to choose carefully.

235
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,300
Where's the tomato

236
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,780
Not if it's soft, not if it's too hard

237
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,270
Not too young, not too familiar, understand

238
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,710
What about this? Is this OK

239
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,710
Yes, I can

240
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,170
So beautiful, of course I want to stay and be a coach.

242
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,870
Thank you

243
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,260
What about potatoes

244
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,440
Potatoes, just choose the one of the right size.

245
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,310
Too big a tweed cut too long

246
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,160
It's too small and there are not enough cut pieces.

247
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:22,250
So help me with some potatoes. These are sweet potatoes, not potatoes.

248
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,160
Isn't that sweet potato

249
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,080
Are you an idiot? This is tomato and that is sweet potato

250
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,790
This tomato and sweet potato

251
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:39,770
Why is the name so like this? All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right

252
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,680
Boss

253
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,100
Help me figure out how much it is

254
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:48,770
Why do tomatoes and sweet potatoes have such similar names

255
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,740
Stupid

256
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,700
Potatoes 5.6 yuan

257
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,510
Six cucumbers

258
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,530
Seven pieces of green pepper

259
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,270
The tomato is 11 yuan and 4 yuan.

260
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,160
Just thirty

261
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,750
Thirty! Why is it so expensive

262
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,020
20 bar

263
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,030
I don't have enough capital for this

265
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,640
Then I won't

266
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,870
Thank you

268
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,660
In three seconds, I bet he calls us back

269
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,820
Three, two, one

271
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:29,130
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right

275
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,620
Hello

276
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,170
You're not

277
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,930
You are so professional in buying vegetables.

278
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,770
Although you can't cook, whoever tells you that you are a professional in buying vegetables will definitely cook.

279
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,910
Then why do you buy so much

280
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,870
Didn't I think the economy was not good?

281
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,040
And

282
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,670
The main reason is that it is cheap. Besides, I can't make salads.

283
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,380
I am really convinced of you.

284
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,940
Why

285
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,660
Tie me an apron

287
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,460
You can't tell tomatoes from potatoes. You told you to cook.

288
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,100
Hurry up

289
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,500
I don't want salad

294
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,480
Turn around

298
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,640
Lone men and few women suddenly concave this shape,

299
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,210
How do you feel a little flirting

300
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:01,170
Su Nuan Xia

301
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,400
All right

302
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,040
All right, all right, let me have the kitchen

303
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,800
Well, then I'll go clean up

315
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,740
Alas

316
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,760
Hmm

317
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,180
5

318
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
We don't know what to do.

319
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,340
Hmm

320
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:15,510
Hmm

321
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,360
How can Hua Bai order takeout?

322
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,960
You set it up for me

324
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,690
If life goes on like this

325
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,270
It feels good, too

326
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,400
Anyway

327
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,870
Thank you all this time

328
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,150
Coach took me in.

329
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,110
Who let me be your coach

331
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,880
When I was cooking

332
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,110
He also burnt the rice out.

333
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,820
Don't let you go to the expense

334
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,770
If I hadn't dragged you to the vegetable market, there would have been no such thing.

335
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,400
Don't talk about it

336
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,640
Can you stop drinking

337
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,100
The last time the phone signal was bad

338
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,160
I have a lot to say to you

339
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,500
He did carry this pot again.

340
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,000
What to do, what to do, who will help me

341
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,900
Yes

342
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,640
I haven't finished what I said last time.

343
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:21,630
I should have apologized to you for the last time. If I hadn't taken you to team training and matches, your grandfather wouldn't have been angry with you, would he

344
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,790
To drink

345
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,700
Why don't you face me when you like me

346
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,070
By the way, I haven't told you about the truth yet.

347
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,260
If she hadn't complained to your grandfather, you wouldn't do it now.

348
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,080
Warm summer

349
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,630
You've had enough of your night

350
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,810
I admit I like it. Are you satisfied

353
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,530
I-I mean, stop drinking and I have to take you home.

355
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,030
Why didn't you say so earlier

361
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,060
Hmm

365
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,640
Drink fragments again

367
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,950
What about your night

368
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,660
King's Night

370
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,000
You're going to be late

378
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,280
I believe you ghost

379
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:13,620
Lone men and women didn't return all night. What didn't happen. I told you, I really can't remember. I swear

380
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,680
If something happens, I will be the first to tell hello that it's not good.

381
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,680
Am I particularly ugly now

382
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,730
Do it for me

384
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,360
Isn't that the female coach of the basketball club

386
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,270
Not very good-looking

387
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:40,160
The figure is barely good, and the buttocks are quite warped.

388
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,890
Yeah, legs are quite long, too

390
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,280
Are you all right

391
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,440
How can you hit people casually at night? They both speak ill of you behind your back.

392
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,900
I just heard you

394
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,750
He should have hit you and secretly hit so many people to watch. Is it appropriate?

395
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,440
I will sue you

396
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,020
If you are a member of your family, you can hit people at will.

397
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,260
Just wait until you pay the compensation

402
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,200
I'll go

403
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,950
This watch is over 100,000

404
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,580
Then I'll beat Ben back. Stop it

405
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,680
Principal

406
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,240
Don't say any more

407
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,440
I am willing to make peace with my classmates at night.

408
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,340
This is also my fault.

409
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,460
I should have called

410
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,580
No matter what, fighting is not allowed at school.

411
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,630
King's Night

412
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,100
After that, you can go to the Academic Affairs Office yourself. Okay

414
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,520
Don't do it next time

415
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,480
Are you all right

416
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,630
Are you not hurt

419
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,040
Warm summer

420
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,910
Last night you

421
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,680
Su Nuanxia and Night God Are They what Relations

422
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,240
This is abominable

423
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,190
The night god fought for her

424
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,300
Is it what hype again,

425
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:30,080
Su Nuan's summer is too scheming, isn't it? In order to chase after the truth of the night god, what can do it. What about what?

432
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,260
No hype

433
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,140
Nor is it Su Nuanxia who actively pursued me.

434
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,100
It is Su Nuanxia that I actively pursue.

435
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
How is it

436
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,240
Can you shut up now

437
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,750
Night God, you are so handsome

442
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,390
We

443
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,630
Is this an official announcement

444
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,640
What are you doing blocking your face for

445
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,450
Is it

446
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,410
Shy I'm not

447
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,100
I just didn't brush my teeth or wash my face.

448
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,800
Can't see guests

449
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,760
Last night, your saliva and unkempt appearance

450
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,980
How cute

451
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,750
Then you can't make a surprise attack when I am so ugly.

452
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,300
Anyway

453
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,720
From now on

454
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,070
The whole school knows that you are Su Nuanxia and my girlfriend at night.

455
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:56,040
So you have to thank those nonsense people for giving you assists. They said what, I can't hear you.

456
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,850
I just want you to remember

457
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,240
I am Junye

458
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,900
I only love you

462
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,000
You, you go first

463
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,670
You should go first

464
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:31,600
You're both in front of each other

466
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,810
Hurry in for the meeting

471
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,240
First of all

472
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,620
Congratulations to our team for announcing another couple

473
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,390
Everyone is quack, quack, quack

474
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,580
What a long time we called and urged before she started toward us

475
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,710
Is

476
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:20,410
Even more than Ling Xuan, but then again, this official announcement is for the coach.

477
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,320
I don't know whether it's a good thing or a bad thing.

478
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,750
What you mean, what, has nothing to do with me

479
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,550
You see

480
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,080
Half a day

481
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,230
The school forum is full of coaches who scold coaches, which should also receive a lot of

482
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,320
SMS bombardment, yes

483
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,050
The circle of friends has not stopped in the past few hours.

484
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,780
The microblog is about to come up with a topic.

485
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,820
Are you all right

486
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:55,320
Isn't it just some swear words? How can you see a rainbow without experiencing wind and rain, right? Besides, I don't need to be unhappy because of these strangers.

487
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,900
However, because of these posts, I did have a harvest.

488
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,760
That is the important content of our meeting today.

489
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,400
Recruit new

490
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,710
A substitute

492
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,960
This has what relations with those posts. I followed the news of recruiting players after each post.

493
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,830
There are already many people adding me now.

495
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,200
It's still the old routine, coach. You have a big heart.

496
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,420
What a big heart

497
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,630
When the time comes, I will give all their news to the rabbit rabbit for unified screening.

498
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,380
If you add more substitutes, you will have to buy new equipment.

499
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,080
Will it cost a lot of money

500
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,560
My brother is trying to make a point of it.

501
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,290
This

502
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,750
There's a problem, what

503
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,520
Your grandfather stopped your card

504
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,560
It's okay. I'll introduce you to a part-time job.

505
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,750
Then we are not without sponsorship.

506
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,400
This is his usual trick.

507
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,510
If I had known, I wouldn't have thrown that watch away.

508
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,090
But it doesn't matter

509
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,810
I'll find a way

510
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,850
That won't work

511
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,830
We are all part of the team. We can't give you all the responsibility.

512
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,380
This is our most dangerous moment.

513
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,520
We must work together to find a way to work together even if we sell our bodies.

515
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:18,390
I mean, make some small advertisements, promotional films and so on. In short, our goal is to

516
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,760
Attracting Sponsor Dad

518
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,070
This later period is too difficult. It is more difficult than playing basketball.

519
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:37,010
Isn't this the first film of Qingmeng? Why can't it be perfect and amazing?

520
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,890
I've already registered my microblog number. Upload the movie quickly.

521
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,760
But take a what title, Qingmeng Basketball Team

522
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,460
Qingmeng Basketball Team's Highlights of Moments All Listen to Your Hard Work.

528
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,840
Too handsome

529
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,090
Oh, my God. And that's a good idea

532
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,120
This dunk is too handsome, isn't it?

533
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,780
What dunked. I didn't dunk

535
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,940
Is it

536
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,360
Master, show me

537
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:38,220
Why don't you show me the communication? There is nothing to communicate with. Go to practice quickly.

538
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,190
It's not as hard as looking at it.

539
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,920
Want to learn how is that possible

540
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,910
Dunk which is want to learn can learn

541
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,370
At your height, let's live in the next life.

543
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:57,090
If I can dunk in my next life, I will definitely beat you out of the water.

546
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,500
It means that you want to meet me again in your next life.

547
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,310
But it is also good to meet

548
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,860
Take it

549
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,210
What are you doing

551
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,200
Get your legs out of the way

552
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,080
Ah, ah, you

553
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,170
Don't move. Don't move

554
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:36,000
The air up there is good. Didn't you want to dunk? Don't wait for the next life.

555
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,100
I will help you today.

556
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,720
It was so enjoyable

557
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,870
You, you, you stop and wait for me to come down. You are dead.

559
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,860
