1
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,740
Here we go

2
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,890
Let's go, let's go, let's go

3
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,400
 

4
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,030
Why

5
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,320
I have no idea where to put you now.

6
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,650
I don't know where to put the player.

7
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,010
It was your failure as a coach.

8
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,070
It has nothing to do with me

10
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,040
 

11
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,970
Refueling

12
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,840
Come on, you see, Coach Han is here too.

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,980
Is that the new captain who has been transferred to play Qingmeng? Is that the new captain who has been transferred to play Qingmeng so seriously? You have come at night, you have come at night

14
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,050
 

15
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,860
 

16
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,860
Jungu Legion guards you. He is Qingmeng's ace night god.

17
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,160
Yes, but he is really handsome. I heard that he hasn't touched the ball in a long time.

18
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,900
Yeah, but he's really cute

19
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,090
Junye, this boy is really domineering.

20
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,990
When you were with them last year, you gave us a lot of trouble.

21
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,500
He plays too alone

22
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,350
I am in the same position as him.

23
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,400
He may think I robbed him of the captain's position. I don't know why Coach Su chose me and Coach Han why you chose me.

24
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,310
Is it different from what? If he were Xiang Yu, you would be Liu Bang.

25
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,950
And you are better at football skills.

26
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,940
Isn't it

27
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,140
 

28
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,460
 

29
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,560
 

30
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,380
No.4 Qi Feng

31
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,840
Height, 192, strong core strength, good at inside rebounding,

32
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,370
Last year's Qingmeng was also a center.

33
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,560
He is the same. I have an impression.

34
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,720
No.14 Shen Yingliang

35
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,270
The Old Captain of Qingmeng

36
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,640
It's a pity

37
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,810
His 3-pointer is very accurate, which is a pity.

38
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,730
Too long to touch the ball

39
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,380
Rust

40
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,000
No.7 point guard Zhang Xiaoqiang plays fancy games and responds quickly.

41
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,380
This

42
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,540
It should be a freshman this year. We can observe his characteristics in this competition.

43
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,760
 

44
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,420
The four of them plus Jun Night

45
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,880
Is Qingmeng's lineup today, Chu Ran, do you think

46
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,870
Can they beat our reserve team

47
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,610
Qingmeng's Discussion on Personal Ability Is Not Weak

48
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,870
But on Team

49
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,620
Is a mob

50
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,000
The reserves beat them more than enough.

51
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,590
The other day you fell on me at the school gate.

52
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,230
Do you know why I didn't fight back? Because you don't have the strength.

53
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,410
There is no point in fighting without an audience.

54
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,410
I'm going to let you lie down ten times on this court.

55
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,040
You're dreaming

56
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,720
A team that relies on bribes to win.

57
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,330
I think it's just hard-mouthed

58
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,360
Then let's see if the rest of us are hard or not.

59
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,650
Come on, you have to win

60
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,260
 

61
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,980
Defence

62
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,930
Bottom line

63
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,240
 

64
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,200
Shoot

65
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,810
 

66
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,680
 

67
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,460
Defensive defense

68
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,460
 

69
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,600
 

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,080
 

71
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,020
Nice shot

72
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,170
You got what

73
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,360
This kind of ball is not thrown, waiting for the Chinese New Year.

74
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,840
Do you hear me talking to you

75
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,340
Before the match was over, one of our own started to fight first.

76
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,960
I can beat him again if I win you. Then you have to have this skill.

77
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,070
Warm summer

78
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,530
What's the matter with Jun Night? It seems that he is in poor condition. He just started to move slowly by half a beat.

79
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,800
Night God, Night God, I Love You, Jun Mushroom Corps Guard You

80
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,740
 

81
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,230
Defence

82
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,300
Pick-and-roll pick-and-roll

83
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,470
 

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,670
Beautiful Zhang Xiaoqiang

85
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,440
 

86
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,820
 

87
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,890
You don't seem to be in the right state at night. No 
You don't seem to be in the right state at night. No 


88
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,790
Anyone is even a professional player.

89
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,430
Not playing for more than a year

90
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,440
The feeling of the ball will also collapse. You have faded out for so long that you have such a performance.

91
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,480
It's already a genius level,

92
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,840
 

93
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,000
 

94
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,120
 

95
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,300
 

96
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,180
You can't foul what. It's too fast to prevent.

97
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,720
There is no tradition of saying no in myth.

98
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,800
 

99
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,380
The ability at night is only half restored at most.

100
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,260
The rest is up to us.

101
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,710
You'll have the inside line

102
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,140
Qi Feng

103
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,220
All right

104
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,140
 

105
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,040
 

106
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,020
Hit the bottom line

107
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,560
 

108
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,100
What about warm summer

109
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,150
 

110
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,290
Ready to call a pause

111
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,260
You're right

112
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,890
Junye is still very strong,

113
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,600
It just lost its stability.

114
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,470
Lost its stability

115
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,710
The meaning of being a player is lost.

116
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,600
Not only is it Jun Ye Shen Yingliang, but some of their old players

117
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,160
It has been abandoned for too long.

118
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,740
That's why I said

119
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,180
Qingmeng's Basketball Circle

120
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,490
Already dead

121
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,920
 

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
 

123
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,200
End of pause time

124
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,920
 

125
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,460
We can't wait to die. We have to take action. They have too good a hand now. They can fight any way.

126
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:45,540
What should we do? The instability of your night sight affects your mentality, so the more you play, the more urgent you are. Your training intensity is not enough and your performance is not good.

127
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,010
Plus this is the opponent's home court.

128
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,240
So it's not surprising to play a downwind ball

129
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,200
Can catch a cold, I need tactics, don't need to analyze my tactics is

130
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,180
Ling Xuan will be the main player before the next pause.

131
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,680
 

132
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,580
Why do you make tactics around Ling Xuan because he is the only player that the other side does not understand

133
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,500
In addition, the physical quality is strong enough for these few minutes.

134
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,040
Just let him rush

135
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,200
 

136
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,440
 

137
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,560
 

138
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,500
 

139
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,360
 

140
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,720
 

141
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,730
Myth's No.15 thug fouled with two points and a valid penalty.

142
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,880
 

143
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,630
This number 10 is a bit interesting. Unfortunately, the basic skills are too poor. In our words,

144
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,090
His performance in the past few minutes is equivalent to forcing what to open.

145
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,880
Fast speed and strong impact force

146
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,520
In addition, they are all weaknesses.

147
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,960
This style of play is basically eaten raw.

148
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,070
Once physical strength drops,

149
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:07,270
He is a scum

150
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,000
 

151
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,590
 

152
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,750
 

153
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,320
 

154
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,360
 

155
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,800
A good shot

156
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,990
Ling Xuan's invincible state seems to be over.

157
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,470
No, he's still fighting

159
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,370
 

160
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,620
 

161
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,120
 

162
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,280
Ling-hyun's up to you

163
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,520
Come on, Ling Hyun. I believe you

164
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,090
Do you understand the scum of Qingmeng

165
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,040
 

166
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,360
 

167
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,180
In view of the current state of your night,

168
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,090
Is there any play in Qingmeng before half-time

169
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,440
Coach Han thought

170
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,280
Is he still the same as before

171
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,920
A good shot

172
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,830
 

173
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,920
 

174
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,080
 

175
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:01,030
Mama, you're a wall

176
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,800
Come on, everybody. Fifteen seconds left in the first half. One more point difference is a single digit

177
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,160
 

178
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,340
 

179
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,940
 

180
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,060
Stop him

182
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,680
Night God Night God

183
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,440
He is too strong, isn't he? He is really abnormal. The point is that he is too handsome.

184
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,780
This man is too skillful

185
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,040
Neither of them could stop him

186
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,800
Then the three Jun night balls are empty.

187
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,620
Univariate

188
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,400
It's no use

189
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,240
Why don't you say it's interesting to play by yourself?

190
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,030
What are you doing

191
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,840
Is infighting handsome? There is what dialect for me. Go back and say it.

192
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,300
Will you cooperate with you so well that you can play well and ask what teammates

193
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,450
 

194
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,230
Likes to be cool, right? Come on, Ling Hyun. Are you crazy? You're not

195
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,080
According to his play, there was no way to play in the second half.

196
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,460
If you don't want to fight

197
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,320
Can walk

198
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,560
Sit down

199
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,460
 

200
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,830
All right, you're done quarrelling

201
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,400
Now it's my turn to get down to business

202
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,600
Not less than eleven points

203
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,280
But it is definitely not that we cannot catch up with it.

204
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,440
As long as you follow my tactics, you will definitely be able to reverse the second half.

205
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,460
Although I am a Jack Bauer who claims to be undead, I encounter this kind of situation.

206
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,500
I think it is necessary for us to discuss it

207
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's be realistic and think about how to narrow the difference.

209
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,920
Anna should be disappointed

211
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,080
That's all you guys can do, right? I'm going to tell you again how to win the game

212
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,570
Indeed

213
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,880
We didn't have enough time to play the match and suffered a lot.

214
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,080
I studied the first half match with their play, which is the basic training formation.

215
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,250
Besides, any of you can win singles with them except Ding Lei, who is good at football.

216
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,470
Coach

217
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,940
This is not singles

218
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,370
We don't have any cooperation right now, so

219
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,080
We'll take this game

220
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,670
Turn into a one-on-one fight

221
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,620
Singles

222
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,530
The tactic is simple

223
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,360
It is called "Four Guarantees and One Tactics"

224
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,930
Let the four people outside the night hold down the four players of the Myth Reserve Team respectively.

225
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,200
Let Jun night fight one-on-one with the remaining player of them.

226
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,960
Chu Ran, if you can break four defenses and one defense on the court,

227
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,460
Ding Lei

228
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,120
Twenty seconds left

229
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,840
At this time

230
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,970
Both sides have reached the extreme.

231
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,500
As long as I keep the ball in possession for ten seconds, you will be finished. It depends on whether I answer or not.

232
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,610
Then you rob it

233
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,520
Awei

234
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,260
Watch what run

235
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,320
 

236
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,960
 

237
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,010
Your field

238
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,760
You are still fit to lie down.

239
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,620
It's over

240
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,200
You don't really want to go to the palace, do you

241
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,780
 

242
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,120
 

243
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,690
 

244
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,380
 

245
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,280
 

246
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,320
 

247
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,540
Warm summer, why don't you go to Qunliet and have a night god? Is he still coming or not?

248
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,860
Forget it. He won't answer the phone.

249
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,210
You still have the face to answer it if you play like that.

250
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,620
If it weren't for my brother's death today, what ghost

251
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,680
I lost early today, okay? A man called God

252
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,770
In the end, he won miserably.

253
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,000
If it were me

254
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,580
I'm ashamed to come. Don't say that

255
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,410
The somebody else Zhang Xiaoqiang also played very badly, which is not still very happy to eat

256
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,860
I was shot while lying down

257
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,580
 

258
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,760
Yeah, what time

259
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,900
 

260
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,200
Let's go somewhere else

261
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,130
You eat first

262
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:31,970
 

263
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,600
Situation in what

264
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,790
 

265
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,450
Xiaoqiang quickly brought the ball to the front court.

266
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,480
 

267
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,660
Your what Attitude at Night

268
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,990
You don't like it when I choose Chu Ran as captain.

269
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,080
Coach Su

270
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,260
No matter who is the captain, I will have no problem.

271
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,400
I will continue to cooperate with you at night. This kind of hypocritical humility is not needed.

272
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,300
I just quit

273
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,990
Junye, I know your personal ability is very strong.

274
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,260
But the team is everyone's effort. You have to control your emotions.

275
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,900
Churan is my first choice before I do it.

276
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,480
 

277
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,280
 

278
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,750
Is that what it feels like to be back on the pitch

279
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,970
Brother is not good warm summer was taken away by Chu Ran

280
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,840
 

281
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,540
 

282
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,580
In fact, I have been blaming myself all the time.

283
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,510
If I make that shot, we can beat Myth University to win the championship.

284
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,040
Will Coach Sue not leave

285
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,390
If there is no point in discussing these

286
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,410
My dad, he's gone

287
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,000
Basketball is still there.

288
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,240
It makes sense

289
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,710
So you left the struggling green dream and turned to myth.

290
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,580
Is it just to pursue your basketball dream

291
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,820
Yes

292
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,560
Coach Sue used to say

293
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,170
Basketball will shape us

294
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,040
I want to keep playing

295
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,520
I believe he will support me in the sky.

296
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,790
And I understand you

297
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,410
It's like

298
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,950
I also have my dream

299
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,640
My dream is

300
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,620
Let Qingmeng Rise Again,

301
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,480
That's the spirit

302
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,830
Then I

303
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,660
I sincerely wish you success. It's not irony.

304
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,280
It can't be

305
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,400
When you were a child, you always admired me blindly.

306
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,920
Now he has become tall and beautiful.

307
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,350
Don't even believe what your brother said, do you

308
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,920
 

309
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,320
 

310
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,780
 

311
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,130
Let's go

312
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,660
Brother, why did you come? Your daughter-in-law was abducted and Chu Ran bought roses to express himself.

313
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,280
 

314
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,380
 

315
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,470
In fact, I have always wanted to have a good talk with you.

316
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,430
It seems that I missed the first two times at Qingmeng University.

317
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,630
Sorry

318
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,540
I was too excited that time.

319
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,360
Since I decided to be a coach,

320
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,410
Is to have the momentum of wind and fire

321
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,200
Just like today you led the team to win our reserve team.

322
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,610
In fact, it is very good.

323
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,690
Come on

324
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,480
This bunch of flowers

325
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,120
I salute you

326
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,580
Why do I have a sense of accomplishment of adulterers and adulterers now?

327
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:30,470
Excited, what. Shut up. Excited. You're shaking. Are you

328
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,900
 

329
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,790
Too bad you're my brother

330
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,610
If the flowers are from someone I like

331
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,710
That's good

332
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,410
Warm summer

333
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,740
You like Junye, don't you

334
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,300
 

335
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,670
Actually, this boy is a nice guy.

336
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,240
It's just a little arrogant.

337
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,000
It is not easy to soothe him.

338
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,720
How could I like him

340
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,930
As you know, I am all about basketball now. I will not fall in love with him.

341
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,190
There is no conflict between playing basketball and falling in love.

342
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,560
And you will have a high degree of tacit understanding.

343
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,660
Maybe you will change your character for you at night in the future.

344
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,540
Speaking of which

345
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,040
I still want to play another match with such a king night.

346
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,060
Night God, this head is a little green.

347
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,090
Although I lost your competition, I can count what compared with your grassland.

348
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,370
 

349
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,340
 

350
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,360
 

351
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,620
 

352
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,980
 

353
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,770
You don't go to the celebration party at night. Why are you standing here

354
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,790
By the way, there is good news that I haven't sent it in the group yet. Do you want to tell you first? I told you that Chu Ran promised to let Myth's first team compete with us again?

355
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:03,730
The time is two months later, the place will be at our Qingmeng Basketball Hall, our main stadium.

356
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,380
I'm quitting the team

357
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,440
You said what

358
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,880
You joined the basketball club to keep the basketball hall, didn't you

359
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,860
Also true

360
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:17,860
The basketball court is now secured and you have no reason to stay here, what.

361
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,570
King's Night

362
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,490
Are you afraid of losing to Churan

363
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,290
Fear and myth

364
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,380
My business

365
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,840
Don't worry about it

366
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,320
Don't you want to get back on the field

367
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,460
As long as you train well, you will definitely beat Chu Ran. I believe you

368
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,270
 

369
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:48,820
 

370
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,420
 

371
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,960
 

372
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,160
 

373
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,990
 

374
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,220
 

375
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,890
You didn't sleep either

376
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:19,160
I-I-I just lost my sleep normally

377
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,180
You can't sleep at all

378
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,140
It's not because of Junye

379
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,320
 

380
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,960
My best friend is indeed in the same boat.

381
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,800
Who is in love with that megalomaniac crazy?

382
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,690
What

383
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,010
Then why are you insomnia

384
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,600
Jun withdrew from the team at night.

385
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:46,390
 

386
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:51,590
 

387
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:57,010
Today's meeting, uh, has two things to do

388
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,730
First of all, our match with Myth's first team has been confirmed.

389
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,950
Two months later

390
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,220
Right here on this field

391
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,620
Do you have confidence

392
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,510
Yes

393
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,410
Indeed as expected, a group of arrogant people were infected by your night.

394
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,130
Although he won yesterday,

395
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,650
But it was just the myth team reserve

396
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,330
There is a great difference between the strength of the reserve team and the official team.

397
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,570
Besides, yesterday we still won by a narrow margin.

398
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,630
Afraid of what

399
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,830
Isn't there two months left? Two months is enough time to change a team.

400
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,840
If what is confident or not, it will be over.

401
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,610
Coach

402
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,710
The second thing you said was what

403
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,120
The second thing

404
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,050
That is, we are going to recruit new players.

405
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,790
If you have a suitable one, you can recommend it.

406
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,040
This is very important. We didn't even have a substitute in the First World War yesterday.

407
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,350
New blood must be replenished as soon as possible.

408
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,110
There are more important reasons

409
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,610
Jun withdrew from the team at night.

410
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,610
Coach, rest assured that Ling Xuan will definitely protect you from victory.

411
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:01,850
If you don't like listening, you can also learn from Junye and quit the team.

412
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,550
Zhang Xiaoqiang

413
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,740
Ling Xuan chose him because he had a bad mouth. Don't be serious. If it weren't for protecting my sister-in-law from foreign enemies, I wouldn't play with such people.

414
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,960
 

415
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,580
First of all

416
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,140
Chu Ran is my brother who grew up together, not an enemy of what.

417
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,460
Secondly, Junye and I are only the relationship between coaches and players, so don't talk nonsense in the future.

418
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,450
Say it

419
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,280
You are all young and can't see the essence of your feelings clearly.

420
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,680
I prophesy

421
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,730
You will come back sooner or later

422
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,530
Whether he comes back or not

423
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,950
Anyway, we must win the match with Myth.

424
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,220
So

425
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,720
Starting from tomorrow, I will develop a special training method.

426
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,840
This training

427
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,690
Will be very strict

428
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,720
By the way, warm summer

429
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,060
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow. I may have to ask for leave.

430
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,780
Row

431
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,490
All but Mr. Shen must be present tomorrow

432
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,050
Especially you

433
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,730
Ling Xuan

434
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,410
Not allowed to work

435
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,860
 

436
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,470
Got it

437
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,320
 

438
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,060
 

439
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,980
 

440
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,040
 

441
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,600
 

442
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,780
 

443
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,000
 

444
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,810
 

445
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,460
You quickly rolled to train at night.

446
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,480
 

447
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,040
 

448
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,440
 

449
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,750
King's Night

450
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,990
Why do you get up so early on weekends

451
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,950
Come here

452
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,000
Have breakfast together

453
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,170
 

454
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,770
Why don't you answer the phone

455
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,000
 

456
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,930
 

457
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,470
Junye, do you want to reconsider your withdrawal from the team?

458
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,140
No

459
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,000
That what 
That what 


460
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,720
Why don't I just ask
