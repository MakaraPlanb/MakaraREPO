3
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,830
The little girl is very energetic.

4
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,440
Send it

5
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,260
What are you doing

6
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,300
Work

7
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,560
About the basketball team

8
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,810
Not enough for you

9
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,020
Put it down. Put it down

10
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,560
Don't bother me with my money

11
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,360
You are short of money

12
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,830
The basketball team has bought a new batch of equipment.

13
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,910
So I've been in negative equity lately

14
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,000
How much do you need

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,760
I give

16
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,120
As an independent woman of the new era, I will not ask you for money.

18
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:58,790
Why is this not what I said the day before, right? Is it true that the social atmosphere is not good and I am good at it?

19
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,060
Why do you let go

20
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,250
Put me down I won't

21
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,560
Hurry up

25
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,320
I sponsored it

26
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,550
All right, sponsorship

28
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,980
Then I can think about it

30
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,820
Walk, walk, walk

31
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,550
Easy to stop

32
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,440
Su Nuan Xia

33
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,120
Are you going to do what's strange training again? Don't worry, this is a surprise.

36
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,910
Turn around

37
00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:03,070
Thank you, your father, for saving the Qingmeng team in the mire. Thank you very much.

38
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,730
Thank you, thank you very much.

39
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,440
Beautiful. What are you doing

40
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:22,170
I've thought about the money you gave me for nothing. I can't take it, but if you are a sponsor, with the strength of our dream team, it will soon increase your income.

41
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,270
But at our current level

42
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,390
I can only make a friendship advertisement for you.

46
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,350
Come on, put it on

47
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,680
Let's take a photo to commemorate our first sponsorship.

48
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,800
First sponsorship

49
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,650
Is this okay? Are you ready? Is this okay? One, two, three eggplants

55
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,230
See no temperament super good seems to be very tall ah legs two meters long ah

57
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,760
I don't know who he's waiting for

58
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,120
I was waiting for Anna. No wonder

59
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,920
Lu Ye

60
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:26,870
You didn't tell me why you suddenly came over. This chocolate tastes good. I happened to pass by your school, so I turned over by the way.

61
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,330
I have inquired about all the low-fat ones.

62
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,580
Thanks

63
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,350
Or

64
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,670
Let's have dinner tonight

65
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,580
Okay, let's go

66
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:48,390
The three of us have seldom got together since we grew up. Why don't you ask Jun Ye to come together?

67
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,950
Forget it

68
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,750
He practices basketball every day now

69
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,950
No time

70
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:59,390
Don't you know that since Jun came back to the basketball team at night, the whole people have followed the magic.

71
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,210
I want to meet him now and say a word is very difficult, but this is too flat, isn't it?

72
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:11,570
Please help me do something. If you go on like this, you will become a stranger to me at night.

73
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,490
Brother Luye, help me. I'm dying

75
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,830
Don't you have a Jungu fan club

76
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,140
Just a little upgrade

77
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:33,070
Why do you run well?

78
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,400
What's going on here

81
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:48,630
Green Dream Green Dream

82
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,080
Su Nuan Xia, we have applied for Qingmeng's cheerleading team.

83
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,360
How about if you train that basketball team and we're here to cheer them up

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,240
That's a great idea. Okay, okay

86
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,170
Anna

87
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,040
You're fucking what again. Why do you say that? This cheerleader is part of the basketball team.

88
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,490
This Anna classmate has had friction with me before.

89
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,160
But I believe he is really good for the team this time.

90
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,270
Besides,

91
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,710
There are so many beautiful women in Qingmeng Cheerleading Team.

92
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,500
How cool the competition will be then

93
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,120
Su Nuan Xia

94
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,410
I can't see. You still have some insight. That's

95
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:38,560
You can be here, but we are training now. Please go outside in an orderly way.

96
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,690
Good

97
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,960
Let's go

98
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,620
You'll be sorry

99
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,930
Our Xingmeng University basketball team is playing basketball

101
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,440
Here

102
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,840
Uh, sorry, sorry, it's time to train, it's time to train

103
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,250
Excuse me. Excuse me

104
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,580
Off-site off-site off-site

105
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,780
Night God, Night God, Night God

106
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,540
Night God, Night God, Night God

107
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,760
Night God, Night God, Night God

110
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,400
You have also seen the situation in what these days.

111
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
Can you negotiate with the cheerleaders

112
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,750
Don't show up when we're training

113
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,470
When the time comes, you can play whatever you like.

114
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,330
It is useless for me to say what now.

115
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,390
Everyone already knows that you are training here.

116
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,020
It was also for this reason that I joined the cheerleading team.

117
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,920
Good

118
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,380
Then we are all leaders. You know my difficulties, right

119
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,400
How beautiful

122
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,680
I think I was completely defeated by you

123
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,470
I worked so hard to plan such a cool confession drama.

124
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,270
How can you be all right

125
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,780
It means you're stupid

126
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,860
I'll go

127
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,020
You are like a wood. You still have the face to talk about me.

128
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,820
Let me ask you something

129
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,230
The Pit Digged by Su Nuanxia

130
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,410
How are you goe to solve it

131
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,140
You mean the cheerleaders

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,540
Isn't that good

133
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,190
Men and women are not tired of working together.

134
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,430
There are still so many beautiful women with traffic,

135
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,120
At least Qi Feng is very happy

136
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,610
With the current quality of training,

137
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,880
How to Fight Myth

141
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,910
Hello

142
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,610
King's Night

143
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,360
How about that cheerleader

144
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,090
It was your idea

145
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,870
How

146
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,230
You've figured it out for Anna now

147
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,940
This young master's thoughts will not be guessed by you.

148
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,890
Such as

149
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,380
I found you a new training ground.

150
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,420
I can carry my bag and check in tomorrow.

151
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,860
Come on, Rabbit, Rabbit

152
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,580
Oh, my gosh

153
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,670
It's so big

155
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,210
Jun Dashen, this resort will not be your property, will it

156
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,230
This is from my friend's house

157
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,710
The environment is good

158
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,180
The place is also large, which happens to be training with everyone.

159
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,190
The point is that there is no interference.

160
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,030
I can't wait to start training. Come on

164
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,800
King's Night

165
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,810
Is your friend also a basketball player

166
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,630
The basketball facilities here are so complete that they all look like they are specially set up for basketball training.

167
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,580
Do I know your friend more than that

168
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,030
I have fought before.

169
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,750
To tell you the truth, this is the training base specially built by Lu Ye for Myth Basketball Team. Lu Ye

170
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,600
He seems to be the captain of myth and the training base of myth.

171
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,940
That's the enemy camp. Now it's one of our own.

172
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,000
Lu Ye and I are good friends.

173
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,690
Since Chu Ran went to the Myth Team

174
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,860
He dropped out of the team

175
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,180
This time

176
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,690
Is to help us train

177
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,320
What about the people who beat the myth

178
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,940
I went shopping at the foot of the mountain.

179
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,560
It's expected to be there in a few minutes, waiting for what

180
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,400
Let's move

183
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,000
Wait a minute

184
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,600
Come on, come on

188
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,160
Ladies and gentlemen

189
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,910
Are you tired after practicing for so long

190
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,530
Come and have a rest

191
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,280
Right, right, right

193
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,790
You must be Lu Ye. Thank you

194
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,710
Thanks, handsome

195
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,110
This orange juice is my favorite

196
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,960
Thank you

197
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,280
King's Night

198
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,520
This is your girlfriend hanging on the teaching building.

199
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,150
Hello, my name is Su Nuanxia, and I am the coach of Qingmeng Basketball Team.

200
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,420
The coach is still a woman.

201
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,240
As soon as you listen, it looks like a follow-up. It doesn't matter to you if you have a follow-up.

202
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,390
Warm Summer Do you mind if I call you Warm Summer

203
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,980
Let's talk about it

204
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,080
How did you two follow up

205
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,760
You know too much

209
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,620
You didn't have time to hire the best chef for you at the time of your night's notice.

210
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,300
You can make do with it. No, no, no, no. Thank you, handsome boy, for the reception.

211
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,150
Anthomaniac, don't I have the right to admire handsome men yet?

212
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,220
Is it possible to just look at you, a guy who has no interest, every day?

213
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,180
You are not my girlfriend. I have a what interest in you.

215
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,050
I didn't expect you to be cold at ordinary times.

216
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,400
Your friend is quite hospitable, isn't he

217
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,480
You are too naive

218
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:15,390
Rabbit, look, that shrimp looks delicious, but we can't scare the host for the first time, can we?

219
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,680
You said that in warm summer, it is better to start directly.

220
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,500
Not good

221
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,180
What for

222
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,220
You look like you want to eat that

223
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,570
I haven't been to practice all day.

224
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,590
You didn't come to class at night. Where have they all gone

225
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,580
Lu Ye

226
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,580
Do you know where you went at night

227
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,850
Let me tell you something, lenient to those who confess and strict to those who refuse

228
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,900
Du Resort

229
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,590
Su Nuan Xia

230
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:46,848
Su Nuanxia actually lived under the same roof with you at night.

231
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,420
Hello

232
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,040
Get me a car right now. Come on

233
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,090
He said that he would train today and all of them would lie in bed with me.

234
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,930
Morning, warm summer

236
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,560
Eat breakfast early

237
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,420
Finish training

238
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,050
Good

239
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,720
Do you know if you have to train today

240
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,430
Hurry up

242
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,320
This early morning can't give people a good rest. Last night, you slept like a pig and had to rest.

243
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,800
Change clothes and go to training quickly.

245
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,520
All I know is that training is fast.

247
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,130
Get up, get up

249
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:56,450
Anna, why are you here? You didn't arrange the training yet. If I don't come to Jun Night, I will really be abducted by Su Nuanxia.

250
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:02,490
I'm just borrowing the venue. Training is their business at night. I don't care.

251
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:10,130
They have all gone to training now, and you should get up quickly. That has something to do with me, what. I am not a member of the Youth Dream Team. Of course it has something to do with it.

252
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,280
You have to help me arrange the logistics.

253
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,720
Come on, come on, come on, get up, get up

254
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,180
Come on, come on, come on

255
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:32,540
When I get back, I will repair them all, leaving me and Jun Night alone.

256
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,730
Let's have a rest. I have prepared snacks for everyone. Let's come and have something to eat.

257
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,770
Take a break

258
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,920
Thank you, Anna. Then we're welcome.

260
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,680
It is very expensive to eat.

261
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,530
Every time you eat, your most active school flower sister is really persistent in coming to the resort for you.

262
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,620
I will prepare afternoon tea for you all day long.

263
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,180
Charismatic

264
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Junye, this is especially delicious, and I am personally responsible for it.

265
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:13,840
I thought I told you not to prepare these. That's not enough. People like Su Nuanxia and Xiao Tutu

266
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,230
How is it possible to take good care of you

268
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,820
These are the most expensive and delicious things of mine.

269
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,800
These have no food safety problems at all.

270
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,240
Why can't we take care of them

271
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,540
You

272
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,630
Be sure to eat this high-calorie food.

273
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,920
What's the matter? I remember someone said they would break up with milk tea.

274
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,350
And he must not see dessert on the training ground.

275
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,680
I am not an athlete. I am a coach now.

276
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,860
It is even more important to take the lead

277
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:53,600
Clearly, this is my highlight. Why is he the only one in your eyes at night?

278
00:18:53,670 --> 00:19:02,070
But these are all I've prepared, Anna. I-I don't matter. I can eat them.

279
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:10,310
As a coach, I can't even eat, let alone you. Su Nuan Xia, don't go too far. You can't let others eat with what.

280
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,360
Anna

281
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,960
You come with me

282
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:22,380
What are they doing

284
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,070
In the future, when we train,

285
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,890
Why don't you come with me

286
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,150
King's Night

287
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,810
I really don't understand this time. I will definitely prepare low-calorie food next time. If you are here,

288
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,980
Some people get distracted

289
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,860
Then I am naturally beautiful and have my own eyes and what methods.

290
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,040
You night, I will be able to watch silently next to you, right?

291
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,010
King's Night

292
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,740
You said that

293
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,680
Is it because Su Warm Summer

295
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,150
You have been like this since you were a child.

296
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,070
As long as you get angry

297
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,920
To find someone else's reason

298
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,230
So Lu Ye still lets you

299
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,920
This has what relations with Lu Ye.

300
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,480
Think for yourself

301
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,840
King's Night

302
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,600
I like you so much

303
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,940
I have also done so many things for you that I would never have done before. Is it better for Su Nuanxia than for what?

305
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,780
Including bribery of myth reserves

306
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,880
You

307
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,310
How do you know that everything has to have a degree?

308
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,350
I don't want you to interfere with our training any more.

309
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,780
It is good to know for yourself.

312
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,750
Only Su Nuanxia and I know about this matter.

313
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,900
Su Nuan, I'm not finished with you in summer.

316
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,310
I heard that Anna was upset by the night god again today.

318
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:58,810
I'd better not express my opinion on this sensitive topic. This is getting darker and darker. If you really have nothing to do with the night god, will anyone come after you to declare sovereignty?

319
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,930
You see, you see, the battle for sovereignty is like that. He's staring at you with his nostrils now.

320
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,250
Nonsense

322
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,160
Thank you

324
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,640
You told Anna about what, but he has lost his temper with me for half a day.

325
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,520
Why did he come to you so soon to complain? It's not a complaint.

326
00:21:31,154 --> 00:21:36,154
Just say that you maintain Su Nuan summer and like Su Nuan summer and so on.

329
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,490
No way

330
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,450
You really like Su Nuanxia

331
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,990
If I like warm summer

332
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,160
Wouldn't it be a good thing for you

333
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,340
So is that

334
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,320
But actually

335
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,760
You don't have to tell Anna. I can see that you are very different to Coach Sue.

336
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,250
How long has it been since you played? This time, I brought the team to training.

337
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,120
Absolutely for women

338
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,350
While eating

339
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,540
You brought him food. I don't believe it. I didn't see it with my own eyes.

340
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,590
I was just saying that if

341
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,190
People can change

342
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,080
It doesn't mean I like him

346
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,050
Where's Mr. Shen

348
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,710
He seemed to have a problem with his graduation defense and went back first.

352
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,280
Why is the atmosphere a bit strange?

353
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,160
You didn't even see Anna firing at you

354
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:46,050
Eat, eat, eat, eat, you said the person who set the dishes was really

355
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,350
Why do you put your favorite shrimp in warm summer so far every time so far, isn't it? Jun night

360
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:11,370
Thank you. I come by myself. Sometimes it is not convenient for girls to pick up food.

361
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,160
There is something what wants to eat.

362
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,410
Despite the opening

364
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,840
No more

367
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,370
Everybody's up

368
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,220
Something has happened

371
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,050
How did you get up

372
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,840
What are you doing

373
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,180
Don't sleep

374
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:03,160
Why did Lu Ye have to call us down in the middle of the night? It was very difficult. There was what.

375
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,040
Welcome show Anna's not back yet

377
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,740
It was already dark when he went out on this mountain road. I think he was lost.

378
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,580
Did you call him

379
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:20,690
He didn't even take his cell phone out. Why are you waiting? It's so dark on this day. Go out and look for it. I have prepared two cars. Jack Bauer, you drive mine.

380
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,640
You bring warm summer at night

384
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,610
This is the hell of a place in what

385
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:49,190
Why can't you go around for half a day?

389
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,190
Why, there's a barricade ahead

390
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,500
I'll go down and see if I'm with you

391
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,820
Anna

392
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,910
Stop shouting and change the way

393
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,070
Take another road

394
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,300
Why can't it be opened

395
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,880
The key was left in the car

397
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,350
What should I do then

398
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,740
Take another walk and see

404
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,230
Anna

405
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,760
Anna Anna Anna

406
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,820
Anna, where are you, Anna

408
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,790
King's Night

409
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,410
How long do you think we have to go

410
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,610
We drove over

411
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:59,420
Twenty minutes to walk back, at least an hour. God bless me

412
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,720
Let's meet Anna on our way back, and they'll all be happy.

415
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,060
Maybe even if we find him

416
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,620
I can't sit in a car.

417
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,580
You have to walk back on your own

418
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,270
Do you think they have found Anna

419
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:28,000
Don't worry, Lu Ye will find her.

423
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,240
You better wear it. I'm not cold

424
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,560
I don't want to be happy

425
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,110
You have a cold

430
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:09,900
It hurts. This is the hell of a place in what

433
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,080
Anna Anna Anna

434
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:23,320
Slow down, hurt your ankle, you'll be in trouble. Where can she go in the big night? Where can a girl go?

435
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,850
Anna Anna

436
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,540
Who, who, who, who

439
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Anna Anna Anna

441
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:45,030
What are you doing here? Why are you bastards looking for me

442
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:53,580
All right, all right, don't cry. It's ugly. You're ugly. You stay away from me. Anna can't walk. I'll carry you. I don't need you to carry me.

446
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,900
Tie Hanhan

447
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,170
You'd better give up

448
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,600
Life is so real. Get out of here

450
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,930
Let me tell you a joke

451
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,520
The little fish asked the big fish

452
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:23,730
Big fish, big fish, what kind of small fish do you like to eat? Then the big fish said that I like to eat small fish that speak slowly.

453
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:31,170
Then the little fish said how about this

454
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:35,600
After laughing, do you feel warmer? I feel colder.

455
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,060
Then let me think again

456
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,980
Warm summer

457
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,940
Actually

458
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,790
On that day's confession spray painting

459
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,240
Brother

460
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,480
Anna

463
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
You're finally here. It's freezing us to death.

466
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,190
Coach Sue, ladies and gentlemen

467
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,620
To thank everyone for helping me find Anna last night

468
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,240
I decided to offer a free sparring service.

469
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,690
Help everyone to improve the quality of training. Don't you just want to play ball because your hands itch?

470
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,780
Ling Xuan

471
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,510
You have never fought with Lu Ye.

472
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,670
I don't know the meaning of his condescending to practice with him.

473
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,580
Nani

474
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,510
Does Lu Ye have what's stunts

475
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,810
To put it simply

476
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,900
Luye's ability is perfect simulation

477
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,120
Although her own style of playing is a mystery, it can perfectly duplicate anyone's unique skills.

478
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,940
Even shine on you is so powerful

479
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,030
I don't believe it

481
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,440
One to One

482
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,720
This

483
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,400
This what style of play

484
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,950
Lu Ye is now simulating

485
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,100
The main force of the myth team is Gu Yuan's eagle throw.

486
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,710
Although the name sounds very secondary,

487
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,120
But there is no way to prevent it.

489
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,980
On behalf of Anna to blow you up, that's not necessarily true.

492
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:23,350
If in the official competition, Ichichen Jiang's move must be a dunk.

493
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,320
Lu Ye is playing away

495
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,460
Enough fun

496
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,880
It's my turn

497
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:38,750
Do you dare to do it again

498
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,290
What he is simulating now is

499
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,690
Myth Team Point Guard Bai Yin

503
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,570
No way

504
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,370
We can't even get a copy

505
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,310
What about the official competition

506
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,880
It's time for the last player to play

511
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,190
What a lovely killer whale, look

513
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,840
Beautiful bird of paradise, like a rainbow

514
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:36,600
Beautiful corals are picturesque

519
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,700
I like the way you read carefully.

524
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,890
But you keep interrupting me

532
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,820
The fireworks convention in Japan is really beautiful.

534
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:07,060
I should do some what for such a beautiful fireworks conference.

537
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,930
What do you think I'm going to do

540
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,670
You are too talented, aren't you? I am more talented in my studies.

541
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:29,560
I don't want to learn

546
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,140
What are you doing

547
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,120
I am just lazy and want to see pictures to relieve my boredom.

548
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,700
I have always wanted to go to the fireworks conference in Japan.

549
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,730
Will you stay with me

550
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,280
I also want to see

551
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,160
Picturesque corals, rainbow-like birds of paradise

552
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:09,080
Lovely killer whale, then you heard all the nonsense I just said.

553
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,940
Not a word of what you say is useless.
