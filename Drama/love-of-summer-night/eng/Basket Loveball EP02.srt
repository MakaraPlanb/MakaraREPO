1
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:12,925
What?

2
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,050
Jun Ye is entangled by other women\

3
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:17,050
Outdoor basketball court

4
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,625
Wait, I'll be right there soon

5
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:20,425
She should entangle Jun Ye

6
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,650
She doesn't know me, Anna

7
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:26,100
Outdoor basketball court

8
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,175
What's happening?

9
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:35,850
Where's the woman entangling Jun Ye

10
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:36,900
There

11
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,075
So fast

12
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:04,750
Please be a professional judge

13
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,475
Don't stay too close to the court

14
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,150
If it were not for me

15
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,725
and he made the shot

16
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,875
Chu Ran couldn't have defended him

17
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:14,950
Stupid Judge

18
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,925
You are just helping Chu Ran

19
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:19,275
Now it's Chu Ran's turn to attack

20
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,150
Shen

21
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,975
I'll modify your best move

22
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:42,675
to salute to Qingmeng which I will leave

23
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:44,175
Shen

24
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,500
Is this your famous move

25
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,550
Super far three-point shot

26
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:48,100
It is not the same

27
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,000
This three-point shot

28
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,200
has no knee bending

29
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,125
The most important thing of super far three-point shot is the take-off height

30
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,125
Using taking-off to power the shot

31
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:55,925
Jun Ye hasn't played for too long

32
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,775
He forgot

33
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,075
No matter how good your skills are, if you don't practice more

34
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,850
you will lag behind

35
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,675
I have to say that Chu Ran wins this shot

36
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,600
Jun Ye

37
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,325
Am I born to chase you

38
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:25,925
Jun Ye

39
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,775
I don't know why you quit

40
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,800
But now

41
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,925
Don't you want to have a real

42
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,250
battle with Chu Ran

43
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:32,625
And win back the things you lost

44
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:35,650
Come back, you can do this

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,800
None of your business！

46
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:41,725
What's your problem

47
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,050
Think about this

48
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,800
Let's put this beside first

49
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:57,000
Schoolmaster

50
00:04:58,175 --> 00:04:59,725
It's the decision of the council

51
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,075
Can't you see we are in a meeting

52
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,400
What's your name, what is your major

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,550
Sport Management, Su Nuanxia

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,725
Su Nuanxia, you are the daughter of Su Li

55
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:17,025
Su Li

56
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,100
Isn't he

57
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,575
Minister, you go first

58
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,525
I'll find you later

59
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:22,600
Schoolmaster, how about dismissing the basketball club

60
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,650
Let's talk later. Close the door

61
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:25,425
Me

62
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,250
okay

63
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,350
Nuanxia

64
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,500
I've seen you when you were a child

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,025
You've grown up so fast, have a seat

66
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,000
Schoolmaster

67
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,425
I heard that they will dismiss the basketball club

68
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:49,525
and reconstruct the stadium

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,275
I'm surprised that you know so quickly

70
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:54,975
Since last time

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,925
we lost the game to Shenhua

72
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,200
You father

73
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,375
the team dismissed

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,700
the students of Qingmeng University

75
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:05,275
have lost their passion to basketball

76
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,425
The basketball court has been in vain since then

77
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,600
but also require a significant amount of maintenance

78
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,125
Is there no turning around

79
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,750
It's the decision of the council

80
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,525
Can you fight for this

81
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:19,150
I want to

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,250
But Nuanxia

83
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,925
you have no team members

84
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,700
How can I convince them

85
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:25,950
That's easy

86
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:27,775
As long as we have the basketball club

87
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:29,400
we will recruit members

88
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,275
You know

89
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:32,025
A lot of people are passionate with basketball

90
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,875
What about the coach

91
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,250
I'll be the coach of Qingmeng Basketball Club

92
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,300
I will go to the end with them

93
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,925
Schoolmaster

94
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,600
I didn't do this for my father

95
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,125
but also for myself

96
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,075
If I don't try

97
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,300
I will regret it all my life

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,150
Qingmeng has the potential

99
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:54,725
We shouldn't give up basketball

100
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,950
So please give me a chance

101
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,225
Give me

102
00:06:58,225 --> 00:06:59,775
and give Qingmeng a chance

103
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:05,300
But in order to save the basketball club

104
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,525
the first thing you have to do is to gather a team

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,850
That's easy

106
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,775
and you have to lead them to defeat Shenhua University

107
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,675
so that I will have the advantage

108
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,250
to convince the council

109
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:17,975
Thank you, schoolmaster

110
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:19,750
I'll not let you down

111
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,975
Let's go to every room and deliver our flyers

112
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:28,300
We can't let any masters go

113
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:29,225
Let's take them all down

114
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:30,150
You're so tough

115
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,000
But now we have to find another master

116
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:37,150
Go!

117
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,125
Hey boss, is Ling Xuan here?

118
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,250
What do you want for drink?

119
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,325
I mean, is Ling Xuan, your deliver boy, here

120
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,050
What do you want for drink?

121
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,625
Two cups of latte, thanks

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,725
Here's the situation

123
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,025
Usually at this time,

124
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,850
few people order take-outs here

125
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,125
So Ling Xuan will come later

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,650
Okay, we'll wait here

127
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,450
Then bring us a tiramisu

128
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,525
Ok

129
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,925
Nuanxia, do we continue

130
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,325
Yes, we have to find him

131
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,775
Why are you still here?

132
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,425
I forgot to tell you

133
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,125
Ling Xuan just called

134
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,875
He said he won't come today

135
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:48,900
You...

136
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,500
Don't be angry

137
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,700
Come on

138
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,175
I'll give you two VIP cards

139
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,725
20% off next time

140
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,325
It's you again

141
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:32,500
I'm here to ask...

142
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:35,625
what do you think of joining the basketball club?

143
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,150
Hey, don't be so boring

144
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,250
Boring? I'm longing for talents

145
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,525
I say for the last time

146
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,650
I'm not interested in basketball, please go

147
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,275
What's the sound

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,525
Is another girl breaking in

149
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:54,650
Say I'm not here, please

150
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,075
Ye, open the door, Ye

151
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,100
Aunt, Jun Ye is not here

152
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,850
I'm here for the Wi-Fi

153
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,700
It can't be right

154
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,300
I saw a girl coming in

155
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,750
She must be hiding

156
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,550
Find with me

157
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,450
Aunt, aunt

158
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,450
What's this

159
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,900
This is your rematch against Chu Ran

160
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Solid line represent you

161
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,300
Dotted line stands for Chu Ran

162
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,375
And then the triangle is a disguised breakthrough

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,650
Circle for shot

164
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:34,375
You did well

165
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,925
Of course, I'm professional

166
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:38,100
How is it?

167
00:10:38,225 --> 00:10:40,300
Do you want to join?

168
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,500
It's easy

169
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,375
Just fill in the Application Form

170
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,325
Toilet contract

171
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,925
It will be a legend of our history

172
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:56,150
What's the sound

173
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:57,825
It must be from next door

174
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,225
It's okay It's okay! It's okay!

175
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:02,650
Aunt, aunt

176
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,050
How dangerous

177
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,050
If you're caught, you've had it

178
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,125
Don't scream, I'll get rid of it

179
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,900
You look afraid

180
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,875
How can I be afraid

181
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,700
Then why are you shaking?

182
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,725
How come? I will step on it

183
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,075
Coming

184
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,225
Where's aunt?

185
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:39,400
Lucky for you

186
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,450
She just left,

187
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,300
otherwise

188
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,775
you can be dispelled for ten times

189
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,475
It's a misunderstanding, you know

190
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,050
I came for basketball

191
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,075
Are you okay?

192
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,475
You get out

193
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,600
I don't want to repeat

194
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,450
I'm impressed, Nuanxia

195
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,700
You break into Master Ye's dorm for the second time

196
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,325
It's useless

197
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:16,500
He still refused

198
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,725
It's right

199
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,275
It's not that easy to convince players

200
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:22,225
See

201
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,450
I sacrificed a lot to convince Ling Xuan

202
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,200
My gosh

203
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
He worked so hard

204
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:32,725
Doesn't he have to study

205
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,325
According to my investigation,

206
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,925
as long as it's not against the law, and it can make money

207
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,400
he's done them all

208
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:40,800
No exaggeration to say

209
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,100
He earned money from everyone in Qingmeng

210
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:46,100
Have you thought of how to take him down

211
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,500
As the VIP of eating

212
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,600
I can make him suffer

213
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,200
form living

214
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,250
According to my investigation,

215
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,425
the cafe we went to last time

216
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,325
Ling Xuan is in charge of the delivery there

217
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,600
If we order a take-out now

218
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,925
He will be the one to deliver

219
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:19,500
Hello, I'd like two cups of Hong Kong-style milk tea

220
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,500
Hello, I'd like two cups of Tapioca milk tea

221
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:54,600
Hello, I'd like two cups of Milk green team

222
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,625
Hello, I'd like two cups of Kumquat lemon tea

223
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,625
Stop

224
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,525
Xiao Tutu, do you want to drink milk tea like water

225
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:35,925
I paid

226
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,825
Miss, this is sixth floor

227
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:40,600
Do you know how many times I've come to the sixth floor?

228
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:43,800
I'm warning you, stop

229
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,075
Ling Xuan, as long as you join the club,

230
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:50,125
we will let you go

231
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,925
You can keep this going if you are not afraid of gaining weight

232
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,525
I can change my job

233
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,500
It's alright

234
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,550
I have Plan B

235
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
This convenience store

236
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:12,575
is another play Ling Xuan works for

237
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,700
Hello, does Ling Xuan work here

238
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,850
Do you know when will he come

239
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:25,300
I know, let me

240
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,650
When does Ling Xuan

241
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,775
work here

242
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,000
Usually after 10:00 a.m.

243
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,075
That's right

244
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,000
Such abnormal work intensity

245
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,975
Nuanxia, do you think he skips classes

246
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,050
I'll eat this

247
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,425
Nuanxia, Ling Xuan's here

248
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,125
Nuanxia, are you okay?

249
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:30,375
schoolmaster

250
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,500
get up

251
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,300
Ling Xuan

252
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,025
schoolmaster

253
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:37,975
Doing part-tame work is a good thing

254
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,125
But you have to walk slowly

255
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,900
and be careful

256
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:41,425
Thank you schoolmaster, bye

257
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,125
Hold on

258
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,450
What's wrong, Nuanxia

259
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,050
Schoolmaster, I think

260
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,275
Ling Xuan is a computer science student

261
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,550
He has a lot of classes

262
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,325
He has no time for part-time jobs

263
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,675
So I don't think

264
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,725
this is a part-time job

265
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,950
He must be skipping classes

266
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:57,575
I...

267
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,300
Ling Xuan

268
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,050
If you don't attend classes often, you can't get credits

269
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:01,325
You understand this, right?

270
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:05,050
I'll have the counselor keep an eye on you

271
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:07,449
Don't schoolmaster

272
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,749
I'll go back for classes

273
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,125
Yes, Ling, it's not good to skip classes

274
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,050
You are something

275
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:15,299
You'll know about me when you join the basketball club

276
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,825
As long as you join the team,

277
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,925
you can have credits

278
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:19,299
and there's scholarship if we win

279
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,700
You will also have time for classes

280
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,900
You deserve that

281
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,450
Scholarship?

282
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,275
I heard that Master Ye has a girlfriend

283
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Do you know who she is?

284
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:49,325
I saw it on the Post Bar

285
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,650
Is it true?

286
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:53,800
Beauty, Jun Ye has a girlfriend

287
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,550
Do you want to consider me

288
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,075
The schoolmaster has said

289
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:00,400
if we can't recruit members,

290
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,525
we can't establish the association

291
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,050
If we can't establish the association

292
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:04,925
They will reconstruct the stadium

293
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:09,050
As long as we have the club, we can save the stadium

294
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:20,125
It's not a good thing to take photos of girls in secret

295
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,275
If you like Coach Su

296
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,325
I think you'd better tell her openly

297
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:26,725
You are so gossip lately

298
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,350
You ordered so many food

299
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,250
to recruit this delivery boy

300
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,650
You got good taste in humans

301
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:44,525
To recruit members,

302
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,050
you don't even care about your figure

303
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,825
You really sacrificed a lot

304
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,425
You have to think twice

305
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,675
It will be troublesome

306
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:56,450
Come on, let's go find her

307
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,625
We will have an exam in this class

308
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,750
120 min for you

309
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:07,475
The score will be included in credit

310
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,325
How come?

311
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,525
So unlucky, it's dark when we finish the exam

312
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:15,675
Let's find Coach Su tomorrow

313
00:19:23,225 --> 00:19:24,175
I'm not in a hurry

314
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:27,500
100 minutes left

315
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,200
I can't hand in a blank paper

316
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,925
I have to finish this, even though I don't know anything

317
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,525
Is that okay?

318
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,000
Jun Ye, you can hand in the paper

319
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,700
Thank you, sir

320
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,175
Fighting, Nuanxia

321
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,825
Su Nuanxia is having a PE class

322
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,825
How can I run into her everywhere

323
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:14,300
Enemies on a Narrow Road

324
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,925
How dare you smash me

325
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,650
You are so cheesy

326
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,400
Why don't you carry the bricks if you have so much strength

327
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,175
Yes, you can't be compared to our Anna

328
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,550
Do you feel shameful to entangle Jun Ye with your looks

329
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,075
Who are you?!

330
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,100
Nuanxia

331
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
is so much better than boy crazies like you

332
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,125
You just chase around Master Ye all day

333
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:42,600
Fangirl

334
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:46,350
What? forget it, punch her

335
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,525
What are you doing?

336
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,050
Who are you beating?

337
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,325
What are you doing, you fangirl

338
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,625
Hey, what are you doing with my hair

339
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,150
You fangirl

340
00:20:58,275 --> 00:20:58,950
Beat her

341
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,800
Su Nuanxia is the heroine in the picture

342
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,450
hugging Master Ye

343
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,825
Awesome

344
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,925
Master Ye likes this type

345
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,675
You fangirl

346
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,225
You fangirl, fangirl

347
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
You hit me?

348
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,700
Take off you hands

349
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:28,650
Jun Ye, they bullied me

350
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:30,325
You said ill words first

351
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,375
Is that Master Ye?

352
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,800
Can you keep an eye on your fans

353
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:35,725
Go back first

354
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:38,200
Lu Ye is finding you, call him back

355
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,825
I...

356
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Follow me

357
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,725
Wait for me, Jun Ye

358
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,575
Nuanxia, you did something big

359
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,875
It's real between Jun Ye and Su Nuanxia

360
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,325
I didn't expect that Anna is meaningless one

361
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,575
Xiaoqiang, lock the door

362
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:09,875
Why? Is there anything you can't say outside?

363
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,550
I can help you find team members

364
00:22:12,225 --> 00:22:13,075
You want to join?

365
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I won't

366
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:16,725
But in order to save the stadium

367
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:18,300
I can help you

368
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,800
I want you,

369
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,550
not your help

370
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,125
Except me

371
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,800
I can give you anything

372
00:22:25,825 --> 00:22:27,525
I don't want anything besides you

373
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,650
It's an Internet Era

374
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:34,575
I've posted the recruiting notice on the Bar of our school a long time ago

375
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,175
There should be many replies

376
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:42,350
Jun Ye

377
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:46,525
is in love with Su Nuanxia

378
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,050
They left in public hand in hand

379
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:51,150
There's a picture, there's a truth

380
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,325
How's this hand in hand

381
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,050
It should be like this

382
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,825
What are you doing?

383
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,100
I didn't blaming you for dragging me here

384
00:22:58,875 --> 00:22:59,725
If it were not for you,

385
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,950
how can I be in love with you

386
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:04,850
We have to make it clear

387
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,450
This bar has high reputation

388
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,675
Why doesn't anyone reply to me?

389
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Clarify, this is Su Nuanxia

390
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,875
I will restate that

391
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,850
I have nothing to do with Jun Ye

392
00:23:27,675 --> 00:23:30,375
Qingmeng Basketball Club

393
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:36,525
will start recruiting tomorrow

394
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:41,650
If you have a basketball dream,

395
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:44,875
let's hold hands

396
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,525
and bring Qingmeng back to the peak

397
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,700
You must not speak for her

398
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:58,550
You all pay attention on the entertainments on the bar

399
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,375
What's the problem of I looking at beautiful girls

400
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:02,900
Don't blame this all on us Mushrooms

401
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,850
We didn't

402
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,700
Little sun, big dream

403
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:07,875
What a cheesy name

404
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,375
Students of the Department of Physical Education work out every day

405
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,725
How could she watch these

406
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,725
Little sun, big dream

407
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:16,050
Is she a fan of Jun Ye

408
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:18,125
She should change her profile photo first

409
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:19,150
People of our Department of Physical Education

410
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:20,800
will not use such a cute picture as our profile photo

411
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,700
Don't clarify here randomly, just be your cute girl

412
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,250
This

413
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,550
Yun Ye's fans

414
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,525
What are you up to?

415
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:35,850
I'm helping you clarify

416
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:38,975
I'm Jun Ye

417
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,075
I'm Jun Ye

418
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,075
I had nothing with Su Nuanxia

419
00:24:47,675 --> 00:24:48,525
From today on,

420
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:51,000
don't let me see these absurd things

421
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,350
They are really together?

422
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,525
Is this real?

423
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,075
It can't be true, my gosh

424
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,450
How is it possible

425
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:16,050
It's real between Jun Ye and Su Nuanxia

426
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,450
It can't be true

427
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,450
I'm so surprised today

428
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:26,975
Su Nuanxia

429
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,900
I didn't expect that you haven't gather a team,

430
00:25:29,425 --> 00:25:31,125
but found a boyfriend for yourself

431
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,425
and you broadcasted officially to the whole school

432
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,050
He clarified that there's nothing between us

433
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
You know nothing at all

434
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:39,650
Sometime things get so messed up

435
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,600
Do you think Master Ye is really interested in you

436
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:46,450
How could it be?

437
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,875
Then why would he

438
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,300
clarify this

439
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,550
I think he did that on purpose

440
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,625
Wait for tomorrow

441
00:26:11,425 --> 00:26:13,825
Brother, look, the Bar is messed up now

442
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,075
They are all gossiping

443
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,500
There are only about ten replies about basketball

444
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,200
They should talk about basketball now

445
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,025
Basketball club is recruiting new members

446
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,150
Have a look

447
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,700
Have a look

448
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,050
Basketball club is recruiting new members

449
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,100
Basketball club is recruiting new members

450
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,125
This, thanks

451
00:26:45,825 --> 00:26:47,325
Qingmeng Basketball Club is recruiting new members

452
00:26:48,825 --> 00:26:50,925
Have a look

453
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:54,575
Send this to them and ask them to sign up

454
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:56,225
Do you understand?

455
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,975
Yes

456
00:27:03,775 --> 00:27:04,925
Have a look

457
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:11,500
500 each

458
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:13,175
After signing up,

459
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,725
remember to send your photo to the group

460
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,575
Do you understand?

461
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,450
I got it! I know!

462
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,475
That's impossible

463
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,125
The reputation of me and Jun Ye is so high

464
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,925
How come no one's here to sign up

465
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,725
Maybe comparing to basketball,

466
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,550
they are more interested in gossips

467
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,850
And that annoying Anna

468
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:36,450
She posted a message in the bar

469
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,250
in the name of Head of the Arts Department

470
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,650
saying that she doesn't like basketball

471
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,450
and clubs should focus on cultivating our temperament

472
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:45,925
She's the beauty queen

473
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,475
She has a lot of followers

474
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:51,325
So I did this for nothing

475
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,075
No

476
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,450
You have Master Ye as your boyfriend

477
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,375
You...

478
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:58,450
I want to sign up

479
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,700
First come, first served. I came first

480
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,800
Hurry up

481
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,425
Sign up!

482
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:02,975
Don't try so hard!

483
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:04,450
We will make this Application Form

484
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:05,925
Fill in your personal infounding

485
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:06,625
Give me one

486
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,325
Help me pass this, thanks

487
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:10,925
Fill in these infounding

488
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:16,800
Brother, is this okay?

489
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,950
They can't play basketball

490
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:20,325
We have no time

491
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,925
We have to save the stadium

492
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,000
The stupid club

493
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,350
will sign up for the club

494
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,925
Yes, Anna made a statement

495
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:32,175
Who dares to sign up

496
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,875
The Jun Ye's fan club sent a message, see

497
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,775
Let me see

498
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,400
What are they doing?

499
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,050
Nuanxia

500
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,050
I've seen your passion,

501
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,625
but in order to join the basketball club,

502
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,225
you have to pass some tests

503
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:57,100
Tests?

504
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,175
Will it be difficult?

505
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,600
Is it so troublesome to join a club

506
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:03,000
Relax, just some small tests

507
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,475
Go

508
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,425
All right, guys, stand up

509
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:39,850
That's great

510
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,750
Congratulations! You three

511
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,525
You can take the second test

512
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,950
More?

513
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,175
Take it easy, everybody!

514
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,000
Just an easy test

515
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,800
Your activates core muscles lacks strength

516
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,925
Leg explosive force is not enough

517
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,025
Look at your shoulder

518
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:12,525
You can't stand a little bump on the court

519
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,400
No

520
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,100
Go! Go! Go!

521
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:21,425
Nuanxia. If it keeps going like this,

522
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:23,600
we can't recruit anyone

523
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,900
There's still people coming

524
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,025
I, I...

525
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,825
I want to sign up

526
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:30,375
Fill in these infounding

527
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,325
OK, ok, ok

528
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,125
Hey, were you here before

529
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,650
Yes, I remember you

530
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,725
You didn't pass the first round

531
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:40,925
Was I here? No, I wan't

532
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,925
Do you know what are they recruiting

533
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,125
A weird man

534
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,375
He gives us ￥500

535
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
as long as we sign up for the Qingmeng Basketball Club

536
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,025
Do you think he's stupid

537
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,250
Yes

538
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:58,825
Thanks!

539
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,250
Thanks!

540
00:31:04,675 --> 00:31:05,225
Come on, let go!

541
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,225
We don't recruit girls

542
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:07,025
I can do nothing

543
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:08,725
It hurts

544
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,125
Who are you? Why are you messing up here?

545
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,275
Stop!

546
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:20,300
Couch Su, what a coincidence!

547
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,275
￥500 each for these people

548
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,100
You gathered every kind of people

549
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,200
But no one is suitable. What a waste of money

550
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,925
Su Nuanxia, my brother was trying to help you

551
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:43,925
Fewer but better

552
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,525
These people can't join the basketball club

553
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,125
What are you doing?
