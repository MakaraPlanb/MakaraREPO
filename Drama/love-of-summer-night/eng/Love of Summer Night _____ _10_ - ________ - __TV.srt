1
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,610
Come on, we can't even get a copy

2
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,390
What about the official competition

3
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,170
The last player is ready to play

6
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,040
You win when you grab the ball.

11
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,090
This is too fast, isn't it? I can't see their movements clearly. Is this Xia Ze's ability?

12
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,800
Not only do I have to break the ball

13
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,950
And score on your head

14
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,950
Anyone can brag

16
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,540
King's Night

17
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:08,392
It's great to win, isn't it? Do you want me to forget it and use my own skills to play one-on-one with you?

18
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,890
We're running out of time

19
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,840
And you're out of the team

21
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,360
I don't think I can play with you either.

22
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,980
All right

23
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,410
But Qingmengguang depends on you alone.

24
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,720
It must be as ugly as it is to lose.

25
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,600
Lu Ye is right

26
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,380
With our present strength, we will definitely lose in a month and a half.

27
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,650
But you seem to be very confident.

28
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,480
Because there are two other time strategies that we can strive for.

29
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,170
There are many things we can do in the next 45 days.

30
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,170
Warm summer

31
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,520
You really have the aura to be a coach.

32
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,800
I'd like to hear it

33
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,360
Do you have any what countermeasures

34
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,130
I haven't thought about it yet. Let me talk about it first.

35
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,420
First of all, center Jiang Yichen

36
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,200
If Lu Ye's simulation is right, it means that he has very high physical talent.

37
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,070
For this kind of gifted player, we must play clumsily and skillfully.

38
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,720
Qi Feng, if you want to win, he must have a thorough understanding of the simplest moves.

39
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,450
How do you say it

40
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,420
I haven't figured it out yet, but it must be the right way.

41
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,420
Very interesting

42
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,300
What about Gu Yuan

43
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,770
As long as he touches the ball, he will become a shot. It is difficult to defend. Then we will also play a ghost. Interference before he shoots.

44
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,860
Lu Ye is right. Just cut off Gu Yuan's air operation route.

45
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,930
There's a chance. So I think your chances of winning have improved a lot.

46
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,810
Really

47
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,500
From zero percent

48
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,250
To 0.1 percent

49
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,680
As long as there is a little chance, we can't give up.

50
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,920
By the way, the road show

51
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,850
You just played four people

52
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,510
Who is the counterpoint with Shen Xuechang on the myth side

53
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,820
It's me

54
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,680
I am both the core trump card of myth and the all-round triple breakup, but now that I quit the team, myth has no triple breakup.

55
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,050
Next

56
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,540
It depends on how you make an issue of this short board.

59
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,880
Chu Ran

60
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,180
I don't quite understand

61
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,780
I am a power forward. Why did you pull me so far out of the three-point line to practice three points?

62
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,390
Just try ahead as I told you

63
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,350
Footsteps

64
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,990
Trunk

65
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,430
Breathing

66
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,940
It's easy to take a walk.

67
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,350
So powerful

68
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,900
How do you do it? No matter how far away the three points are, they are also thrown by hand.

69
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,260
All you have to do is coordinate all aspects

70
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,850
Nature follows its course.

71
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,240
Again

73
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,780
Thank you, Chu Ran

74
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,280
Not the captain

75
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,560
Xia Ze

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,300
In this myth team

77
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,570
You have the greatest potential

78
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,670
In my absence

79
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,070
You are the core

80
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,370
Captain, are you kidding me

81
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,590
You will be promoted to the core by throwing two or three points.

82
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,680
Then I can also compete for the core.

83
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,750
Old rules

84
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,790
One to One

89
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:03,160
Although the goal is arduous, this training is quite fruitful.

90
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,090
Let's have a toast

93
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,240
This is the second cup

94
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,350
To us

95
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:27,780
Mr. Lu Ye, thank you for providing us with this free training ground.

97
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,420
Coach, slow down. I'll drink first

98
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,120
No, no, no, thanks to you, we

100
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,860
In order to eat the flaw of silver, right, so this cup is to be drunk together.

102
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,750
All right

103
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,750
Would you like a cup of tea

105
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,860
Come on

106
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,160
After drinking this cup

107
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,320
And a third

110
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,430
Come on, let's have a toast

112
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Don't let her drink

115
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,080
How did you get out

116
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,570
I came to see you

117
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,440
What's the matter

118
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:31,120
I brought you good wine to celebrate the success of our training.

120
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,520
Come on

124
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:46,949
Luye's wine is really hard to drink.

125
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:55,600
No, I think it tastes good. Today is the last day of training camp.

126
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,800
Is that how you want it to end? Otherwise

127
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
How else is it gonna end

128
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,980
Actually, I-I've been trying to tell you

129
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,820
Thanks to you

130
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,630
Otherwise, there would be no basketball club today.

131
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,500
What for

132
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,560
Do you want to

133
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,020
Sacrifice, Mr. Jun 
Sacrifice, Mr. Jun 


134
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,790
I just want to have a good drink with you.

135
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,370
Warm summer

136
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,790
You're drunk

137
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,610
Do you think I look good, Junye

139
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,220
Deceive people

140
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,740
Then how did you hang the spray painting at that time

141
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,280
Choose such an ugly photo

142
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,300
So

143
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,070
You know, wait a minute

145
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,590
Stop drinking

146
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,920
You don't understand

147
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:07,950
How can you make me drink? How can you make me drink again? How can I make you drink again?

148
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,020
There are some things I have to drink too much to dare to talk to you.

149
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,580
You want to say that what

150
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:46,300
Shall we swap? Shall we swap

151
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,680
First of all, let's take you yesterday

152
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,600
Tell me what you haven't finished on the mountain.

155
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,860
In fact, the warm summer expressed me that day.

157
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,000
I like you in warm summer

161
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,080
Coach Jun got up at night,

162
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,660
Let's go back to school.

163
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,810
Here we go

164
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,080
Last night

165
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,010
You go first

166
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,040
Last night

167
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,360
How did I get into the room

168
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,300
Your night warms summer.

169
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,980
You must kill Chu Ran for me so as not to waste this young master's special training for you.

170
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,580
Don't worry

172
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,360
Rabbit Rabbit

174
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,110
Let me tell you something

175
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,070
What's the matter? It's so serious

176
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,520
That day

177
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,580
After you and I got lost at night

178
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,820
He told me, bullshit. He told your banner

179
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,060
I think

180
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,090
I seem to like him

181
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,430
What

182
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:07,060
You like things in what on the night of the monarch. Why don't I know? Calm down. The situation in what

183
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,460
You told him, too

188
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,640
There are some things I have to drink too much to dare to say to you.

189
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,790
You want to say that what

190
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,000
Shall we swap

192
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,900
Can you

193
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:35,450
Tell me what you didn't finish on the mountain yesterday

194
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,100
It's not a confession, is it

195
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,680
After all, the situation in what, forget it, let's talk to you in detail later.

196
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,600
Yes

197
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:56,780
He just sent me WeChat saying what to do if he asks me out to play after the training. You're dating now. What, dating. Don't talk nonsense. I haven't decided whether to go or not yet.

198
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,640
Why not, chief

199
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,470
I'm the coach. All right, all right. Don't give me the what coaching stuff.

200
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,120
If we talk about it again, we will go to the top of "Three Principles and Four Virtues"

201
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,980
By the way

203
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:26,890
I'm telling you, what you need most now is not only the mind's eye, but also the mind's eye.

204
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,860
That's it

207
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,980
Let's go with this. This is a little more compatible with your skin color.

208
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,400
Why do you have to wear a skirt? It's not comfortable at all.

211
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,780
It is uncomfortable to wear a skirt.

212
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,030
How do you know

213
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,140
Both skirts and clothes look good.

214
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,830
Where are you

215
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,160
Raise one's head

225
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,670
Coach, I can't believe I'm dressed up as a woman today.

226
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,610
Yeah

227
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,690
Why is he wearing a skirt

228
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,410
He

229
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,680
This skirt is of average tailoring

230
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,650
The color in the cloth is still tacky, straight men are aesthetic, so don't talk to me. Do you think warm summer looks good at night?

231
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,710
Why are you standing here

232
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:03,030
There are 44 days to go before the myth of the decisive battle. I hope everyone will show 100% spirit on the court.

233
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,520
Jun Ye and Ling Xuan Group

234
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,020
Zhang Xiaoqiang and Qi Feng Group

235
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,110
Half-field 2-segment 2

236
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,760
Let's go. All right, come on

241
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,140
Good

242
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,220
Defence

243
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:50,250
Coach, I said you are abusing power for personal gains now.

244
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:56,850
You're not bashful to say that I don't know whose cell phone is full of Ling Xuan.

245
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,360
Just keep your mouth shut

246
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:04,430
But I heard that the first person a boy looks at after scoring is the one he likes.

249
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Are you filming me

250
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,570
I don't have any

251
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,470
I'm not just filming you

252
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,440
Besides, I am the coach. What's wrong with the players?

253
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,540
Bring it

254
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,100
What

255
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,130
Why are you so stingy

256
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,060
I took a little of it. It's not this

260
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:48,020
That's the end of today's training. Everyone, stay where they are and disband.

262
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,280
No, we're 15 minutes from the end. Shut up

263
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,400
Coach, he's quick

264
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,880
Everyone usually has hard training. Let's go to bed early today.

265
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,280
That's it

267
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,780
Did the coach take the wrong medicine today? If it was normal, he would have to delay it for half an hour.

268
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,320
I seem to have discovered a great truth.

270
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,950
I also found out

271
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,720
Isn't it

272
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,190
Anna didn't come today

273
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:29,030
Really? It's hopeless

274
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:41,730
When the team came back on the first day, you followed. Why did I send the team new sports equipment?

275
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,230
Do you still need the permission of your coach Su Da to enter?

276
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,430
Thank you for your equipment

277
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,860
As I said before, your cheerleaders can come and cheer at any time.

278
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,910
So long as we don't interfere with our train

279
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,120
Let's finish today. Just leave your things in the office early.

280
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,000
It's over. Today is so fast. I have something to do later.

281
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,090
Good

282
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:09,140
OK, then please get out of the way. I don't need you to teach you. You're sweating all over at night. Let me wipe it for you.

283
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,040
No

284
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:18,090
Jun night, I brought some sports equipment to the team. Can you help me take it in?

285
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,360
Qi Feng, they're inside

286
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,760
Me

287
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,060
There are still some things

288
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,550
Let them help you

289
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,420
King's Night

290
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,430
Rabbit Rabbit

291
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,930
How is the warm summer going recently? Is the club going well?

292
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,620
Brother Chu Ran, are you spying on military intelligence

293
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,910
I think you can go straight to warm the summer. That's not enough. I just care about him.

294
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:07,630
I'm afraid he will think much. Really? Is my words so unreliable?

295
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:15,340
You don't even know how good warm summer has been recently and you have a handsome and rich boyfriend.

296
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Who knows it well and asks, of course, is the first male god in Qingmeng,

297
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,880
Your night

298
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,720
They are quite a match.

299
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,760
I bless them

300
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,970
Is it true that you are duplicitous

302
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,170
You must be very frustrated now

303
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,760
Rabbit Rabbit

304
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,070
You and warm summer will always be my sister.

305
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,660
That's good. Today, on your first date with Warm Xia, you changed your clothes specially in late summer.

306
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,330
They should have a good time. I'm curious where they go on dates. I know. Why don't I take you there?

308
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,370
This shop is very interesting

309
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,710
As long as it can break the record

310
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,920
You can get free of charge.

311
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,490
Every time I come here

312
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,590
Almost all of them cost no money.

313
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,160
How

314
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,480
To compare

315
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,890
I'm telling you

316
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,090
You can't underestimate my shooting skills now. Maybe you will lose.

317
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,800
So let's

318
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,750
Compare one to one

319
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,070
To compare is to compare

327
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,540
That's awesome. It's a record-breaking one. Yeah

328
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,300
How about you? You're the best

331
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,180
Why are you so small? Did you just release the water? It was agreed that there would be fair competition.

332
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,510
No, one more round. You're not waterproof

335
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,950
Both of them are good at pitching. They match well.

336
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,710
Rabbit Rabbit

337
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,940
It's not easy who you think is better than me or Junye. You'll know if you try it later.

340
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,430
Someone broke the record so soon.

341
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,160
So powerful

342
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,840
I'd like to see it's what

343
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,290
How can it be that two of them

344
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,300
Rabbit Rabbit

345
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,760
What are you doing here

346
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,620
Brother Chu Ran said he wanted to come to you, so I brought him here.

347
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,240
Night God

348
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,340
Nice shot

349
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,400
You can do the same

350
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,880
Do you want to do it again? No problem

352
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,760
I had a good time today, so I'll see you on the court next time.

353
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,310
Yes

354
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,810
I hope I can be in Qingmeng's basketball hall.

355
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,850
Convince you to lose

356
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,320
It depends on whether you have the ability to force me to play.

357
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,810
You mean you don't take part in the first team matches, too much, Brother Chu Ran.

358
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,960
Without my mythical basketball team

359
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,580
It is not something Qingmeng can fight against.

360
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,480
Yes

361
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,820
We'll see

362
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,440
I'll get you to take that back

363
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,200
Let's go

364
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,260
Rabbit Rabbit

365
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,280
Why aren't you with them

366
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,710
I don't want to watch them sprinkle dog food.

367
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:52,340
Then you may have to take a taxi by yourself. Suddenly there is something on my side that I can't take you. It doesn't matter. Go ahead and do it. Bye

368
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,020
I'm right across from you

378
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,270
Why are you looking for me

379
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,740
Let me get this straight

380
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,000
You like to send Su warm summer, don't you

381
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,380
I also hate that Su Lengxia is too close to you at night.

382
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,720
So

383
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,060
We will form an alliance.

386
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,520
Anna's having dinner tomorrow night

387
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:53,870
Which one said this is to thank Zhang Xiaoqiang and Qi Feng for saving him from the barren hills and mountains during the training.

388
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,680
What about a special dinner for the whole team?

389
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,290
No

390
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,740
Why is it a little strange? It's not only strange

391
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,820
I think he wants to start the second round of the battle for the night god.

392
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,630
How about the progress of you and Night God? Do you dare to synchronize with me? We just went to the video game city together.

393
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,850
Don't you know everything

394
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,720
My elder sister said this and I was angry.

395
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:22,040
Besides training, dating, you two are still romantic in basketball.

396
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,480
What about the surprise

397
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,090
Where is the provocative wall east?

398
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,460
We're not dating, are we

399
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,860
And he didn't say he liked me

400
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,000
You two can't take it

401
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,820
No wonder Anna came out as a demon.

405
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,370
Enjoy it as you please. Don't mention it.

406
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,280
Think of me, the cheerleader, as a sympathy to everyone after the training.

407
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:01,530
Didn't you have a little conflict with Coach Sue? How can you

408
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,200
Coach Su and I are both members of the Green Dream Basketball Team.

409
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,350
We should be tolerant of each other.

411
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,010
Thank you, Anna, for your hospitality and support

413
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,960
Then remember to give me my job number when you check out later, and I'll give you a 20% discount.

414
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,200
Haoqi Feng

415
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,330
Why are you looking at people all the time

416
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,320
Tell me if you want to change places

421
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,320
Chu Ran

422
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,630
What are you doing here

423
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,430
Excuse me, can I sit here

424
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,420
Not allowed

425
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,700
Anna's classmate

426
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:02,300
Is this Myth University star also your guest? Yes, Mr. Shen, I just met Chu Ran downstairs.

427
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,340
He took the liberty of inviting him up for a drink.

428
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,890
Captain,

429
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:13,080
Thank you for facilitating the match between the late Qing Dynasty and Myth. I would like to propose a toast to you first.

430
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,880
Hmm

431
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,960
Old Xia.

432
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,970
Well, we haven't been to dinner for a long time. Come on.

433
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,920
You forgot the last time

434
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,150
About the resort?

435
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,800
Oh

436
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,940
Then I'll stop drinking. Come on

437
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,800
It doesn't matter, I don't like forced master songs, what am I doing with you in Ma Xian,

438
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,950
Are you thirsty about what? Alas, you don't have to worry about it,

439
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,260
Whoever cares about you.

440
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,660
Hmm

442
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,780
Excuse me, miss. Excuse me. Excuse me

443
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,160
Did you say you served me? You scared me. Sorry

444
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,850
Sue, don't go too far in summer.

445
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:08,900
Coach almost ran into a waiter. It 's your business, what. Eat your fish

446
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,420
Jango Anna cares about me

447
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,530
Let me eat more fish, then you will obey and eat more.

448
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,850
Do you like to eat more shrimps in warm summer

449
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,670
No

450
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:29,160
You like to eat shrimps in warm summer. There is a bowl of seafood soup. There are shrimps in it. Let me put some for you.

451
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,860
What likes steamed shrimps, fried shrimps and salt bureau shrimps just don't like soup, soup, water and your shrimps in warm summer.

453
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,490
You eat it yourself. Don't worry about me.

456
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,300
Thank you, Brother Chu Ran. When you were a child, you were very selective and liked shrimp very much, but you didn't like Bo. You pushed it to me every time.

458
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,350
Waiter

459
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,330
Give me ten shrimps with Longjing tea. Yes, sir

460
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,500
Brother Shifen

461
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,340
Why do you order so many shrimps

462
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,640
Here we are

463
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,440
I'm afraid I can't eat it all. It's better than those shrimps peeled by hand.

464
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,270
But also can eat directly

465
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,940
The air is full of victories and defeats that you have not seen for a long time at night. Rich ah, peeling shrimps for your own people has what trouble.

466
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,380
Besides, these shrimps are also peeled by people.

467
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,240
Things have been simplified.

468
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,680
On the contrary, it does not show that what's mind is something that individuals can do.

469
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,720
Can embody what's new ideas

471
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,830
Don't argue. I like shrimps and shrimps

472
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,900
I can eat it. Zhang Xiaoqiang eats it.

473
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,560
Then I'm not at all welcome. Eat it, eat it

478
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Elder sister, is it necessary to argue? I'll see if you can answer it or not.

481
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,790
It seems that I am redundant.

483
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,480
Don't run

484
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,120
The defeated general is jealous and jealous.

485
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:38,110
Is it not just to send water? I have what, but I am jealous and jealous. I am not only jealous and jealous. I am not only jealous of sending water. I pay attention to who I pick up or who I don't pick up.

486
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:44,010
It may be that you will let me take someone = water and wait for him at the edge of the field later on night.

489
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,390
Yes, you will never send you any more water after night.

498
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,700
This

499
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,930
Is it for me

500
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:29,380
You took Anna's

501
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,400
I didn't want to realize a dream of Qi Feng.

503
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,620
Next Water Delivery

505
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
Remember not to keep me waiting too long

507
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,110
Hold the water and wait for me

509
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,100
Before I finish my practice

511
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,480
You are not allowed to leave
