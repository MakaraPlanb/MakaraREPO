1
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,160
 

2
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,640
 

3
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,540
Why don't you answer the phone

4
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,720
Hello

5
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,800
Do you want to reconsider your withdrawal from the team

6
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,100
No

7
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,140
That what 
That what 


8
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,040
Why don't I just ask

9
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,280
 

10
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,730
I said, do you like me? Otherwise, if I date Chu Ran, why did you quit the team?

11
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,280
 

12
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,620
 

13
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,910
By the way

14
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,220
Today I have a tea date with my good friend Ann

15
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,880
You can go too

16
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,450
All right, Grandpa

17
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,920
 

18
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,070
Please

19
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,100
Mr. Jun, old hello, hello, please sit down and have a good seat.

20
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,760
 

21
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,760
Is this Jun's night

22
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,020
General an

23
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,660
Uncle Good hello

24
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,580
 

25
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,740
This is my daughter Anna, who was in France a few years ago. Hello, Grandpa Jun.

26
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,750
Please take care of it

27
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,870
Junye classmate 
Junye classmate 


28
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,240
Good

29
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,110
Come on, everybody, sit down, sit down, sit down

30
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,820
 

31
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,190
Miss Anna used to know Jun Ye. We have been in touch from junior high school to college.

32
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,340
This fate is not shallow

33
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,260
 

34
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,640
Well, it's more important to have a good talk. Yes, yes, yes,

35
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,870
Junlao

36
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,760
 

37
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,830
My daughter's tea making skills

38
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:57,350
That's a unique skill. I boast that there is no water at all. Have a good taste.

39
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,180
 

40
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,640
 

41
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,800
Grandpa Jun, please have tea

42
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,460
King's Night

43
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Thank you

44
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,430
Give up in warm summer

45
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,050
 

46
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,520
If you want to return to the team, Junye will not stop answering the phone.

47
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,320
Maybe he was busy with what just now.

48
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,540
Rich people are busier than we think.

49
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,000
I believe he will come back as long as the misunderstanding is explained clearly. Look, you are still helping him.

50
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,310
Is Gao Fushuai privileged? Su Nuan Xia is not what I said about you. You are just too indulging in your night.

51
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:10,190
Don't pay any attention to him in warm summer. I think you are a natural gold medal coach. Some guys who abandon themselves and hate the rich are the real losers. Who do you say? Just say you? Xiao Tutu, I've endured you for a long time. I told hello, okay, stop it, stop it.

52
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,830
You say it again, loser, loser, loser. Okay, I failed. I see if you can leave me or not.

53
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,010
Then you go, Ling-hyun

54
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,990
Rabbit Rabbit

55
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,490
I'm just quick-mouthed

56
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,360
Who knew he was so impulsive

57
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,880
 

58
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,030
 

59
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,770
Who called you

60
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,840
Is that the village coach again

61
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,600
 

62
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,370
Your grandfather and my father don't know when what will be back

63
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,180
We can't stay silent, can we

64
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,700
You said

65
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,380
Are you that exclusive to me

66
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,450
No

67
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,890
 

68
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,830
You pull your hair like this

69
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,560
Hair dandruff can easily fall into tea.

70
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,970
Laijun Night

71
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,700
 

72
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,830
Why don't you ask a waiter to get a towel?

73
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,950
 

74
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,680
No

75
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,480
 

76
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,390
After a good talk with Anna, remember to take her home. Jun and I will never go back.

77
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,350
Nana

78
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,850
Take good advantage of the opportunity

79
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,040
 

80
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,130
 

81
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,760
 

82
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:55,030
Neither your grandfather nor my father is coming back. We seldom have the chance to be alone.

83
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,150
After all these years, you should know that

84
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,280
I have always been very interested in you. I am not interested in you.

85
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,660
Is it true that there is no such thing

86
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,890
I don't believe it

87
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,170
Warm summer

88
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:17,570
Junye, where the hell are you now, tell me right now

89
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,180
 

90
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,240
 

91
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,910
Why can't you say that you still choose teahouses on the court? It's so old-fashioned.

92
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:37,730
Miss, do you have an appointment? I'm looking for Jun Night

93
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,500
 

94
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,970
 

95
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,260
Look at that

96
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,070
We are both very well matched in wealth, appearance and family affairs.

97
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,580
You should like people like me

98
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,740
 

99
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,200
You won't

100
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,100
Do you really like Su Nuan Xia

101
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,510
Miss, this is it. Thank you

102
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,830
You're here. Sit here

103
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,100
 

104
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,700
Good. I happen to be a little thirsty

105
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,940
 

106
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,040
Su Nuan, you are really haunted by the ghost.

107
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,290
You

108
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,270
So you didn't come, you went out with her, went out with her

109
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,580
You think too much. Then what are you doing here? You don't answer the phone. Can you give me a reason?

110
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,670
Sorry

111
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,110
I won't be

112
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,500
It happened suddenly today.

113
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,800
 

114
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,990
What am I doing with Junye? I have a what relationship with you.

115
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,860
Did I meet the plot of a rich and powerful idol drama with dog blood?

116
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,380
I see.

117
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,550
He and he

118
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,610
He doesn't like him, but he has a bad heart towards him.

119
00:08:52,610 --> 00:09:00,510
Death, so want to use me as a shield, mercilessly cut off this woman's delusion, want me to help you ah OK,

120
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,550
You have to be in training on time every time, but you have no credit with me,

121
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,550
You have to swear that if you stand me up again

122
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,760
You will become bald and no girl will ever like you.

123
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,080
Good

124
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,650
What are you two doing

125
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,530
 

126
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,520
I just can't bear to take my eyes away from your handsome face at night.

127
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,920
I can't help it for a minute. No, no, no

128
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,440
Not even zero one

129
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,160
Too much

130
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,740
 

131
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,160
Come and eat

132
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,540
One for you and one for me

133
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,600
 

134
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,800
Isn't it delicious

135
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,980
 

136
00:09:53,380 --> 00:10:01,400
You said you didn't have a girlfriend before, did you use her as a shield?

137
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I almost forgot my business

138
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,280
 

139
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,320
Anna

140
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:18,280
Didn't you notice at school at ordinary times? I and Jun night? On the surface, it was a relationship between coaches and players, but in fact it was a real relationship between male and female friends.

141
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,150
 

142
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:25,030
Isn't that right? Little Jun Jun is

143
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,300
I don't believe it

144
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,390
Why don't you believe it when it's over?

145
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,960
It seems that we can only use our unique skills.

146
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,460
 

147
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,140
What is she doing

148
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,050
This is for the future of Qingmeng

149
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,460
Throw caution to the wind

150
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,640
 

151
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,150
Believe it

152
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,400
Junye, I'm really out of sight. I'll disband Jungu fans now.

153
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,960
 

154
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,920
It seems that my acting skill is not bad.

155
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,020
Look what I'm doing

156
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,100
Isn't it just a kiss on the face? This is a basic etiquette abroad, okay?

157
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,480
What's wrong with me

158
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,270
It must have happened suddenly

159
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,200
 

160
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,880
Why are you sitting here? Everyone has gone. Wait for me

161
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,760
Aren't you going to eat

162
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,500
 

163
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,080
Let me tell you, Chu Ran and I are really good friends who grew up together.

164
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,600
Even if you hate him and envy him 
Even if you hate him and envy him 


165
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,920
I really don't have any affair with him.

166
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,730
I and he are the same as you are to Anna.

167
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,160
Nothing. You see

168
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,520
You and Chu Ran have a what relationship,

169
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
I don't care

170
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,650
It's not a matter of emotion, it's not a matter of Chu Ran

171
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,380
Then why did you quit the team

172
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,410
Don't you want to challenge Myth's first team

173
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,860
The competition in two months

174
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,820
Is it important to you

175
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,370
Maybe you think I'm fanciful, after all, the reserves are playing so hard.

176
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,380
But

177
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,810
I believe we have a chance to have

178
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,060
And there must be

179
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,020
 

180
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,740
King's Night

181
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,390
I hope you can help me

182
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,150
Come back to the unit

183
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,280
We need you

184
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,880
For the sake of helping me just now

185
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,840
I will grudgingly promise you

186
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,040
 

187
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,830
Thank you, thank you, thank you

188
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,800
 

189
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,080
 

190
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,040
 

191
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,460
10 October 2016

192
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,180
The team has been injected with fresh blood again.

193
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:59,770
It's good to be young, young, vigorous and hard-edged. Of course, there are also disobedience and despise teammates.

194
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,910
There are more and more tricks for young people nowadays.

195
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,770
As a coach, we should also keep pace with the times.

196
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,320
If they are hard, I will be soft.

197
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:14,430
Since the teammates are not friendly, I will let you love each other and stick together every day.

198
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,560
 

199
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,470
 

200
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,320
 

201
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,720
 

202
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,880
 

203
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,010
 

204
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,040
 

205
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,950
What are you doing here all by yourself so late? You're a ghost

206
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,250
Walking without sound

207
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,090
Is there any ghost that I care so much about the players?

208
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,260
I am not afraid to play the ghost.

209
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,340
I just didn't think

210
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,720
You will care about me. You have promised to return to the team. As a coach, I must not give you the most professional guidance. Not a small tone.

211
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,310
Tell me about it

212
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,310
What's my problem

213
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,170
One word

214
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,720
Say it

215
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,240
Not alone but tight

216
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,560
You haven't attended professional training for more than a year.

217
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,620
So

218
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,620
Your body function and your muscle memory are not as good as before.

219
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,180
You wanted to take control of the last game

220
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:36,060
As a result, you can't help it, so you start to be nervous. The more nervous you are, the more scared you are. The more scared you are.

221
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,000
You are even more nervous.

222
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,220
I know my situation myself.

223
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,550
I don't believe it

224
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,790
You don't know how you play

225
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,840
That's it

226
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,240
Do you know what's name is bitter and bitter

227
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,290
I can't look so ugly. It's really like this.

228
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,680
The eyebrows are so wrinkled that they can kill a mosquito.

229
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,470
Laugh

230
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,490
So, as long as you follow the team and practice well,

231
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,720
Promise you to return to the original night god thank you

232
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,140
But I am still used to practicing alone.

233
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,680
I don't like the whole team together.

234
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,060
How come you're such a man

235
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,550
Don't mention it

236
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,700
If you say you're a fool three times

237
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,260
Then I don't mind practicing with the whole team.

238
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,640
 

239
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,110
 

240
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,080
If it weren't for winning the myth,

241
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,680
I'm a fool I'm a fool I'm a fool

242
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,560
Barely do it

243
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,810
 

244
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,760
 

245
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,260
Immature

246
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,440
 

247
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,180
 

248
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,700
 

249
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,590
How come you hurt your ligament

250
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,640
I tell you I'm quitting the team

251
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,510
Why, I, I hit a paranormal, paranormal

252
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,000
Yesterday

253
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 

254
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,720
 

255
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,790
 

256
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,820
 

257
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,460
 

258
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,620
 

259
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,590
Sorry, I'm late today, so I'll go first.

260
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,600
 

261
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,480
 

262
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,300
 

263
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,480
 

264
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,740
 

265
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,990
I didn't think the basketball club was really useful at this time. The hotel was too expensive at night.

266
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,520
It's better to sleep here than in the open air.

267
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,760
 

268
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,500
 

269
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,530
 

270
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,470
Don't chase me, didn't I just eat a few more boxed meals? I have what's fault

271
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,220
 

272
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,320
 

273
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,280
 

274
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,120
 

275
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,300
 

276
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,860
 

277
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,960
 

279
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,780
Ghost! Help! Ghost!

280
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,800
 

281
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,880
I don't care. I'm quitting the team. I haven't made enough money in my life. There's no ghost in this world.

282
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,870
Did you get too sleepy and hallucinate yesterday? Please, I didn't believe it before.

283
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,790
I can see both eyes

284
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,860
Warm summer

285
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,950
It's not really a ghost, is it

286
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,120
 

287
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,850
Anyway, I don't believe it

288
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,630
If there is

289
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,210
It must be human

290
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,760
 

291
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,600
 

292
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,880
 

293
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,250
 

294
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,600
For thousands of years

295
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,080
Some people insist on atheism and others believe in the existence of ghosts and gods.

296
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,060
Junye classmate

297
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:54,400
Please combine your knowledge of the basic principles of Marxism and talk about your views on this phenomenon.

298
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,390
Miss Li

299
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,440
Ladies and Gentlemen

300
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,040
First of all, I am a materialist in the Marxist philosophy system

301
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,330
 

302
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,520
The main difference between materialism and idealism is that

303
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,890
Nature

304
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,620
Did God create it

305
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,530
Materialism holds that the world is knowable.

306
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,490
Deny

307
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,860
There are omniscient people in the world.

308
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,970
So you

309
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,900
Can you talk directly about the fact that in the materialist cognitive theory

310
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,790
There is an important rule

311
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,740
Is to maintain the falsification of things

313
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,470
For example

314
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,040
The concept of ghosts and gods

315
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,510
Unless someone can prove its exact rules and influence us all the time.

316
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:41,420
Rather than sometimes without a connection close to human imagination,

317
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,470
In this way, we can better prove its meaning.

318
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,700
 

319
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,220
 

320
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,360
Not the Kui is the person who got full marks in the exam, which teacher still has a problem.

321
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,690
What if a staunch materialist encounters an inexplicable phenomenon

322
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,340
 

323
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,920
We can use various ways and means to explore it.

324
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:13,180
However, it should never be simply discussed with the concepts of ghosts and gods and miracles if it causes social problems.

325
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,530
Then deal with it according to law.

326
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,600
 

327
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,620
 

328
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:29,470
The team is the safety of my family. Everyone knows that yesterday Ling Xuan fell on the basketball court and is still lying in the hospital.

329
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,910
As a member of the team, should we get justice for him and peace for the school?

330
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,660
Coach

331
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,160
Just waiting for you to say a word

332
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,290
But I heard that Ling Hyun seems to have met a ghost.

333
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,340
Forget about it

334
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:50,010
Did you go to the basketball court for training last night

335
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:55,410
I was there last night. What was fine

336
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,750
What ghost, someone must be playing tricks

337
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,560
Forget it

338
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,190
Tonight, everyone will take turns to stand guard with me. We must catch this ghost.

339
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,950
 

340
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,560
Every time it thunders and rains, I ask him to accompany me.

341
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,360
 

342
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,550
I don't care

343
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:24,320
But I haven't finished my experiment yet.

344
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,200
I have classes

345
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,210
I remember you didn't have classes

346
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,440
Are you and I probably mistaken

347
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,280
How can there be ghosts in this world

348
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:45,350
What is terrible. I thought you had a private course. Then you are not afraid to come with me.

349
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,600
Didn't you say there was training

350
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,080
Preparation myth

351
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:58,030
Now the panic team is not good. I announced it. Now the ghost catching group has been formally established. He has caught all the real ghosts and fake ghosts.

352
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:04,730
Just in case Zhang Xiaoqiang Qifeng, you two will be waiting at the gate of the basketball hall, waiting for orders at any time.

353
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,420
Hmm

354
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,850
Far away

355
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,760
Hmm

356
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,720
Hmm

357
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,570
Alas, this is good.

358
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,750
Hmm

359
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,920
Hmm

360
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,610
It's paper. Ah

361
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,630
Aren't you afraid of ghosts

362
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,640
I'm not scared by you yet.

363
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,050
At a shock

364
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,810
More terrible than ghosts

365
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,240
Excuse me

366
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,140
It's all my fault that I substituted into this horrible atmosphere in advance.

367
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,090
The atmosphere is horrible

368
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,880
 

369
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,280
 

370
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,370
What things, what what things me

371
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,280
He also said that he was not afraid of ghosts.

372
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,880
 

373
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,320
Hurry up

374
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,540
I think this is the most inconspicuous place.

375
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:49,580
But, uh, we can see the whole stadium here

376
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,870
We'll be right here

377
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,480
Watch the plant and wait for the ghost

378
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,870
Why do I have a good night's sleep

379
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,390
Come here and suffer so much nonsense.

380
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:25,740
 

381
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,340
 

382
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,560
 

383
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,720
 

384
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,000
 

385
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,800
 

386
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,040
This is the bone soup that I specially cooked for you.

387
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,140
I have tasted it

388
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,560
Although the appearance is not very good, the quality is not bad.

389
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,110
Try it 
Try it 


390
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,000
  

391
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,980
How do I think it tastes a little strange? You won't have diarrhea after drinking. Don't worry about it.

392
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,370
Just drink it

393
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,640
Sleep after drinking

394
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,520
And I'm here to take care of you

395
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,710
Believe you for a moment

396
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,040
 

397
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,360
 

398
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,840
 

399
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,120
Sleep

400
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,540
Come on, slow down

401
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,800
 

402
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,780
 

403
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,120
 

404
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,320
 

405
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,870
 

406
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,440
 

407
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,720
 

408
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,640
 

409
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,160
 

410
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,600
 

411
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,230
 

412
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,440
 

413
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,480
 

414
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,520
  

415
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,480
 

416
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,680
 

417
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,530
 

418
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,880
 

419
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,410
How is it

420
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,840
Are you feeling better

421
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,520
Do you want me to call you an emergency

422
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,560
Little Brother

423
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,540
What a blessing you are

424
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,910
Girlfriend is still with you so late.

425
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,100
I just ran several wards to deliver hot water to you.

426
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,750
She didn't do it yet.

427
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:54,150
 

428
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:58,410
You come to the bed

429
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,880
Lest Su Nuanxia say I bully girls

430
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:11,080
 

431
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,880
 

432
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,600
 

433
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,720
 

434
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,760
 

435
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,840
 

436
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,640
 

437
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,430
Wake up, wake up

438
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,210
What's going on with you couple

439
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,670
If you hurt your girlfriend, you should also get well of your illness first.

440
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,930
 

441
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,080
 

442
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,120
 

443
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,240
 

444
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,810
 

445
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,200
 

446
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,090
 

447
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,920
Why did you fall asleep last night

448
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,680
That's not right

449
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,150
How can you sleep in a place like this

450
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,900
Is it because

451
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,690
She

452
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,370
 

453
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,050
 

454
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,160
 

455
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,750
Your sleep is too ugly, isn't it? I almost fell down.

456
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,080
 

457
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,960
It seems a little bit

458
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,960
 

459
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,210
Lumbar soreness and backache

460
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,210
After waiting all night, I didn't wait for the ghost.

461
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,270
It seems that we have to continue tonight.

462
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,650
Do you still come? Is this place so comfortable to sleep in

463
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,540
Thanks to Ling Xuan's loud voice,

464
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:25,340
The whole school knows about this haunted incident. If we don't solve it,

465
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,240
The basketball hall may be closed.

466
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,460
Think for yourself

467
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,560
 

468
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,880
 

469
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:43,510
 

470
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,800
 

471
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,900
 

472
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,480
 

473
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,080
 

474
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,480
 

475
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,980
 

476
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,040
 

477
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,560
 

478
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,380
 

479
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,320
 

480
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,380
 

481
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,080
 

482
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,230
 

483
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,720
 

484
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,220
 

485
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,740
 

486
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,660
Hard work

487
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,680
Drink some water

488
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,560
Give you another hug of love

489
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,700
Don't

490
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,760
 

491
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,200
If you don't let me hold, let me wait for half a day.

492
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,160
 

493
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,750
You let go of me, hug yourself with the air.

494
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,370
Didn't you abandon me? You let go

495
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,320
I had just finished playing the ball at that time.

496
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,140
Sweating all over

497
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,720
 

498
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,960
 

499
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,180
 

500
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,200
 

501
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,380
 

502
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,600
 

503
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,400
 

504
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,040
I don't dislike you

505
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,060
I am afraid you will dislike me

506
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,670
Who told you to make your own decisions

507
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,650
 

508
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,290
I thought you said you didn't dislike me. I was instinctive. Okay

509
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:59,380
The next time you sweat again, I will definitely not hide from you when you dump me in the face.

510
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,700
How can I give up

511
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,120
 

512
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,030
 

513
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,870
It smells good. Smell it carefully.

514
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,390
 

515
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:16,240
It's my favorite milk shower gel

516
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,820
Guessed right

517
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:21,920
 

518
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,000
 

519
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,960
