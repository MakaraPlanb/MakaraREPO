1
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:10,474
ï¿¥500 each for these people 

2
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,300
You gathered every kind of people 

3
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,350
But no one is suitable. What a waste of money 

4
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,550
Su Nuanxia 

5
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:16,725
My brother was trying to help you 

6
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:19,125
Fewer but better 

7
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,600
These people can't join the basketball club 

8
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:23,975
What are you doing? 

9
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,450
You can ask them to give back the money 

10
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,025
Start Plan A 

11
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,075
They have finished what I told them to do 

12
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,650
I won't ask them to give back the money 

13
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,300
You don't care because you don't make this money 

14
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,600
How about those failed to join the club 

15
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
You can ask back these money 

16
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,975
Aren't you regathering the basketball team? 

17
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,250
I want to regather Qingmeng 

18
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:50,925
A team to defeat Shenhua 

19
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,750
You have the time to find these people, 

20
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,075
why don't you just join 

21
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,600
I won't 

22
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,525
When you join in the club, 

23
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,150
you can worry about my players 

24
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,225
I'll find my players myself 

25
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,600
You are so close 

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,575
So romantic 

27
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,850
Being close at such a public place 

28
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,000
I can learn from you 

29
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,275
What are you doing? 

30
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,375
Xiaoqiang, I will take her to the Basketball court first 

31
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,075
Bring Qi Feng here 

32
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,300
Bro 

33
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,550
What do you what to do? 

34
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:31,775
Do you want to sacrifice me 

35
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,600
Shen Yingliang 

36
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,475
Ling Xuan 

37
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,175
with you and Qi Feng, there's four people 

38
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,975
I'll find another way about the rest 

39
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,225
I don't want these people 

40
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,300
It's my perseverance 

41
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,250
I'm so unlucky to meet you 

42
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,850
Su Nuanxia, don't look down on me 

43
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,950
No rear guard in Qingmeng 

44
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:52,225
can defeat me 

45
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,775
I quit with Master Ye 

46
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,275
See you at the court 

47
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:57,275
Then 

48
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,675
Who's Qi Feng 

49
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:00,375
Qi... 

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,675
He's a sullen stupid guy 

51
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:05,350
You will know 

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,200
Girls 

53
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,875
It's time for us to fight 

54
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:21,525
What's our motto? 

55
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,225
Jun Ye, Jun Ye, I love you 

56
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:26,800
We'll be there with you 

57
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:29,200
Even if we are far apart 

58
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:31,825
We'll never give up on you 

59
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,775
Nuanxia 

60
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,700
You really have nothing to do with Jun Ye 

61
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:51,425
I heard Jun Ye never gets close to girls 

62
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
You are the first one 

63
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,475
How can we have something 

64
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,300
Even of there is a relationship, 

65
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,175
it's me taking him down 

66
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,250
I didn't expect that you are a girl with goals 

67
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,225
Su Nuanxia 

68
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,150
It's lucky that you are not clouded by this cheesy girl 

69
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,550
You are here to fight again? 

70
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,425
You don't know Jun Ye 

71
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:29,050
This is the real face of this woman 

72
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:30,800
What is my real face 

73
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:31,850
How come I didn't know 

74
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,975
Jun Ye, don't be to close to this woman 

75
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,125
She's a pervert 

76
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:40,375
See, this is the photo we just got 

77
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,800
She takes pictures of men dressing like this 

78
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,800
I don't know what she wants 

79
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,850
By the way 

80
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:49,475
I heard that someone took pictures of boys changing clothes 

81
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,100
It must be her 

82
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,575
It's shameless 

83
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:53,850
She's not a pervert 

84
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:58,200
But she asked those guys to take off their clothes 

85
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,850
in the name of recruiting members 

86
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,150
Is this not enough? 

87
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,375
We have pictures in our group 

88
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,125
Beauty 

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,475
I was trying to assess their basic physical fitness 

90
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:10,200
When Jun Ye wants to join us, 

91
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,800
I will take a look as well 

92
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,050
Maybe 

93
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:14,625
I'll even feel it 

94
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,200
You... 

95
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,250
I won't 

96
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:19,550
All right 

97
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,650
Alright. You have said for thousand times 

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,825
I'm in 

99
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,900
Who's that? 

100
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,950
I, I... 

101
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,725
I'm sorry 

102
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:40,725
My brother Feng is shy at the sight of girls in short skirts 

103
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:43,125
You can ask me 

104
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,650
if you have any questions 

105
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,400
Who are these guys? 

106
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,325
Don't affect the club recruiting new members 

107
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,275
if there's nothing else 

108
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,125
Jun Ye, why are you with her? 

109
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,325
He must be afraid of woman 

110
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,925
He's so cold to the beauty queen 

111
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,150
Zhang Xiaoqiang 

112
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,300
Qi Feng 

113
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:09,875
You have to take a test 

114
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,350
after filing in the forms 

115
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,650
Okay 

116
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:17,900
Go 

117
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:18,525
Okay 

118
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:19,850
Follow me 

119
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:20,725
Go! 

120
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,350
Since you haven't played for more than a year, 

121
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,050
the test will be stricter 

122
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,175
Except basic physical fitness assessments, 

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,075
you have to fit my qualifications in dribble shot as well 

124
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:37,125
So for now, 

125
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:38,550
the test begins 

126
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,700
In the next period of time, 

127
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,525
I want to see your skill of controlling the ball and shooting 

128
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:26,575
I'll come first 

129
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,675
Is him a talent again? 

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,225
Xiaoqiang, what are you doing? 

131
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,625
Coming 

132
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:13,400
My hand slipped 

133
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,450
I'm sorry 

134
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,825
Did I frighten you 

135
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Are you OK? Anna 

136
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,525
This kind of fool is the most obscene 

137
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:25,775
Let's stay away from him 

138
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,000
You can't take the opportunity I made for you 

139
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,825
No wonder you still have your first love 

140
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:34,600
It's not cool 

141
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,125
Sorry, Coach Su 

142
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,600
Basketball matters most 

143
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:52,800
in my heart 

144
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,775
You must be surprised 

145
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,575
why the leading player of Qingmeng 

146
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,875
transfered to Shenhua University 

147
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,300
and join our team 

148
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,400
Chu Ran 

149
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,425
Tell them 

150
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:12,400
I want to be the champion 

151
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:14,850
He just 

152
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,100
wants to be a champion without paying efforts 

153
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:17,650
I've never met you before 

154
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,525
He's reserve team captain Ding Lei 

155
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:22,475
Usually, our leading players don't join the training 

156
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,200
Ding Lei leads the new players in training 

157
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,650
Chu Ran, right? 

158
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,525
Don't think that you can be so proud 

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,825
because you know Coach Han 

160
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,550
You have to convince me 

161
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,775
if you want to join Shenhua 

162
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:38,625
One on one 

163
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,450
Score above my head 

164
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:41,550
Well 

165
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,050
We have enough time for you to battle 

166
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:47,950
Welcome Chu Ran 

167
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,125
Ding Lei, spare man? Do you want to be a regular player? 

168
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,525
Before defeating me, 

169
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,225
you have to defeat Qingmeng Basketball Club that just regathered 

170
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:03,350
Qingmeng 

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Weren't they dismissed 

172
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,100
since Coach Su died? 

173
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,325
His daughter is named Su Nuanxia 

174
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,175
She made a club 

175
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:13,350
and gathered some old players 

176
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,850
But I heard that 

177
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,200
Master Ye joined 

178
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,525
Chu Ran, Master Ye was your teammate 

179
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,250
You must be familiar with him 

180
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,350
Coach Han really knows a lot 

181
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,825
I battled him one on one before I left 

182
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:29,925
He's so much worse than before 

183
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,250
Did you win? 

184
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,250
Cliff-hanging win 

185
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,275
You can't win little Master Ye 

186
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,334
Last ten seconds before the end of the game 

187
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,675
Qingmeng trails by one point 

188
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,450
The game ends 

189
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,050
Shenhua University wins again 

190
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:06,900
Coach 

191
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,800
Congratulations on their success in defending the title 

192
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,675
Coach, what's wrong? 

193
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,125
Itâs amazing 

194
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,325
Chu Ran made such a small mistake 

195
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,500
He failed on his best layup 

196
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,300
Coach, 

197
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,250
coach, coach 

198
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,575
Call an ambulance right now 

199
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:17,525
What's wrong? 

200
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,400
Coach 

201
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:19,900
Coach 

202
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,625
Chu Ran 

203
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,625
No 

204
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,450
Coach 

205
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,150
Coach 

206
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,825
Sorry, Coach Su 

207
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,825
Why are you so undetermined 

208
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:48,575
and unprincipled? 

209
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:49,800
Do you forget you duty here? 

210
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,650
Take off your hands 

211
00:12:57,925 --> 00:12:59,175
Qin Shangcheng 

212
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,625
You left me in Tianchu and didn't let me come to Wanjiang 

213
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,225
That's what this is all about? 

214
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,250
What do you mean by 

215
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,525
watching TV series in the day? 

216
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,800
What's the hurry? 

217
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,700
We have to recruit 

218
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:13,600
See 

219
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,450
Shen, Ling Xuan, Zhang Xiaoqiang 

220
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,750
and Qi Feng are all here 

221
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:19,050
You can take another one down 

222
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,250
We need a leading player 

223
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:23,625
But the only leading player of Qingmeng is Jun Ye 

224
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,250
I see your point 

225
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,225
But this afternoon is the time limit I promised the schoolmaster 

226
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,350
So 

227
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,925
This the only chance to make Jun Ye join the 

228
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:33,025
basketball club 

229
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:35,475
What if he doesn't come 

230
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,000
It's impossible 

231
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,600
With my charm, 

232
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:39,950
he will come 

233
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:42,475
Do you dare to be a little more narcissistic? ! 

234
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:54,950
Zhang Xiaoqiang 

235
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,700
If you can calculate the answer to this question 

236
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,575
I'll let you join the club 

237
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,225
Otherwise I'll be the first one to oppose 

238
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:08,050
It's simple 

239
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,450
The answer is the third power of 5A 

240
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:14,175
Jun Ye, did you tell him? 

241
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:15,775
No 

242
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,275
Please 

243
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:18,725
Do I need my brother to solve this for me 

244
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,300
Connect AC and E 

245
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:23,150
Make a projection on the right 

246
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,900
The slope of the first tangent L is known to be K 

247
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,725
So the ratio of L to Y 

248
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:30,150
is KX times the square of the root KA 

249
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:34,875
The answer is very detailed 

250
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,100
But I have to remind you 

251
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,300
You can affect your study 

252
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:39,975
by joining the basketball club 

253
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:41,075
Don't get too excited, sir 

254
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,275
We don't know if we can save the basketball club 

255
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:44,925
I just signed up 

256
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:45,825
randomly 

257
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
May it be so 

258
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,850
This kind of clubs that affect learning atmosphere 

259
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,275
should be as less as possible 

260
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,125
Sit down 

261
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,150
Okay, let's move on 

262
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:03,675
Schoolmaster 

263
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,950
Here's the situation 

264
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,900
I couldn't gather five people 

265
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,550
But there's a lot of talents in our school 

266
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,875
My ability is limited 

267
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,450
and I lacks personal charm 

268
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:16,725
I couldn't attract enough boys 

269
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,100
It's weird of you to say so 

270
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Since it's the case, 

271
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,700
you can't construct a basketball team 

272
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,750
Sorry, Nuanxia 

273
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:30,700
But, 

274
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:34,675
the fifth player will be here 

275
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,850
Xiaoqiang 

276
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,775
How do you feel about Su Nuanxia? 

277
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,625
Dirty and mean 

278
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:49,350
A female monster 

279
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,375
I mean 

280
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,125
Expect these 

281
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,550
What's she like? 

282
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,250
Will she mistake that I like her 

283
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,650
if I join the basketball club? 

284
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,700
Brotherï¼ 

285
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,350
You pushed me into this 

286
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:03,700
and now you are jumping into this yourself 

287
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,525
Damn! 

288
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:06,500
You really fall in love with this girl 

289
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,325
How could it be 

290
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,325
The teammates all mistook you 

291
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,675
for what happened last year 

292
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:10,600
After Couch Su left, 

293
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,850
the team dismissed 

294
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:13,750
I think it's a new beginning 

295
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:17,600
New beginning? 

296
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:19,625
Yes, let's go, we still have time 

297
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,300
Jun Ye, why are you here? 

298
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,425
Schoolmaster 

299
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:36,750
I want to join Qingmeng Basketball Club 

300
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,500
Please agree the establishment of basketball club 

301
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:40,750
Nuanxia 

302
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,850
Ah, the fifth player you mentioned is Jun Ye 

303
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,425
You didn't take in any players 

304
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,725
because you were waiting for me 

305
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,725
Take it easy 

306
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:52,700
We are in the same team now 

307
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:54,525
Su Nuanxia 

308
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,400
You can't let anyone know that 

309
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,250
I join the basketball club 

310
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,700
I'm afraid that's not possible 

311
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:02,550
Don't push it 

312
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,525
Remember to come for training 

313
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,000
Welcome to the Qingmeng Basketball Club family 

314
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,800
To celebrate the founding of the team 

315
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,325
At the barbecue store, out of campus at six tonight 

316
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,050
Please be here on time 

317
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:46,425
There will be big, big surprises 

318
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,600
It's half an hour to six 

319
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,650
Is it too late of you to send this? 

320
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:51,575
Definitely not 

321
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,075
Who dares to run late for such an important occasion 

322
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:55,100
Here 

323
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,700
Let's rehearse before they come 

324
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,300
Okay 

325
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:01,150
Ready! 

326
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,075
Start 

327
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,925
First 

328
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:05,500
I would like to express my welcome to all of you 

329
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:08,075
It's because of you 

330
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,325
that Qingmeng could be formed 

331
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,425
As a coach, 

332
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,450
I'd like to thank you all 

333
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,450
Although I'm easy-going at normal times, 

334
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,025
I will not go easy on you in training 

335
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,650
I need to confirm the rules of our team here 

336
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,625
Coach Su 

337
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,100
Keep a low profile 

338
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,050
Let's see 

339
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,225
Sorry 

340
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,600
We will wait a little longer 

341
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,250
Okay 

342
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,050
No one comes 

343
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,225
They've gone too far 

344
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,200
Nuanxia 

345
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,175
You're not even a coach yet and 

346
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:57,525
 they don't take you seriously 

347
00:18:57,825 --> 00:18:59,700
You have to show them your authority as a coach 

348
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,200
Yes 

349
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,375
I'm a coach 

350
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,300
You don't reply my message? 

351
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,300
Hey, Nuanxia 

352
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,175
Shen 

353
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:20,125
Why didn't you reply to me? 

354
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,900
Sorry 

355
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,650
I'm too busy on my graduation thesis these days 

356
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,925
I didn't look at my phone 

357
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,475
Remember to check your message 

358
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,550
Okay 

359
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,975
Hey 

360
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:39,775
Where are you? Ling Xuan 

361
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,000
I got a lot of work to do 

362
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,775
What's up? 

363
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,325
To celebrate the founding of the basketball club 

364
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,925
Tutu and I hold a party 

365
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:46,450
Why don't you come? 

366
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,450
I said 

367
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,625
I join for Credits 

368
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:50,250
Don't waste my precious time 

369
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,675
with these boring things 

370
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:52,175
Deal? 

371
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:57,475
I'm so mad 

372
00:19:58,325 --> 00:19:59,075
Ling Xuan 

373
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:00,525
Pretty good 

374
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:01,550
Who's that? 

375
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:02,575
Mr. Zhang 

376
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:03,425
A school mate of mine... 

377
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,325
Nice 

378
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,050
I think you have much potential 

379
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,125
Go deliver a set meal 

380
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:09,000
Okay 

381
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,225
2043, Building 3, Dayang Community 

382
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:13,000
I heard that their elevator broke 

383
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:14,525
Thank you 

384
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:17,025
Okay, Mr. Zhang, I'll go now 

385
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:18,100
Go on 

386
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:21,050
Hurry up! 

387
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,775
Go! 

388
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,225
It's my roommate's sister's birthday 

389
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,975
They held a party in the classroom 

390
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,175
I don't know them 

391
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,575
Anna is in this class as well 

392
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,400
It's already started, let's go 

393
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,175
What if Anna is not here and there are all other girls 

394
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,275
You coward! 

395
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:39,975
Alright 

396
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,125
I'll check it for you 

397
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:48,750
Coach 

398
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,175
Hello, coach Su 

399
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:52,925
Coach 

400
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,600
Coach Su 

401
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,325
I can't hear you 

402
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,050
Are you with Zhang Xiaoqiang? 

403
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:58,325
What are you two doing? 

404
00:20:58,725 --> 00:20:59,575
Why don't you reply? 

405
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:03,825
I can't hear you clearly. HeIIo? 

406
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:06,300
Silly boy 

407
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,075
Come up 

408
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,100
Coach, I'm out 

409
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,925
I'll call you later 

410
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:10,950
I can't hear you 

411
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:48,500
Nuanxia 

412
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,725
You'd better find him inside 

413
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,900
rather than calling him here 

414
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,650
Forget it 

415
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,850
I won't affect him 

416
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,825
September 7, 2016 

417
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,750
It's five years since the founding of the team 

418
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:05,850
Many new faces join us every year 

419
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,025
Some quit 

420
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:09,875
because it was too tired 

421
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:12,225
Some didn't seem talented at first, 

422
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,950
but became the leading players 

423
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,500
Maybe basketball isn't only about skills, 

424
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:19,775
but also the pursuit of a team 

425
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,325
The pursuit is the basis of a team to win 

426
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:25,775
Tutu 

427
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:28,525
Let's find Shen for help 

428
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,575
Only he can gather them together for training 

429
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:35,050
Shen is so low profiled 

430
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,850
I didn't expect 

431
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,075
he was the former captain 

432
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:40,425
I didn't expect 

433
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:42,325
that Zhang Xiaoqiang, Qi Feng 

434
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,775
and the poker face 

435
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:45,475
are all his team members 

436
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,725
But 

437
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:49,100
Shen will graduate in the near future 

438
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:50,900
and he's so busy lately 

439
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,025
I really do not understand 

440
00:22:52,425 --> 00:22:54,000
why would he return to the team 

441
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,200
everybody has his idea and pursuit 

442
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,825
I believe 

443
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:00,475
something in the Basketball court is attracting him 

444
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,175
I know that they are busy 

445
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,975
But this is not the reason 

446
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,775
Shen is about to graduate 

447
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:27,125
and he can come for training today 

448
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,625
Are your stuffs 

449
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,950
more important than his 

450
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:31,650
In addition 

451
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:33,025
Today 

452
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:34,550
we want the students to see 

453
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,525
the cohesion of our basketball club 

454
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:40,100
What are you doing? 

455
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,175
Practice passing 

456
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:43,225
How can you pass the ball like this 

457
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:43,975
What's up? 

458
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:45,175
You... 

459
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,250
Come on 

460
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:48,850
You... 

461
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,300
This is what you mean by cohesion? 

462
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:52,300
Enough? 

463
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:56,875
The training begins 

464
00:23:57,425 --> 00:23:58,350
Coach 

465
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,100
Can I take off my clothes, it's too hot 

466
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,050
You're so annoying, Zhang Xiaoqiang 

467
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,175
Just take off your clothes 

468
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:14,200
Xiaoqiang, let's practice 

469
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:26,100
Zhang Xiaoqiang's reaction and movement are good 

470
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:27,925
Although his controlling looks in a mess, 

471
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:29,200
he's fast enough 

472
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:30,450
to confuse the rival 

473
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,550
He can be a point guard, 

474
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,350
but he controls the ball for too long 

475
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,325
Qi Feng has the height 

476
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:41,550
and core strength 

477
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,900
He can be a Center-forward 

478
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,975
It's pretty good blocking skills 

479
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,450
But he just plays the ball 

480
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:48,050
too legitimately 

481
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,225
Well done! 

482
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:56,675
That's beautiful 

483
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,450
Jun Ye, Jun Ye, I love you 

484
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,925
Just like mice love rice 

485
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,975
A bunch of mice, so annoying 

486
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,300
Can you cheer for 

487
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,675
other players 

488
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:15,050
If you go on like this, 

489
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,675
I'll kick you out 

490
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:30,775
Former captain 

491
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,925
I came because of you 

492
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:34,325
You are not in a good status today 

493
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,650
Shall I replace you 

494
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,925
I can't feel it 

495
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,250
I think I shouldn't 

496
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,300
It's really different to be on the court with Master Ye 

497
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,800
I want to see 

498
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,000
what else is hidden in you 

499
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:48,950
I'll be with you 

500
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:50,650
Let's call it a day 

501
00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:52,200
I have something to do 

502
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,475
I'm off first 

503
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,750
Bro, wait for me! 

504
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,325
Jun Ye 

505
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,500
Go! 

506
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,850
I'll leave now 

507
00:26:12,675 --> 00:26:14,450
Nuanxia, sorry 

508
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,500
So reliable 

509
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,075
Itâs okay 

510
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,850
It's the first day of training 

511
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,825
It's good enough to have them all here 

512
00:26:35,025 --> 00:26:37,150
If it were not for Master Ye that refused the training, 

513
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,975
others wouldn't go 

514
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,475
Can he do whatever he wants just because he's handsome? 

515
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,150
This is unacceptable 

516
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:45,375
He didn't refuse the training 

517
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:46,500
I guess 

518
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,975
The atmosphere of training 

519
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,175
disappointed him 

520
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,975
You mean... 

521
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:54,775
He went to the outdoor basketball court for training 

522
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:56,950
That's not good 

523
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,675
Since we are on the same team 

524
00:26:59,025 --> 00:27:00,325
We have to show our teamwork spirit 

525
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,500
How can he train alone 

526
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:04,425
You're so right. Tutu 

527
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,625
I will teach him a lesson tomorrow 

528
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,050
Who are you calling? 

529
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:46,300
You came for me? 

530
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:48,825
Why are you standing at the door? 

531
00:27:49,925 --> 00:27:51,625
You come here for training alone 

532
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,750
Are you not satisfied with yesterday's training 

533
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,300
If you want to have more training, 

534
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,575
just tell me 

535
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,050
It's pretty lame 

536
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,450
to pretend to be handsome publicly 

537
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,375
You are lame 

538
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,775
That's too much 

539
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,850
Who's too much? 

540
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,675
You come here for training alone 

541
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:09,575
and forget about the team 

542
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
I'm too much? 

543
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,575
I changed the key here 

544
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,275
If you want to have more training, 

545
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,375
you have to do it with the team 

546
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,825
The team goes before the self 

547
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,300
I don't have to teach you this simple truth 

548
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,550
You are so shameless 

549
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:30,500
Give me 

550
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,450
You were pretty asshole when you were talking 

551
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:35,150
Give me 

552
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:37,200
Give me 

553
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:39,000
Help! there's a rogue 

554
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,250
A rogue coach 

555
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:41,700
Asshole 

556
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,675
It's shameless 

557
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:43,450
Give me 

558
00:28:57,675 --> 00:29:01,775
How can you tell a man is in love with a woman? 

559
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:03,425
First 

560
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,300
A man will appear by her side from time to time 

561
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,825
to attract her attention 

562
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,875
Tutu 

563
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,550
What are you murmuring? 

564
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:19,875
Seeing through a man's heart 

565
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:22,050
Come on, Tutu 

566
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,550
Ling Xuan 

567
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,750
I can see what he's thinking with my eyes closed 

568
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,875
I don't need an expert for this 

569
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,925
I just want to know him more 

570
00:29:30,275 --> 00:29:31,525
Maybe he likes me 

571
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:33,225
and I didn't realize 

572
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,525
What if we just miss each other 

573
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,550
If a boy likes a girl, 

574
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,525
will this girl fail to realize it? 

575
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:46,350
Sometimes he drank the water I brought for him 

576
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:47,400
and smiled at me 

577
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,175
Is there anything else? 

578
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:51,650
Nuanxia 

579
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:54,100
Do you think Jun Ye likes you? 

580
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,025
Are you kidding?! 

581
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,250
He's like an iceberg 

582
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:00,875
He can see nothing 

583
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,850
expect basketball 

584
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:04,925
Su Nuanxia 

585
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:06,250
Are you dumb? 

586
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,050
Su Nuanxia 

587
00:30:08,175 --> 00:30:09,175
Why are you talking so much nonsense? 

588
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,650
Su Nuanxia 

589
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,150
Don't disturb me from training 

590
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,300
Get out! 

591
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:14,725
Nuanxia 

592
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,925
You are more and more like Jun Ye now 

593
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,450
Don't get me in touch 

594
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:21,950
with that iceberg 

595
00:30:22,675 --> 00:30:24,800
I'll fetch some water. I'm thirsty 

596
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,175
What are you doing here? 

597
00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:40,900
Why did you go to girl's dormitory? 

598
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,375
I'm here to show you my new tactics 

599
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:19,800
Tutu 

600
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,625
Could you lend me your book?
