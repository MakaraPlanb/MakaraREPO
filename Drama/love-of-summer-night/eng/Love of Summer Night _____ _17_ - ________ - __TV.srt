1
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,800
This later period is too difficult. It is more difficult than playing basketball.

2
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,890
This is not the first film of Qingmeng. Why can't it be perfect and amazing?

4
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,300
I've already registered my microblog number. Upload the movie quickly.

6
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,920
But how about a what title

7
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,910
Highlights of Qingmeng Basketball Team's Wonderful Moments

8
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,600
All right, I've listened to your hard work.

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,160
From then on, Qingmeng Basketball Team will soon reach the peak of its life.

12
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,090
Popular All over the Network Sponsoring Man Man to Become a Star Team

15
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,780
Don't worry, with my editing skills, I will definitely attract many fans.

17
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,190
Is this a loophole

19
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:24,910
How is it that the reading volume of only 15 is not enough? Usually I send a selfie to browse with more than 1,000

20
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,490
I sent a photo of us.

21
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,360
It's not scientific

22
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,360
In my good looks

23
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,800
How can it not attract clicks

24
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,180
Ling Xuan, you changed the cover to my photo.

25
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,270
Very normal

26
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,840
Basketball on Weibo

27
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,920
It's not as good as entertainment news, and you didn't buy promotion and traffic.

28
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,880
Don't mention it

29
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,760
You know that, too

30
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,540
Junshi Group has Propaganda Department and Public Relations Department

31
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:06,460
However, this title is also declarative.

33
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,840
We're trying to help, too. It's okay. Everybody, don't be discouraged

34
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,600
While no one is looking at it yet

35
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,820
We can do it again

36
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,820
Send it out again

37
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,040
Good

38
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,590
Junye classmate

39
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,000
Junye classmate

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,370
Hello hello hello

41
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,300
Introduce yourself

42
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,230
My name is Alex

43
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,320
This is my company

44
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,870
That's right

45
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,340
How about our company

46
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,500
Recently, I am cooperating with fashion magazine.

47
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,880
Is to discover new people and shoot a group of plane posters,

48
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,560
But the editor-in-chief was not satisfied with the alternative model until he saw your video and asked me to ask you.

49
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,230
Are you willing to make magazines

50
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,150
Don't worry, we are definitely a regular company.

52
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,080
How about I make you an offer of 50,000

53
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,930
All right

54
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,690
I see

55
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,740
Good address is up here. Find me when you get there.

56
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,230
Be sure to call me

59
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,920
50,000 yuan

61
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,580
Mob Advertising Media Co., Ltd.

62
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,920
Photographer

63
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,470
Is your night for sponsorship fees,

64
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:46,650
If you take a look at this name, it is unreliable. It will not be an unscrupulous company that cheats boys and girls to take nude photos.

65
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:52,950
My God, you have a fire ahead of me at night. I can't imagine it.

66
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,220
Isn't that awesome

67
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,920
No

68
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,230
This must not be allowed to happen

74
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,830
You are

75
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,150
I'm looking for a man named Amway,

76
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,360
Hmm

77
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,740
Hmm

78
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,920
Whoops.

79
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,980
Is our momentum okay?

80
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,960
In the car far away

81
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,370
Absolutely stable

82
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,880
Their this

83
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,940
For what

86
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,560
Good

87
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,290
It's perfect

88
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,010
It's a natural clothes rack.

89
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,540
The position is a little to the left.

90
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,290
Who are you

91
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,400
Who are we? We are here to punish rape and eliminate warm summer.

92
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,090
Evil

93
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,590
What are you doing here

95
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:58,590
Is this the mob, what, mob, we're here at the Bird Union Culture Media Company

96
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,640
You're making a mistake. What's the matter

97
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,860
He also wants to come in and make trouble.

98
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,500
I'm sorry

99
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,740
How do we know someone will take the name of a ghost like the bird and the crowd?

100
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,300
So do you have anything to do with what now

101
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,960
If it's okay

102
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,670
I ask you to leave

104
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,780
Can I stay? No

105
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
Let her stay

106
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,420
All right

107
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,270
But you can only keep one person

109
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,940
Row

110
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,640
Remember not to divulge the shooting information. There are free fruit, tea and water to drink. Let the security guard get them.

112
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,100
What a big own goal this time

113
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,580
This time, Jun Ye really came down to earth and took a job for the team.

116
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,220
Not bad. Perfect. Come on

117
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,170
Take your shoulders easy. Let's have another group.

118
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,010
Good

119
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,640
Good to keep

120
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,880
Sell his boyfriend's body for the team,

121
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,550
I am also a qualified coach. Well, this is the end of today's shooting.

122
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,620
Next

123
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,990
Do you have any thoughts of moving forward in this direction

124
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,470
You are really in good shape.

125
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,020
You look awesome in a suit

126
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,770
Excuse me. Wait a minute

127
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,890
You see

128
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,870
How about this picture? This state

129
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,050
Can you send me all these photos later

130
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,830
All right

131
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,920
Let me see you

132
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,680
How's it goe? Luo is always perfect

133
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,760
This is Mr. Luo, chief editor of our company

134
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,890
Your outline is very stiff.

135
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,330
Cheeks, jaws and chin lines. You are very interesting to me.

136
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,310
Give me your WeChat

137
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,640
In the future, I will personally connect with you.

138
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,280
I have already added your WeChat

139
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,460
Since you are so proud and charming

140
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,380
Then will you sweep me

141
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,060
Isn't this the story of a rich woman keeping a little German shepherd?

142
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,680
Why don't you fasten this button well?

144
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
Go

145
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,130
Little girl, I appreciate your young people's courage to love and hate.

146
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,590
But I feel like you misunderstood me

147
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,210
I asked you for WeChat at night to sign him as an artist.

149
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,780
I might

150
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,320
Misunderstanding

151
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,420
Misunderstanding

152
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,490
Don't mention it

153
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,650
As long as you don't mind

154
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,150
I asked my assistant to draw up the commercial terms of the contract.

155
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,180
Guaranteed income of 800,000 yuan a year

156
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,540
Wait until you see the contract before you make a decision

157
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,780
Luo Zong

158
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,570
I don't have to read the contract.

159
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,960
My girlfriend agreed

160
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,610
I'll sign it

161
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,580
If the contract is signed, the funding gap can be closed.

162
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,040
But

163
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,000
Why do I always have the feeling of selling my husband for glory?

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,360
No, no, no, Junye, trust me so much

165
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,460
I certainly can't let him down.

166
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,720
Little girl

167
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,360
I'm so envious of you. How about that

168
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,620
Have you decided, coach? Have you decided

169
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,860
Decided

170
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,260
Not to sign

171
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,000
With what's own boyfriend to show it to others, right

173
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,930
Mr. Luo worked hard. Teacher worked hard. Let's stop the team and go.

176
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,610
Warm summer played a handsome role in the advertising company today, but the problem of funds and grandpa

177
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,320
We have to solve one

178
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,860
Don't worry about my grandfather's problem

179
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,820
It can be postponed for a while.

180
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,150
But I can let that man beat me again.

181
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,770
Redeem my watch

182
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,620
You

183
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,660
Forget it

184
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,710
Otherwise, I will grind my teeth and go to the construction site to take part-time jobs.

185
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,840
You

186
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,920
Forget it, or I'll grind my teeth and borrow it from Anna.

187
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,910
Forget it

188
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,500
Otherwise, I will bite my teeth and open a live broadcast to cut a wave of leeks.

189
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,360
There can be

191
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,900
No, you're serious

192
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,660
Oh, it's not you

193
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,480
It's not you, it's him

198
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,420
Here we go, here we go

199
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:28,470
Dear fans, I am Junye, forward of Qingmeng Basketball Team.

200
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:36,830
Answer the question, Night God. You are what Night God. How long can your eyelashes be? Do you like sweets besides playing basketball?

201
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,440
Do you have any other preferences of what? Besides playing basketball, you have other preferences of what.

203
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,580
Read a book

204
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,310
The most intolerable thing is what

205
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,640
The first thing to do when you get up in the morning

206
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,830
Open one's eyes

208
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,840
The most intolerable thing

209
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,020
The most intolerable thing should be to make mistakes on the court.

211
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,020
Night God's life is so boring, besides basketball or basketball

212
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,570
But even in this way, the traffic in the room is also large.

213
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,550
See that

214
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,420
More than 7,000 people poured in just one minute.

215
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:25,510
The most intolerable thing is that so many gifts are too ruthless. Is he a money printer?

216
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,380
Brother Qiang

217
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,080
Please help me to see if this reward ANNA is Anna Benna.

218
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:40,470
Do you like Japanese food? I don't like listening to what music

219
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,010
When light music is ready, all today's questions will be answered.

220
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:46,950
Over

225
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,380
Ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to meet you here today.

226
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,070
So you and what can all raise the issue with me, oh

227
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:25,910
My idol has approached. Night God, dare you show me your side face again? Night God, I am your little maid, face, genius is you.

228
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,640
I will randomly select three questions and then answer them.

230
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,290
Do you like what color

231
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,310
Blue

232
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,000
I like to drink what drinks.

233
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,770
White Water

234
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,530
Like what type girls

235
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,640
Medium-long hair

236
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,610
High-nosed

237
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,620
Round-faced

238
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:03,970
The girl who stands up right under my chin is, yes, you are.

239
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,470
What for

240
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,360
Idol Idol is me is me

241
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,470
The night god's boyfriend is strong and the night god pulled me up. I want to report it. Mom, the night god is telling me

242
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,340
Well, in order to thank you all for your support, I'll postpone it for another five minutes.

248
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,710
Night God, Night God King, Night God, Night God

251
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,350
Slow down, slow down, slow down, don't squeeze, don't squeeze, don't squeeze, night god, night god

252
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:05,620
This is the chicken soup my mother made for you. Can you have a sip of it? Night God, Night God, this is the doll I made myself. Can you accept it?

253
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,900
I don't accept gifts

254
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:14,820
Night God, you take it. Night God, I already have a gift, so we won't accept it. Thank you for your support.

255
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,960
I hope everyone will pay more attention to our youth dream team.

256
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,610
Officials and micro people forward more and pay more attention to it.

258
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:24,460
It's been a hard day. Everyone, go back to rest early. Thank you

259
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,620
Night God, night God, she's right

260
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,830
Let's go back to rest early today.

261
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,970
So handsome

262
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,270
All right, let's do what we say

263
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,820
Today, you are also tired at night. Let's all get rid of it.

265
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,590
Why didn't you just let me talk to them

266
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:50,990
Now it's a rising season for the team and you have the most fans. I'm afraid I'll lose my fans after disclosing my girlfriend.

267
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,940
So you're willing to let me take their gifts

268
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,170
You won't be jealous

269
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,920
Is that what you want to see

270
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,020
Neither do I

271
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,890
For the team

272
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,760
I can't help it

273
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,800
Rabbit Rabbit

274
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,790
Why don't you think there are any fans looking for me?

275
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,710
They dare to find my man and I hit them in the face with gifts.

276
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,520
All right, all right, Queen, I was wrong

279
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,600
Hit him, hit him, keep up, hit him

280
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,080
Sister, do you have time tonight

281
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,260
Come on, come on, come on, come on

283
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,900
Who said there were no handsome men in basketball

284
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,390
This is what I told you about the night god. He is handsome enough to turn around.

285
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,870
This team is full of long legs. Tomorrow's public number finally has material.

286
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,150
Push it to the photographer first

287
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,540
Send it, send it

289
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,980
Excuse me, is this Qingmeng Basketball Team

290
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,490
Yeah

291
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,220
We are from Liusheng Middle School and have always admired you.

292
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,940
In particular, Brother Junye, can you sign your name?

293
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,920
Your name is what

294
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,640
My name is Bingbing

295
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,990
Thank you, Bingbing. Thank you

296
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,960
Ah

297
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:55,220
It's Junye. It's really Junye. He still called me by name. I'm going crazy. We haven't gone far yet.

298
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,950
This should be a fan of Jun Ye before

299
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,400
Former fans are now appearing again.

300
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,510
To cheat a corpse

301
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,290
How

302
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,390
You're jealous of my fans

303
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,320
Who hasn't got many fans yet

304
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,460
 

307
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,810
Brother Xiaoqiang

308
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,830
Can we take a picture without autographs

309
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,440
I-I really like you

310
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,920
Make it clear that you like me

311
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,370
We think you are very handsome.

312
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,470
Do you know the fast player? Are you sure you can get a good picture when you develop there?

313
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,370
Is it

316
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,360
Remember to develop the photos and ask me to sign them.

317
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,720
Thank you, Brother Xiaoqiang

318
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,600
Yes, I can

319
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:49,840
I didn't expect you to have such great charm.

323
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,240
How do I feel like we're surrounded by enemy troops

324
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,090
Night God Night God I watched the video on Weibo and especially liked you. Can you take a picture with me?

325
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,510
Microblog Video Xiao Rabbit

326
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,650
Look at Weibo

327
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,520
Good

329
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,850
Oh, my God, it's been up by 300,000 fans and over 10 million hits in the past few days.

330
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:33,840
We seem to be angry. Indeed, friends' forwarding is the most effective. It seems that it is not just classmates' forwarding.

331
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,540
There are also well-known bloggers who have pushed it to us.

332
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,040
God, I've been watching this number in high school.

333
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,400
Look at the comments

334
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,560
You see

335
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,540
Ah

336
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,020
Beard

337
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,880
The only grandson of the family

338
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,460
Even if you run away from home, you even run to be a net celebrity.

339
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,180
Even if you make money in this way,

340
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,420
He won't come back.

341
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,610
The merit of my whole body is this stubbornness. He learned it like a model.

342
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,620
I'd like to see you have what who is happy or not.

344
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,590
Everyone, keep order. Today is our live training show. Please don't make any noise.

345
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,000
Isn't it just a team? There are so many people who like it.

349
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,090
That's a good ball

352
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:52,350
Senior Jun Ye, you are my idol. I never thought I could train with you. There is no idol on the court.

353
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,980
Only opponents and teammates

354
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,020
Let go of the fight. Take it easy. Okay

356
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:07,040
Junye, this boy is a little interesting.

358
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,780
How are you, senior

359
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,600
Hurry up with spray and ice bags in warm summer.

360
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,640
It looks serious

361
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,470
Rabbit Rabbit

362
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,680
Thanks, but old wounds like this

363
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,940
It's no use, but simply deal with it like this.

364
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,190
So that it can be prevent from deteriorating

365
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,600
Warm summer ice bag

367
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,160
So many beautiful women come every day.

368
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,800
Hello, coach, this is the water for you. Please come to you tonight.

370
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,260
Good

372
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,500
Find a sponsor quickly. This is not a good time.

376
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,940
Chairman of the Board of Directors

377
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,310
Chairman of the Board

379
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,870
Junye, is this your grandfather

380
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,460
You must go to the hospital

381
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,100
I have to check it out. No, the old man may pretend to be ill. You will be caught if you go there.

382
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,350
What if it's true

383
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,830
By the way, I have a sister who is the head nurse of this hospital.

385
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,580
King's Night

386
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,990
You train well

387
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,410
Grandpa gave it to me

389
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,390
Mr. hello Jun, this is a full-time nurse in charge of physical rehabilitation.

390
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,620
She will be responsible for your high nerve soothing massage.

391
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,010
Mr. Jun, how do you do? Please take care of me

392
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,790
Don't rush to be cute yet

393
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,150
The nurse who gave me the massage, has this changed to the fifth one?

395
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,640
Let me click it for you first. If you don't think so, let them change it.

396
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,470
Just press it, just press it

398
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:00,290
Is this all right

399
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:07,630
Right here

400
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, how can your massage technique be different from theirs?

401
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,590
Maybe it's because I've learned what a therapist does in sports medicine and rehabilitation

402
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,800
Okay, left, left

403
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,960
You said. Bai

404
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,880
Right, right, right

408
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,760
 

409
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:39,540
No, we have just reached 300,000 fans now.

410
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:44,590
If you take this kind of hard and wide, first, this platform has nothing to do with basketball.

411
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,110
Even if we do, we don't necessarily have much income.

412
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,630
Second, it is easy for such small companies to close down now.

413
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,060
What if they collect fans' money? Stop it

414
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,170
No, no, no

416
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,160
Little girl

418
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,370
You used to be full of energy every time you came here.

419
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,530
Why are you so sad today

420
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,100
Because

421
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,150
I may be lovelorn soon.

422
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,940
Who is so discerning

423
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:26,510
Such a beautiful girl with such a good temper is rejected by some people. The elders in my boyfriend's family don't agree with us. Why?

424
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,880
I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm not good enough

425
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,920
This is bullshit

426
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,540
So good-natured and so beautiful

427
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,740
There are also professional skills that are not good enough.

428
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:49,940
Let me tell you, you young people, you must be brave enough to stick to your own things and do it bravely. Don't listen to those old stubborn people.

429
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,960
Do you know

430
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,180
Hello

431
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:07,370
We are a well-known designer brand in China. Although we have just been established, we feel that the image and temperament of our teammates are especially in line with the live broadcast of the goods during training. We will give samples and hope to have a good reply.

432
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,830
In fact, this is the fastest way to make money.

433
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:17,390
However, we are adhering to the integrity of fans and have to assess the quality of products.

434
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:20,900
How can he guarantee that what he sends to us is the same as what he sends to fans?

435
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,060
Furthermore,

436
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,150
This has a great impact on the quality of our training. It's nonsense.

437
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,510
 

438
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:35,270
Do you know how I feel when I read the private letter what now, what feels, I feel that these words are like cooked ducks and all have flown away?

445
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,600
Brother Xiaoye

446
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,380
How's Grandpa

447
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,300
Or is it the old problem of the nerve center that can only focus on recuperation?

448
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,100
The doctor told him not to make him angry or

449
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,870
There is a risk of hemiplegia.

450
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,140
It's been hard for you these days.

451
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,220
It's okay

452
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,050
You know it's coming

453
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,630
Sorry

454
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,140
Grandpa, I'm late

455
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,930
Several bodyguards can't hold you down. I won't run again next time.

456
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:26,410
Don't worry, Grandpa, you have fans now, have you become a net sensation, and I have no choice but to do so.

457
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,380
For the team

458
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,610
You listen to me, I won't listen to you

459
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:35,400
You're just as full of that coach right now, aren't you

460
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,760
You called her in

461
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,720
I want to see her myself

466
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,060
Grandpa

467
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,530
What about the female coach

469
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,700
Also came

470
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,540
Hello, Grandpa Jun

471
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,160
Forget it. Forget it

472
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,690
I know all of you

473
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,170
Let me be straightforward then

474
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,300
Who is the female coach

476
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:19,110
Why doesn't he play according to the rules? Yes, I was a little caught off guard, too.

478
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,380
Far field,

479
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,580
Oh

480
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,500
Duck,

482
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:42,680
Hello, everyone, the straight men training class hosted by Qingzi will continue to teach as straight men.

483
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,600
Not only have to face all kinds of sharp angles,

484
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,230
The crisis-ridden proposition sometimes contains a huge amount of information in a casual little spit.

485
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:59,110
If you are careless, the consequences will be unimaginable. For example, when your girlfriend asks you to be with me every day,

486
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,820
Do you feel bored

487
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,450
How to answer this question is impossible

488
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,950
This is not scientific. How can it be

489
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,660
Asking this kind of question is boring in itself. I'm not aiming at anyone.

490
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:19,100
I mean, everyone in this room is rubbish. When a girlfriend asks such a question,

491
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:33,550
It shows that she is bored with your relationship and has some remorse. So at this time, the witty boy must show his respect for his girlfriend while categorically denying it.

492
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:45,920
Emotional care should never be self-righteous. The only way to talk is to take care of her feelings and apologize for not giving her enough security.

493
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,820
I don't know how to say it. Can you give a demonstration? First of all

494
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,640
We should do a good job in expression management.

495
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,790
Looking at her with an incomprehensible look can shake her head slightly, but with sincerity in confusion.

496
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,070
Why do you think so

497
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,340
Is it because my mind is full of games

498
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,360
It makes you feel too boring.

499
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,760
Sorry, baby

500
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,390
I ignored you

501
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:23,450
Well, if my girlfriend asked her if she had quarreled and ran away, would I contact her voluntarily?

502
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,790
How do you answer that question

503
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,450
It depends on whose fault it is

504
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:35,170
It must be a serial phone call. Think about how much you have to worry about your girlfriend being out alone. There is no quarrel. I will never give my girlfriend a chance to get angry.

505
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,790
Ding Lei, how about you

506
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,120
Charging beasts will never bow to girls.

507
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,350
Charging beast, I think the trap of this problem lies in

508
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,840
Why do you want to let the quarrel happen? That's right.

509
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,190
When you find your girlfriend angry,

510
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,700
Can't I give her a big red envelope? Can't I give her a big red envelope?

511
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,800
Why should such a good solution develop into running away from home, right?

513
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,080
Hmm

514
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,600
Hmm

515
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,990
Ah

516
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,280
Hmm

517
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,800
You sit in the morning looking at your cell phone,

518
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:32,430
While waiting for the study period,

519
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:37,480
I landed first
