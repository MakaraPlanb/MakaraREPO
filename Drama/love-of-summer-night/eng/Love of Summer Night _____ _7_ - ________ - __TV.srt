6
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,290
Forget it. Teammates should love each other.

7
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,090
For the sake of your accompanying me to catch ghosts,

10
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,360
Not afraid, not afraid

14
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,570
Today's soup is sparerib soup. Drink it while it is hot.

15
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,950
No, today's quality and quantity will definitely taste good. I won't drink it.

16
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,870
Just take a sip. Can you stop bringing me soup

17
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:34,270
I have finished drinking your soup and I have to go to the emergency department again. Can you go back and don't waste your precious time on me?

18
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,300
Do you think I want to take care of you

19
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,510
I am for the warm summer team.

20
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,780
That happens when I have decided to quit the team.

21
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,710
You don't have to take care of me

22
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,920
Don't bother you again

23
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,380
Don't know good people's hearts

24
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,260
Here you go

26
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,060
It's a good time to go

27
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,280
Who told you to drink

28
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:06,510
It is normal for young men and young people to quarrel, but this soup does tell the little girl.

29
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,940
Next time, put more cooking wine, or the meat will be a little fishy and white for you to drink, and you will still pick on me.

30
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,750
Give it to me

37
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,260
Can you drive

38
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,390
Brother Qiang

39
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,930
This is not a good time for us to open the dark, is it? It's been several days. Something is going to happen. Something is going to happen.

40
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,240
A little later, we'll get out of here

41
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,000
I heard that there are activities in the dance club, and Anna seems to be going too.

45
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,100
If we don't catch another ghost tonight, even if we still have to prepare for training, we can't sleep here every day, can we?

48
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,250
What are you doing

49
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,880
You're gonna use this as a bedroom

50
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,020
To catch a ghost, to catch a ghost

51
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,990
Sleep quality cannot be reduced

52
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,340
My brother's sleep quality is very good recently. I didn't think this basketball hall has the function of treating insomnia. He still has insomnia.

54
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,660
Why didn't I see it

55
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Xiao Qiang

56
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,850
You go home first

58
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,410
If you get sleepy for a while

59
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,270
You can use this

62
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,780
Clearly at first heart unwilling feeling unwilling

63
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,850
Why are you so active now

67
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,620
Why don't you take a break

68
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,300
I'll just watch

69
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,010
Will you come like this

71
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,000
Mobile phones don't let you play with books and you can't read them.

72
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,760
What else can I do then

73
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,640
We can whisper

74
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,790
I have nothing to say to you

75
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,580
Don't say it, don't say it

76
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,760
It's nice to see the light coming in this month.

77
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,630
This was originally the best corner of the school.

78
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,640
If there is no street lamp across the street

79
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,360
You can also see the stars

80
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,700
I thought you wouldn't talk to me

81
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,030
Look at the stars

83
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,460
But you know a lot about it. Don't tell me it's yours

85
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,540
This stadium

86
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,160
Before my dad died

87
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,610
It was specially built for me.

88
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,340
Every time I see every corner here,

89
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,020
Reminds me of him

90
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,590
Bah, bah, bah, what's mouth is broken. A casual remark can poke people's sad things.

93
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,660
I'm sorry

94
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,090
I didn't mean it. I said you believed what

96
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,530
Why are you doing this

97
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,760
Do you know that you have a lot of strength

98
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,550
Who told you to lie to me

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,170
Who

100
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,910
Stop

103
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,270
Catch the ghost! Stop! Don't run! Catch the ghost

104
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,950
Stop for me

105
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:59,760
 

106
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,710
The coach is fighting a ghost. Why is this ghost warm?

107
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:14,520
Stop it. Stop it. I'm human

108
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:21,440
Anna, how is it that hello hurts

109
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,010
You night is really charming. You can let Miss Anna play the ghost to frighten me.

110
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,770
In fact, the biggest winner this time is Qi Feng

111
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,820
I asked him to take Anna home.

112
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,040
He can finally buy the milk tea she likes to drink.

113
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,370
But how did Miss Anna know

114
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,350
There is a big man

115
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,870
You will be afraid of ghosts.

116
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,410
 

117
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,550
Yeah

118
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:51,730
 

119
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,920
How do I know Ling Xuan is so timid

120
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,940
Should he be discharged from the hospital

121
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,930
Aren't you all alone

122
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,710
How can you care about your teammate

123
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,000
Myth World War I

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
56 days left

125
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,060
If you really want to win

126
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,180
We must work together

127
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,840
You're right

128
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,310
It's been hard these days. Go back and sleep well.

129
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,680
What for

130
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,830
I also want to sleep in the stadium.

131
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,000
There is a place like that where what sleeps well.

132
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,840
 

133
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,880
 

134
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,950
Bye-bye by car

135
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,560
 

136
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,240
 

137
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:16,360
 

138
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:24,870
 

139
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:33,850
 

140
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,900
 

141
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,590
 

142
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,680
 

143
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,640
 

144
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,040
 

145
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,060
 

146
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,270
 

147
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,200
 

148
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,830
Quick, quick, quick

149
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,000
 

151
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,440
Set

152
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,280
Welcome us Ling Xuan back to the team.

153
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,990
Yes, how are you recovering? Can you train normally? No problem

154
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:14,270
If it weren't for someone's poor cooking, I would have come back yesterday, I think you still want to be hospitalized, right

155
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,300
All right, stop it

156
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,890
Anna wanted to apologize to you personally, but she was injured and had to apologize later.

157
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,980
Let's get back to the point. In fact, Ling Xuan's injury this time is a good thing.

158
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,430
Why do I feel so awkward when I hear you say this

159
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,310
First of all, every cloud has a silver lining together solved the haunted incident.

160
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,340
Secondly, we have also turned over the incident of withdrawing from the team at night.

161
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,280
Next, he will prepare for myth with us.

162
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:50,010
And the third good thing is that our senior Qi Feng finally got the welfare of being alone with Anna, you iron silly

163
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,460
It's hidden deep enough. It's completely the rhythm of the idiot's counter attack.

164
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:59,260
Don't you talk about me, Coach Sue. Don't you talk about devil training

165
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:09,340
By the way, now that our players are all in order, the coach will sacrifice my dark universe invincible love training method.

166
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,410
 

167
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:16,190
Considering that our classmate Ling Xuan has not fully recovered from his foot injury, our training will not be so intense.

168
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,830
A new Soviet-style training method will be adopted.

169
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,180
Still have conscience

170
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,200
Props on Rabbit Rabbit

171
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,730
 

172
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:38,230
My method of loving each other, commonly known as the binding method, is simply to tie the hands of two people together and do what things without letting go.

173
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,330
Eating, drinking, pulling and scattering are also together. Accurately speaking, it is

174
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,670
But you can unlock the lock at 7 pm. I did this to break in the tacit understanding between everyone.

175
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,520
Uh, the five of us split into two groups

176
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,050
Zhang Xiaoqiang, Qi Feng, Shen Xuechang

177
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,470
The three of you are in a group, Junye and Ling Xuan are in a group.

178
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,820
I object to this what ghost training and I have to be tied to this guy.

179
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,840
What about you? Do you have a problem

180
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,700
No

181
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,960
 

182
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,390
 

183
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,660
 

184
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,180
What are they doing

185
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,640
Isn't that Jun's night? Why is he so close to that boy and still tied to one another?

186
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,560
Isn't Jun Ye having an affair with Su Nuanxia of the Sports Department?

187
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,700
Changing partners so soon

188
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,640
My God is handsome and can really do whatever he wants.

189
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,770
It was agreed that we would have half-time and you would accompany me to the cafe in the morning.

190
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,120
Afternoon casual

191
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,670
Stop talking nonsense

192
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,760
Brother Chong, where are we going

193
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,670
Senior, where are we going

194
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,360
Come with me

195
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,220
 

196
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,460
 

197
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,810
 

198
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,660
 

199
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,890
 

200
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,560
 

201
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,120
 

202
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,060
When you're gonna get to what

203
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,510
Until you make enough money

204
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:44,710
 

205
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:56,310
Hello, your coffee night. Hello is handsome. We are here specially for you.

206
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,060
It was agreed

207
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,180
Your morning is mine, isn't it

208
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,920
 

209
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,280
Do you want to take a picture with Jun Night

210
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,450
Twenty dollars a time is a fair price.

211
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,050
Wireless Network Free High Definition Pictures Send Friends Circle in Seconds

212
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,620
Ling Xuan

213
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,120
Don't go too far

214
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,400
Don't you make enough money early so that you can leave early?

215
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,360
Come on

216
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,640
 

217
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,980
 

218
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,920
 

219
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,160
 

220
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,220
Thank you

221
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,840
All right

222
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,840
 

223
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:47,090
It seems that my training has already begun to work.

224
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
 

225
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,320
 

226
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,200
 

227
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,200
 

228
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,200
 

229
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,740
 

230
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,810
Xiao Ling, Xiao Ling did a really good job today. Don't worry, I will count it all in your performance.

231
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,540
And then I'll give you a little extra subsidy

232
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,560
 

233
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,030
 

234
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,890
 

235
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,310
Thank you, madame. You're welcome. By the way, remember to bring your friend back next time.

236
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,090
It's my time

237
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,760
Bye-bye

238
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,920
This young man is really handsome.

239
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,580
He looks like a star. He's called what.

240
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,680
 

241
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,360
 

242
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,500
 

243
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,480
 

244
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,870
 

245
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:16,200
The next picture may be a little bloody.

246
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,220
 

247
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,120
 

248
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,910
 

249
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:32,220
 

250
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,630
So that's why you're here for dinner this afternoon. It's hard to make an appointment here

251
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,200
And it happens to be today

252
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,160
Help me with my last reservation. Yes, sir.

253
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,650
Will this set meal be too expensive

254
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,470
 

255
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,490
Can this be ordered? Excuse me, sir

256
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,530
We only make two packages today, so we can't order it alone.

257
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,580
This is too bad, isn't it

258
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,390
I'd better drink water

259
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,700
 

260
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,090
What are you doing

261
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,900
Drink water

262
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,900
Sir, would you like to cut off the rope before eating

263
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,680
Don't need a good one. When the food is served later,

264
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,190
From his direction

265
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,080
All right

266
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,320
 

267
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,040
 

268
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,630
Jack Bauer, are you all right

269
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,540
 

270
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,730
Come on, slow down

271
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,600
 

272
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,350
Sorry, Jack Bauer

273
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,340
I didn't expect you to react so much.

274
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,200
It's okay

275
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,270
Just give me a blindfold later

276
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,140
 

277
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,030
 

278
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,710
I want to pee

279
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,570
 

280
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,680
 

281
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,430
I wonder why I can't pee

282
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,090
 

283
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,880
 

284
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,600
 

285
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,790
 

286
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,900
 

287
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,220
 

288
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,450
Cheapskates drink cold water

289
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,000
Want to eat

290
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,750
As long as you apologize to me, you shouldn't have betrayed me today to take photos.

291
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,910
I'll order you one

292
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,240
Gentlemen are not fed by grief.

293
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,720
 

294
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,420
 

295
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,700
 

296
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,120
 

297
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,370
Sorry, I really shouldn't have used you to make money.

298
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,980
I was wrong

299
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,500
 

300
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,540
You can take his share.

301
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,880
 

302
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,880
 

303
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,340
You have a conscience

304
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,680
I would have ordered it for a long time.

305
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,560
You think I look like you

306
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,340
 

307
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,120
 

308
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:15,680
 

309
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
 

310
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,020
You pay, you eat first

311
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,520
Sir, I wonder if you are satisfied with our couple package today.

312
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,160
Couple Package

313
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:44,990
Didn't I order a two-person package? Yes, our two-person package today is called a lifetime of love. It is indeed a couple package. Whatever the what package is, can't you just eat it? Hurry up and eat it.

314
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,680
 

315
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,040
 

316
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,580
 

317
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,320
Miss hello

318
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,740
Please go to the toilet here, miss. Sorry, we can't enter here without an appointment.

319
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,990
This way, please

320
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,620
Why do you want to eat in such a fancy place?

321
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,490
 

322
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,270
265

323
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,910
The sense of freedom is so good.

324
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,810
Today's meal

325
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,600
Thanks

326
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,960
Why are you following me again

327
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,520
 

328
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,340
Big drumstick, you said what

329
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,610
 

330
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,620
 

331
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,520
 

332
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,500
 

333
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,940
 

334
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,480
 

335
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,400
 

336
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,480
 

337
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,310
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bite you. I was so hungry

338
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,900
I think I can smell ham, and I can't help it.

339
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,350
Don't mention that from now on

340
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,420
 

341
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:49,300
Do you want to go back to school later? Then take me with you by the way.

342
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,480
Casually

343
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,300
Two bosses

344
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,920
Thank you

345
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,620
You're welcome

346
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,060
Miss Su

347
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,240
Excuse me, this is what's roasted sweet potato

348
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,180
It smells good

349
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,620
I don't eat this stuff

350
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,540
You didn't eat it, did you

351
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,660
 

352
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:22,710
How can I eat this kind of food? Then you don't eat it for me. Anyway, who doesn't know that eating too much of this kind of food will cause flatulence?

353
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,660
Bring it

354
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,760
 

355
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,270
Eat as you like

356
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,100
 

357
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,280
Break open

358
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,400
 

359
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,960
It's not delicious at all.

360
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,160
It's not delicious. You still eat it all the time.

361
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,880
 

362
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,490
 

363
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,900
 

364
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,610
 

365
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,390
What about your night

366
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,760
You came here on the morning of the night.

367
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,670
But in poor condition

368
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:21,910
Not long after the tie-up training, he had a high fever and left without us telling you.

369
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,120
Fever

370
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,980
What's the matter? I accompanied him to the hospital. The doctor said he had fever caused by food poisoning.

371
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,820
He

372
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,940
Why are you leaving? He has already returned.

373
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,540
But it's a little hard to take you there

374
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,560
 

375
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,540
 

376
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,120
 

377
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,520
 

378
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:51,030
Stop and call the two of you, do you hear me

379
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,740
Why are you wearing a mask

380
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,870
What ghost, you smell too heavy. Go, go, wash it quickly.

381
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,920
 

382
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,080
 

383
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,310
 

384
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,110
Let my brother rest first

385
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,490
When he wakes up, you have to take his temperature and remember to make him take his medicine on time.

386
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,400
 

387
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,000
Aren't you coming? I don't have that much time

388
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,580
I have to wash my socks, okay

389
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,840
 

390
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,660
 

391
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,280
 

392
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,400
 

393
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,230
 

394
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,650
 

395
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,600
 

396
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,780
How can you be defeated by baked sweet potatoes when you look so good?

397
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,840
 

398
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,680
 

399
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,320
 

400
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,590
 

401
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,640
You

402
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,900
Wake up

403
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,640
What are you doing

404
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,250
I heard that food poisoning, this canthus

405
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,170
Edema

406
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,890
Then I'll examine you

407
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,340
Is it swollen

408
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,090
A little bit

409
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,310
 

410
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,190
So

411
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,930
You're like this

412
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,250
Are they all the pots that baked sweet potatoes yesterday?

413
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,360
Then why am I okay? Maybe my intestines and stomach are different.

414
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,290
Forget it

415
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,990
Don't eat these things anymore

416
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,640
I'm sorry

417
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,370
Let me get you some medicine. No

418
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,940
This is the FIBA drug

419
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,780
You're not a professional

420
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,620
Do you still have to worry about this

421
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,420
It's not what you think

422
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,540
This medicine has side effects on nerves.

423
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,360
Daily life has little influence on

424
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,660
But in the short term, the body function will definitely decline.

425
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,040
Can't reach the intensity of normal competition training

426
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,380
You are

427
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,280
Afraid of delaying the match with myth,

428
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,560
I'm going to endure it

429
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,320
Let it heal itself. How can it work? I'll find a way for you.

430
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,940
 

431
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:24,280
Let me see, take 200 grams of ginger, mustard, onion and pepper.

432
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:34,150
Chop up, mash, grind the juice, add brown sugar, add a little cola, and cook over high heat for 20 minutes.

433
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,450
You are saved at night.

434
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,280
Where to find what onion, ginger and garlic now

435
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,900
Don't worry

436
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,370
I have already arranged it.

437
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,840
Someone has taken the order.

438
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,880
 

439
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,350
Please rest assured when the screenshot is received.

440
00:29:53,350 --> 00:30:01,820
I am already on my way to the market. It is very good. If you stop by, buy me another induction cooker and bring it to me.

441
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,030
Thanks

442
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,680
 

443
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,840
Let me help you

444
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,670
No

445
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,510
As a beautiful girl who has lived independently for a long time,

446
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,900
This kind of difficult problem

447
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,690
Trivial matters

448
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,440
 

449
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,770
 

450
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,200
 

451
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,140
 

452
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,080
 

453
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,600
 

454
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,040
 

455
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,580
 

456
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,280
 

457
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,940
 

458
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,560
 

459
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,380
 

460
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
 

461
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,070
The problems exposed by the loss

462
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,460
I hope everyone can reflect on it when they go back.

463
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,820
Winning or losing is a common thing for soldiers.

464
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:29,120
I don't think there is any trouble. If it is normal to lose every time, there is a difference between winning and losing in what.

465
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,900
But

466
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,190
As a coach, I

467
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,600
I have the greatest responsibility.

468
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,360
I stayed to reflect

469
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,790
Everyone disbanded in situ

470
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,770
Coach

471
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,880
Do you want me to stay with you

472
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,390
There's no need to go

473
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,280
 

474
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,440
 

475
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,460
 

476
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,880
 

477
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,520
It's over

478
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,120
It must be Uncle Administrator off duty.

479
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,870
What about the cell phone

480
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,310
Where's the bag

481
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,490
Thank you, Uncle

482
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,020
Why haven't you left yet

483
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,850
Thank you, Uncle

484
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,180
It was you

485
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,200
 

486
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,440
 

487
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,020
Have you taken a picture with your cell phone for a long time,

488
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,160
Are your hands sore

489
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,230
That's enough

490
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,200
 

491
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:38,080
