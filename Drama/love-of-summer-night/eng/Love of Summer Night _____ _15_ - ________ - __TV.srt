1
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,570
Coach Han is furious. Please go to the office and plead guilty later.

3
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,330
I think your previous training was also in the afternoon.

4
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,050
You've been coming to me lately. Don't delay your training

5
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,780
I used to take care of you all the time. I'm used to it.

6
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,380
I know you always want to see you unconsciously when you are here.

7
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,650
Just because we have known each other for so long, you also know my character. I live well everywhere.

8
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,510
Besides, there are still rabbits and rabbits here now.

9
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,580
My players, though their mouths are bad.

10
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,230
But no one is bad

11
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,360
It's not like I'm going to get abducted, is it

12
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,360
Good

13
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,460
Of course I know I can take care of myself.

14
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,320
But don't refuse me to come to hello

15
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,740
Thank you, Brother Chu Ran

16
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,660
Although I have always regarded you as my brother.

17
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,320
I always follow you behind your ass and stick to you and let you take care of me, but now it's different.

18
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:23,790
As for me, I have my own team. As the captain of the myth team, we all have our own things to do and things to be responsible for.

19
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,060
So you don't have to give in to me

21
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,000
Hello

22
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,240
Coach Han

23
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Good

24
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,900
I'll be back soon

25
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,340
Coach

26
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,680
Do you want to talk to me about what

27
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,410
I heard that you have been going to Qingmeng University quite frequently recently.

28
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,940
Is it to meet Su Nuanxia

29
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,540
Yes

30
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,680
What about me

31
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,780
No objection to your contact with Zuri's daughter

32
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,490
But if she interferes with your training

33
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,360
I will have to hand over your captain position to others.

34
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,400
Will Rabbit come today

35
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,350
Last time I turned her down

36
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,290
He should she should be very upset, right

37
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,020
Everyone is getting older and should be very mature emotionally.

38
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,880
How could I care so much about how she feels

39
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,800
But

40
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,570
Why did I refuse her last time? I am a man.

41
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,560
I should face her bravely.

45
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,320
Qiangge Qi Feng

46
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,710
How come it's just the two of you

47
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,270
Shen Xuechang and Jun Ye still have two classes. Coach seems to have something to go out.

48
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,580
What about the others

49
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,590
Who, there are new players? No, no, Brother Qiang

50
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,940
You're usually six

51
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,740
Are you quite experienced in emotional aspects? Generally speaking, you also know a little about it.

52
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,570
What for

53
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,260
You have to give me some advice. I have something I want to ask you

54
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,830
Please raise your question

55
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,690
I have a friend who is not me

56
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,560
He wants to ask how to judge whether he likes a girl.

57
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,900
I think your friend's problem is very problematic in itself.

58
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,630
Why

59
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,510
Like this kind of thing

60
00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:01,720
It is originally a kind of metaphysics. Whether men chase women or women chase men, it is an instinctive reaction that cannot help it.

61
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,310
There are not so many rules

62
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,960
Your friend's question itself reveals a sense of doubt.

63
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,840
That

64
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,770
Let me ask for him

67
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,020
Is there a situation where you suspect at first and then realize later that you finally get together?

68
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,180
You're insane

69
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,660
Why is it so complicated

70
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,560
If you move, you will lift it. If you can't move, you will force it

71
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,570
If you can't, you will be forced to confess. If you dare not even confess, you will still talk about what's liking.

72
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,660
Don't be so secretive like some people. It's very low-level, okay? But

73
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,650
If my friend ever refused that girl, then let that girl also refuse him once.

74
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,120
Everybody even

75
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,250
Love is a very important thing. One step is passive and the whole process is humble.

76
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,430
That

77
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,410
I advise your friend that it is better to figure out whether he likes her or not.

78
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,580
How do I feel about going around and back

79
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,580
Ling Xuan

80
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,990
Don't listen to his nonsense. He hasn't been in love yet, Qi Feng.

81
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,520
How can you expose me

83
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,250
I'd better find someone with experience to ask

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,410
Shen Xuechang

86
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,070
Do you have any what dialect that can guide or solve my friend's problem just now?

87
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,510
Sorry, Ling Xuan, I am too busy here. I may not be able to answer your question.

88
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,900
Also, I studied infection, not psychology.

91
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,160
Look why I'm a teammate

92
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,940
Is it so weird that I buy you a coffee

93
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,110
If you have what dialect, just say it

95
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,680
I just have a question for you

96
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,110
Better be honest

98
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,710
That friend is me

99
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,820
I seem to like Xiao Tu Tu Tu

102
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,570
Sorry

103
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,250
I really can't help you emotionally.

105
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,650
But if you think I can help you, what

106
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,050
You can tell me

109
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,290
For the time being, I can't think of it.

113
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,570
This

114
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,420
The atmosphere seemed a bit awkward

115
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,150
Why don't we have coffee to ease up

120
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,080
What about Su Nuan Xia

122
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,920
Didn't you say you had to train today

123
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,260
Didn't the coach tell you

124
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,340
Today's training is just a cover

125
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,480
We are going to have a birthday party for Bunny Bunny later.

126
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,500
Yeah

127
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,550
What about her

128
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,540
Should we set up the scene on the rooftop,

129
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,320
Brother Qiang, I'll take this to the coach first and help you when I get back later. Go ahead, go ahead

130
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,020
Come on, let me deliver it for you

135
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,600
Wrap up those lights later

138
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,800
How come it's you

139
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,280
Why can't it be me

140
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,020
Xiao Tutu's Birthday Party

141
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,830
As a member of the team

142
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,540
Why can't I come

143
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,900
Why are you still trying to rush the lights when you come here?

144
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,660
But the quality of the lamp is too poor

145
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:33,610
The birthday present you prepared for Xiao Rabbit is like this, what called it like this. I arranged it very carefully. All right, if you come to find fault, make room for me quickly.

146
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,550
If you want to help me, set up all these chairs.

147
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,520
You asked me to set these things up.

148
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,520
Do you have a problem

155
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,730
What are you doing

156
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,370
Things like moving things

157
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,820
Men should do it.

158
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,800
Do as you please

162
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,740
What are you doing climbing so high

163
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,630
Hurry down

164
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,180
Do you think I can come down

165
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,300
You jump down and I'll take it

166
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:03,590
I may be a little heavier than a normal girl. I am also a star player at least.

167
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,380
Is there no bearing capacity for this?

168
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,680
Then I jumped

169
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,930
Are you going to jump or not? You come closer. I'm afraid

172
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,590
Luckily, luckily

173
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,990
I didn't kiss him on the mouth.

174
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,220
Otherwise, you will not be able to bleed.

177
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,900
It was an accident. I didn't mean it

178
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,780
Don't touch porcelain

179
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:06,670
I touch what porcelain

182
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:17,410
Su warm summer, don't rely on me to like you just have nothing to fear, do you know

183
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,390
How many people want to be responsible to me

184
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,290
Anyway, I don't want to

188
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,680
Beauty, so you can still refuse

189
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,270
Su Nuan Xia

190
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,320
You are a living Liu Xiahui

192
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,810
Miss Yao, please enjoy your water

193
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,910
So you two

194
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,730
Not a chance to get in touch with each other alone.

195
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,490
Not once, really

196
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,360
Junye always said that he was very busy playing basketball and had no time to get along with me.

197
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,180
The child is too fond of playing.

198
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,330
It's not fun either.

199
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:30,840
Maybe there are other reasons why he has been addicted to basketball recently.

200
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,110
I don't know if I should tell you that you are afraid of what and have grandpa to back you up.

201
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,640
It was their basketball team that recently had a female coach. It seemed that the two of them were dating what.

202
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,400
Grandpa

207
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,460
Go forward to go back and forth

208
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,200
Be careful

209
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,470
Left Left Two Steps Forward

210
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,250
Have you prepared what surprise for me

211
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,240
Certainly.

212
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,830
It's beautiful

213
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,910
Is this what you have prepared for me

214
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,090
It is mainly prepared for warm summer.

215
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:33,510
Of course, we also did a lot of work. Happy Birthday to Rabbit

217
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,860
Thank you, warm baby. My best friend is still much more reliable than men.

223
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,120
Coach

224
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,710
You this

225
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,320
The party was not prepared enough.

226
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,380
Why are they all takeout food? Why do you still want barbecue?

227
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,300
If we had barbecued now, we would have been arrested by the security guards.

228
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,350
Isn't it covered by the night god

229
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,400
Besides, his family runs the school.

230
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,430
Who dares to catch us

231
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,320
Xiao Tu Rabbit

232
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:28,290
What are you doing here? Last time you told me about that, I was all right.

233
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:34,660
Don't take the past to heart. I don't care. Not me. I think I have already thought it over.

234
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,480
As long as the people I like change fast enough, they will definitely not be able to catch up with me.

235
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,600
What, there are still power outages these days.

236
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,120
Is the voltage unstable

237
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,140
Probably tripped

238
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,960
Rabbit Rabbit

239
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,750
You are familiar with this side. Go and have a look.

240
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,870
Good

244
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,850
There was no power outage. Then why did you let the bunny go

245
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,300
 

246
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,510
How loathe to give up

247
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:15,080
How can I bring my cake on the stage without her leaving?

256
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,620
I don't have my cell phone with me.

257
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,760
How can I see it so high

264
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:02,290
Xiao Rabbit, how did you become a single dog that no one cares about?

265
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,920
 

266
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,600
Let me tell you a joke

267
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,160
Do you know why Husky has been five minutes? Why hasn't Shaw Rabbit come back yet?

268
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,520
So concerned about her, call her

269
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,630
Go on

270
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,920
Do you know

271
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,900
Because its IQ is easy to reach a consensus with suspects. It's cold.

273
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,490
How come you don't even have a cell phone

274
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,060
If you are really in a hurry

275
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,650
The power distribution room is downstairs

276
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,670
You go down and have a look

277
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,660
Good

278
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,890
Just as I went down for a walk

279
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,210
And then

280
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,260
All right, all right, let me go on

281
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,820
Rabbit Rabbit

282
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,540
Ling Xuan

283
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,460
You have what's amazing

284
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,160
You don't like me, that's your disadvantage.

285
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,880
If you refuse me, you will lose a lot of money.

286
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,290
But

287
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,080
I have to pretend to be relaxed and tell you

288
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,280
I don't care. How can I not care? It matters a lot.

289
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,440
Good

292
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,040
I like you, Xiao Tu Tu Tu

293
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,590
I thought you didn't like me because I was so stupid

294
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,250
I like to bicker with you and like you to be with me. I don't like others to drink your soup.

295
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,630
Although it is really hard to drink.

297
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,480
Quick, quick, quick

298
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,730
We do this

299
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,670
Not so good, is it

302
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,010
Did your heart beat faster just now

303
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,710
So the people you like haven't changed yet, have they

304
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,190
There are no flowers or applause here.

306
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,300
Here are a hundred jokes I made up for you

307
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,240
What

308
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,560
Before

309
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,790
I often make you unhappy.

310
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,730
So look at it when you're unhappy

311
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,440
Think of me as making amends

313
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,550
Can you still like me

315
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,990
Here comes the applause

320
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,040
Why don't you go with Shaw Rabbit

321
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:52,090
I'm stupid. They were just together. How could I make a light bulb?

323
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,300
You are stupid

324
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,510
Not only did you ignore my confession,

325
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,080
And grab a bunch of light bulbs and shake them in front of me every day.

326
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,920
Sorry

327
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,990
I really can't help it for the time being.

328
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,820
Over the hurdle of coaches and players,

329
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,650
How long is that for now

330
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,330
Then I have to go back and think about it. I'll tell you tomorrow. Let's go. Bye

332
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,290
Su Nuan Xia

333
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,370
I will wait until you think it over.

334
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,640
Su Nuan Xia Hold on

338
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,940
Grandpa

339
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,480
What are you doing here

342
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,100
Yeah

344
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,510
You're downstairs. Come back later

345
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,440
I haven't got up yet

346
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,260
Have dinner together

347
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,510
Yes

349
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,920
Then you want to eat what

351
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,960
Good

352
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,970
All right, bye-bye

353
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,100
When did you get up in what

354
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:21,540
Since you called Ling Xuan, how are you? Xiao Tu Tu's love is different.

355
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,190
This is all learned to lie

356
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:31,950
Look at you. You've been dressed up all the time and said, what, I haven't got up yet.

357
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,980
In fact, I'm a little regretful about agreeing to him.

358
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:40,630
You can't be so fickle, can you? If a woman promises too quickly, she will be eaten to death by a man.

359
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,600
Yesterday was my impulse, so I should test him again.

360
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,660
Who let him before

361
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,990
In a word

362
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:59,190
What I just said on the phone is one of my ways to control men. If I act very active and cooperative, wouldn't it seem that I am very easy to chase?

363
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,860
Where did you learn all this

364
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:15,410
You don't know that love is too complicated and smooth. I'm afraid it won't last long, too long and I'm afraid it can't stand changes.

366
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,910
You have no class today

367
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,280
Why haven't you come yet

368
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,700
I sent him a message in the crowd and he didn't reply.

369
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,240
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed cannot be reached for the time being. Please dial again later.

370
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,190
Situation in what

371
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,990
There was a quarrel and a cold war.

372
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,470
Practice your ball in what's words

373
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,390
 

374
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,830
There must be something delayed. I think I will come.

376
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,960
Warm summer

377
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,250
Let's go first

378
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,350
Bye, coach

379
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,260
Why haven't you come yet

380
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,200
Sorry, the user you dialed cannot be reached for the time being.

381
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,540
Please redial later

385
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,760
Talk to me about what

386
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,360
Grandpa

387
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,680
I must go back to Qingmeng

388
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,580
Enough, enough, enough

389
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,450
Shut up, what. Go back to your dream

390
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,210
You just want to go back to that team and continue to play. They are really a good team.

391
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,800
It's not the same as before.

392
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,340
In order to play ball

393
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,440
I even forgot my identity.

395
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,650
You took what I said as a deaf ear and turned a deaf ear to it.

396
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:19,400
No, but I really like to play ball. The heir of the monarch's family

397
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,150
There must be a marriage that suits your life. Yao Zhen told me

398
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,510
Previously

399
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,650
The Ann General Administration rejected it.

400
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,300
Forget it

401
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:36,970
But how nice this girl is now, Yao Zhen. Don't fool around this time. Warm summer

402
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,850
She is a good girl

403
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:46,100
And I didn't play to be with her. Anyway, as long as the female coach is here, you are not allowed to go.

404
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,650
You are not allowed to leave this house without my permission.

406
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:59,010
Are you saying that Jun Yee is missing? Even Lu Ye doesn't know where he is.

407
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,340
I told you everything I know

408
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,300
My family lives near Junye's house. He did not show up for several days in a row.

410
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:17,200
MLM kidnapping, abduction, kidney digging, forced prostitution, and the strength of the monarch's family are all impossible to happen.

411
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,970
Shen Xuechang summed up well.

412
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,630
Admire

413
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,060
Coach Su's brain circuit is indeed clear and strange.

414
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,650
Jun Night's disappearance this time was silent and there was no news.

415
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,580
Capable of doing such a thing

416
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,690
It can only be your grandfather at night.

417
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,940
Grandpa, the old man

418
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,900
But why would he do that

419
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,680
 

421
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:47,970
By the way, when I called his house, his servant said that he would stop looking for Jun Night about the basketball club in the future.

427
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,380
How come you sound so cheerless

428
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,770
It's okay. What's going on

429
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,640
It's okay. I just asked you how you were preparing for the match.

430
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,320
Is there something wrong with what

431
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,810
He disappeared at night

432
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,020
He can't be reached

433
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,580
It seems that he can't compete with us.

434
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:25,240
The most urgent thing is to find a substitute quickly.

435
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,200
Otherwise, you won't be able to play.

436
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,610
I know

437
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,650
But I don't seem to be able to worry about your night.

438
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:39,810
And I don't seem to be able to focus all my attention on the match. He may have met what.

439
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,300
As you know

440
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,150
People from a family like his

441
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,540
The attitude towards basketball will not be very pure, will it?

442
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,370
Chu Ran, you don't know him. He is not such a person. You don't know his persistence in playing basketball.

443
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,070
I won't blame him even if he can't make it to the match with you.

446
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,050
Feed warm summer

449
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,190
It turns out in my heart

450
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,310
Is he more important than winning the myth

451
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,800
So I've been struggling with what these days. I heard that a new noodle shop has been opened in the canteen. It's good.

452
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,970
Shall I take you to eat

453
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,920
Listen to you

455
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,950
Couples are amazing

456
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,830
Where are you at night

457
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,930
When will you come back from what

461
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,120
Brother Xiaoye, you are finally awake.

463
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,820
You have come into contact with an allergen.

464
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,730
The doctor has already dealt with it. It's not a big deal. You just have to pay attention to your rest.

465
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,230
Where's Grandpa

466
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,720
The chairman is going to attend the meeting of the branch office at the moment.

467
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,960
When he left, he told me to take good care of you.

468
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,320
Actually

469
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,440
The remarks made by the chairman of the board

470
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,230
He didn't mean it, too. Don't take it too seriously.

471
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,240
I'm used to it

472
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,700
You go out first

473
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,200
I would like to have a rest

474
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,480
Yes

477
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,320
You can't wait to die any more at night.

478
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:59,680
I can imagine the way you scold me now.

479
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,540
But it doesn't matter

480
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,160
I'll be back soon

You really don't eat

485
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,820
Have no appetite

486
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,790
What's the matter

487
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,500
I think we abuse dogs.

489
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,180
I'm not losing weight

490
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,740
Losing weight is not your style.

491
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,790
Our Ling Xuan needs to eat more

493
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,190
Open one's mouth

495
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,940

Play-chasing

511
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,750
Will you apply the facial mask what again?

512
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,860

Just waiting for you to reply a sweet good night.

00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,510
The correct way to open it is what.

532
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,650
Let me pick you up to the movies this weekend and then take you to a delicious Japanese food.

533
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

534
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,850

I just need someone to help her make decisions.

539

Do you understand
