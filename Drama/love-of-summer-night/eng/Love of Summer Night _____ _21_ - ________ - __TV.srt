4
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:25,290
Hello, help! Warm summer, they are demons. I can't pull them. Say what, don't worry. Say you slowly.

6
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,590
I seem to have seen the psychopaths you mentioned.

7
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,930
Excuse me. Thank you

8
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,640
What are you doing

9
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,450
Report Coach

10
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,470
We are reviewing the method of loving each other.

11
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,920
Ask the coach for instructions

29
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,080
Whose idea

38
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,930
If you ask them

39
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,670
The meaning of basketball is what

40
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,000
They may not be able to answer

41
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,070
But through their changes, you should know

42
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,980
It is because you and your father reshaped them in basketball.

43
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:39,410
It helped them. Because of you, they have a new goal in life.

44
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,720
Full of energy, no longer like the way I used to play around.

45
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,440
So don't let Shen Xuechang make a mistake,

46
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,440
It negates all your achievements.

50
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,300
Do you think the fat man is fat

51
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,710
With his current height and weight

52
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,960
If you don't lose weight, it will affect your health.

54
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,300
Who is this

55
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,960
This is Zhang Xiaoqiang before playing basketball.

57
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,080
Last night, it was well said to let me go.

58
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,940
Not yet 24 hours later, he refused to accept the account.

59
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,280
It was my idea

60
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,250
But they don't want you to go either

61
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,880
Otherwise, I wouldn't be so cooperative with you.

62
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,740
Actually, I'm very touched

63
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,790
But

64
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,130
You can keep me. I can't keep me for a while. I still want to go.

65
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,290
Before you leave

66
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
I want to show you something

68
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,780
Another day of wanting to play ball

69
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,520
Why did you bring me here

71
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,160
Why does this man eat so much? No wonder it's scary to grow into a big fool.

72
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,960
You know what, he's on the basketball team of our school. He can't win honor for the school without this head.

75
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,390
Senior Qi Feng, I like you. Don't listen to their nonsense.

80
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,940
It's over and I can't sleep again.

86
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,220
My friends are less than a month away from the annual finals of Qingmeng and Myth.

87
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:24,690
The coach announced that starting from today, the training will be increased and the duck will be washed one hour in advance tomorrow morning.

88
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,670
The rabbit is so cute. How can you eat the rabbit?

93
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,270
Coach Ben has been waiting for you to watch the ball for 4 hours.

94
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:01,430
The group was five minutes late.

95
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,360
Penalty station

97
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,210
Lu Ye has already taught everything he can.

98
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,250
The rest is on our own.

99
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,950
Do you have confidence

101
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,740
If you have something to say, you still have to wait for what to practice it for me.

108
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:55,842
Ninety-two ninety-three ninety-four ninety-five ninety-six is seven ninety-eight ninety-nine one hundred

114
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,280
Quick

115
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,070
Jack Bauer, come and help me

116
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,020
Don't you move. I'll snipe at him first.

118
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,710
Rest Time to Assemble

119
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,450
Strictly speaking

120
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,560
We still have an hour and a half. From today, we will cut it by half.

121
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,300
Listen to the coach

122
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,740
Now I'm the coach

123
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,200
Yes

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,260
Run poison, quick

133
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:57,680
With poison, this is the men's toilet. I dare to be lazy at this time. After playing the football match, I will be punished for sweeping the toilet for one month.

137
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:12,770
We got up this morning and the weather was clear. We came to the playground. No one could get down.

138
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,800
Zhang Xiaoqiang, you still want to run another 32,000, right? Speed up

139
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,320
I must have been out of my head the other two days before I wanted to keep this devil wears prada.

143
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,200
He smokes what again

145
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,000
He said he quit

146
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,680
You came to what when you were on vacation.

147
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,700
I have something to discuss with you

148
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,740
What affair

149
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,560
I'm going on a date with Jun Night

153
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,590
You promised me before

154
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,492
If I can make Lu Ye a teaching assistant, you can let me date Jun Night for one day.

155
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,090
I said so, but the right to interpret any event ultimately belongs to the organizer.

156
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,050
If you want to go back on your word, it's not

157
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,460
The main reason is that it took you so long to come to me. The validity period has passed.

158
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,570
When you promised me before, you didn't say there was a validity period.

159
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,810
I didn't say that, but it's common sense

160
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,850
Then you and I are getting married

161
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,050
You just came to cash in, didn't you just become a mistress and get involved?

162
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,320
What you said

163
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,260
It seems to make some sense, doesn't it, so this matter has to be turned over and so on

164
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,130
Are you married to Junye

165
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,770
Since the unmarried woman is not married,

166
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,170
Then I'm not against morality. I'll take your boyfriend with me tomorrow.

167
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,120
Meet me at the lake

171
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,270
Don't be angry. I tried my best yesterday.

172
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,910
Has succeeded in reducing the day to four hours. Just stay with her for four hours.

173
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,680
Your boyfriend is dating someone else

174
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,330
Aren't you jealous

175
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,600
I believe you

178
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,040
You have to believe in yourself. You are the most beautiful in my eyes.

179
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,330
How's it goe? How's that boyfriend ready

180
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,680
Ready

182
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,140
Okay, let's go

185
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,930
Didn't you say you believed in Junye, a duplicitous woman

186
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:17,060
Women who are duplicitous, alas, where do you say they will go? Wherever do you care?

187
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,370
Your boyfriend is nearly two meters tall as an adult.

188
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,280
It's not the fear that he will be lost.

189
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,080
Just curiosity

190
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,720
I advise you not to wonder if you know where they are going.

191
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,380
You'll want to know what they did, what, and then you'll want to know if they had any intimate contact.

192
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,770
Have you held hands

193
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,280
Did you kiss

194
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,760
And then you keep thinking about it, thinking about it, thinking about going to bed

196
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,720
Absolutely impossible

197
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:00,260
Besides, I am not the kind of girl who is insecure.

201
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,800
Junye is really a thoughtful person. Now you know where they went. Don't worry.

203
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,850
What are they doing on the open-air basketball court

208
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,810
Come on

209
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,130
Give me a hug

210
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,540
Oh, my gosh

211
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,620
Alas, I'm going to be with Lu Ye.

212
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,320
What are you doing? You just let go of me, tear you up, you come back, you don't come here

213
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,530
You get back here and let me go

214
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,790
I can't spare that dead girl and don't look at anyone's man.

215
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,600
Do you think I am a sick cat when the tiger does not show its power? You let go

216
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,760
Is it funny

217
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,860
 

218
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,210
No, really. What Anna has decided to accept Luye.

219
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,070
She just wants a farewell hug

220
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,970
Say goodbye to your youth, say goodbye to your Ming love, which ended without a disease. Well said, who knows she is playing what's bad idea again.

222
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,270
And you

223
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,780
Why are you so casual? She says she hugs you. You think you're a doll in the mall.

224
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,020
Ah

225
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,310
Su Nuanxia

226
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,010
You lent me to Anna. I said I could lend you. Why are you so unprincipled?

229
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,600
Where on earth are you going in warm summer

230
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,430
Don't you talk to me. I'm bored. I'm going to the supermarket to buy disinfectant.

231
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,400
Release

232
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,770
Let go. I don't need you

233
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,920
Laugh at what Laugh at you Laugh at me Laugh at you Laugh at me Laugh at you

234
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,400
What are you doing

235
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,750
Cold War

236
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,870
It's beautiful to think about it.

237
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,360
You

238
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,510
Why? I told you to let go

239
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,050
Let go. Do you hear me

246
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,900
Coach, you have a cold

247
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,860
No, no, you're wearing a what mask

248
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,760
Why are you staring at you at night

249
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:03,070
Wearing a mask is not necessarily a cold but also a swollen mouth.

251
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,120
What is he doing here

252
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,920
Why don't you reply to my news in warm summer

253
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,860
The former captain is here again.

254
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
I like Qingmeng so much.

255
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,150
Why did you turn to myth at the beginning?

256
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,790
I want to go to Beijing

257
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,420
Join a professional team

258
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,390
Don't want to waste time with amateurs,

259
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,800
Don't think I don't know you're thinking about what

260
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,970
You'll be twenty-two next year

261
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,880
Can participate in the league selection

262
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,040
So that you can bypass me

263
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,030
Stay in Beijing with warm summer

264
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,580
But I will not let you succeed.

265
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,140
You are not suitable for warm summer.

266
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,700
Is it fit or not

267
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,680
It's not up to you

268
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,260
What are you doing

269
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,200
Qingmeng is not our private territory. We welcome everyone to visit.

270
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,440
King's Night

271
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,160
It's not that you don't know what I mean. Brother Chu Ran has no other meaning.

272
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,120
He has his own ideas

273
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,200
He didn't mean any harm

274
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,140
Some people are not like good people in what but like thieves. We have to be careful.

275
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,830
It seems that the last time I hit you, I played too conservatively, which made you overestimate your level. You

276
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,520
Ling Xuan Ling Xuan Ling Xuan

277
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,130
You mean what, you

278
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,340
What do you think makes you angry? You said we played very conservatively last time.

279
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,960
Let's see

280
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,430
Your real strength

281
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,640
Yes

282
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,580
This year's competition

283
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,190
I will play the whole match.

287
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,250
All right

288
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,880
It's getting late. Let's go back to rest early.

289
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:48,940
Ding Lei

292
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,360
Chu Ran, what's wrong with this

293
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,810
Why did you suddenly increase your training? The captain said that he would play the whole match against Qingmeng this year.

297
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,650
Warm summer

298
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,440
Recently, Uncle Manager of the Stadium is very fierce. He is small and transparent like me.

299
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,950
I can hardly cope with it.

300
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,480
What's the matter

301
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,230
Recently, many things in the stadium have broken down and need to be repaired.

302
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,070
I don't want to use the team's money.

303
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,730
Uncle thinks we are too angry.

304
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,160
I said

305
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,630
You closed your doors and studied tactics. No one has time to help me.

306
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,620
Even Ling Xuandu

307
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,640
It's too hard for me

308
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,580
Do it at your own discretion

309
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,890
Damn it, so many things broke down the other two days.

310
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,630
Su Nuan Xia

311
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,840
Did you break those things

312
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,000
I think so

313
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,880
How many day have you been sleepless

314
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,060
How long are you goe to keep it from me

316
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,620
Everyone knows that

317
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,680
During the warm summer, I closed my doors to study tactics.

318
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,470
The team is managed by Lu Ye and assisted by Jun Ye.

319
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,240
Did she not let you see her these days

321
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,820
Repair Application

322
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,220
It's all for this week.

323
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,640
The door of the dressing room

324
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,310
Actually

329
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,680
The faucet in the men's toilet

330
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,960
 

332
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,780
Actually

335
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,340
You're right

336
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,940
Tell the truth

337
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,180
Warm summer is like this now.

338
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,150
One month before the college entrance examination,

339
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,020
I had the privilege of witnessing

340
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,860
What should I do then

341
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,020
What should I do then? Tell me clearly. Don't worry. I'll give you the inside story.

342
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Machamp out of control

343
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,380
Long-term insomnia means that the stress of warm summer has reached a critical point.

344
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,450
It must be because of the great battle with myth.

345
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,870
How about that

346
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,250
How can I

347
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,460
Let her relax. There is one thing to say, one thing to say.

348
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,050
I don't know that either

349
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,010
But let's not get too close to the warm summer recently.

350
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,840
If you hurt any match, don't play it.

351
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,510
She did not see you at night.

352
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,180
This is also why Rabbit Rabbit

353
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,420
Rabbit Rabbit

354
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,780
 

355
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,130
Rabbit Rabbit

357
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,500
Rabbit Rabbit

360
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,360
Rabbit Rabbit

361
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,280
Have you seen my cell phone

362
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,610
Why don't you come out in your pajamas to scare people when you don't have a good sleep in the dormitory?

364
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,860
I want to see the basketball information on my cell phone.

365
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,760
 

367
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,900
Here you are

368
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,100
It's all my fault

369
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,000
I didn't take good care of you.

370
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,620
Rest assured

371
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,950
I'm here

373
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,670
I'm fine. I'm fine

374
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,930
Hmm

375
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,350
She has a lot of strength

380
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,570
Be full

381
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,640
Do you know why I brought you here

382
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:15,820
The day you grabbed the doll, you said that the average of three dollars was not too cool.

383
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,550
I'll go over there and see what's going on in what

384
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,440
You had a good time that day

385
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,370
I know you have a big appetite

386
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,480
So this buffet is six hundred people to your appetite.

387
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,060
You will definitely enjoy the pleasure of an average of three dollars each.

388
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:40,110
You know me, you can't let me go and fetch your meal.

391
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,600
I'll pay extra for all these dishes.

392
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,920
I have seen many people like you.

403
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,430
Girl, I'll give you something to eat.

404
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,280
 

406
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:41,650
If the old iron is not satisfied with the suit, it will be double-clicked and laughed.

411
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,344
If you don 't, let' s get out of here. I 'm afraid he' ll throw us out. Don 't worry

412
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,540
I'll buy this place

414
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,500
Girl

415
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,170
And if that's not enough, do you have anything else to eat in what? I'll have someone arrange it for you right away.

416
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,910
No, that's enough, that's enough

417
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:24,590
Customers are God. Welcome to Xiaoyaoju Seafood Self-service to enjoy first-class service.

418
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,720
Hmm

419
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,220
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

420
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,120
Come on, come on, girl

421
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,990
Come back, come on, come on, come on, girl, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, take your time

422
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,340
Good, good

423
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,330
Thank you for your hospitality

424
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,940
You are the most edible I have ever seen.

425
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,640
We will often come to eat in the future. Sorry, I won't entertain you.

426
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,060
Because you eat too much, you have been listed in our blacklist. You can't take it easy.

428
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,723
Then don't do marketing with me. Come out

430
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,320
I'm going to photograph their store and send it to my friends to tell them not to come.

431
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,790
What if it rains so hard

432
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,270
What are you doing

434
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,290
 

436
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,100
The manager gave it to you

437
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,630
He said there were no umbrellas

438
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,688
You go in and borrow your umbrella and phone.

440
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,900
I told Jason Chung

441
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,340
I'm going to buy this place

442
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:56,210
It's not too exaggerated to change to a public toilet, is it? Let me explain to someone

443
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,340
Jason Chung said

444
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,880
The area of this place is too large

445
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,000
Can't change

446
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,140
You want to change what

448
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,760
Fortunately, it can't be changed. No, no, no, no, no

449
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,630
The only thing that teases you is your skin.

450
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:14,330
No, we have to figure out how to get there

452
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,720
Are you ready

453
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,720
1

454
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,480
2

460
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,210
 

463
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:49,540
Your new hairstyle is really beautiful today. Of course, this is the same style of Korean drama.

464
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,268
Let's eat what today and order later. You haven't told me whether I am good with bangs or good without bangs.

466
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,460
Just as good-looking

467
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,460
I told you last time that you have a good foundation and look good at everything.

468
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,100
How can it be the same

469
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:10,940
Have you lost your freshness to me? Sorry to disturb your red wine.

471
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,970
Please take your time, gentlemen

473
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,140
Do you think my legs are long or theirs

474
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,100
You are perfunctory. No, I am serious.

475
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,130
We basketball players are very sensitive to body proportions.

476
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,650
Although it is to look at girls, the selection mechanism is the same. You can choose enough.

478
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,320
Let me ask you something

479
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,350
Do you think my long hair looks good or my short hair looks good

481
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:51,090
Long hair looks like you are a lady.

482
00:30:52,930 --> 00:31:05,410
You mean my short hair is not good-looking. How can short hair be more nifty? I think it is quite suitable for you. You clearly want to say that I can't control the style of a lady with long hair, right? I don't have it. I want to say that you are so beautiful.

483
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,790
What hairstyle is good-looking ah perfunctory sunny son sunny son

484
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,490
Let me explain

486
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,860
Hey, what are you doing? I'm resting after playing

487
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:25,030
You would rather rest than come to me. Do you still have me in your heart?

488
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,660
 

489
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,780
Hey, where are you

490
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,180
I am thinking about the tactics against Qingmeng tomorrow.

491
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:40,830
I'll pick you up for a midnight snack later. No, you don't even have time to send me a WeChat for a few seconds. You don't have me in your heart.

492
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:44,220
Haruko, it's very important for me to stop this match. Really

493
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:50,270
Sure, talk to your gentleman at night

494
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,950
That's too much

495
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,870
Hey, what are you doing

496
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,690
Akiko, I was thinking about you

497
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,960
I miss me, you don't want me, you give me a trick to fool me, why don't you die

499
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,270
Feed, feed

500
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:18,980
I miss you. What are you doing? What are you not doing? You're wandering around

501
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,960
You'd rather wander around than look for me.

502
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,400
Do you still have me in your heart? You have made great achievements, have you? You won't take the initiative to find me if I don't look for you? This is what's attitude.

503
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,200
Want to break up, don't you

504
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,640
No, no, you listen to me

506
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,960
Hmm

507
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,840
He joined the army.

508
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,880
Hmm

509
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Ah

510
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,920
Hmm

511
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,280
Hmm

512
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:04,990
You sit in the morning looking at your cell phone,

513
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:13,950
The calamity deceives down, the staircase, the book man,

514
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,230
Step by step, it's up to you

515
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,520
Fresh love.

516
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,630
Here we go.

517
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:32,670
No, it's not that, it's not that,

518
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,310
Right?

519
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,700
Don't believe in accidents and live.

520
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,240
Let's take a look,

521
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,820
Small

522
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:48,420
I didn't put your emotions

523
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:53,020
With you in the mood every day,

524
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,780
Birds

525
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,960
Without confidence,

526
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Ah

527
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,520
You fall asleep in the classroom,

528
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,120
The eyes began to bleed,

529
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,040
Hmm

530
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,470
I just thought

531
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,280
Looking at you is hard to forget,

532
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:29,120
Your bright time is also the weather.

533
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,640
Ah

534
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:34,140
Me

535
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:38,840
Brazil.

536
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,140
But I am really angry.

537
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:49,220
Sorry, I didn't mean to

538
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,470
Hmm

539
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,330
I don't care about money,
