1
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,410
You can't beat me one on one

2
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,690
Why don't you hide this time

3
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:49,550
Then walking with you, I am especially like a rich woman with a little milk dog. It looks like she has special money.

5
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,140
Jokingly

6
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,740
This science building

7
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,350
It was donated by my grandfather in 1998.

8
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,910
Art

9
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,130
It was my fifteenth birthday

10
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,240
Grandpa built it for me

11
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,940
No.11 Teaching Building

12
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,110
I donated my first bucket of gold.

13
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,750
Well, well, you

14
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,280
Major catering chains surpass all walks of life.

15
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,930
The Junshi Group has been involved in these, all of which will be mine in the future.

17
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,500
And I'm yours

18
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,100
I don't want you just looking rich

19
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,880
Stay with me

20
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,110
All I have is yours.

22
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,200
With you rounded off, I held it in my hand.

23
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,080
Half the school

24
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,980
Assets, then I do have a lot of money.

27
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,390
How come it's you again

28
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,920
Shen Yingliang's hand is not wanted

29
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,880
Doctor

30
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,500
Well, I played too hard last time.

31
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,790
Next time I will be careful not to pay attention.

32
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,630
In the future, don't say you can't hold basketball with a scalpel.

33
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,560
What are we doing here

34
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,960
Inspecting my assets, of course

35
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,720
Is this infirmary also invested by Junshi

36
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,160
All Equipment

39
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Excuse me, Mr. Shen

51
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,480
I promise you

52
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,620
Find the best doctor to see Shen Yingliang.

53
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,410
Do you believe me

54
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,060
Of course

55
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,070
Forget it

56
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,560
I don't think about what. I just want to be quiet

57
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,620
Who is Quiet

58
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,700
Shen Xuechang was given a warm summer holiday.

59
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,640
Quiet is the new player

60
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,350
Don't eat it cold if you have a bad brain.

61
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,780
Coach Jun bullied me at night.

65
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,560
On behalf of Qingmeng, I offer condolences to the basketball team.

66
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:59,130
The team has grown rapidly in such a short period of time. This time against Myth, we played with momentum and style.

67
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,300
Although we lose, we are still proud.

68
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,080
The players on the pitch are the hardest. I'm not what warm summer. You are too modest.

69
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,350
Not the Kui is coach Su's daughter, indeed as expected tiger father has no dog daughter

70
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,570
Principal, don't compare me with my father.

71
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,510
Of course, the younger generation will always be a pioneer.

72
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:25,560
Principal, our coach is very shy

74
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,040
All right, then I won't disturb everyone's training.

76
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,100
Take a good picture

79
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,050
King's Night

80
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,860
Warm summer now wants to be quiet, not night at night.

81
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,660
I think bunny bunny

82
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,200
I feel sick

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,010
The match should be steady and win. The health of the players is more important than winning or losing.

84
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,840
People are higher than basketball.

90
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,930
What are you doing

91
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,020
We have something to say today

93
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,510
Come on

94
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,500
The responsibility for losing the game cannot be borne by the coach alone.

95
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,640
So

96
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,640
We are going to hold a review conference.

97
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,680
Start

99
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:53,940
I have too much mood fluctuation on the court, my mentality is not stable enough, my moves are fancy, I want to be handsome in front of my sister, the purpose of playing is not pure, I am stupid, I can't overcome the shadow of dunk

100
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,060
I didn't take the lead as captain.

101
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,900
Can't limit the opponent's score, so usually ask the coach to give me more practice.

102
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,880
In fact, every time I train to squat in the pit for so long, it's not because I have a tummy, it's because I'm lazy.

103
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:16,310
Zhang Xiaoqiang, every time I go to deliver takeout, I say that I ask for leave. In fact, I lied to you. Ling Xuan, you and I are stupid.

104
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,560
Zhang Xiaoqiang Ling Xuan, you two

105
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,270
Give me a penalty to sweep the stadium for a month. Good, good, good

106
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:34,270
I never wash my hands when I go to the toilet. I wear a pair of underwear on the front and back four times. My avi format video has two T's. I have indexed it by different artists. I am a handsome boy.

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,080
You can only instigate so much money.

117
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,350
Is that a little happier

118
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,960
How many boxed meals can you buy with so much money, the red envelopes sent out, and the water spilled out

126
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,070
Your heart knows I know

127
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,910
Don't worry. It's okay

129
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,760
I don't believe it

130
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,040
Unless

131
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,170
You promised me to do a happy thing together every day.

132
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,920
Then I'm relieved

133
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,340
All right, what, is everything okay

135
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,900
What do you want

136
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,120
You'll know tomorrow

140
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,980
What about what

149
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,220
 

152
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,820
I think it's all right

153
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:03,730
But this exercise is not convenient either.

154
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,710
 

155
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:12,900
The quality is too poor. I'm sorry we didn't consider the way customers try on fashion in this way. We must pay attention next time.

157
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,220
Are you satisfied? Excuse me

158
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,800
Go

159
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,800
Don't buy this one

160
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:37,740
Three carat weight color cutting clarity is top grade

163
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,980
Excuse me

164
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,080
Go

166
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,600
 

167
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,280
This looks good

168
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,840
It is rare to meet what you like.

169
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,760
Buy

170
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,960
Should be able to hold basketball

172
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,240
It is better to put basketball in your hand.

178
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,090
I bought too much to wear. I came here.

179
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,780
How can you go home empty-handed

180
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,170
I'll take all of these

183
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,560
Hold it, please

200
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,980
What to do

202
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,360
I don't want any of these things

203
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,030
Why don't I take these things back

204
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,330
And then you drive

205
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,370
I'll call someone to pick it up.

207
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,190
Let's see

208
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,870
Anyway, it's close to the school.

209
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,890
Let's go by bus

211
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,060
I knew you hadn't been there

215
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,380
How about girlfriend, isn't she good?

220
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,870
Do you like taking buses very much

222
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,000
For two dollars, you can explore the city for free.

223
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,150
However, the morning and evening rush hours will not work.

224
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,840
Don't mention it

225
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,940
I can drive the car and you can also

226
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,640
Not the same

236
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,940
Wait for me in five minutes. I'll be right back

239
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,070
Do you like sweet cones

240
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,780
Mainly, the second one is half price.

241
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,840
A two-dollar bus will do

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,200
A small cone can also be used as a toast.

245
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,560
The coach is under a lot of pressure.

246
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,370
Let's stop pretending to be deep.

247
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,790
Hurry up and cheer up

250
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,080
A smile is worse than a cry.

251
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,970
Warm summer

252
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,430
You see

253
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,490
The light will come

256
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,620
Don't mention it

257
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,010
Coach Sue said before

258
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
Failure is the mother of success

259
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,080
Then we have too many moms

260
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,830
If you don't talk, no one will treat you as dumb.

261
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,780
I'm fine. Don't worry

262
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,850
Junye was right

263
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,670
There is no way to continue like this.

264
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,800
I decided to pay out of my own pocket. It's my treat.

265
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:23,550
In order to help everyone clear away the haze, it doesn't matter how much it costs. Let me do it. Let's order our Ling Xuan takeout.

266
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,340
Kill two birds with one stone

269
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,180
Gifts are not sent to people's hearts.

270
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,940
So

271
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,000
Do you like what in warm summer

282
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,560
That's it

294
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,700
Let's play a game

295
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,220
You answer my question, we're in a

296
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,180
We are all in the house

297
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,760
Two people

298
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,870
Eat for a day

299
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,540
Three meals

300
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,280
One room, two people, three meals and four seasons. I'll realize it for you.

301
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,750
How do you know I like it best

302
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,760
Because

303
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,130
I love you

304
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:36,060
This is what I want two people to be simple and happy together.

305
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,080
So as a memorial to our love

306
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,480
I have already put this house

307
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,620
Buy it

309
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,640
Who stipulates that a treat can only be a meal

310
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,020
Good quality and low price

311
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,880
Four dollars a two each

312
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,720
Ah, you

313
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,180
What Practice Reaction Ability

314
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,040
What's the order, no order, no catch? Run 20 laps tomorrow, Jun Night

316
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,470
Sorry, the left hand is lax in training.

317
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,550
Why did the coach continue to practice when he was stunned?

318
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,580
Good

323
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,440
It's all my fault that I was so radical yesterday that Shen Xuechang's injury worsened.

324
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,600
It's all my fault

325
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Don't take all the blame on yourself. You said why didn't I notice

326
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,400
If I had found out earlier, if I hadn't been so competitive, it wasn't your fault.

327
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,460
You're just under a lot of pressure

328
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,210
Need to relax

342
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,620
Remember when we first ate sweet potatoes

343
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,140
How can I eat this kind of food? Then you won't eat it for me.

344
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,500
Anyway, who doesn't know this kind of thing will flatulence if you eat too much, bring it

345
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,460
Eat as you like

346
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,660
No, no, no, that day, no

347
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:05,770
It's not good at all. It's not good. You still eat it.

349
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,360
Su Nuan Xia

351
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,390
Me too

353
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,760
Here is the small one for you

356
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,960
 

358
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,040
Move, move, move

365
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,510
This is too happy, isn't it? I also want to have a boyfriend to practice catching dolls for me.

366
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:13,310
On average, three dollars a piece is not too cool. Yes, I'll go over there and see if there are what's fun.

369
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,420
Thank you

372
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,860
For you

373
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,790
This is what

376
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,780
These are the twenty-one stars I gave you. They form two hearts in the sky.

377
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,160
On behalf of my love for you

378
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,920
As eternal as the universe

381
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,270
Say what

382
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,460
No, take it back

383
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:17,890
Why is it that where will you go has a bad ending? The ending is not important. It is good that love is eternal.

390
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,790
I can't be with you today

391
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,780
Why

392
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,150
Is it

393
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,460
I did it wrong again, what

394
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,990
At fault

395
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,930
That's great

396
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,150
Today, you will accompany me to do one thing.

397
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,520
No problem

398
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,090
 

403
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,480
The goal of cooking this time is very simple.

404
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,550
Don't call

405
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,000
Take-out

408
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,260
Secret Recipe

409
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:46,890
This is my favorite dish from now on.

410
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,580
Leave it to me

413
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,480
I'll do it

414
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,480
No, no, no

415
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:06,350
It's too difficult. Why don't we change it? This is your wish.

419
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,290
Dried chili

421
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,740
Dried chili

425
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,760
You said Coach Sue was so good at cooking

426
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,030
Why did you give birth to a cooking idiot?

427
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,360
You know, what, I'm a theoretical expert. I'm a natural coach.

431
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,680
 

432
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,800
It's ugly

436
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,190
It's over, it's over. I just touched the chili

437
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:57,280
Make you laugh at me

439
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,750
It turns out that you will choke when cooking spicy dishes.

442
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,800
What's the matter

443
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,070
Miss Coach Sue

444
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,450
When he used to make spicy shrimp

445
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,780
It must be hard

447
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,950
It doesn't matter. Coach Sue is so good at cooking.

448
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,060
How can it be the same as the two of us

450
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,180
It's okay. I'm here

458
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,630
Rich levels, spicy and bitter

459
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,400
You said it was as advanced as making coffee with your hands.

460
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,180
Innovative Dish Diablo Spicy Shrimp

461
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,320
We did it

464
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:06,060
Hello, everyone, welcome to the second phase of the special project of the survival guide for straight men who know you warm on summer nights. I am your mentor Qingzi.

465
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:12,390
Today, our topic is the boyfriend's desire to survive.

466
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:19,620
Question 1 When your girlfriend asks how many ex-girlfriends you have, the correct answer is what.

467
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:26,000
Baby that doesn't exist, you are my first love. It's too fake.

468
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,690
The past is over. I believe you are the last one for me.

469
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:35,270
Too much wrong

470
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,970
To be honest with you, I have talked to nine girlfriends before.

471
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:43,830
To nine girlfriends

472
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,690
Respectively

473
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:50,190
Eyes like your nose, like your mouth, like your ears, like your hairstyle, like your figure, like your character, like your temperament, like your

475
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,720
Interests and hobbies are also like your last

477
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,350
I finally met a perfect you

478
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,290
That's awesome

480
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,330
Good

481
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,000
Question 2

482
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,210
When my girlfriend said the air conditioner here was too cold,

483
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,720
I know how to do this

484
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,770
Ask the waiter to turn up the air conditioner

485
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,340
Mistakes are too perfunctory.

486
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,090
That's not easy. Just drink more hot water.

487
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,520
Ding Lei, you've had enough, no matter when you are in what, as long as your boyfriend dares to say, drink more hot water.

488
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,670
Can be pulled out and shot

489
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,030
Like me

490
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,660
Must be the right answer

491
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,420
It's not

492
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,070
The best you can do is pass the exam.

493
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,470
Who told you to wear so little

494
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,790
He also showed his thigh.

495
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,200
Don't you know, take a coat

496
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,020
Chu Ran, isn't it your death to answer this way?

497
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:06,590
No wonder he talked about nine. Don't you know the weather has turned cooler recently? Do I have to wear a coat every day to come out?

498
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,990
Can I give it to you at any time

499
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,500
You just deserve it

500
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,570
I deserve to buy you a new dress.

501
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,500
Go

502
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,150
I'll take you to buy a coat
