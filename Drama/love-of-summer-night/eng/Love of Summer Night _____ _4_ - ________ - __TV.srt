2
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,560
Give it to me

3
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,080
Give it to me, help me. Some people play rascal and rascal as coaches are not only owed.

4
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,180
This is shameless. Give it to me

7
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,810
Why would he help me

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,490
Why should I help her

9
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,760
He doesn't like me by holding me like this, does he

12
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,160
Su Nuan Xia

13
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,880
Or

14
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,660
Let 's tear that door down

15
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,420
Don't look so sad, will you? It's just a little broken lock, won't it?

16
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,520
When the time comes, find a hammer and give you a minute to blow it. Can't you do it?

17
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,780
Otherwise, this is the case

18
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,020
You train well. Coach Ben gave you a new lock.

19
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,510
Rumors that some rich kids are not very good at football have become a god.

20
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,190
This little beauty, are you his girlfriend? Who are you? What about what? Who is his girlfriend?

21
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,160
Night God is my player

22
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,320
It turned out to be the nearest female college coach, Coach Su, who has heard a lot

24
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,880
Talking to you? I'm the captain of the reserve team of Ding Lei Myth University Basketball Association.

25
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,540
Nicknamed the Beast of Charge

26
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,690
In a few days, I will lead a team to play with you. Do you dare to have an open performance match, the second team of Myth University?

27
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,040
All right, I'll take the game

29
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,860
King's Night

30
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,520
It's a shame for your girlfriend to follow you. I dare not accept the challenge of coming to the door in the morning. Is that so unintelligent?

31
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,670
You let go of Coach Su's bravery. I think you might as well be good with me.

33
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,930
You talk too much

34
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,400
Fuck off

35
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,700
Good

36
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,580
Is it okay to have a temper match? You can wash your neck and die.

37
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:08,461
I will write the venue for the competition in your school forum.

38
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,000
See you in three days

39
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,140
You must have a good training now, right? A group of substitutes are just

40
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,720
I can handle it all by myself

41
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,980
You still don't want to practice together. Don't worry about it.

42
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,400
I will do what I promised you

43
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,120
Everyone will train together.

44
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,910
But

45
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,960
After this competition

46
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,600
Leave me alone

50
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,120
You said this time, this time

51
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,920
Men have the first time and the second time.

53
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,290
The myth of Qingmeng duel can be seen.

54
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:58,010
Pay attention to the basketball confrontation is a big war, Anna. You can scan the code here and pay attention to it.

55
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,580
Hello students can have a look at

56
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Sweep the Code and Pay Attention to the Public Number

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,700
Although the opponent is the reserve team,

58
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:12,670
But I have been waiting for Qingmeng to regain her strength for a long time. All the girls in our class will go to cheer up.

60
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,840
Something big has happened

61
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,410
The basketball club actually made an appointment with Myth Team 2,

62
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,630
Turn around, turn around, don't turn, it's not a green dreamer.

66
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,640
Yes, Brother Feng, I didn't expect you, Tie Hanhan, to be a milk tea drinker.

67
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,700
Yes, I am iron and honest

68
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,040
That

69
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:48,150
Can you get me in the team? That's not possible. Our company is very strict, or I'll get you a card for 10 and 2 free.

70
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,800
Shi what Ka, tell me about it.

71
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,990
Brother Feng, Brother Feng, come here, come on, come on

72
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,860
Please help me stop Xiao Rabbit from seeing me. I'll give you this cup of milk tea.

74
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,300
Wonder where the hell is it

77
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,730
Thanks, Brother Feng

78
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,890
Milk tea for you

79
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,000
This milk tea is really your own drink.

80
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,010
I don't believe it anyway

81
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,690
How about it? Is it still enjoyable?

82
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,750
Now I recognize my core position, Chu Ran

83
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,030
You are so much better than the last match last year. We can win last year. Are you out of the water?

84
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,270
Do you want to drain the water

85
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,280
I don't know either

86
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,520
Captain Chu and Coach Han asked you to come over

87
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,350
I heard Ding Lei say

88
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,440
This game was your idea. Is there a problem with what, Coach Han

89
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,750
This is unnecessary. I don't think so.

90
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,890
To be polite, the current myth team is a master who is lonely, lazy and lazy.

91
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,840
To put it bluntly, it is a fragmented battle.

92
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:21,740
If you want to achieve a bigger goal, you must have a training opponent. The current Qingmeng team can be a sparring partner.

93
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,640
Let the loose strings tighten and bring the hearts together again.

94
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,680
Make sense

95
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,040
You really have the temperament of a leader. I'm not playing house on the myth team.

96
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,390
What I am pursuing is the peak of basketball.

97
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,030
You pursue the peak of basketball and I will not hinder you.

98
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,780
But don't forget our agreement

100
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,880
Warm summer, I hope you can cherish the opportunity I have won for you.

101
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,280
Didn't Brother Lei go to training

102
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,420
How tired is it like a fur-losing dog?

103
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,180
How is the basketball team? Coach Han got a transfer student to be the captain.

104
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,080
The amount of training has increased several times.

105
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,020
It's like a mental derangement. Then you can still quit the team like this. I must have a big dream.

106
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,670
Become a player of choice

107
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,600
Captain Ding, hello, I am willing to give you some benefits. I hope you can put a little water in the match with Qingmeng Basketball Club.

108
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,560
Of course, I don't want you to put the water too obviously. Look at it.

109
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,200
The situation in what, ah, this is

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,220
Jun night ah, Jun night day see you so drag

111
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,080
I didn't expect to be able to do this again.

112
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,070
Let's play with him

114
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,120
Deal

118
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,700
Why is it that the warm summer event is not good? Mao Mao is impatient.

119
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,980
You see

120
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,180
Green Dream Team

121
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,810
We accepted the benefits. I didn't expect the Green Dream Team to be so disgusting. Oh, my God, how could our Jun Jun not beat them?

122
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:25,130
It was their coach Su Nuanxia who did it. This woman is really a good hype player.

123
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,190
This is our monarch night must not know

124
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,440
Now not only the post bar, but also the circle of friends are spreading it.

125
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,590
Warm summer, you spent the night studying mythology. The reserve team won't

126
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,870
I know, it's not you. Well, you bunny, you doubt me, don't you

127
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,480
I don't have plastic sister flowers. I dare not

131
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,020
You were the one who bribed the myth reserve

132
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,260
The whole green dream except you

133
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:14,070
I can't think of anyone else. Do you know this is an insult to the basketball players? I would rather lose the match.

134
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,360
Also don't want to take bribes to win,

135
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,300
I told you it wasn't me

137
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,010
I didn't expect a basketball match to be so exaggerated.

138
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,340
Su Nuan Xia We Believe

139
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,610
You usually only give us 18 dollars of packed lunch and 80 cents of water.

140
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,800
How is it possible to buy each other off

141
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Yeah

142
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,620
Ling Xuan, you are really good at settling accounts.

143
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,830
She is the only one who has this motive. With what, I have this motive. Your family is so rich.

144
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,300
And the loser is you

145
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,470
If it were me

146
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,860
I will not give only this benefit.

147
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,480
As a college student, I have to pay back the flowers every month. Why should I bribe

148
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,440
Anyway, I will definitely find out this person, and then you must apologize to me in person.

150
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,180
Make sense

152
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:05,270
What should I do? Why are you so angry? No, I can't let him know

155
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,310
How did you post it online

156
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,740
I can send it if I want

157
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,710
Delete it for me as soon as possible.

160
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,740
I won't delete it

161
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,400
Be careful I sue you

162
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,920
You gave it to me voluntarily. I don't have any legal problems.

163
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,070
And

164
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,960
If your team is not strong, don't come out and humiliate yourself.

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,300
Do you like it here

174
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,510
Like

175
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,060
That

176
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,350
Shall we come here often in the future

177
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,370
With the people you like, no matter where you go.

178
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,140
I like it all very much.

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,640
Really

186
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,900
You laugh so obscene

187
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,060
It is impolite of you to shout like that.

188
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:31,860
I'm sorry, mainly because your smile is too obscene and doesn't look like you at all. That's why I'm excited. Let's not talk about those that don't exist.

189
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,370
Let me ask you something

190
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,950
Have you ever met

191
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,000
That kind

192
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,540
Unspeakable love

193
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,930
Normal

194
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,010
I used to like my cousin's girlfriend, but I couldn't say it.

195
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,950
That's not what I'm talking about

196
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,240
I'm talking about

197
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,320
You started from the past

198
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,750
I feel very disgusted with her.

199
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,620
But then what happened

200
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,440
I like it very much.

201
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,960
You mean Su Nuan Xia, right

202
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,930
Fuck off

207
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,360
Suddenly, a lot of whitewashing people appeared.

210
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,990
You stink at night and face crazy, isn't it

211
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:45,100
Ling Xuan's miser is not Shen Yingliang, unlike

212
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,320
Zhang Xiaoqiang and Qi Feng

213
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,660
Not to mention

215
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,510
Who the hell is it

218
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,720
Help

219
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,040
I don't believe I can't find you

223
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,840
The Internet address of my chat account has been found. Anna did it.

224
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
I see

225
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,480
Why did you stop the car? Miss Su is in front of you.

226
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,770
It's her

227
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,560
Even more so, you can't stop the car.

228
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,540
What a coincidence

229
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,030
What can I do

230
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:48,340
Didn't someone think I was the one who bribed the team before? I just came over and told him to prepare an apology.

231
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,590
So

232
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:59,760
You have found the real bribe, so no one has to worry about it. I just came by to inform him in advance that it would be too temporary to prepare a heartfelt apology.

233
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,680
Childish Zhang Xiaoqiang Drives

234
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,850
Here

235
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,100
You

238
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,280
In fact, Miss Su is very cute. You laugh more in front of him than before.

239
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,950
You've been gossiping more and more lately

240
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,060
Okay, I won't say it. Let's go home. Let's go home.

245
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,800
Warm summer

246
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,620
Are you all right? It's all right

247
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,880
I'm just a little excited

248
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,160
King's Night

249
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,410
Just wait for you to kneel down and kowtow to me and admit your mistake.

250
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:53,200
What

251
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,920
This classmate is not in English class now.

252
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,300
Excuse me, teacher

253
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,160
Today's students, ah, have a vast collision. All right, let's continue to study by ourselves.

258
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,580
We're sitting here today

259
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,700
Is it a little far from your night

260
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,920
Why are these people so boring and still leaving messages here?

262
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,610
Anna, the night god is here

264
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,620
It is better to surf the Internet less.

265
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,690
Did you know that at night

266
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,380
After all

267
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,880
The exam is coming soon. Okay, I, I know

268
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,350
Did Anna Jun care about you just now?

269
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,070
Yeah, the night god saw us just now

270
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,080
It's over

271
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,590
Does Junye know about what

272
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:11,200
Anna, wait for us

274
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,620
What's wrong with Anna today

275
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,980
I don't know

276
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,620
I said you have a really hard end. You are almost cutting the table in half.

277
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,460
I was too excited to see the news of Jason.

278
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,870
That Jason knows who replied to the post.

279
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,620
Not quite clear

282
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,260
Anna

283
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,020
Su Nuan

284
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,480
How about what

285
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,410
Situation in what

286
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,920
I don't know

287
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,020
This is illegal detention. I also told you that you were framing it.

288
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:22,550
I've got your Internet address. You're the one who bribed the team and the one who responded, right? I asked why you framed me. Do you know how humbled I have been these two days?

290
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:29,610
I didn't frame you. I just didn't want you to lose at night.

291
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,380
He had a hard time playing again.

292
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:40,090
And when I talked to them, I didn't say I was you. I didn't know they were so shameless.

293
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:48,710
I even put the chat record in the post bar, so I am also the victim.

294
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:54,020
You're crying, what. I'm supposed to be the one who's crying. Okay

295
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,120
If your night

296
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,480
Knowing that I did this

297
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,720
He will definitely hate me in the future.

298
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,110
The somebody else also didn't like you, then I can't say he will like me in the future, ok, ok, ok

299
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,460
Could you please

300
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:20,050
Don't tell Junye about it. If he knew, I wouldn't live.

302
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,860
Don't cry

303
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,310
This can't stand the problem of beautiful women crying. What can change it sometime.

305
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,250
Wipe it

306
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,530
My eyelashes

309
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,160
You just forget it. It's me

310
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,920
Must have made public her bribery of the team.

311
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:57,818
The school has punished her. Let's give her a chance to mend her ways.

312
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,760
You must have been a fairy in your last life

313
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,040
By the way

314
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,340
Didn't you still say you wanted Jun Night to apologize to you?

315
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,760
Yeah

316
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,900
My apology

317
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,280
Pig brains are really

319
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,750
The competition is coming soon.

320
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,600
Before, a little disturbance delayed a lot of training time.

321
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,620
But it doesn't matter

322
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,540
I'm here

323
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,730
I watched the video of the Myth II team and came up with a tactic against them.

324
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,080
Next, let's rehearse it.

325
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,080
It is better to break in our team.

326
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,500
If you don't fight, it's over.

327
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,150
He also engaged in what tactics.

334
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,660
I am not desperate or angry.

335
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,570
Not angry, not angry, not angry

336
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,040
Not very strong today

337
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,280
Why did he come all of a sudden

338
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,080
Didn't he bring his own water

339
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,360
You don't want to ask me if I have found anyone who bribed me, do you

341
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,900
Didn't you come to carry water

345
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,580
Thank you, coach

346
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,620
Thank you

347
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,860
Here comes the meal

349
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,530
Today, I eat what. Today is the Kung Pao Chicken Set Meal.

350
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:30,990
This one is full of warm summer. Thank you for giving me one.

351
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:37,840
Don't you usually eat this eight-dollar packed lunch at night,

352
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,950
I suddenly want to eat today.

353
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,730
I suddenly have no appetite. Give them food.

354
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,190
I can't believe the coach didn't protect his food today, right

356
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,450
Boss, take one

357
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,140
Then give me two eggs

358
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,570
And this tenderloin sausage will also add more spicy to me.

359
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,750
Haole

360
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,430
How much is it

361
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,280
Ten dollars

362
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,780
What's the matter with this monarch night

363
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,380
Hanging around in front of me all day long.

364
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,440
I couldn't even eat

365
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,480
Boss, hurry up, starve to death, now, now

366
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,830
Thank you

368
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,260
How can you come here to eat this kind of food

369
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,380
Can't you let me have a good taste

370
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,220
Hello

371
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,410
Why isn't someone trying to make me apologize

372
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,250
I'm waiting

373
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,460
No

374
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,020
Why not

375
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,820
I haven't found anyone, have I

376
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,920
If you have to apologize, I can also reluctantly accept it.

377
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,040
Su Nuan Xia

378
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,480
Are you stupid? You're stupid

379
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,160
I'm sorry

381
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,780
What are you talking about

385
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,280
I'm so excited to go to the scene today to see the night god.

386
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,930
I heard that the youth dream team

387
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:19,024
This time I spent money on our water release.

388
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,360
I think the standard must be very poor. Let's watch the show today. Go, go, go, go

390
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,940
We have seen a lot of videos of our opponents in the past two days.

391
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,640
I specially edited the fragments of Ding Lei to show you so clearly.

392
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,680
Ding Lei

393
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,100
Although he is a reserve member of the myth team,

394
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,960
I have met him several times.

395
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:47,940
Although this boy plays arrogant, he is also a mythical gold. The sixth man has a lot of chances to come on as a substitute.

396
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,160
Nicknamed the Beast of Charge

397
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,310
It means that when he plays, he is very wild. Most of the players who fight him will be injured.

398
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,490
Then I'll give it a try. Is he fierce or am I fierce?

399
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:07,490
Ling Xuan, you are just too reckless. You play forward in the same position as Ding Lei, but his reaction is faster and more stable than yours, so you don't need to confront him.

400
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:13,530
People like you who have no brains and only know how to rush blindly should do your pick and roll honestly and watch me play.

401
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:20,950
Who do you say has no brain Ling Xuan's team is harmonious, or do you believe it or not when I order 100 cups of milk tea after the competition?

402
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,130
Brother

403
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,370
All you have to do is score three points

404
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,540
I will only give you a transfer.

405
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,650
Zhang Xiaoqiang

406
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,150
The team pays attention to team spirit.

407
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,360
Don't bring your buddy's loyalty to the team.

408
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,220
Got it

409
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:37,040
Tie Han Han, I saw Anna coming just now

410
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,360
Let her rest assured, no, no

411
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,680
Don't worry, everyone

412
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:52,350
Rebounding, the warm summer I have grasped to death, you can rest assured that we will definitely beat the mythical garbage reserve team today.

417
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,490
Goddess, which school do you belong to? Why have we never met before?

418
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,400
You deserve to talk to our sister Anna. Get out of the way.

423
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:24,420
Are the banners ready? They are already ready, little sister. We don't need you to come. We do it. We do it

424
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,500
Hang up, classmate. Excuse me

428
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,460
Brothers

429
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,070
This game is the time for our reserve team to prove their strength.

430
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,390
The Green Dream Team also doesn't know what to think.

431
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,520
This team has only been formed for a week and dares to come here to play away games.

432
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,390
So

433
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:50,520
I decided to keep their goals in single digits. How many points do we have to score?

434
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,810
At least three times as many as theirs

435
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,490
Coach, good coach, good coach, good everyone's hard work, coach, why did you come in person?

436
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:06,750
With our strength to deal with this kind of team that has not even passed the break-in period, in fact, you don't have to worry at all if you lose this match.

437
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,730
Then you can go straight to the palace.

440
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,080
Is it true what coach Chu Ran said just now

441
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,480
You've known Captain Churan for a while

442
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,540
Have you ever seen him tell lies

444
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:28,030
Shen Xuechang is experienced, but he is too busy at ordinary times, which makes him not decisive enough to play the ball now, so he must take advantage of the time when no one is defending.

445
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,880
Pull down the open position and throw three points.

446
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:36,190
Zhang Xiaoqiang, you are so unreliable at ordinary times. This match is very important, so please attack against it. All right, coach

447
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:36,870
Don't worry

448
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,100
I have no characteristics, but I am reliable at critical moments.

449
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,010
Tell me what to do

450
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,560
Your goal is very simple is to use Qi Feng's height to pull out the gap.

451
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,130
Then he passed the ball to Shen Xuechang, a foreign media player. This is today's main tactic.

452
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:57,440
The feel of the three-point shot needs high-intensity training to be maintained all the time.

453
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,250
I am really holding everyone back now.

454
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,030
It doesn't matter. We still have the night god.

455
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,440
Night God

456
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,040
With your usual training performance, you can pass the ball and block the difference.

457
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,400
I don't expect you to get what points.

458
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,370
I hope everyone will not be influenced by this kind of amateur guidance.

459
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,200
Come on in a minute and listen to me

460
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,460
This is not the time to play with personality.

461
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,320
The majesty of the coach's decision

462
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,100
Cooperate

463
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,520
Cooperate with you

464
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,240
You beg me, I

465
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,390
Here we go, let's go, let's go, let's go

467
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,620
Why

468
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,930
I have no idea where to put you now.

469
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,150
I don't know where to put the player.

470
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,700
It was your failure as a coach.

471
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,760
It has nothing to do with me

476
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,260
Night God is so handsome. What should I do

477
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,390
Half an hour late, I wouldn't have washed my hair if I had known it.

478
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,360
He won't be angry, will he

482
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,450
Have you waited a long time? I just arrived. Not long ago

484
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,040
Thanks. It's still hot

487
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:44,030
Matcha with a little sugar and cream. How do you know this is my favorite flavor

488
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,300
I was guessing

492
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,010
What happened to you today

493
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:07,710
I drew the eyeliner and then wiped it off and drew it again. Have you waited for a long time again?

494
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,280
 

495
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,780
Delicious

496
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,920
It's still hot

497
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:19,120
It's so cute. I like matcha tea milk tea best.

504
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,850
You wait a long time every time

505
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,550
Don't mention it

506
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,280
I am strong and strong.

507
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:44,530
It's good to blow the wind. If you don't drink it, it will get cold.

509
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,440
I like the taste is also specially inquired about by you

510
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,210
I feel so sorry

511
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,760
How about you make it up to me

514
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,040
As long as you remember my preferences,

515
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:13,070
I prefer American tea without sugar rather than milk tea.

516
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,110
And

517
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:20,080
My favorite girl is Su Nuanxia

518
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,360
So no matter how late she is,

519
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,160
I would like to wait for her
