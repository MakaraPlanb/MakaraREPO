1
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,470
Why haven't they come back yet

2
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:19,270
Girls always take more time to go to the bathroom. You don't have to worry about them. They need to spend what time.

3
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,520
Those who don't make up and don't make up may be faster than us boys.

4
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,230
Eat your meal

5
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,110
Do you think I am Qi Feng

6
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,540
 

7
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,350
 

8
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,820
 

9
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,580
 

10
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,600
 

11
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,360
 

12
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,950
 

13
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,860
 

14
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,580
Chu Ran, can you please take a picture for us? We'll take it when everyone is together.

15
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,400
 

16
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,590
 

17
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,260
Didn't you say

18
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,240
You and Chu Ran are pure brother and sister

19
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,420
How do I think he is jealous with the night god

20
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,760
How should I know

21
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,680
I'm speechless, too. Okay

22
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,790
Well, you are really popular.

23
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,890
The two male gods are jealous of each other.

24
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,780
There is also an Anna eyeing up the other side.

25
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,340
It's none of your business

26
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,420
No, I can't even take my little errand brother down.

27
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,940
It's really heart-rending. Are you all right? You and I told you not to drink so much. You still drink

28
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,050
The play I chased yesterday guessed the wrong combination again. I thought it was the male owner.

29
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:45,950
I am very sad that I am a good man. Why doesn't everything come according to my guess? Why is it bad?

30
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,760
Why do you say what I like it

31
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,360
 

32
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,940
 

33
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:05,780
You eat more at night. I think your training usually consumes your physical strength and makes up for it.

34
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,760
This is the warm summer spot

35
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,970
Then she's not here now. Just take my seat later.

36
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,570
She won't be so stingy, will she

37
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,140
 

38
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,150
Miss Anna is a good match for you

39
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,760
You really think so, of course

40
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,440
However, if you are so handsome at night, there should be no teenage fans.

41
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,420
You must be very experienced in love. You are a star player in Binhai Province.

42
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,040
There are more fans than I do.

43
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,840
Isn't that more experienced in love than I am

44
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,160
Shen Xuechang

45
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,550
What's wrong with Jun Ye and Chu Ran? How do I feel strange?

46
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,270
I have no idea

47
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,830
Young People's Ideas

48
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,190
I can't keep up

49
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,670
Are you fighting for the coach

50
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,830
Does Chu Ran want to pry the warm summer to replace Han Mo of the myth team in the past?

51
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,020
 

52
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,240
 

53
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,140
Why is there no answer to the phone?

54
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,300
Bunny, I also called

55
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,790
No answer

56
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,760
 

57
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,330
Where did you go in the warm summer

58
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,750
Are you all right

59
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,780
Are you drunk

60
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,860
It's not all her fault

61
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,340
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. She drank too much. She drank too much. Do you know that my skirt is very expensive?

62
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,070
Do you think this will work

63
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:41,190
Well, I'll transfer the dry cleaning fee to you

64
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,010
Xiao Tu Rabbit

65
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,850
Is it money? I have money

66
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:55,600
I'll give you all the money. I'm sorry. You're insane. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look at her drinking like this.

67
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,710
I won't wear any more clothes that I vomited. You must make it up to me in full. Five thousand pieces, not a cent less.

68
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:07,670
Xiao Rabbit, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

69
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,980
 

70
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,100
 

71
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,660
 

72
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,220
All right, you girl

73
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,770
I have to remember something for you

74
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,690
Avoid defaulting when you wake up

75
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,590
Come on, you owe me the 5,000 IOUs first. Give me her hand and stand up.

76
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,880
 

77
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,080
 

78
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,140
 

79
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,820
 

80
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,400
 

81
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,220
Good

82
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,920
Ling Xuan, please send the rabbit back to school.

83
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,220
Pay attention to safety in small matters

84
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,950
 

85
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,800
Come on, slow down, slow down

86
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,540
 

87
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,640
 

88
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,160
 

89
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,420
There is only one seat available in Junye's car. Let me take a taxi to take you home.

90
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,160
What for

91
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,530
Let's take a taxi

92
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,920
What are you doing

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,420
Brother, your car

95
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,490
 

96
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,800
 

97
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,220
 

98
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,760
You let go of me and I can go by myself.

99
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,300
 

100
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
 

101
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,420
You're bleeding

102
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,520
I'm bleeding, Ling-hyun

103
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,540
You quickly take me to the best hospital to have a nosebleed and go to the best hospital in what.

104
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,780
Do you think I have no money

105
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,560
I have money

106
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,540
Give it to you. Give it to you

107
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,150
I don't want your money. I have long wanted to give you money.

108
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,720
But I know you'll be angry

109
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,910
You, you said, what, did you know

110
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,470
In order to give you an extra floor fee,

111
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:14,570
How many takeout and milk tea have I ordered? I have gained 10 kg. I have become a little fat man. No one likes me anymore.

112
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,590
Did you order my delivery on purpose? The wife of shop-owner said that you had a commission on the delivery order.

113
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,860
I'm trying to make money for you

114
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,100
And you know what

115
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,080
The noodle shop where you work

116
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,730
It's awful, it's awful, it's awful

117
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,160
Is it that bad

118
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,420
 

119
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,880
Ling Xuan, I'm sponsoring you. I mean it

120
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,140
I don't want you to work so hard again. I don't work hard. I don't work hard.

121
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,170
Stop thinking about how to help me

122
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
 

123
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,960
 

124
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,450
 

125
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,220
Xiao Tu Rabbit

126
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,240
Why did you fall asleep

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,960
King's Night

128
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,150
You take her home

129
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,160
Brother Churan is too arrogant these days, isn't he

130
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,360
Coach, these days

131
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,080
Probably exhausted, too

132
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,760
That's how she is

133
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,710
You can sleep anywhere in what.

134
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,100
 

135
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,060
 

136
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,540
 

137
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,990
 

138
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,440
 

139
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,280
Warm summer

140
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,940
What do you want me to say to understand

141
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,690
 

142
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,140
 

143
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,020
 

144
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,170
You said you

145
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,110
Why do you do so much for me

146
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,920
 

147
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,680
Or tell me

148
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,350
I usually have such a bad attitude towards you.

149
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,430
Ling Xuan

150
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,040
I like you

151
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,440
 

152
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,060
 

153
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,500
 

154
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,680
 

155
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,340
 

156
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,660
Hello, please ask Coach Han for leave for me.

157
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,840
It's so handsome. You see, it's so handsome. Is it from our school? It's from our school.

158
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,150
He is the new captain of our basketball team. Don't you even know that his name is Chu Ran

159
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,600
Hello, aunt

160
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Chu Ran

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,220
I heard that you have been training very hard recently.

162
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,080
Warm summer is not here. Please come and see me for dinner when you have time.

163
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,640
Auntie cooks you delicious food.

164
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,220
I also saw it with warm summer yesterday.

165
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,580
What, you don't know

166
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,960
 

167
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:23,170
I really hate English class the most. I have graduated from high school. Why can't I get rid of the ocean of knowledge?

168
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,460
English is difficult in other classes that are difficult in what, okay?

169
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,880
I am not like you. I am most afraid of taking English tests.

170
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,850
If I pass the English exam, what will use it. In case I fail in other classes, I will not have to pay it back.

171
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,680
 

172
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,950
Su Nuan Xia

173
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,880
Mom and Aunt

174
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,120
 

175
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,120
If it weren't for Chu Ran

176
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,310
I didn't even know you changed your report to Qingmeng without authorization.

177
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,240
Chu Ran told you

178
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,140
This is too much. I'll call him. Don't change the subject.

179
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,090
I didn't change the subject

180
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,290
Mom, I was wrong

181
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,220
Aren't I afraid to tell you that I'm afraid of your objection

182
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,420
Of course I object

183
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,210
Didn't you already see the result of your father's training for the basketball team?

184
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,420
Then I didn't want to fulfill my father's last wish, did I

185
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,790
My team is very good, really

186
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,990
I believe they will win the myth.

187
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,650
Just trust your lovely and beautiful daughter. Support it.

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,550
Let's see

189
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,510
I can also take a step back.

190
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,360
As long as you fulfill my request

191
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,830
I will allow you to stay

192
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:42,520
Thank you. Don't thank you so early. This request is not that simple.

193
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,230
I want you to be excellent in every subject at the end of this term.

194
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,760
Otherwise, you will leave Qingmeng quickly.

195
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,390
Let's change it

196
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,240
 

197
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,930
There's no way, then I can only give up my favorite thing in order to get the first place in Qingmeng.

198
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,440
I can only give up my favorite sleep in and get up early to study hard.

199
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,320
 

200
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,560
 

201
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,780
Before, the dormitory environment was too comfortable.

202
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,950
The efficiency of reading in the library must be high.

203
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,170
I don't believe I can't knock you

204
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,740
 

205
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,090
  

206
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,540
Isn't that the coach

207
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,700
 

208
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,760
 

209
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,400
 

210
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,930
Encounter a coach who fell asleep while studying in the library.

211
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:40,120
 

212
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,920
 

213
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,400
 

214
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,280
It's true that I know my daughter, but I don't know my mother. Warm summer's mother really saw her.

215
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,200
  

216
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,220
 

217
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,200
 

218
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,770
Warm summer went to the library to prove that I still want to work hard.

219
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,520
Maybe she can really fulfill her mother's request.

220
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,800
 

221
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,700
 

222
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,390
If she doesn't pass the exam

223
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,790
Is it true that we can only return to Beijing,

224
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,560
 

225
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,120
 

226
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,980
Of course

227
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,520
 

228
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,380
 

229
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,070
 

230
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,120
In case she does not pass

231
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,220
No

232
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,810
With her intelligence quotient

233
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,890
Certainly not

234
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,600
Shall we help her

235
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,250
I think this is a deep pit.

236
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,710
You'd better not jump in

237
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,030
The coach is stupid and has strong self-esteem.

238
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,050
Even if you help, she may not be able to accept your statement that what

239
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,010
No, no, no

240
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,860
I mean, I have a way

241
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,180
 

242
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,740
Welcome Su Nuanxia to come back from the glorious sleep in the library.

243
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,710
Stop it

244
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,160
I studied here all day and what didn't learn it.

245
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,890
He was also photographed in the ugly hair group.

246
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
I can take the beautiful photos.

247
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,400
I said you really are

248
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,350
How long have you been there? Sleep like a pig

249
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,810
You are still not a friend. You deleted you for me.

250
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,940
But I have a way to save you from the hot water.

251
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:51,140
Are you sure you want to do this to me? Do you have memory bread or can you pass through the future and read the test paper?

252
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,480
 

253
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,540
You see

254
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,350
 

255
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,990
How do I think Zhang Xiaoqiang's tone is not like this?

256
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,800
It's a little stiff. Your focus is strange. Take a closer look at it.

257
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:16,950
Night God is really a student bully.

258
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,240
Xueba

259
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,400
 

260
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,870
This is a chance for you to make up for it.

261
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,330
I was also reluctant to find you to make up a missed lesson. I seem to

262
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,780
Not begging you to give me this chance

263
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:53,430
Don't you want this beautiful, kind and lovely coach to stay and help you

264
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,000
You think these two idioms have something to do with you

265
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,550
 

266
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,220
Why do you still try to be brave when you have steps down in Su Nuan and Xia Su Nuan

267
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,750
But now you have something to ask for

268
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,890
Your major is athletic anatomy

269
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,230
Exercise physiology

270
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,060
And sports psychology

271
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,110
Then let me see how well you have mastered it first.

272
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,640
Let's just be so-so

273
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,710
 

274
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,790
Qi and blood barrier is what's meaning.

275
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,200
 

276
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,930
Don't remember

277
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,100
Proprioceptor; proprioceptor

278
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,160
What mean again

279
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,750
You said next, next, I will be fine. I already know how well you have mastered it.

280
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,720
What degree degree of slag

281
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,840
 

282
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,020
 

283
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,590
 

284
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,520
 

285
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,960
 

286
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,220
 

287
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,750
Mr. Shen, you must know a lot about the Myth Team

288
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,070
Is it okay

289
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,230
After all, there have been several meetings. Can you tell us about it?

290
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,980
I heard Ling Xuan say that you had already fought Lu Ye at the resort.

291
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,540
Well, you must have a full understanding of his strength, right?

292
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,590
Besides him, Jiang Yichen, nicknamed the Violent Killer, is the strongest center I have ever played against.

293
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,560
And

294
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,290
Gu Yuan, a shooting guard who is good at eagle shooting.

295
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,790
And point guard Xia Ze's forward Mirage pass

296
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:26,260
They are all top-notch players. It seems that there is also a forward named Downfold, who uses three fingers to join up.

297
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,570
Fly up at a high speed

298
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,020
Xia Ze is very strong

299
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,540
But I beat him up

300
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,380
Who do you think is the most mythical person?

301
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,960
Today

302
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,680
It used to be Luye

303
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,800
 

304
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,180
Now it's Chu Ran

305
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:47,510
I haven't had a fight with Chu Ran yet. Tell me how terrible it is. This has to start three years ago.

306
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:53,970
At that time, I stopped at the basketball club. Let's talk about it tomorrow. I'm in a hurry to make up a missed lesson. You all helped me.

307
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,800
 

308
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,870
 

309
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,590
 

310
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,040
Xue Ba Jun

311
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,720
Do you dare to bend the rules

312
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,040
These are all things I would like to eat but dare not eat at ordinary times.

313
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,480
You said you came to make up a missed lesson for me and bought so much delicious food.

314
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,360
How embarrassed I am

315
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,000
These are your meals for the day

316
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,470
Every page you memorize, Mazel

317
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,840
You can eat the same thing

318
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,780
You are too eager to pass the exam.

319
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,760
 

320
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,890
All right, all right, do as you say.

321
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,930
 

322
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,200
 

323
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,340
 

324
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,360
 

325
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,900
 

326
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,990
I have already memorized half a page.

327
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,350
Can I eat half a chicken wing

328
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,240
 

329
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,270
Not so hard

330
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,430
Dun

331
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,000
People are iron, rice is steel, and people will not be hungry for a while.

332
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,790
I think you have the strength to do something about it.

333
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,680
Then

334
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:15,320
Memorize two pages before eating one. Don't go too far. If you want to go back to Beijing,

335
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,960
Don't waste my time here

336
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:25,760
I mean, if you don't eat these wings

337
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,210
It gets cold

338
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,000
Continue to recite

339
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,840
 

340
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,640
 

341
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,960
 

342
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,700
I can fall asleep all the time

343
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,620
 

344
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,650
 

345
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,890
 

346
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,170
 

347
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,840
 

348
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,940
Why are you so close to me

349
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,520
Su Nuan Xia

350
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,060
If you pass the exam this time

351
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,080
Let's go on a date

352
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,240
 

353
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,080
 

354
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,750
Please, I am a computer student who can't help you with English.

355
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,740
Nonsense

356
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:29,060
Your JAVA C + + what is not all written in English. Besides, people's night gods are not studying sports either. He is very attentively helping warm summer tutoring.

357
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,980
I'm not a student bully lying to me.

358
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,130
I checked

359
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,120
Last year you won a huge scholarship. I couldn't help it.

360
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,900
After all, earning scholarships is more efficient than working.

361
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,770
Forced me to study hard and strive for high marks in the exam.

362
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,230
You're talking about what

363
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:53,850
Don't you feel wronged by getting a scholarship? Let's not talk about it. I don't have much time. I still have two jobs to do and three simulation questions to do.

364
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,440
Go on and review for yourself. I'll go first.

365
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,880
 

366
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,000
 

367
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,440
 

368
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,760
 

369
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,240
 

370
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,000
 

371
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,350
 

372
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,460
Xue Ba Jun

373
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,280
I think I have learned the key points of Mazel backwards and can go out and fight.

374
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,350
Talk about it

375
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:31,230
Read with me the three laws of simple materialism, water, fire, earth, metaphysics, solitary and quiet films. No to reveal things. I say materialism and you say materialism.

376
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,870
Are you stupid to drink Coke

377
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,470
You're stupid

378
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:42,140
This is the super test site I invented exclusively. Recite the pithy formula. All right, just rap and walk.

379
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,940
No matter how boring the content is, it becomes very simple in an instant.

380
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:52,980
Do you think the representative of simple materialism is the Five Elements Theory of Jin Mu, Water, Fire and Earth

381
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,230
 

382
00:23:53,810 --> 00:24:00,000
Does metaphysics represent stillness and one-sided

383
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,590
Is that all right

384
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,080
There is no problem in making up pithy formulas.

385
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,260
But your painting style is not right. Isn't it going to be the general exam tomorrow?

386
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:14,990
Isn't it to improve efficiency? Now Mazel has taken care of it. There is still a lot to review.

387
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,160
If you don't hurry, it will be dark. I'm here.

388
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,880
Can't be blacked out

389
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,160
 

390
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,780
 

391
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,470
Not necessarily

392
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:35,910
Is it true that there is a power outage in what these days. I am so tired of power outages that I should come soon.

393
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,700
I don't know. Let's go check with logistics. Okay

394
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,970
Rabbit, Rabbit, Rabbit, Rabbit

395
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,620
Where are you in warm summer? Our dormitory has a power outage.

396
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,390
No way, the dormitory has no electricity either.

397
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,280
It is said that the whole failure will not be recovered until after midnight.

398
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,650
 

399
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,850
It's over. It's over here

400
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,150
Prepare for today's surprise endorsement. This is great. There is no chance.

401
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,800
Do I have to go back to Beijing

402
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,240
Come on

403
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,340
You ask the night god to think of some way to use the power of love to generate electricity. Don't make any noise there.

404
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,550
I'm not in the mood to joke with you. Hang up

405
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,940
Looks like we'll have to study in the moonlight tonight

406
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,750
The moonlight is gone

407
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,920
Go to my bedroom

408
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,860
There are separate wires

409
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,890
 

410
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,300
Your Aunt Suguan is too scary.

411
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,620
Who can see it in the dark?

412
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,520
Come on, let's go

413
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,040
 

414
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,140
 

415
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,520
 

416
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,860
 

417
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,600
 

418
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,630
You are the only one with electricity in the whole school.

419
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,190
This kind of sVIP treatment

420
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,880
Let a person envy jealousy hate

421
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,310
Have electricity

422
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,480
It was just a coincidence

423
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,350
I did it for the sake of safety

425
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,560
This has something to do with security, what

426
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,080
Some time ago

427
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,100
Someone steals high-power electrical appliances.

428
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,050
I am worried about the potential safety hazard.

429
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,860
So I went to the engineering department.

430
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,270
Draw a new thread

431
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,270
I didn't expect to use it today.

432
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,670
 

433
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,760
 

434
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,570
You can review in this chair

435
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,370
This time it is very comfortable to sit up.

436
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,330
Good

437
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,880
 

438
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,700
 

439
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,850
Read for a long time

440
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,870
Want soft light

441
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,760
This desk lamp

442
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,260
Good for your eyes

443
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,200
 

444
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,810
You said you were so thoughtful to help me review.

445
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:57,940
Thank you. Then I was here studying hard before I called tonight.

446
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,780
Let me analyze the exercises for you

447
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,960
 

448
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,560
 

449
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,720
 

450
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
 

451
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,400
 

452
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,950
 

453
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,000
 

454
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,020
 

455
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:14,970
 

456
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,180
Could you please ask the logistics department

457
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,860
Try to call late

458
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,100
 

459
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,800
It's not scientific

460
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,880
 

461
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,810
 

462
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,800
 

463
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,920
 

464
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,920
 

465
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,040
 

466
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,780
 

467
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,850
All right, all right 
All right, all right 


468
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,620
Just one exercise book

469
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,200
You are more than half wrong.

470
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,690
Did you take a good look at the key points I ticked for you? I read them and I memorized them.

471
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,560
The answer above

472
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,590
I can't understand it at all.

473
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,170
I don't have any pictures in my mind.

474
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,930
Besides, those words are almost the same. I don't know which is which and which can't remember.

475
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,070
That's a lot

477
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,510
What's Fixed Points of Muscle Follow-up

478
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,000
I can't remember it anyway.

479
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,120
Good

480
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,050
Take a good look

481
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,050
Only once

482
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,710
Take it

483
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,300
Lift dumbbells and bend your forearms for example.

484
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,210
What about the time like this

485
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,590
This piece of skin

486
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,860
Is the fixed point

487
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,380
That is, the relative motion is relatively small

488
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,870
It is fixed

489
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,940
Oh, what

490
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,760
Feel what you let me touch

491
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,590
 

492
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,280
 

493
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,880
Here

494
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,990
So strong

495
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,000
 

496
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,940
 

497
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,590
What if this is the way it moves

498
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,880
This

499
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,970
It becomes a moving point.

500
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,630
 

501
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,480
Move

502
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,530
Magic

503
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,360
 

504
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,870
Let me have a look at the rest

505
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,800
Trapezius muscle

506
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,150
Biceps brachii and abdominal muscles

507
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,480
 

508
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,340
Then the pectoralis major muscle

509
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,180
 

510
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,480
 

511
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,720
 

512
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,320
Why don't you talk

513
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,720
 

514
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,140
Me

515
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,450
Suddenly a little hungry

516
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,520
Do you have anything for what

517
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,000
 

518
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,620
 

519
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,160
You keep watching. I'll cook now.

520
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,790
 

521
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,000
 

522
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,440
 

523
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,590
 

524
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,440
 

525
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,020
Eat noodles

526
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,300
 

527
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
 

528
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,610
Yes, you

529
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,660
 

530
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,530
It's even better than the one in the advertisement.

531
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,700
Selling photos is only the foundation.

532
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,350
The most important thing is to eat well.

533
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,720
Come and try it

534
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,760
 

535
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,670
 

536
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,000
Am I getting up too early

537
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,840
Why don't I do it again

538
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,210
I lied to you

539
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,970
Very delicious

540
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,130
Really

541
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,360
If you don't believe me, try it.

542
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,860
How is it

543
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,880
Is it okay

544
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,120
Row

545
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,880
If you are so reluctant, I will take care of the rest. I'm not polite to you.

546
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,560
 

547
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,600
This is definitely the best noodle I have ever eaten.

548
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,840
I didn't think I could have such a high-level treatment on this blackout night before the examination.

549
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,240
So exaggerated

550
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,700
Actually

551
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,160
I am rewarded to girls who study hard.

552
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,470
 

553
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,640
 

554
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,000
 

555
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,410
 

556
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,120
 

557
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,810
 

558
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,160
 

559
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,360
