1
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,860
 

2
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,300
In accordance with this momentum

3
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,390
There seems to be some suspense

5
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,140
Coach Han

6
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,220
Why don't you call a pause and set it up

7
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,340
Of course, young people's competitions are conducted by young people themselves.

8
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,350
What do you say, Churan

9
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,340
Shen Xuechang

10
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,980
Hold on. Time is running out

11
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,370
Are you all right

13
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,380
To ensure the sight of God's three points

14
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,760
It takes a great deal of physical strength at the expense of

15
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,130
Even Shen Xuechang, who is at his peak,

16
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,350
It can only last for ten minutes.

17
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,760
He has held on for 15 minutes today.

18
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,440
So you didn't shoot in the first half

19
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,150
Is it in the energy storage tank

20
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,510
Sorry, my energy tank is gone.

22
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,750
Me

23
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,350
No, no, no 
No, no, no 


24
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,020
But now there is one less person

25
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,480
There's no substitute

26
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,080
How do I play

30
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,450
I'll do it

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,760
Is there any other way

35
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,010
Su Nuanxia is really a heroine when she goes on stage. There are also such things.

36
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,600
This is a long time to see you. No, the female coach has to go on her own.

37
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,370
The competition has reached this point.

38
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,280
Not so much

39
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,320
We won't be merciful just because we are a woman.

40
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,520
This little girl really looks like Coach Zuri.

41
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,360
Qingmeng University really has an excellent basketball team.

47
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,110
Come on, come on, come on

48
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,850
Come on, my warm summer

49
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:49,600
It's weird. Don't you hate warm summer? You know what is one yard at a time.

51
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,300
Come on, come on, come on

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:16,290
No, I, I, my affectation is dead.

54
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,820
I will never look down on you

58
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,780
Fast throw

59
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,330
Hmm

60
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,980
Hmm

62
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,960
A good ball warms the summer.

63
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:46,980
Beautiful

70
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,060
Little Night God, I didn't think you were quite good

71
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,550
The second half was very exciting.

72
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,330
We underestimated the enemy

73
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,540
Captain

74
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,320
Do you still have barbecue that night

75
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,990
Eat what barbecue. We are all so tired.

76
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,860
Go back and rest

79
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,080
They don't eat, we eat

80
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,850
Coach

81
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,840
We all lost. There's something delicious in what.

82
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,330
It's my problem, not anybody's problem

83
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,280
Although the match was lost,

84
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,590
But this is the hardest and most exciting competition I have ever seen of you.

85
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,190
What if you lose? It's a big deal to make another appointment.

86
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,880
We definitely have the strength to fight the first world war,

87
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,310
I really envy the coach's blind confidence.

90
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,980
Grandpa Jun, these are all my grandpa asked me to bring to you.

91
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,740
Good, good

92
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,310
He's got a good job in Switzerland, isn't he? Great

93
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,900
Just a little bored and always thinking about letting you go fishing with him.

94
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,300
You

95
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,490
You tell him

96
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,690
As soon as your relationship with Junye is confirmed,

97
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,500
I'll be right there

99
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,660
But Grandpa

100
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,320
On the night of the monarch, he seems to be

101
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,240
Never asked me out

102
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,100
 

103
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,200
But this

104
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,720
I can't help it

105
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,310
You have to show your grandfather's entrepreneurial momentum.

109
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,260
Good

110
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:36,340
It's time to sneak out with Night God again. Do you want me to borrow your skirt? It's so hard to make an appointment for a meal?

111
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,660
There is no problem with eating.

112
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,340
But if you eat like this, you are afraid that someone will misunderstand you.

113
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:48,590
Coach, do you have other plans after dinner? You're too dirty, aren't you

114
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,280
No wonder take-out brother ignores you

115
00:08:51,290 --> 00:09:01,460
In order to prove the purity of this coach, I will change the meal to breakfast the next day now. I am dirty. I think you are the crazy Kannika Nimtragol.

116
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,630
Have breakfast together

117
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,640
What

118
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:14,630
I just took a fancy to the newly opened breakfast shop and decided to treat the hard-working wooden face classmates. Do you take a fancy to the fact that you can eat at will?

119
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,600
And dress formally.

120
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,350
Zhang Xiaoqiang

121
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,020
You wait for me

122
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,140
You are

123
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,910
Didn't you say you had to change clothes

124
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,070
That's what I said, okay

125
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:57,070
But Night God, the way you look in a suit

127
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,930
How is it

128
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,670
Do you think I look good

130
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,490
King's Night

132
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,950
Do you think I look good

134
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,200
King's Night

138
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,660
I was just going to see you. What a coincidence, isn't it?

139
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,180
What are you looking for me for

140
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,860
I heard that you joined your school basketball team. Can you show me to your stadium?

141
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,550
No

142
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,550
That

143
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,990
Take me to see if you can tie it

144
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,290
Grandpa also said before that you can spend more time with me, this classmate, why do you

145
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,880
Hold my classmate's hand

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,300
This is

147
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,920
She's my coach

148
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,950
Yes

150
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,610
Who is this woman? She dares to hold Junye's hand

151
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,340
I think she looks quite beautiful, too. Why haven't you seen her before in school?

153
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,080
Anna, do you know that girl? Her name is Yao Zhen

154
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,540
It's a very difficult woman to deal with. How can she pester you at night?

155
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,840
Don't you think

156
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:17,230
It is more difficult to deal with than Su Nuanxia. Ah, Su Nuanxia is completely incomparable with her, okay? I would rather Su Nuanxia be my opponent.

157
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,530
Yeah

158
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:28,330
The enemy of this enemy is a friend, especially a difficult person like Yao Zhen. I have to find a helper.

160
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,630
What I said is not exaggerated at all.

161
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,710
This Yao Zhen is definitely not a good fault.

162
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,830
Everyone in our circle knows

163
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,580
If she's after someone

164
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,010
You must get the hand

165
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,470
She will be haunting you all night

166
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,040
And they will do everything they can.

167
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,310
That won't work

168
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,570
This will affect your night training.

169
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,460
Isn't it

170
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,860
Affect Your Night

171
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,490
It will affect the team to win the championship.

173
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,720
You don't know

174
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,470
This Yao Zhen

175
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,460
There is a way to chase men.

176
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,840
First

177
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,200
Verbal flirtation

178
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,210
And then

179
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:12,190
Intimate contact is too much, right, so we must work together to drive Yao Zhen away.

180
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,880
 

181
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:20,760
You accepted it so quickly to prevent it from happening.

184
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,050
 

185
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,240
This is a good driving skill

186
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,160
Isn't it illegal to drag racing on this campus? Yes

187
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,000
Violation of regulations

188
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,640
Also, section chief

189
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,340
How did you get this off-campus car in without a pass, but she said

190
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,760
I am a family member of the monarch's family, what.

191
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,170
How does she have the face to say that her family members are on the night of the monarch? Yes, have you inspected them?

192
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,370
Let me tell you something

193
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,590
She, she, she's a liar

194
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,420
She's actually

195
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,140
Want to sell financial management

196
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:04,590
How many times have you been pestering me and Jun Night? You don't believe it. You don't believe it. Look at the picture. If this is Jun Night's family,

197
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:15,530
How could this be your attitude at night? She has seriously affected the training of our team members, so please detain her car immediately. Now the swindlers all drive sports cars and sell financial management.

199
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,200
Hmm

200
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,720
This, this

202
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:52,490
I got my car in that school. You're in charge of fix it for me, and you're gonna send me all the information on the youth dream team right away,

205
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,320
We just lost the match and you're leaving. You've changed your mind, haven't you

207
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,490
With so many plays, I volunteer

208
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,830
It will only be a few days before the city games are over.

209
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,820
All right

210
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,610
Then you must call me when you arrive. You, too. If you are bullied by these straight men, you must tell me.

211
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,980
What dialect clearly only coaches bully us.

212
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,540
Now that the rabbit has gone

213
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:42,530
In the past two days, the problem of stadium hygiene will be left to you. Forget it. Coach is inhuman. Clearly, we have already lost the match. It's miserable enough. Now it's unreasonable for us to clean up. Don't pretend.

214
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,860
Don't worry, someone will solve the health problem. I have already found volunteers. Who?

215
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,970
A senior student told me that she was short of credits and wanted to volunteer here.

216
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,670
I think people are quite reliable, so let her give it a try first.

217
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,100
Should be here in a minute

218
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,240
Maybe he did better than I did

219
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,420
Isn't it

220
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,320
Then I'll go to practice first.

221
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,930
Put that on top

222
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,900
Coach

223
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,530
Yao Zhen

225
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,810
Yao Zhen, why are you here again

226
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,440
Jun night we met again

227
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:05,470
Hello everyone, I am a new volunteer. These things are small gifts for cheerleaders and players to meet for the first time. I hope they can help everyone.

228
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:14,100
By the way, I will give everyone a gift card that can be consumed in any shopping mall of Haitai Group. Don't mention it.

230
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,680
Rabbit said that the volunteer was you, didn't you say senior student?

231
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:28,140
It was a 10,000-dollar card. This person won't get 100,000 yuan for 10,000 yuan. Thank you, fairy.

232
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,000
Why is it a fairy

233
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
With this little money, I want to buy off people's hearts.

234
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,780
Throw it all away

235
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,550
But this one was thrown away

239
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,080
Practice ball

243
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,600
Zhang Xiaoqiang, right

244
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,000
Hello, it's Yao Zhen

246
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,680
Coach

247
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,450
Can this beautiful woman stay a few more days

248
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,760
What do you say

249
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,950
Let's welcome volunteers to join us

251
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,220
Su Su Warm Summer

254
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,280
I will welcome you very well.

258
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,980
These two days may be hard for you.

259
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:35,170
The team manager of the school team may not be the same as you thought before, so let me know when today's training records are sorted out.

260
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,780
Then today's meal may need your help.

261
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,640
Coach

262
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,600
I think they worked so hard. I know there is a restaurant that specializes in nutritious meals for athletes. Why don't I order some over?

263
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,430
No

264
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,570
You are a volunteer. Just obey our arrangement.

265
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,890
A good coach

266
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,200
Are you calling those people who just came with you

268
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:19,470
To thank them for just carrying water, I shook hands politely and then they went to the infirmary.

272
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,110
I heard that Yao Zhen is an independent woman abroad.

273
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,760
How can this kind of thing depend on others

274
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,280
Where am I going to get it

277
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,450
Where's today's soup

283
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,290
Yao Zhen

284
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,380
This floor clean-up must be checked

285
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,180
We brought all these things ourselves, so aunt is not responsible and the light must be turned off.

286
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,140
If the security guard finds out that the lights are not turned off, it is our energy conservation problem, and then the club will be deducted points.

289
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't think you have heard the legend of this basketball club yet.

290
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:48,610
This is the evening.

292
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,720
I-I just need to finish this. Aren't you afraid

293
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:07,390
When you go back today, you will have to document these training records and send them to me for backup. I will analyze them according to the above data.

294
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,640
King's Night

295
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,710
How can I finish so many things at night? Please help me

296
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,810
Didn't you say you wanted to volunteer

297
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,920
Me

298
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,010
Then please do your best

301
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:36,030
Where are you, miss? I'm sorry. We'll be right back in the infirmary.

304
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,080
Is it okay if we do this

305
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,280
Of course it's okay. We're all for the team.

306
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,680
Let's go first

307
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,180
See you tomorrow at night

308
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,340
What about you? It's for the team

309
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,970
I'm here for your night. She's here

310
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,910
How much it affects the progress of the team. You're right.

311
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,280
I'll go first. See you tomorrow

312
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,720
Where are you going

313
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,520
Hands

317
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,490
Some people are really popular.

318
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,060
Yeah

319
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,900
So you should cherish me

320
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,300
Are you hungry

321
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,870
Let's go for a snack

322
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:43,900
Then go to the restaurant that specializes in making nutritious meals for athletes.

323
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,070
How's Yao Zhen's house

325
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,120
You

326
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,250
I just want to be straightforward

327
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,150
Just tell her I like you. No

328
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,080
So what do you want

329
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,200
In a word

330
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,360
This matter

331
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,150
We'll talk about it when she's gone

332
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,250
Then keep working hard

333
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,150
If you don't help me do my own thing, do it yourself.

335
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,700
Help me

336
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:15,150
Master Jun, please, help me, help me, please

338
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,820
Coach Sue, is there something wrong with what

339
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,520
Your form is not based on individual players, which is invalid.

340
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,660
Let me look at yesterday's draft

341
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,240
This

344
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:42,790
It's not Anna. Dogs are not allowed in this stadium. How did you bring dogs? Get out of here. I have my own use.

345
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:48,890
You guys, you guys are going too far. I just want to help the players.

346
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,140
How can you use such despicable methods to drive me away?

347
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,380
If the allergy is serious, you should go to the hospital.

348
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,130
Yeah, coach

349
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:02,450
I didn't know she was allergic to dogs. I know

350
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:08,470
I did it on purpose, didn't I? How could Coach Sue treat her little sister like this?

351
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,550
That's too much, I

353
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,220
King's Night

354
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,600
Coach

355
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,480
Is the night god pulling the wrong person

356
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:30,930
This Yao is really difficult to deal with. He will pretend to be weak. Isn't that allergy? Do you know that it is dangerous if the allergy is serious?

357
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,240
Get the dog out of here

360
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,860
How long will you stay

361
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,860
Until you like me

362
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,940
I already have someone I like

363
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,590
You don't want to say it's that Su Nuan Xia, do you

364
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,620
Yes

365
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,340
What do you mean

366
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,330
I have suffered so much these days.

367
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,530
It was a joke

368
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,280
I thought you were going to volunteer

369
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,480
Why don't you have any gentlemanly manners

370
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,940
People as good as me like you for so long.

371
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,470
Don't you feel at all

372
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,000
No

373
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,000
What am I doing hiding here

375
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,280
There are a lot of good people like you

376
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,330
Am I going to like every one of them

377
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,240
Also

378
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,280
If you have such bad taste, you only like people like Su Nuanxia.

379
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,970
I think I'm out of sight.

380
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,810
Su Nuan Xia

381
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,620
She is much better than a self-righteous person like you.

382
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,360
You

392
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:38,590
They all passed the exam.

394
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:51,590
Warm Summer Rabbit Rabbit I told you that I passed all the exams and I can stay. Really? Great

395
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,900
When I get back, let's go out and have a big meal to celebrate. You're coming back.

396
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,750
Yeah, look, I'm already at the school gate

397
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,410
Do you miss me especially

398
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,440
Is it okay

399
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,460
You didn't know you were looking for that volunteer

400
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,960
King's Night

401
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,620
What's wrong with Junye

402
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,770
Is Yao Zhen coming for Night God again

403
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,100
Don't worry, when I get back and pick up her, it's all done.

404
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,180
I'll talk to you when you come back. I'll tell you, it's really a turnaround recently.

405
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,860
When you come back, let's go to the second canteen and invite you to have a big meal. OK

406
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,530
Okay, bye-bye

407
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,700
King's Night

408
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,430
We have to tell him quickly.

409
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,940
Is it a bit insincere to send it like this?

411
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,030
Red envelope

412
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,560
I passed the general practice

413
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,780
There is no need to go back to Beijing.

417
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,920
There are only so many WeChat wallets. In the afternoon, I would like to thank the bosses in person for saving their lives.

418
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,860
See you at the old place

423
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,870
Don't you think

424
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,240
I was infected by Yao Zhen.

426
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,080
Very surprising

427
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,250
The second place in the last classical music training examination was

428
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,870
Zhang Xiaoqiang, a sophomore from the Department of Architecture,

429
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,400
Mr. Zhang.

430
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,810
Is it what's reason to be an architecture student that you should take classical music as an elective

431
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,270
Do you think the art of architecture and the art of music are essentially the same? No

432
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,790
The main reason is that this man has a thin face and dragged me here anyway.

433
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:16,630
This is Qifeng, the first student in the exam. Let's meet everyone. Hello, Qi Feng Physics Department

434
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:23,470
Mr. Qi Feng, I heard that your electromagnetism paper has been published in British magazines and I am the main force of the school basketball team.

435
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:30,450
So I'm even more curious that it's what who let you take classical music

436
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,880
Isn't that the power of love

437
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,860
Like a beautiful little sister

438
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,040
Knowing that people like classical music, in order to find a common topic, this is the big move.

439
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:46,190
Brother Qiang, that's enough. Stop talking about it

440
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,440
All right, let's start the class now.

442
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,720
Mom, why are you here? Why don't you welcome me?

443
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,690
I made braised chicken wings

444
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,390
And chicken with chili pepper for you and rabbit rabbit to eat

445
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,760
Are you going to celebrate passing the exam? You know all about it. Look, I'm proud of you.

446
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,580
The tail is going to tilt to the sky.

447
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:20,140
Yes, I have already called your teacher and asked about your grades. This time you are stepping on a steel wire.

448
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:25,780
I almost fell, Mom. Then I passed the exam. Don't I have to go to Beijing?

449
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,270
You are just like your father

450
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:35,640
As stubborn as a donkey, there must be a first step in everything. I am really happy here. You see, I learn to play basketball at the same time.

451
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,990
Don't worry about it

452
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,720
You'd better

454
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,060
The child

456
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,840
You are so handsome at night. Is it really too handsome?

458
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,810
You are so handsome at night

459
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,730
Look at what and concentrate on your meeting.

461
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,040
Come here, come here

465
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,240
No one

466
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,840
Go this way

469
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,020
You've finally listened to me and disguised yourself

470
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,120
Is this necessary

471
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,350
How can I be so shady? You have so no confidence in your beauty?

472
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,060
At the beginning, I had a crush on your face.

473
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:56,140
And first-class football skills and wisdom, thanks to you, I can pass all the exams this time. Maybe I can still get a third-class scholarship.

474
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,700
Go ahead

475
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,240
How can I repay you for passing all the exams

476
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,910
Didn't I give you a red envelope

477
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,770
You want to bribe the school director with money.

478
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,060
Or

479
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,780
In a different way

482
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,520
Kick off

484
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:28,680
No one has made me so nervous for a long time. It is really numbing to say that victory.

485
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,100
Do teammates still need these

486
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,800
Teammates

487
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,300
Ridiculous fetters

488
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,310
Did I cut everything long ago to gain absolute power with scissors?

489
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,900
There is not only a technical gap between you and me, but also a far more essential difference than that.

491
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,140
You talk too much nonsense, Chu Ran-jun

492
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,340
Bet on the honor of the myth reserve team and the name of the charging beast.

493
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,310
If you have the courage, come and rob it.

494
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,760
Your consciousness is not enough

495
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,140
Indeed as expected is the king's name on the court, what's now it doesn't matter

496
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,890
I'm not standing here to play games like winning the best name with you, Coco.

497
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,530
I just want to check

498
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,130
The injury to your thigh

499
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,100
How's it goe
