1
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,340
I'm more scared about losing you
than losing an opportunity...

2
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,700
in this industry because of a scandal.

3
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,750
So...

4
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,660
let's start over again.

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,510
Are you still not going to hold onto me?

6
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,240
If you let go now,

7
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,360
we'll never get to see each other again.

8
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,330
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

9
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,310
I love you.

10
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,150
(Episode 15)

11
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,050
We're here already.

12
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,620
Why is my place so nearby?

13
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,570
I don't want to go home today.

14
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,720
I want to be with you.

15
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,980
To be honest, I feel the same way.

16
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,950
Can I go home after I see you fall asleep?

17
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,060
It takes quite a while
for me to fall asleep.

18
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,960
That's better.

19
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,110
That means I'll get to
see you for a long time.

20
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,720
My insomnia never really bothered me.

21
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,130
But after we broke up,
my insomnia started...

22
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,310
giving me a hard time.

23
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,200
I had to stay up all night
thinking about you.

24
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,330
When was the hardest for you?

25
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,050
Never mind. You were probably fine
because you were so busy.

26
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,010
Who says I didn't have a hard time?

27
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,380
I had a hard time every night
and every morning.

28
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,310
I had a hard time working
and going to trials.

29
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,270
Every minute of the day
was difficult for me.

30
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,440
Really?

31
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,530
Did you really have that
much of a hard time?

32
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,800
Are you that happy to hear
that I had a hard time?

33
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,070
Of course. That shows how
much you really liked me.

34
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,770
Oddly enough, I feel very relieved now.

35
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,320
Let's never break up again.

36
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,810
Let's promise each other...

37
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,980
that we'll never let go
of each other's hands.

38
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,020
Okay, I promise.

39
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,320
I won't ever let go.

40
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,610
And I'll protect you.

41
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,380
The reason I left you was...

42
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,080
because I didn't want to bother you...

43
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,000
since it was such an important
time in your career.

44
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,010
And I still feel the same way.

45
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,380
So for the sake of protecting you,

46
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,030
we should do a better job in
keeping our relationship a secret.

47
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,460
We should do a better job in
keeping our relationship a secret?

48
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,710
Yes, we can't have anyone take
photos of us like last time.

49
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,260
So we should refrain from meeting outside.

50
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,900
We should meet up in confined areas...

51
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,170
such as your place or mine from now on.

52
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,150
Confined areas?

53
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,240
Yes.

54
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,320
A secret and quiet place
where there's no one else...

55
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,710
but the two of us.

56
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,520
Is it okay...

57
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,220
if I spend the night here?

58
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,800
I won't ever cross this line.

59
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,920
I promised you earlier
that I'll protect you.

60
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,380
Oh, okay.

61
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,690
Thank you so much for protecting me.

62
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,910
- Good morning, Mr. Kwon.
- Good morning.

63
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,130
It must've been uncomfortable
for you to sleep in that.

64
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,240
It's okay.

65
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,300
What's your schedule for today?

66
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,950
I'm not that busy today.

67
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,790
My shoot starts at 1pm,

68
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,550
and it'll probably end at about 7pm.

69
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,430
Then we can have dinner together.

70
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,430
- I'll call as soon as I'm done.
- Okay.

71
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,160
Who's here so early in the morning?

72
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,990
It's my manager. What are we going to do?

73
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,800
- Yun Seo.
- He'll be suspicious of us...

74
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,240
if he sees us together at this hour.

75
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,950
- Let's pretend like we're not here.
- Yun Seo.

76
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,820
No, we can't do that.
He knows the passcode.

77
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,060
If I don't answer,
he'll probably just come in.

78
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,810
- What should I do?
- Why does he know your passcode?

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,060
I get that he's your manager,
but he should...

80
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,450
- respect your privacy.
- I'm going in.

81
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,420
What...

82
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,530
You should hide here for now.

83
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,960
What? Ms. Oh.

84
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,760
My gosh.

85
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,110
Hey, you're up.

86
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,150
I thought you were sleeping
because you didn't open the door.

87
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,270
Oh, well...

88
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,120
I was using the blender.

89
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,910
That's why I didn't hear you ring the bell.

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,720
What brings you here so
early in the morning?

91
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,760
Doesn't the shoot start at 1pm?

92
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,880
I got a call saying they changed the time.

93
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,200
Your shoot starts at 11am,
so we need to get going.

94
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,290
I see. Okay.

95
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,200
I'll get ready really quickly
and meet you downstairs.

96
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,210
You can wait for me in the car.

97
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,850
- I'll be right there.
- Okay, don't take too long.

98
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,900
Okay.

99
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,050
Oh, I almost forgot.
Yun Seo, let me use your bathroom.

100
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,780
Hyuk Joon!

101
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,150
- What?
- I'm sorry.

102
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,350
Can you not go to the bathroom?

103
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,820
- Why not?
- What?

104
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,330
- Well, the thing is...
- Yun Seo.

105
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,140
I'm really sorry,
but my bladder is about to burst.

106
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,950
- Please let me in.
- No, wait.

107
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,350
- No, I really need to go.
- Hyuk Joon!

108
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,730
I really need to go.

109
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,800
My gosh.

110
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,150
Yun Seo, how long are you
going to stand there?

111
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,630
- Oh, right. I'm... I'm sorry.
- Yes, you should be.

112
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,680
You should feel sorry for my bladder.
Please leave.

113
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,250
- Go.
- Okay.

114
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,380
Hurry.

115
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,560
Got you!

116
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,290
Mr. Kwon?

117
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,420
Yes, this is he. An investigation
by the prosecution?

118
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,570
Gosh.

119
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,640
You see...

120
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,440
My gosh. It wasn't me!

121
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,890
Goodness...

122
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,780
My gosh,

123
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,080
Mr. Kwon.

124
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,430
It's all right.
I was going to shower anyway.

125
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,210
(Singil 3-dong Morning Soccer Club)

126
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,590
Oh, dear.

127
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,780
I'm glad that he had something
like this in his car.

128
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,550
I'll wash this and get it back to you.

129
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,840
So what's going on?

130
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,930
Why are you here this morning?

131
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,940
No way. Hold on.

132
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,250
Did you sleep here?

133
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,470
- No!
- Yes.

134
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,460
No and yes. Yes and no!

135
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,680
That says it all. Mr. Kwon,

136
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,430
it's true that I approve of you two dating,

137
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,770
but this is completely inappropriate.

138
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,820
Hyuk Joon!

139
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,460
Mr. Kwon, you should get going.

140
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,140
You barely have time to
go home and get changed.

141
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,360
Come on.

142
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,750
Mr. Kwon, I'm not finished, you know.

143
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,150
Does she not know how messed up this is?

144
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,180
Here.

145
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,960
- Bye.
- I'll get going then.

146
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,960
Hyuk Joon, how could you say that to him...

147
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,420
when he got hosed down because of you?

148
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,480
Yun Seo.

149
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,930
He may have gotten hosed down,
but I was struck by a lightning.

150
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,310
How can you bring him home
when you've barely been dating?

151
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,670
What should I do then?
Be with him on the streets...

152
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,750
and get photographed?

153
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,910
If you at least get photographed outside,

154
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,490
I can make up a cover story.

155
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,820
If he's photographed on
his way out of here,

156
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,320
that's a done deal.

157
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,010
We're aware of that,
so we take necessary precautions.

158
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,120
You approved our relationship,
so just let us be.

159
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,270
Pretend you didn't see anything.

160
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,720
That's what I want to do,

161
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,180
but I'm worried that you'd get caught.

162
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,190
I approved, but my brain
still doesn't allow it.

163
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,990
It's driving me insane too.

164
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,660
What are you looking at?

165
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,660
What's this?
I was wondering where you were.

166
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,410
Were you out playing soccer?

167
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,170
Hold on. Singil 3-dong Morning Soccer Club?

168
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,950
Why go that far to play soccer?

169
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,020
They must be good.

170
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,990
Let me join you next time.

171
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,610
You'll never be able to join me there.

172
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,070
What? Why not?

173
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,560
Are they picky with the
members they accept?

174
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,160
I'm quite good, you know.

175
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,580
Just know that it's not a place for you.

176
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,610
Seriously?

177
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,790
Just how good is he at
soccer to shut me out?

178
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,700
Who knew that I'd end up doing this?

179
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,170
You finish around 7pm,

180
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,640
but I'm texting in advance
because I miss you.

181
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,380
Are you done filming?

182
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,470
I think it'll be over soon.
How about some dinner?

183
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,620
That'd be great.

184
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,260
Then I'll see you at my place.

185
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,200
Will I be hosed down again?

186
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,140
Of course not. I'm changing
my lock combination...

187
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,660
as soon as I get home today.

188
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,760
Then I'll bring you sushi, your favorite.

189
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,370
Yes, I'm just about to...

190
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,970
I'm sorry, but I'll have to stay
for some additional scenes.

191
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,600
I'm afraid I'll have to take a rain check.

192
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,370
I see. Well, it can't be helped.

193
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,880
Please don't tell me you
already bought the sushi.

194
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,830
No, not yet.

195
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,710
Please don't worry about me
and focus on your work.

196
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,870
Sure. I'll see you.

197
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,030
I'm home.

198
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,180
Wait. Why are you eating
two portions alone?

199
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,340
One must be for me.

200
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,840
Not exactly.

201
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,180
Then who is it for?

202
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,390
I bought them both for me.

203
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,910
Boy, you're selfish.

204
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,490
You joined a good soccer
club all by yourself...

205
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,590
and now you're eating two
plates of the same sushi.

206
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,200
- You've changed. You know that?
- That's not it.

207
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,260
Starting now,

208
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,770
I'll teach you the virtue of sharing.

209
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,090
Watch and learn.
This is how a society works.

210
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,740
See?

211
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,680
Eat up then.

212
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,360
What do you mean you have something to say?

213
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,400
It's nothing big. The actors
signed with my agency...

214
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,020
are getting more jobs overseas...

215
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,230
which means a variety of global contracts.

216
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,070
I was thinking about hiring a law firm...

217
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,560
as our legal adviser.

218
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,940
So you want our firm on retainer.

219
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,750
I'm not sure. I get what you're saying,

220
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,380
- but it might not be up to you.
- What?

221
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,200
I'm sure you're aware of
the hottest case in Korea.

222
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,230
It's the Im Yun Hee Case.

223
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,480
Who solved it?

224
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,160
Always Law Firm did.

225
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,970
If you're going to say something,
at least say the truth.

226
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,010
It was Attorney Kwon's doing,
not your firm's.

227
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,110
He may be a jerk, but he's talented.

228
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,220
Anyway,

229
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,650
because of it, my law
firm has been in demand.

230
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,720
The same goes for me as well
since I'm its owner and leader.

231
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,180
TV shows and magazines...

232
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,230
are all dying to get an interview with me.

233
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,140
I'm being contacted left and right.

234
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,630
Does that mean you won't
take us on as a client?

235
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,630
That's not what I'm saying.

236
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,400
I'm just saying that we might
not always be available.

237
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,130
That's too bad. Not available, you say?

238
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,470
If you take us on as a client,
you'll enjoy a year-end party...

239
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,160
with the actors and artists.

240
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,740
Also, in the summer at Waikiki Beach,

241
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,560
we'll go camping and play beach volleyball.

242
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,400
Toss!

243
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,070
My ball!

244
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,880
You could enjoy it too,
so I'm sad to hear that.

245
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,970
You should get going then.

246
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,830
Jun Seok, my little brother Jun Seok.

247
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,790
Don't you know a joke when you hear one?

248
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,530
Did you think I'd ignore
my brother's request?

249
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,210
How do you get by in life being this naive?

250
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,170
Bring me the contract,
and I'll sign it instantly.

251
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,100
My big brother!

252
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,720
Gosh.

253
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,680
Also, the team working on
Yun Seo's TV series...

254
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,700
is looking for an advisory counsel.

255
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,860
An advisory counsel?

256
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,090
You know, an expert...

257
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,490
who advises the staff and
writers on legal jargon.

258
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,260
They're looking for someone
who Yun Seo knows well.

259
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,250
I can be that expert. There's me.

260
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,460
- You're an attorney too, right?
- Of course I am.

261
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,950
It's too bad though.

262
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,250
You said you're not available.

263
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,220
Can you ask someone else to do it?

264
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,280
My cute little brother, just let me do it.

265
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,960
No, you make me nervous.

266
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,010
You'll probably annoy the actors on set...

267
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,510
and make animated photos.

268
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,430
Have someone else do it.

269
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,740
I doubt anyone would be willing to do it.

270
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,300
An advisory counsel?

271
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,220
Yes, I'm sure no one would like to do it.

272
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,870
It's exhausting, it's a hassle,
and it'll waste your time.

273
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,990
I doubt anyone would want to do it.

274
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,550
No, I don't.

275
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,340
I have enough cases on my plate right now,

276
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,060
and I don't want entertainment agencies...

277
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,310
handing out there business
cards trying to scout me.

278
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,660
I'll pass too.

279
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,800
Okay, then I'll take the job.

280
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,140
I bet you're delighted.

281
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,640
You'll see Ms. Oh often when you're on set.

282
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,010
Well, I guess that's highly possible.

283
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,470
I heard they need an advisory
counsel starting today,

284
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,850
so I'll be the one to do it.

285
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,200
No.

286
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,270
I'll do it.

287
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,700
Am I hearing things right now?

288
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,090
Mr. Kwon, can you say that one more time?

289
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,300
I said, "I will do it."
The advisory counsel.

290
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,810
Mr. Kwon, don't you hate
those kinds of things?

291
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,030
Yes, well...

292
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,640
It sounds like a good idea
to gain more experience.

293
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,900
Mr. Kwon, if someone does something
that he usually never does, he dies.

294
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,160
So don't mind stuff like this as per usual,

295
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,190
and keep up the fight for justice.

296
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,460
No. I will be the advisory counsel.

297
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,590
What's your problem? You're so annoying.

298
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,230
Is it because of the interview
from the Park Su Myeong Case...

299
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,610
a few days ago? Are you enjoying
all the attention or what?

300
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,240
Why are you trying to show off?

301
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,290
I'm not showing off.

302
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,280
Why did you ask for volunteers
in the first place then?

303
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,030
Forget it. Let's vote then.

304
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,100
Vote?

305
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,290
Yes. If he makes a mistake
at the filming site,

306
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,030
he'll ruin the reputation of our law firm.

307
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,260
So let's vote on who will
represent Always Law Firm.

308
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,920
Let's see who is more
fit for this position.

309
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,500
Just like democratic citizens,
let's decide by voting on it.

310
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,570
(Yeon Joon Gyu, 1 vote
Kwon Jung Rok, 4 votes)

311
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,990
I'll get going then.

312
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,780
Ms. Oh Jin Sim. I have good news.

313
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,110
We have a chance to finally meet.

314
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,070
I will visit your filming site...

315
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,720
as an advisory counsel...

316
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,440
No, I'll surprise her.

317
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,040
(Filming Team)

318
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,510
Is it because I didn't see
Mr. Kwon last night?

319
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,630
I have no energy, and no appetite either.

320
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,780
I see.

321
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,060
I see you've left two radishes
because you have no appetite.

322
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,930
It's so squeaky clean people might
think you licked everything off.

323
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,160
I said I don't have an appetite.
I didn't say I don't like rice.

324
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,450
Yun Seo, I'm happy that you eat so well.

325
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,170
I'm very happy, but you
have to watch your figure.

326
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,550
What if your face is all swollen up on TV?

327
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,060
By the way, you know you have
a photo shoot next week, right?

328
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,180
Yes, I know. Don't worry.
I have a conscience too, you know.

329
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,550
I heard this is helpful,
so I'm drinking it constantly.

330
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,800
Good. Gosh, you look like you're
shooting a commercial right now.

331
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,500
Drink some more.

332
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,850
- Mr. Gong, can we talk?
- Sure.

333
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,490
I miss Mr. Kwon.

334
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,100
I never expected Mr. Kwon
doing something like that.

335
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,400
Tell me about it.

336
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,680
It's unbelievable,
like seeing a mirage in a desert.

337
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,140
Hey, you're all gathered here.
Is it tea time?

338
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,760
Oh, boy. That looks tasty.

339
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,380
Oh, right. From now on,
during our meetings,

340
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,270
I wish someone will take
some meeting minutes.

341
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,880
The typing sound from
the laptop is too loud,

342
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,750
so I think someone should
handwrite some meeting minutes.

343
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,740
Okay. I'll do it.

344
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,740
Oh, Hae Yeong?
Do you have good handwriting?

345
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,740
Yes.

346
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,510
But I think it should be someone
who has some neat handwriting.

347
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,600
To find out, why don't we all
write down some letters?

348
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,250
Write, "Minutes of Meeting" on this.

349
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,430
"Minutes of Meeting".

350
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,440
We should make sure, just in case.

351
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,180
(Minutes of Meeting)

352
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,740
(Minutes of Meeting)

353
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,160
I found it. It's this.

354
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,490
This letter looks the same.

355
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,360
Mr. Choi, Ms. Dan, Hae Yeong, and Ms. Yang.

356
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm very disappointed in you.
I never expected this.

357
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,250
I was always so nice to you,
yet you betrayed me and chose Mr. Kwon?

358
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,100
What are you talking about?

359
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,060
I chose you.

360
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,080
You received one vote, right? That was me.

361
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,100
Liar.

362
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,940
Look at this.

363
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,800
I compared your handwritings when
you wrote Kwon Jung Rok's name...

364
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,290
to the handwritings that
you wrote just now.

365
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,690
This handwriting is the
only one that I don't have.

366
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,420
This is the only one.

367
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,030
Ms. Yang, it seems like you
thought a lot about this.

368
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,050
You said it was an anonymous vote.
How could you do this?

369
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,280
I didn't say anything.
I was simply curious.

370
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,500
Don't worry, I won't discriminate
anyone over something like this.

371
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,920
But why is there so much
dust suddenly in this place?

372
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,140
We should all gather this weekend...

373
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,320
and clean this place up thoroughly.

374
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,740
Except for you, Mr. Lee.

375
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,480
I'll give you a movie ticket,
so go watch a movie.

376
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

377
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,130
Hello.

378
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,230
The advisory counsel for
our drama has arrived.

379
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,650
Mr. Kwon, can you go over
this script with me?

380
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,510
(Waiting Room, Oh Yun Seo)

381
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,490
Why on earth are you here?

382
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,160
How did you come?

383
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,110
You're the advisory counsel for our drama?

384
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,200
It wasn't easy to be elected
as an advisory counsel.

385
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,650
- Elected?
- Yes.

386
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,810
Mr. Yeon, who enjoys being exposed
to the public, outright revealed...

387
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,550
his ambition that he wanted
to be your advisory counsel.

388
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,270
However, out of my
determination to see you,

389
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,540
and despite Mr. Yeon's
persuasion and criticism,

390
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,740
we eventually decided to
vote on it democratically.

391
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,530
And I won by an overwhelming
score of 4 to 1. I have been...

392
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,990
proudly elected as the advisory
counsel of your drama!

393
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,770
If I think about it now, it was a
really thrilling and close fight.

394
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,440
It does indeed sound thrilling.

395
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,870
Yes. Once I came here and saw your face,

396
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,200
I realized it was a great choice
to participate in the vote.

397
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,300
But do you feel uncomfortable
or pressured...

398
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,310
- because of my sudden visit?
- No way.

399
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,940
Do you know how happy I feel right now?

400
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,910
I missed you so much too.

401
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,710
Yun Seo, are you in here?

402
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,640
I'm sorry. No.

403
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,410
How have you been? No.

404
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,930
- Yun Seo. Oh Yun Seo!
- What?

405
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,280
We're starting the shoot.
You have to come out now.

406
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,540
Okay, I'm on my way.

407
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,000
- Mr. Kwon, you should come too.
- Okay.

408
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,060
What's wrong?

409
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,850
Mr. Kwon, I understand how you feel,

410
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,790
but coming here as an advisory
counsel seems a bit...

411
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,170
That's my free will.

412
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,550
Interfering with our relationship
all the time like this...

413
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,420
is an invasion of one's freedom
to pursue happiness...

414
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,550
and freedom of action, which is
guaranteed by the constitution.

415
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,760
- Then...
- Okay.

416
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,960
Yun Seo, don't go.
Don't go with him. Wait for me.

417
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,340
Witness, you said you were at home
at the day of the incident.

418
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,420
Is that correct?

419
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,460
Your Honor.

420
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,410
Wait, I have a question.

421
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,500
Mr. Kwon?

422
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,820
When I say, "Your Honor",

423
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,820
what is the proper hand gesture?

424
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,110
Oh, that.

425
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,760
Okay. Thanks.

426
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,330
Instead of pointing at the judge directly,

427
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,780
you should stand straight or
gather your hands together.

428
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,130
This looks good.

429
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,560
Instead of this?

430
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,700
Using both hands is too weird.

431
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,130
You should stand straight...

432
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,880
♫ <i>Hey you quiet and serious person,
you keep looking at me, right?</i> ♫

433
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,640
Your Honor.

434
00:28:17,012 --> 00:28:20,060
♫ <i>Yes, slowly and calmly</i> ♫

435
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,360
Mr. Kwon, have some coffee.

436
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,680
Thank you.

437
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:27,060
♫ <i>Whenever, wherever, be flexible,
that's my specialty</i> ♫

438
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,030
Excuse me, Mr. Kwon Jung Rok?

439
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,810
This part in the script is bothering me.
Is this...

440
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,730
legally a correct expression?

441
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,760
(Kwon Jung Rok)

442
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,200
♫ <i>It's too hard, tell me with easier words</i> ♫

443
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,320
Yes. It's a very precise
expression with no errors at all.

444
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,730
♫ <i>Can you see my heart over there?</i> ♫

445
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,770
Yes.

446
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,580
Of course there aren't.

447
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,320
I can see this script has no errors at all.

448
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,010
So can we please move on to the next scene?

449
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,480
Come here. Follow me.

450
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,510
♫ <i>You're gonna fall for me</i> ♫

451
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,400
♫ <i>Hurry and show yourself</i> ♫

452
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,560
♫ <i>Yeah, what you gonna do,
what you gonna do, woo hoo!</i> ♫

453
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,040
Ms. Dan.

454
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,790
Although our contract dating is over,
we're still colleagues.

455
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,290
Why don't you ever talk to me
and keep ignoring me?

456
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,380
Did I?

457
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,000
If I did, I'm sorry.

458
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,990
Wait.

459
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,000
Are things going well with the
delivery guy you fell for...

460
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,430
- and chased after?
- No.

461
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,150
I only did that out of habit
because I was drunk.

462
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,530
But it was nothing sincere.

463
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,850
Anyway, I wasn't supposed
to flirt with anyone else,

464
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,960
but I failed to stick to it
until our contract ended...

465
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,340
and broke the contract by doing so.

466
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,150
I'm sorry about that.

467
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,610
You should be sorry.

468
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,680
I'm not quite sure about that.

469
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,770
It's not like you did
everything right either.

470
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,060
You told me that your heart
feels numb when you're with me.

471
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,280
There was no point in continuing
our dating contract...

472
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,520
with someone who had no feelings for me.

473
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,210
I was practically making
a fool out of myself.

474
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,240
Well, then. I'll be off now.

475
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,380
What was that? She used to look at me...

476
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,570
with hearts in her eyes.

477
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,520
But now, she's so cold toward me.

478
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,890
How can someone change so drastically?

479
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,260
Gosh, my heart. It hurts.

480
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,490
Was I too mean?

481
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,370
No, there's no point in
apologizing to a guy...

482
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,170
who has no feelings for me.

483
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,740
Let's get over him.

484
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,080
For some reason,

485
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,280
it feels as if my heart is empty.

486
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,820
Why do I feel this way?

487
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,550
(Short-term Dating Contract)

488
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,310
Whatever the case,
our contract has come to end.

489
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,170
So let's forget about her now.

490
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,240
Goodbye.

491
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,310
It's time to say goodbye...

492
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,840
to this chapter in my life...

493
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,350
that was full of clumsiness and innocence.

494
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,320
Gosh, that's hot! That's so hot!

495
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,100
Goodness, that's so hot!

496
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,160
Do you need anything?

497
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,570
No, I'm just here for no reason.

498
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,320
Working as an advisory counsel
must've worn you out...

499
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,090
seeing that you're starting
the day with a cup of coffee.

500
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,040
I can imagine why. You're already
in charge of so many cases.

501
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,950
But you're even working as
an advisory counsel now.

502
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,520
So it's only natural that you're tired.

503
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,080
It seems like you really
regret having taken the job.

504
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,680
Okay, I'll sacrifice myself on your behalf.

505
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,080
Although it may be bothersome and tiring,

506
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,540
I'll take your place and
become Yun Seo's advisory counsel.

507
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
That's okay.

508
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,570
Really? I see.

509
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,640
I guess it's not that bad.

510
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,310
By the way,

511
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,350
how was the filming location?
Did you have fun?

512
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,820
How does Yun Seo get along
with the male lead?

513
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,600
I didn't get to see him yesterday.
But why do you ask?

514
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,940
I got really curious yesterday,
so I watched a few...

515
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,760
behind-the-scenes clips of the drama.

516
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,080
And I noticed that they have
great chemistry together.

517
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,340
A few people even left comments...

518
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,370
saying it looks like
they're dating each other.

519
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,790
- What?
- You know I'm an expert at this.

520
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,900
I personally think...

521
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,340
there's something going on between the two.

522
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,500
I think the two might start dating
because of this drama.

523
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,980
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

524
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,360
- Aren't you going to leave?
- This is really uncomfortable.

525
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,910
(Lastly, in the viewpoint of
the market environment...)

526
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,950
(Moon Ji Hoo)

527
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,860
(Moon Ji Hoo)

528
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,450
(Kiss master)

529
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,520
"Kiss master"?

530
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,270
Ms. Dan, here's your
schedule for next week.

531
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,570
- Okay, I'll take a look.
- Okay.

532
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,380
Ms. Dan, do you know how
to play the ukulele?

533
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,010
I started playing it as a hobby.

534
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,560
Someone even taught me how
to play it for a while.

535
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,690
I've always wanted to learn how to play it.
If you don't mind,

536
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,080
can I take a closer look at it?

537
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,020
Sure, go ahead.

538
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,010
I learned the basic techniques
by watching online videos.

539
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,030
Is this how you do it?

540
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,810
You need to use...

541
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,150
your second finger like this.

542
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,190
- Like this?
- Your stance...

543
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,640
I'll show you.

544
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,890
You need to hold it like
you're holding a baby.

545
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,820
Would you like to try playing the C chord?

546
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,740
- Is it this one?
- You're good.

547
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,070
I gave that ukulele to her.

548
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,990
How could she use our ukulele
that holds our precious memory...

549
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,190
to play harmony with another guy?

550
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,710
- I really don't understand...
- I noticed...

551
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,890
- She's right there.
- that there's a concert.

552
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,810
But I felt a little awkward
to go there alone.

553
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,990
Why are they together?

554
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,060
It's nice that we're getting
to go there together.

555
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,310
It's not a bad deal for me since
I get to watch a concert.

556
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,210
Ms. Dan, we need to talk.

557
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,550
I have to go somewhere with Jong Hwa.

558
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,380
We agreed to go to a ukulele concert.

559
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,380
No, you can't go there.

560
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,460
I'm sorry, but can you go to
that concert by yourself?

561
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,570
There's something very
important I need to say...

562
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,980
to Ms. Dan right now.

563
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,410
What's the important thing
that you need to tell me?

564
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,490
Ms. Dan.

565
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,200
I want you to return the
ukulele I gave you.

566
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,360
What? Why...

567
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,810
Why are you taking back
what you already gave me?

568
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,980
You're the one who took
back what you gave me.

569
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,370
What do you mean?

570
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,350
You gave me your heart,
but you took it away.

571
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,950
If you were going to be like this,
why were you so nice to me?

572
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,910
On my birthday,

573
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,910
why did you get your hair
pulled on my behalf?

574
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,060
Why did you debone the
roasted mackerel for me?

575
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,580
And why did you get me vitamins?

576
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,850
Why did you do all that?

577
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,530
Why are you suddenly being like this?

578
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:27,340
You're the one who told me
that your heart feels numb...

579
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,760
when you're with me.

580
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,260
Yes.

581
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,700
I thought it was going to stay that way.

582
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,060
But...

583
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,410
What's this?

584
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,520
It's beating so fast.

585
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,490
Foolishly enough,

586
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,450
my heart started beating after you left me.

587
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,930
And...

588
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,790
when I saw you smile with another man,

589
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,000
my heart even started hurting.

590
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,410
My heart...

591
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,290
had to feel all sorts of
things because of you.

592
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,370
- So...
- Yes?

593
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,920
Let's start dating each other.

594
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,450
I'm not talking about a contract.
Let's become a real couple.

595
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,500
I'll give you three seconds
to give me an answer.

596
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,230
Three.

597
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,560
Two.

598
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,970
One.

599
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,480
0.5.

600
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,850
0.25.

601
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:04,520
0.125.

602
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,610
Okay, let's date. I would love that.

603
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,750
- Those are the good times.
- They must be dating.

604
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,440
Those are the good times.

605
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,250
Is she still filming?

606
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,720
- Mr. Kwon.
- Ms. Oh Jin Sim!

607
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,460
What brings you here?

608
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,730
- Get in.
- Sure.

609
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,770
You said you were on set.

610
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,400
Where's your manager?

611
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,780
Today's filming was canceled,

612
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,990
and I sent Hyuk Joon home.

613
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,950
I thought about calling ahead,

614
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,370
but I wanted to surprise you for once.

615
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,950
So surprise!

616
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,790
I'm glad you did.

617
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,400
It sure is nice to see you this way.

618
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,600
Right? Isn't it great?

619
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,910
I still don't know how we
managed to stay apart.

620
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,830
Tell me about it.

621
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,270
I'm glad that today's filming was canceled.

622
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,830
You were probably exhausted.

623
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,040
It's all right. I'm hardly tired.

624
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,510
Still.

625
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,120
From what I experienced from
being on set yesterday,

626
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,560
it takes a lot of stamina to be an actor.

627
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,490
So don't eat less to keep the weight off...

628
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,660
and stay healthy by eating
what your body needs.

629
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,340
You should be the one
watching out for your health.

630
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,140
You work the most out of all
the attorneys at your firm.

631
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,320
You know what? Let's enjoy
a healthy dessert then.

632
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,150
It's red ginseng.

633
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,440
Go ahead.

634
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,210
Sure.

635
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,340
You have something to use that energy on.

636
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,590
Sorry?

637
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,900
Can you help me with my lines?

638
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,330
- Your lines?
- Yes.

639
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,180
It's easier when I have someone
to practice the scene with.

640
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,420
I'd like to work on the
scenes for tomorrow.

641
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,470
Will you help me?

642
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,800
Sure.

643
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,370
Who knew I'd be doing something like this?

644
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,240
Where's the script?

645
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,250
Here it is.

646
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,110
(The two reunite with a
kiss outside the court.)

647
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,890
That's right.

648
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,810
There's a kiss scene in the fourth episode.

649
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,170
My gosh, Jung Do.

650
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,160
Shouldn't you be in Asrael?

651
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,940
I came so that I wouldn't regret.

652
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,600
I knew I'd regret it all
my life if I just let you go.

653
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,410
It says here that Jung Do
pulls Joo Ha in for a kiss.

654
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,920
We can just skip that part.

655
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,790
Why should we?

656
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,220
I agreed to help you practice,
so I'll stay in character.

657
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,700
Oh, dear. My gosh.

658
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,220
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

659
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:57,910
No, I need to practice this.

660
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,590
It's just practice.

661
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,710
Mr. Kwon, here's the script.

662
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,900
This is fascinating.

663
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,740
So this is what a script looks like.

664
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,370
What on earth is this?

665
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,350
Sorry?

666
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,640
Mr. Kwon, here's the script.

667
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,720
This is fascinating.

668
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,560
So this is what a script looks like.

669
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,220
What on earth is this?

670
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,250
Sorry?

671
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,400
Look here.

672
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,550
"Your Honor, the defendant..."

673
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,760
"is in deep remorse regarding his actions."

674
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,840
And?

675
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,990
Isn't this supposed to be a criminal case?

676
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,950
"The accused" is for criminal cases...

677
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,390
while "the defendant" is for civil cases.

678
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,410
So the attorney should've
referred to him as the accused.

679
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:18,820
I see, but I'm not the one
who writes the script.

680
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,440
This is basic research for crime series.

681
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,030
Mr. Kwon, are you angry?

682
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,490
Well, I'll make sure to let...

683
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,250
the write know.

684
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,180
Right, please do so.

685
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,860
Let's try this scene then.

686
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,820
Which scene?

687
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,050
Scene number 27. The trial.

688
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,860
- The trial scene?
- Yes.

689
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,970
Why not stand in the
center and do it properly.

690
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,970
- What? You want me to stand?
- Yes, go ahead.

691
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,170
- I'll see how you do.
- Right.

692
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,290
The plaintiff hired Bujin Constructions...

693
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,020
and completed the demolition.

694
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,030
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

695
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,320
The plaintiff normally sits...

696
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,180
on your left.

697
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,870
This way?

698
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,870
The plaintiff hired Bujin Constructions...

699
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,470
and completed the demolition.

700
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,670
However, you failed to
supply the funds and...

701
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,180
"Therefore, you failed
to make the payments."

702
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,980
Therefore, you failed to make the payments.

703
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,240
- Ms. Oh Jin Sim.
- Yes?

704
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,090
I'm afraid that tone isn't appropriate.

705
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,430
In court, attorneys and prosecutors
rarely raise their voices.

706
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,140
It's best to end your argument in
a charismatic but refrained tone.

707
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,340
"The plaintiff hired
Bujin Constructions..."

708
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,820
"and completed the demolition."

709
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,930
"However, you failed to supply the funds."

710
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,240
"Therefore, you failed
to make the payments."

711
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,870
- Like that.
- I get it.

712
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,430
- Let me try that again.
- Sure.

713
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,590
The plaintiff hired
"Mujin" Constructions...

714
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,830
Ms. Oh Jin Sim. It's Bujin, not Mujin.

715
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:17,330
Yes, of course. Mujin...
No, Bujin Constructions.

716
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,630
Can I get a glass of water?

717
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,350
- Yes, of course.
- Okay.

718
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:27,860
"The plaintiff hired
Bujin Constructions..."

719
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,460
I thought it'd be romantic,

720
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,910
but he's working me harder
than the staff on set.

721
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:47,200
I'm glad I can be of help to you this way.

722
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,280
Sure.

723
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,120
"Outside the court."

724
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,700
"After Joo Ha walks out,
she's shocked at what she sees."

725
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,700
"Jung Do is there in his military uniform."

726
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,120
Okay, got it.

727
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,190
"Jung Do pulls Joo Ha in for..."

728
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,270
"a kiss?"

729
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,780
"The two reunite with
a kiss outside the court."

730
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,160
(Kiss master)

731
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,960
A kiss master?

732
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,410
I have an announcement to make.
I booked us a table...

733
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,570
at the nearby Korean beef
restaurant for dinner.

734
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,970
That's a good choice.

735
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,500
The raw beef there is amazing.

736
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,650
The chef is known as the Beef Master.

737
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,870
As if.

738
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,070
There's no such thing as a kiss master.

739
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,510
Did I say that he kissed well?

740
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,630
It's nothing. May I be excused?

741
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,120
Aren't you finishing your meal?

742
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,050
I have business to attend in court.

743
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,020
A kiss master?

744
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,560
A ski master?

745
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,160
I'm sure he said, "kiss".

746
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,570
Maybe Mr. Kwon wants to find love.

747
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,880
I get it. Since it's spring,

748
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,900
he must be getting all sorts of feels.

749
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,900
Even he'd like some
romance in his life too.

750
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,690
Come to think of it, we're all single.

751
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,170
Shouldn't someone in this
group be in a relationship?

752
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,250
If you don't have time
to find someone outside,

753
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,630
you should look for someone in here.

754
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,800
There are so many secret
couples in other companies.

755
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,830
It's like our firm is the only
place with nothing going on.

756
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,240
Don't CEOs usually dislike office romances?

757
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,340
Since it interferes with their work?

758
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,620
I'm not such an old-fashioned CEO.

759
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:53,210
Furthermore, if there is a couple...

760
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,500
within our law firm,

761
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,850
I will buy each of them a spring
outfit they can wear on their date.

762
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,520
So, the moment you become a couple,

763
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,140
I hope you hold your hands up
and report to me.

764
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:07,920
- What are you two doing?
- You said to report to you.

765
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,720
Me and Ms. Dan are a couple.

766
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:13,980
Yes. We're a new couple that's
been going out since yesterday.

767
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,680
Seriously. What do you think you're doing?

768
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:21,580
How desperate were you for some
new clothes? Does that make sense?

769
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,610
My goodness. This is so silly.

770
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,240
Ms. Dan, Mr. Choi,
are you two really a couple?

771
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,350
It feels like someone smacked
me on the back of my head.

772
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,400
If that's the filming team,
she must be somewhere over there.

773
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,030
Yun Seo,

774
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,380
how do you want to do this part?

775
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,690
If you have any suggestions,
I'll follow it.

776
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,610
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

777
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,510
Mr. Kwon.

778
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:15,780
Hi.

779
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,690
What brings you here?

780
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:21,160
I had some business at court.

781
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,240
I heard you're shooting and
came in case you need any help.

782
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,760
I'm so glad I'm shooting
in front of the court.

783
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,730
We got to bump into each other like this.

784
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,310
- Yes.
- Yun Seo, it's time to shoot.

785
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,910
What?

786
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,580
I have to go, Mr. Kwon.

787
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,970
Okay.

788
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:54,780
Jung Do.

789
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,760
How did you come here?

790
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,800
Shouldn't you be in Israel?
Why are you here?

791
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,600
I came in order to leave no regrets.

792
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,640
In order not to regret letting
you go for the rest of my life.

793
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,790
Cut. What was that?

794
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,990
Was that a car horn?

795
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,390
Make sure there aren't
any unnecessary sounds.

796
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,460
All right, stand by. Let's try it again.

797
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,140
Hold on... Wait a minute.

798
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,610
May I say something
as the advisory counsel?

799
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,100
Yes, of course.

800
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:45,520
I know it's a drama,
but a man and woman kissing...

801
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,250
in front of the court like
this seems so unrealistic.

802
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,560
On top of that, how could an
attorney and a judicial officer...

803
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,550
kiss in front of a sacred court?

804
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,690
From my perspective, as a man
who works in this industry,

805
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:59,830
I'm afraid this scene
is a bit inappropriate.

806
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,620
This is a very conservative place.

807
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,880
Still, if there needs to be some
sort of emotional exchange,

808
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,600
I believe a hug will be appropriate.

809
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,880
- A hug?
- No, forget that.

810
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,840
Not even a hug.

811
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,160
A handshake.

812
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,560
A handshake sounds perfect.

813
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,890
Mr. Kwon, let's go get some coffee.

814
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,660
I don't want coffee.

815
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,650
No, you and I should get some coffee.

816
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,710
You told me not to interfere,
mentioning something about...

817
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:34,630
one's right to pursue happiness.

818
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,240
What do you think you're doing right now?

819
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,140
I just did my job as an advisory counsel.

820
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,980
If you came as an advisory counsel,
you should give advice.

821
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,000
Why are you being jealous?

822
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,210
- It's not jealousy.
- It is jealousy.

823
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,180
Look at that. Mr. Kwon, look over there.

824
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,320
You said judicial officers are
conservative or something.

825
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,530
But look at how they're holding hands.
Conservative my foot.

826
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,530
Oh, well... That's ridiculous.

827
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,570
This industry is very conservative.
There's no way...

828
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,120
Kim Se Won?

829
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,530
Jung Rok.

830
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,260
Jung Rok?

831
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,730
You even know them?

832
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,720
I don't.

833
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,910
Kim Se Won. Jung Rok.

834
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:24,550
I have my right to take the Fifth.

835
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,070
Goodness, you're just full of jealousy.

836
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,000
Can you hold hands like that
in court in those robes?

837
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,570
Who cares? It's not like we're
not working because we're dating.

838
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,230
I just got tired of dating
secretly all the time.

839
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,780
I just decided to open about it
without worrying about others.

840
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,750
Me too. I usually would never
have imagined doing this,

841
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,870
but Se Won was right.

842
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:54,250
It was hard at first, but once I
got used to it, it's nothing.

843
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,320
Jung Rok, what should I do?

844
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,610
I think I'm taking after Se Won.

845
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,710
Fine, whatever.

846
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,300
- Cheers to Always Law Firm!
- Cheers!

847
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,170
So, how did you two start to
get attracted to each other?

848
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:48,170
I know. You used to be enemies before.

849
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,210
I'm not saying this
because he's my boyfriend.

850
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,910
But Mr. Choi was a man born to be loved.

851
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,550
He's handsome, competent,
gentle, and on top of that,

852
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,410
he's a great son. He's really...

853
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,930
the best guy ever.

854
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,500
That goes for you too.

855
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,980
At times, you're cute,
and at times, you're chic.

856
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,780
You're such an unpredictable woman.

857
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,420
I see. Although I don't...

858
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,130
agree with what you said,
a promise is a promise.

859
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,870
You can each go buy some spring outfits.

860
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,720
Thank you, Mr. Yeon.

861
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,800
Why don't we buy a couple outfit?

862
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,510
Something that will look
perfect for your cute style.

863
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:27,820
It's okay.

864
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,880
Let's get something that will...

865
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,580
look perfect on you,
something luxurious and chic.

866
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,470
Let's eat.

867
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:39,200
Why do I have to use my own money
and watch something like that?

868
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:42,930
Anyway, if there are any more
hidden couples, tell me now.

869
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:46,000
We should all go get a group
outfit while we're at it.

870
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,600
I'm already struggling with my loan.
Another 7,000 dollars...

871
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,290
added to my 700,000
won't make a difference.

872
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:54,840
Hae Yeong, if it's okay with you,

873
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,780
would you like to go get a
new spring dress with me...

874
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,990
I have many dresses.

875
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,050
Mr. Kwon.

876
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,350
Is something wrong?

877
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,010
I know.

878
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,590
Your face looks so grim today.

879
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:24,010
Is it because you had a crush on Ms. Dan...

880
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,640
and you feel heartbroken
since she's going out with Mr. Choi?

881
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:27,990
Is that why you're drinking so much?

882
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,090
Is that true?

883
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,000
A crush is love too. I'll root for you.

884
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,690
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

885
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,550
Mr. Kwon, are you still
at your company dinner?

886
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,010
I see.

887
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:50,420
I'm on my way home after today's shoot.

888
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,890
Call me after dinner then.

889
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,180
Okay.

890
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,360
Did he say anything in particular?

891
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:03,310
In particular? Like what?

892
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:04,490
Well, it's just...

893
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,570
It just seemed...

894
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,550
he was jealous because of your kiss scene.

895
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:15,690
I was just curious if he gave
you a hard time about it.

896
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,130
What?

897
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,880
That's the fate of the
boyfriend of a celebrity.

898
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,730
He has to pretend he's okay
watching love scenes like that,

899
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,720
but he feels jealous inside.

900
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,140
He can't proudly tell anyone
that he's dating you either.

901
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,870
And you can't even go to places
where there are a lot of people.

902
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:35,750
Yun Seo.

903
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,070
That's why I'm so worried...

904
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,600
about the two of you dating.

905
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,940
You can't help but get exhausted...

906
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,270
when you're in a secret relationship.

907
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,250
Here you go, honey.

908
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,180
You too, honey.

909
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:06,060
You guys are bringing so
much love to our firm.

910
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,990
I'm not sure about that.
I'm starting to feel angry.

911
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,780
Those two are slowly
helping me understand...

912
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,680
why CEOs don't want their
employees to date each other.

913
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:19,620
I mean, why would the CEO...

914
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,710
want to pay people and
see them dating at the same time?

915
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,950
I feel like I'll become
furious if I stay here.

916
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,690
It seems like you're all done,
so let's go now.

917
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,520
- Let's go.
- But I don't want to go.

918
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,270
- Yun Seo!
- Hello.

919
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,480
- Yun Seo.
- Yun Seo.

920
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,450
What brings you here?

921
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:39,080
I heard you guys are having a team
dinner here, so I dropped by.

922
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,540
I'm glad you're here.
We were just getting started.

923
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,720
Come this way.

924
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,460
Sit here.

925
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,560
Jong Hwa, where's your seat?

926
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:52,840
- Over there, sir.
- Oh, I see. Okay.

927
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,220
Yun Seo, we have big news.

928
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:02,560
Apparently, Ms. Dan and
Mr. Choi are a couple now.

929
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:06,390
- Really?
- Yes.

930
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:09,630
I was actually going to tell you tomorrow.

931
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,660
Congratulations.

932
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,270
Jung Rok, aren't you glad to see Yun Seo?

933
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:17,260
- Why aren't you saying anything?
- Pardon?

934
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:20,950
Jung Rok, what's with you today?
Why do you look so down?

935
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,390
Is it because it's spring?

936
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,930
It must be because you feel lonely.

937
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:26,930
- That must be it.
- That's nonsense.

938
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,010
Don't lie to me.

939
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,720
You know what? We should
set him up on a blind date.

940
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:34,730
That's not necessary.

941
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:37,100
Stop refusing the offer.
You're obviously single right now.

942
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,250
You should do as I say
and go on a blind date.

943
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:43,270
Ms. Kim, Ms. Dan, do you guys know anyone?

944
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:44,720
- Do you know any single women?
- Anyone?

945
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,450
Wait.

946
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:51,210
Mr. Kwon actually has...

947
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,220
a girlfriend.

948
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,210
- What do you mean?
- Are... Are you serious?

949
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,570
Mr. Kwon has a girlfriend?

950
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,940
Yes, well...

951
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,380
Well, it's...

952
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,180
It's me.

953
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,030
- You are so funny.
- Come on.

954
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,880
- Seriously.
- That was great acting.

955
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,880
She didn't even blink
when she made that joke.

956
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,700
"It's me." Gosh, I don't think I can do it.

957
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,330
I'm serious.

958
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,980
I was quite hesitant to tell you at first.

959
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:41,400
But I really like and trust everyone here.

960
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,880
So I want to be honest with you.

961
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,840
Mr. Kwon and I...

962
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,700
are really dating.

963
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:06,620
I like Mr. Kwon...

964
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,610
very much.

965
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,840
Oh, I see.

966
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,820
Sir, isn't that hot?

967
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:24,720
Gosh, that's hot!

968
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:28,990
Water...

969
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,900
I'm crying because it's hot.

970
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:34,720
- Are you sure?
- Yes, it's because it's hot.

971
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,280
Are you sure it's not
because you're heartbroken?

972
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,660
No, it's because my hand's burning.

973
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,450
My hand is burning.
That's why I'm crying. My gosh.

974
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,560
I sincerely congratulate you.
My gosh, that was hot.

975
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:47,510
I need to go to the bathroom.

976
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,140
Gosh, I'm so happy.

977
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,890
Goodness, I need to go to the bathroom.

978
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,020
You guys should congratulate them.
My goodness, seriously.

979
01:01:57,370 --> 01:01:58,420
Thank you.

980
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,100
Congratulations, Yun Seo.

981
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,830
I never knew that so many people...

982
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,140
were dating in our firm.

983
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:09,690
I know, right?

984
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:13,560
I really didn't expect Mr. Kwon
and Yun Seo to date each other.

985
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,410
They seem really different.

986
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,360
But at the same time,
they look really good together.

987
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:20,670
I think they make a great couple.

988
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,920
My goodness, they're forsythia flowers.

989
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,210
You're right.

990
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,620
Forsythia flowers are my favorite.

991
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:32,140
By any chance, do you know the
meaning of forsythia flowers?

992
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:34,260
No, what is it?

993
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:43,660
"My love is deeper than yours."

994
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:47,460
I see.

995
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:55,050
Hey, Ms. Yang.

996
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,770
If you don't mind, would you
like to eat with me someday?

997
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,350
Sure, let's do that.

998
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,110
Why are we drinking all of a sudden?

999
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,820
Because I want to celebrate this day.

1000
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:26,750
Today was the first time
we ever told anyone...

1001
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,380
about our relationship.

1002
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,950
But are you really okay?

1003
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:34,710
I'm worried that you're doing this for me.

1004
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,140
Mr. Kwon, do you know...

1005
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,310
what you say to me the most?

1006
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,120
"Are you okay?"

1007
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,900
"Are you really okay?"

1008
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,100
You always ask me that.

1009
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,980
But today, this is what
suddenly came to my mind.

1010
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,880
"He always asks me if I'm okay."

1011
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,480
"But I wonder if he's okay."

1012
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:04,590
"He's always so worried about me."

1013
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:08,470
"And I'm worried he might not
be taking care of himself."

1014
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:14,450
If you're not okay, I'm not okay either.

1015
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,590
Because how you feel...

1016
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,470
directly affects how I feel.

1017
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,600
And there's one more.

1018
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:28,490
I had to meet you today because
I wanted to tell you this.

1019
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,300
What is it?

1020
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,700
About that kissing scene earlier...
We didn't actually kiss.

1021
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:40,000
Okay, let's not talk about that anymore.

1022
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,060
Don't try to avoid
the subject and listen to me.

1023
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,970
That was just acting.

1024
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:46,990
We didn't actually kiss.

1025
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:50,300
I'll show you.
We held each other like this.

1026
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:53,540
And then, we did this.

1027
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,720
They shot us from an angle...

1028
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,160
so that it would seem like
we're really kissing.

1029
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:02,890
Anyway, I just didn't
want you to misunderstand.

1030
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:07,150
Actors and actresses are good
at doing stuff like that.

1031
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:10,690
They know how to make fake stuff look real.

1032
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,960
Then what if you really
want to kiss someone?

1033
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:21,620
Is this how you do it?

1034
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:54,720
Is it okay...

1035
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,400
if I cross the line today?

1036
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:25,420
♫ <i>So make it count</i> ♫

1037
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,560

01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:02,240
- Ta-da.
- Why did she choose Jung Rok...

1050
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,540
instead of me?

1051
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:04,550
You're so handsome.

1052
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:06,730
You're so unnecessarily good-looking.

1053
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:09,070
How could you be so sly?

1054
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,380
You're seriously unbelievable.

1055
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:12,140
I get that you fall in love very easily,

1056
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,690
but how could you do that
in front of your boyfriend?

1057
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:17,020
You didn't forget about our dinner
appointment tomorrow, right?

1058
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,610
- Can I really go to your house?
- Sure.

Your one-day secretary is
waiting for you in your office.

Ms. Oh.

Your flight leaves tomorrow morning.

1062
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:26,630
- What?
- Now that you're dating an actress,

1063
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,070
- you're starting to change.
- Hello.

1064
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:29,570
You're like a male lead
in a romantic comedy.

1065
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,690
I'll always be waiting for you here.

1066
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,220
That's what I wanted to say.
