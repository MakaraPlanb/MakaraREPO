00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,210
(Final Episode)

2
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,250
Mr. Kwon.

3
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,590
What are you doing?

4
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,610
You always cook breakfast for me.

5
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,270
Today, I wanted to cook for you instead.

6
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,510
So I made toast for you.

7
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,210
It looks so delicious.

8
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,010
By the way, how did you
find all these ingredients?

9
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,440
I helped myself to the fridge
and selected the items.

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,190
I didn't overstep any
legal boundaries though.

11
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,050
According to Article 329 of the Penal Code,

12
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,890
anyone who steals from a stranger
can be sentenced up to...

13
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,770
6 years in prison or a
fine of 10,000 dollars.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,340
However, we're not strangers.

15
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,120
You're right.

16
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,530
We're in a romantic relationship,
so you did nothing wrong.

17
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,300
Would you like to try one?

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,660
Sure.

19
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,230
I'm glad.

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,740
You would've been too perfect
if you were also a good cook.

21
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,020
You don't have to force yourself to eat it.

22
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,820
I'm only joking.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,650
It's absolutely delicious.

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,920
You should try some too.

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,300
What was that?

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,960
Are you just getting back?

27
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,730
I thought you left early
to play soccer again,

28
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,040
but you worked all night, didn't you?

29
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,670
Actually...

30
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,610
Hold on.

31
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,350
Yes, the arrest warrant
will be evaluated tomorrow.

32
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,250
You can meet me there
tomorrow morning at 11am.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,080
Right, of course it's hard on you.

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,520
I know it all too well.

35
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,860
It's been a month since
he broke up with Ms. Oh,

36
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,010
but he's still a mess.

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,320
He deliberately kept busy...

38
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,260
so that he wouldn't have time to miss her.

39
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,080
Last night, he pulled an all-nighter.

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,540
Really?

41
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,840
Recently, he even took up soccer
which I've never known him to do.

42
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,890
What's wrong with playing soccer?

43
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,390
After a breakup, men try to
find things to keep them busy.

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,410
Jung Rok's hoping to exhaust his body...

45
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,470
by exercising and sweating,

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,500
and it hurts me to see that.

47
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,150
Maybe it's because he feels empty inside,

48
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,200
but that manifested into a bigger appetite.

49
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,760
He bought two trays of
sushi all for himself.

50
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,000
Is it that bad?

51
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,870
Oh, dear. He really should move on already.

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,270
Tell me about it.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,680
I'm worried too.

54
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,160
I was completely shocked.

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,980
I can't believe our law firm
connected such a pretty couple.

56
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,270
Didn't the two of them suit each other?

57
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,510
Right. Thank you being so fond of us.

58
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,030
I also think that...

59
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,700
- Ms. Dan and I are...
- Actually,

60
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,890
I meant Mr. Kwon and Ms. Oh.
That's who I was talking about.

61
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,200
Why did they have to announce their
relationship at the same time?

62
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,380
Anyway, this is what I think.

63
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,560
Ms. Dan and I are just
as good looking as they are.

64
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,950
- We only lack in fame...
- Good morning.

65
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,040
Good morning, boss.

66
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,880
Good morning.

67
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,830
Is that from burning your hand...

68
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,030
on the griddle yesterday?

69
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,140
It's nothing severe.

70
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,700
I went to the hospital
because it stung at night.

71
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,230
It's only a minor burn.

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,570
A few days of applying
ointment will clear it up.

73
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,470
You must've been so shocked
to have picked up...

74
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,630
the meat with your hand.

75
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,530
Right. Of course I was.

76
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,480
Ms. Oh was like my own shining star.

77
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,050
Just like the star in the sky,
she wasn't reachable.

78
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,620
That's why I never thought...

79
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,080
she could date a non-celebrity.

80
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,160
That actually made me like her more.

81
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,380
She seems down-to-earth.

82
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,060
Right, it's nice.

83
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,920
If that was the case though,
she could've chosen me.

84
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,710
Don't I look more down-to-earth?

85
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,040
Why is it Mr. Kwon of all people?

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,450
What does he have that I don't?

87
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,130
On that note,

88
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,090
I think I'd be able to
accept this if I knew why.

89
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,100
Why did she choose Mr. Kwon over me?

90
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,680
Help me out here.
I know it's terribly difficult,

91
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,690
but name anything that you can think of...

92
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,800
which explains her reason
for not choosing me.

93
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,500
It's tricky, I know, but...

94
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,670
Looks, age, physique, and vision.

95
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,740
Also, don't you have about
700,000 dollars in debt?

96
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,690
Mr. Kwon is more financially stable too.

97
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,630
I doubt he has a mountain of debt.

98
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,860
When was my client coming in again?

99
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,260
It's the celebrity's boyfriend.

100
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,540
Mr. Kwon, let's talk.

101
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,420
Sure.

102
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,210
About the new cases I distributed...

103
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,240
Did you send in a written opinion too?

104
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
Yes, I did and sent it to court.

105
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,660
Are you sure?

106
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,180
Are you sure you sent the statement?

107
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,110
- Sorry?
- It's just that...

108
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,050
you're good at fooling people, Mr. Kwon.

109
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,690
You pretended not to have
feelings for Ms. Oh,

110
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,800
but you were actually dating her.

111
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,230
How can you be so sly?

112
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,610
I had no choice since
Ms. Oh's a public figure.

113
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,330
I just arrived on set. Gosh, I miss you.

114
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,020
You're smiling.

115
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,230
It must be Ms. Oh.

116
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,000
What did she text to make
you laugh like that?

117
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,950
- It was nothing.
- Nothing?

118
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,850
You lying like this is
why I called you sly.

119
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,940
You liar.

120
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,450
Okay, fine. She texted that she missed me.

121
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,830
So what are you going to text her back?

122
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,570
I don't know why I should tell you that,

123
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,970
but I'll text her that I miss her more.

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,050
Take a look.

125
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,210
I miss...

126
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,310
you more. Heart, heart.

127
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,860
What? Two hearts?

128
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,390
Are you really the Mr. Kwon I know?

129
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,310
This doesn't seem like you.

130
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,690
Yes, I understand that I seem different.

131
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,020
Still, now that it's out in the open,

132
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,670
I'll express my feelings
for her without being sly.

133
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,960
Okay, good. It's crucial for couples to...

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,720
express their feelings.

135
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,290
I don't know if it's because
my legs are longer than others,

136
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,870
but this coffee table is
depriving me of leg space.

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,370
Can you move it for me? I'd do it myself,

138
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,040
but my hand is in this state.

139
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,160
Sure.

140
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,200
Good.

141
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,040
A little bit more.

142
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,170
Now there's too much of a gap here.

143
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,600
Can you bring it back to where it was?

144
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,950
A little bit more.

145
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,100
A little to the left was its spot.

146
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,970
This couch is quite light,
and I was thinking of moving it.

147
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,900
While you're at it, push it to the corner.

148
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,680
- Why are you acting this way?
- What do you mean?

149
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,740
Wait, is it because you're
getting dust on your hands?

150
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,610
Do your shoulders hurt from the labor?
Okay, fine.

151
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,890
Wipe your hands and sit.

152
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,270
Let's see.

153
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,960
- Mr. Yeon.
- Here you go.

154
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,540
This massage is good for you.

155
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,250
Here you go.

156
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,920
I guess my hand is better now.

157
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,620
Doesn't it feel good?

158
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,080
Darn.

159
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,050
Let's set Jung Rok up with someone.

160
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,730
What? A blind date?

161
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,200
They say that love cures a broken heart.

162
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,470
The saying may be old-fashioned,

163
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,300
but it's still wise.

164
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,630
I don't know.

165
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,980
Would he be open to accepting someone new?

166
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,950
That's why we should
lure him out without...

167
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,420
telling him that it's a date.

168
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,440
Without telling him?

169
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,950
I'm not sure about that.

170
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,890
You said that he's having a hard time.

171
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,850
He'll keep suffering by himself
unless someone helps him.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,190
I looked around and found
a decent junior of mine.

173
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,460
Coffee?

174
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,290
That's out of the blue.

175
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,520
Okay, fine. Sure.

176
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,130
Coffee?

177
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,110
(Princess Oh Jin Sim)

178
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,880
Hello, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

179
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,550
What are you up to?

180
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,350
I was working.

181
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,980
Me too.

182
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,940
I think filming will wrap up early today.

183
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,760
What should we do for dinner?

184
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,690
Actually, I already have plans.

185
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,940
Se Won asked me out for coffee.

186
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,790
Coffee?

187
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,540
That's odd. Don't you two
see each other at home?

188
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,430
I thought so too, so I asked him why,

189
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,010
and he said he was bored.

190
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,450
He wants company?

191
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,460
Should I join you two then?

192
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,190
- What?
- Well,

193
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,390
it's a bit suffocating...

194
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,470
to always spend time with you at home.

195
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,480
It's been a while since I saw Mr. Kim,

196
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,530
and no one would be suspicious...

197
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,840
if the three of us were together.

198
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,960
Shall we then?

199
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,760
Se Won, I'm here.

200
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,060
When will you arrive?

201
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,410
I'm not going today.
It's actually your blind date.

202
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,650
What? A blind date?

203
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,240
Your date tonight has your photo,

204
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,360
so she'll probably approach you.

205
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,500
I wish you happiness, my friend.

206
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,130
- Enjoy your date with her.
- Hey, wait...

207
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,810
- Hello?
- Are you Mr. Kwon Jung Rok?

208
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,720
Sorry?

209
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,590
You're more handsome than
you are in your photo.

210
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,510
I'm sorry, but there's
been a misunderstanding...

211
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,810
Yeo Reum suddenly...

212
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,350
asked me to meet up with you today,
so I was surprised.

213
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,770
I didn't know you would be this handsome.

214
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,780
I'm glad I came out on this blind date.

215
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,540
A blind date?

216
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,170
Well... What happened was...

217
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,550
I'm sorry, but...

218
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,590
this man is mine.

219
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,980
Then, excuse us.

220
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,100
Really?

221
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,500
A woman who looked like Oh Yun Seo
came and took Jung Rok away?

222
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,440
Then are those two...

223
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,470
back together?

224
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,210
I'm afraid we've made a huge mistake.

225
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,810
I think so.

226
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,520
What if they get into a
big fight because of us?

227
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,300
I swear, I never imagined
that today would turn out...

228
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,560
to be a blind date.

229
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,400
If I knew that, would I have
asked you to come out?

230
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,750
I'm sorry that I didn't tell Se
Won that we're back together,

231
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,250
but I was planning on telling him today...

232
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,590
I'm so furious.

233
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,150
Because you're so...

234
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,410
handsome.

235
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,090
I'm sorry for being handsome...

236
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,190
What? What do you mean?

237
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,130
Did you hear what that woman said earlier?

238
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,740
That you look much better in
person than in a picture.

239
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,830
She probably liked your picture too,

240
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,500
but if you look even
more handsome in person,

241
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,810
that makes me so anxious.

242
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,070
What if you use this
handsome face of yours...

243
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,140
to steal the hearts of women?

244
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,040
Steal? What are you talking about?

245
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,970
I mean, why are you so fit for no reason?

246
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,160
You're so unnecessarily
good-looking as well.

247
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,000
You're not even going to be a celebrity.
What a waste of...

248
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,300
your face and height. It's such a waste.

249
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,030
Is that why you're angry?

250
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,480
Yes.

251
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,290
Then is there another reason
that I should be angry about?

252
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,100
No, I just thought it was
because of the blind date.

253
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,000
That's not a big deal.

254
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,790
Like you said, you didn't
even know it was a blind date.

255
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,350
We should have that much trust
between each other, you know.

256
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,470
I feel so happy.

257
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,590
- What?
- I'm the one who's anxious.

258
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,600
Since you're such an amazing woman.

259
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,260
I was mistreated by Mr. Yeon today
because I'm dating you.

260
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,440
Really? You were mistreated?

261
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,790
Yes. To be honest, I'm afraid of
what might happen from now on.

262
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,300
From now on, every guy who
knows about us will hate me.

263
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,160
I'm seriously worried I may become
the nation's most-hated man.

264
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,670
So when you say you're anxious,
you have no idea what I'm thinking.

265
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,040
Thank you.

266
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,420
- For what?
- No matter what happens from now,

267
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,810
whatever it is,

268
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,670
I think we'll be able to overcome it.

269
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,300
What? The overseas shoot
has been moved forward?

270
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,720
What do you mean?
We still have two weeks left.

271
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,700
Well, you know the first episode
will be aired a bit earlier, right?

272
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,750
Yes.

273
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,140
That's why there's been
a change of schedule.

274
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,430
No...

275
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,210
But Yun Seo, I have some good news too.

276
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,750
We were supposed to shoot
overseas for three months.

277
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,700
But we have to rush things
because of the first episode,

278
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,330
and there's not enough time.

279
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,350
So, we've decided to finish it
efficiently in one month.

280
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,290
But one month is too long too.

281
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,960
- Yes, it's long.
- So when are we leaving?

282
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,270
Your flight leaves tomorrow morning.

283
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,770
What? Tomorrow morning?

284
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,170
What? A ten o'clock flight
tomorrow morning?

285
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,140
Then we only have 20 hours left.

286
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,130
First, I'll take this afternoon off.

287
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,060
We'll have to stay apart for one month,

288
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,940
so let's make our 20 hours worthwhile.

289
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,040
Mr. Yeon, I need to take the
afternoon off. Give me permission.

290
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,310
What permission? You're already
dressed and ready to leave.

291
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,770
Then I'll take that as a yes and leave.

292
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,620
He never took a day off
in his life, what's the hurry?

293
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,670
Wait, Mr. Kwon!

294
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,790
- Are you going to meet Yun Seo?
- Yes, I am.

295
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,090
You cannot take the afternoon off.

296
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,860
I will not allow it.

297
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,470
Wait. Why can't you allow it suddenly?

298
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,000
I can't stand the two of you...

299
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,840
You have so many trials
on your hands right now.

300
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,310
I don't care whether you
meet Yun Seo or not.

301
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,840
It's not because I'm jealous.

302
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,550
For me, work is more
important than anything.

303
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,720
I can't stand my employees
neglecting their work.

304
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,770
- So don't go, Mr. Kwon.
- I am not neglecting my work.

305
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,690
I've already taken care
of almost everything,

306
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,150
and if there's anything I missed,

307
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,780
starting tomorrow, I'll work
all night and get everything done.

308
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,520
All right. Go.

309
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,400
Go. Goodness.

310
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,040
Now that you're dating an actress,
you're starting to change.

311
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,870
You're like a male lead
in a romantic comedy.

312
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,330
Get going then.

313
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,180
Don't rush too much, and drive safely...

314
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,230
Where did he go?

315
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,450
- Just a minute.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

316
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,510
Mr. Kwon.

317
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,850
A family member of Kwon Min Ju,

318
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,990
from the case you're handling,
has just called.

319
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,380
She has been arrested
by the police just now.

320
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,670
I'll head over there right away.

321
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,860
Tell her not to make any
statements until I arrive.

322
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,890
Okay.

323
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,330
Really?

324
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,030
You have no choice but to go.

325
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,340
Okay, Mr. Kwon. All right.

326
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,330
What is it? He can't
meet you because of work?

327
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,600
Yes. His client has been suddenly
arrested, and he needs to go.

328
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,120
The time we have left to
be together is now...

329
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,080
only 19 hours. Gosh.

330
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,890
What should we do?

331
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,210
It feels unfortunate that the time
we have left to be together...

332
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,120
is passing by so quickly.

333
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,780
And I feel sorry for Mr. Kwon
for handling a case on his own...

334
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,900
without a secretary.

335
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,200
- Mr. Kwon, you're back.
- Yes.

336
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,740
So did you meet your client?

337
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,100
Yes, I had a meeting with her.

338
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,640
I need some help sorting
through the documents.

339
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,400
Mr. Kim, do you have time?

340
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,450
Well, the thing is...

341
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,510
a special secretary is
here to help you today.

342
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,530
- Well...
- What?

343
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,610
Your one-day secretary is
waiting for you in your office.

344
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,760
A one-day secretary?

345
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,340
Okay.

346
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,860
Welcome back, Mr. Kwon.

347
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,220
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

348
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,920
Why are you here?

349
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,520
What do you think? I came to see you.

350
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,670
Now, there's only...

351
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,960
18 hours left for us to be together.

352
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,940
We can't even spare one second right now.

353
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,290
It's a waste to spend such precious time.

354
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,580
So I decided to be with you
while helping with your work.

355
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,470
So I returned as a one-day secretary.

356
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,140
I see.

357
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,150
Okay, then. What shall I do now?

358
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,650
Ask me anything.

359
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,410
I think you've become a bit rusty.
That's my seat.

360
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,110
You should get some rest
if you're leaving tomorrow.

361
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,340
I'm sorry for making you work so much.

362
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,820
Don't say that. I'm totally fine.

363
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,700
- I'll go meet with a client.
- Okay.

364
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,360
I'll finish this until you get back.

365
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,440
Good.

366
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,130
- Where's my cell phone charger?
- Your charger?

367
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,220
Hold on.

368
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,960
(Wireless Battery Sharing Mode)

369
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,050
Here.

370
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,120
What do you think? Isn't it like me,
who always recharges your energy?

371
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,210
- Yes. It's incredible.
- I'll share with you.

372
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,430
Thank you.

373
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,680
Jung Rok really didn't say
anything about the blind date?

374
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,100
I was worried about how angry...

375
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,010
that cranky guy would get,
but things went quite smoothly.

376
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,710
I thought he might tell
me to move out again.

377
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,730
That punk. He sometimes threatens
me since he's the homeowner.

378
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,730
Then move out of there.

379
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,000
It's okay.

380
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,650
The case I'm handling right now
is quite complicated,

381
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,460
and I won't have time to search
for a house for the time being.

382
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,610
I can't move back in
with my parents either.

383
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,660
Anyway, until I take care
of some urgent matters,

384
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,920
I'll just have to keep staying with him.

385
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,860
That's what friends are for, right?

386
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,250
Still, I don't like it.

387
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,210
You're like someone who's
not welcome in that house.

388
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,680
You should come home to
a warm, comfortable meal.

389
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,630
I have a lot of rice at my house.

390
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,900
I see, you have a lot of rice at home.

391
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,190
What? Are you asking me to...

392
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,210
Never mind if you didn't get it.

393
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,950
No, I got it.

394
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,900
You're asking me to move in with you.

395
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,460
You told me I'm the reason why you
can't live with your parents...

396
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,260
and that I should feel
responsible for that.

397
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,660
You're amazing. I really love women
who know how to take responsibility.

398
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,810
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

399
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,420
This is great.

400
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,450
You look like you're about
to die of happiness.

401
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,530
Yes, that's how happy I am.

402
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,220
But instead of dying,
I'm going to live a long life...

403
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,040
so that I can live happily with Yeo Reum...

404
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,840
for a really long time.

405
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,690
He's become really discouraged...

406
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,830
after he lost the
Im Yun Hee Case to Jung Rok.

407
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,040
I'm very glad to hear that.

408
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,020
Can I really move into your place?

409
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,610
Yes, you should move in once you're done...

410
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,510
- taking care of all those cases.
- Okay.

411
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,810
Hey, Ms. Oh. I'm done
with the consultation.

412
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,890
I'm guessing you're hungry,
so I'm going to get you a sandwich.

413
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,910
What would you like?

414
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,870
Okay. Just a second.

415
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,130
I'd like a shrimp sandwich
with mashed avocado.

416
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,220
- Okay.
- Thanks.

417
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,320
Yes.

418
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,810
Yes, I miss you too.

419
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,900
I'll be right there. Bye.

420
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,550
As your secretary, I should've
been the one to get you this.

421
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,840
I'm sorry.

422
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,620
It's so delicious.

423
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,420
I can tell that you like it
just by looking at your face.

424
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,980
How did my face look?

425
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,140
Anyway, thank you for the sandwich.

426
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,410
By the way, how long are
you going to continue...

427
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,190
playing secretary?

428
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,470
I'm not playing. Do you even
know how hard I'm working?

429
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,960
Oh, that's not what I meant.

430
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,170
Give me that. I'm going to
confiscate this from you.

431
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,630
But I bought that.

432
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,750
What's this? You got
a more delicious sandwich.

433
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,370
Okay, fine. Why are you acting so greedy?

434
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,510
There we go.

435
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,060
I finished writing the
counsel's statement...

436
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,940
based on the materials
you organized for me.

437
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,530
I'll take this to tomorrow's
warrant investigation.

438
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,720
You did great.

439
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,870
You too, Mr. Kwon.

440
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,750
We finished this a lot
quicker than I expected.

441
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,200
Yes, we did. Should we
finally go on our date now?

442
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,350
It's 8pm right now.

443
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,900
That means we have exactly 14
hours until 10am tomorrow.

444
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,440
Okay, great. Let's have a lot
of fun for the next 14 hours.

445
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,230
- Wait. Just a second.
- Okay.

446
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,680
Hey, Hyuk Joon.

447
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,690
An online live interview?

448
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,540
Tonight at 10pm?

449
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,870
Why did you schedule it at the last minute?

450
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,560
The thing is, I didn't
schedule it at the last minute.

451
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,810
We scheduled it a while ago,
but I totally forgot about it.

452
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,020
Yun Seo, I'm sorry.

453
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,760
We need to start heading there right now.

454
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,080
Gosh, this is...

455
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,150
Okay.

456
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,600
Gosh, what are we going to do?
This is so annoying.

457
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,960
I have an interview, so I need to go.

458
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,440
It's a live show,
and my fans are waiting for me.

459
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,480
So I have no choice but to go.

460
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,420
Yes, of course.
You should keep your promise.

461
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,510
You should get ready to head out.

462
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,570
My gosh.

463
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,120
She'll be leaving in 12 hours. I miss her.

464
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,810
(Live Talk)

465
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,710
Hello, this is Oh Yun Seo.

466
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,880
I'll be making a comeback
with a new drama...

467
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,160
called "Love Hurts",
and before the drama airs,

468
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,150
I wanted to get a chance to
talk to you guys comfortably.

469
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,230
And that's why we prepared
this live interview.

470
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,890
It's nice to meet you all.

471
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,060
If there's anything you'd like to know...

472
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,190
about me or the drama, you can
go ahead and start asking.

473
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,090
Okay.

474
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,890
Twinkle Twinkle Yun Seo Star...

475
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:57,080
just asked me when I'll be
leaving for my shoot abroad.

476
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,440
To be honest, my schedule got moved ahead,

477
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,230
so I'll be leaving tomorrow.

478
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,930
Yes, I know. I also feel really sad.

479
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,440
Me too.

480
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,490
Yes, okay. A user named...

481
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,870
Yun Seo Owns Joon Gyu's
Heart just told me...

482
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,430
that I should take medicine with me.
I'll make sure I do,

483
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,470
and I will also make sure to stay healthy.

484
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,530
"Yun Seo Owns Joon Gyu's Heart"?

485
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,870
From now on...

486
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,900
I wonder if that Joon Gyu
is Mr. Yeon Joon Gyu.

487
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,930
I'm going to give you a quiz.

488
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,760
And whoever gets it right...

489
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,180
will be getting a call from me.

490
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,200
Okay, then. Here's the quiz.

491
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,050
What is the storyline of "Love Hurts"?

492
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,350
"Love Hurts" is a new drama
that's going to air on TvM.

493
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,460
It's about a female merger
and acquisitions attorney...

494
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,890
who goes to the Middle East for
vacation and falls in love...

495
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,200
with a military judicial officer.
It's a romantic comedy...

496
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,100
directed by Han Sang Cheol
and written by Lee Se Jin.

497
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,230
Oh Yun Seo and Moon Ji Hoo
play the main characters.

498
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,360
And the most important fact
is that the first episode...

499
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,330
will be airing on May 22, 9:30pm.

500
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,390
Do not miss it.

(Bangbae-dong Hedgehog)

502
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,850
There's someone who just explained
it very specifically...

503
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,600
at the speed of lightning.

504
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,490
- Bangbae-dong Hedgehog.
- Yes.

505
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,490
Bangbae-dong Hedgehog,
if you send us your number...

506
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,200
- using the secret chat,
- It's me.

507
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,120
our staff will call you right away.

508
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,140
Okay.

509
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,710
Are we ready?

510
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,960
Okay, then. Let's begin.

511
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,750
Hello?

512
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,870
Yes, hello?

513
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,200
Hello, Bangbae-dong Hedgehog.

514
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,840
Can you please introduce yourself?

515
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,110
I can't exactly tell you my real name,

516
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,660
but just like my user ID,
my nickname is Hedgehog.

517
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,620
I live in Bangbae-dong,
and I'm an attorney.

518
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,980
You're an attorney who
lives in Bangbae-dong...

519
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,210
whose nickname is Hedgehog.

520
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,550
Yes, I'm a huge fan of yours.

521
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,800
The thing is, my girlfriend...

522
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,650
is also going somewhere
far away for a month.

523
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,330
It's something she's always wanted to do.

524
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,000
It was her dream.

525
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,880
So I just want to tell her to
have fun while she's there,

526
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,680
and to make sure she stays healthy,

527
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,880
and that I'll always be waiting here.

528
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,300
Okay.

529
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,750
I'm sure your girlfriend
knows how you feel...

530
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,450
and acknowledges your sincerity toward her.

531
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,830
Yes, I hope you also...

532
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,970
have fun shooting abroad.

533
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,830
My goddess, your goddess,
the universe's goddess.

534
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,520
I love you.

535
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,240
Okay, I love you, too.

536
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,640
I love all my fans. I love you guys.

537
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,020
Hey, Mr. Kwon.

538
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,170
I just finished the shoot and came home.

539
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,290
Yes, I'm going to take
a shower and go to sleep.

540
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,770
Okay, you must be tired.

541
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,300
I'm getting ready to go to work.

542
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,640
I hope you think of me a lot today.

543
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,170
Then I might have trouble working.

544
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,870
Do you like the food there?

545
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,390
Isn't the shoot exhausting?

546
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,620
The food tastes great.

547
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,920
And I am a little tired,

548
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,770
but you're like my vitamin,
so I become energetic...

549
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,770
every time we talk like this.
I'm doing great.

550
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,230
Are you heading...

551
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,760
- to the Middle East tomorrow?
- Yes.

552
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,060
There's something you must
memorize before you go there.

553
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,650
What's that?

554
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,420
Follow me.

555
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,430
"Ladaya sadiq."

556
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,380
"Ladaya sadiq."

557
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,940
What does this mean?

558
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,330
It means "I have a boyfriend."

559
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,820
If a rich Arab tries to hit on you,

560
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,010
I hope you send him away
with what I just taught you.

561
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,360
♫ <i>I just wanna be your star for you</i> ♫

562
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,990
♫ <i>With my heart that I hid</i> ♫

563
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,380
Ms. Oh.

564
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,160
I'm in front of the court right now.

565
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,050
Can you see?

566
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,970
Yes, I can.

567
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,740
By the way, I won the case...

568
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,030
that I was in charge of.

569
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,530
All the other law firms rejected it
because it was a difficult case.

570
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,920
But I took it because
the client kept pleading me.

571
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,070
And not only did I win,

572
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,790
but the judge actually quoted...

573
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,200
the preparatory document
I wrote word by word.

574
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,590
Isn't that amazing?

575
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,300
Yes. Thank you.

576
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,250
♫ <i>The person to care for you is me</i> ♫

577
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,050
♫ <i>With my heart</i> ♫

578
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,360
♫ <i>You already know</i> ♫

579
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,800
♫ <i>How I wait for you</i> ♫

580
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,090
Have you packed everything?

581
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,250
Yes, this is everything
I brought when I moved in.

582
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,470
Yeo Reum has her work cut out for her now.

583
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,270
I'm grateful for everything.

584
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,560
I'll stay with Yeo Reum
while I wrap up some cases.

585
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,800
Then I'll look for my own place.

586
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,370
I'll invite you over then.

587
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,450
Whatever.

588
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,080
Don't you cry because I'm gone.

589
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,340
Get lost already.

590
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,210
I'll get going then.

591
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,370
There's no need to see me off.
Yeo Reum will be here anyway.

592
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,090
I'm only heading outside
to say hello to her.

593
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,500
Jung Rok, I see you were home.

594
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,880
I'm resting this weekend.

595
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,920
And that you should.

596
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,310
Is this all the luggage you have?

597
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,920
Minimalism is the trend.

598
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
Sure thing. Load them in the trunk.

599
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,920
I guess he's your problem now.

600
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,870
Right. Well, you've done enough.

601
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,450
You should get back in now.

602
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,000
I think I'm about to cry.

603
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,040
Get going then and drive safely.

604
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,180
Sure. I'll see you around.

605
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,260
Bye.

606
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,500
Take care!

607
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,020
I hope Ms. Oh Jin Sim comes back soon.

608
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,090
I still have to wait
another five days though.

609
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,830
Hello, Ms. Oh.

610
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,160
I was writing down my arguments.

611
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,580
Isn't it morning there? Did you sleep well?

612
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,860
I hope you had good dreams.

613
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,080
What's with your voice?

614
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,400
Is something going on?

615
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,650
Well, you see...

616
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,640
Please don't get the wrong idea.

617
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,500
- What do you mean?
- An article was just made public,

618
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,800
and I'm flustered because of it.

619
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,430
I'm most worried that
you'd get the wrong idea.

620
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,400
It's not true at all though.

621
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,620
I've being bombarded with
calls from reporters,

622
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,470
so I need to shut off my phone.

623
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,650
I'll tell you everything when I get back,

624
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,790
so don't get any wrong ideas!

625
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,640
Sure thing, but...

626
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,300
Ms. Oh?

627
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,510
An article?

628
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,420
("Oh Yun Seo and Moon Ji Hoo
Enjoy a Secret Date in America")

629
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,280
She said she was fine there,

630
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,570
but she seems gaunt.

631
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,850
Maybe the food doesn't suit her palate.

632
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,650
She seems exhausted too.

633
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,130
Can I be excused first?

634
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,220
Did you read the article
about those two dating?

635
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,620
Of course.

636
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,660
I wonder what happened.

637
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,410
The photo seemed pretty serious.

638
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,960
Ms. Oh would never do such a thing,

639
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,560
but the photo seemed so real.

640
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,860
Exactly. They were shopping like a couple.

641
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,560
I'm disappointed in her.

642
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,730
She never once went shopping with me.

643
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,020
- What?
- Seriously?

644
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,800
I just can't believe that this happened.

645
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,750
I don't think it's true.

646
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,320
Mr. Kwon talked to Ms. Oh
in a sweet tone a few days ago,

647
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,410
and she seems to like him very much.

648
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,630
Things can't have changed so drastically.

649
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,840
I don't know. A person's feelings...

650
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,190
can't normally be explained
with logic or reason.

651
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,680
Don't you know the saying,
"Love constantly moves"?

652
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,780
Ms. Oh's feelings for Mr. Kwon...

653
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,340
could've taken a turn
for that actor instead.

654
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,380
Mr. Choi, why don't you
worry more about Ms. Dan?

655
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,300
I've never seen anyone who
falls in and out of love...

656
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,460
faster than she does.

657
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,820
One day, I even saw her...

658
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,080
fall in love with three different men.

659
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,750
That's all in the past now.

660
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,360
Now that she's with me,
she won't be like that ever again.

661
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,560
Regardless of the truth,

662
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,460
I'm sure Mr. Kwon feels terrible...

663
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,130
to have read this about his girlfriend.

664
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,410
For the time being,
let's not say anything to him.

665
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,470
- All right?
- Sure.

666
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,630
What are you doing, sir?

667
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,890
Come over here and look at him.

668
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,520
He's close to ripping the
documents he's reading.

669
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,870
Don't you think he's angry
because of that scandal?

670
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,760
I'm not sure. Maybe the page got stuck.

671
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,910
No way. If that was the case,
using a rubber tip would be easier.

672
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,640
He's too clever to not know that.

673
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,920
It's obvious...

674
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,410
that he's letting out
his anger on the paper.

675
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,050
- Right?
- What happened to playing dumb?

676
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,970
Yes, of course.

677
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,810
Take a look!

678
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,310
See? Did you see that?

679
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,910
He wants to punch that actor
next to Ms. Oh.

680
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,600
He can't, so he's punching
the copying machine instead.

681
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,930
Am I still wrong?

682
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,310
You said that we should
pretend not to know anything.

683
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,350
That's what I want to do,

684
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,010
but I'm truly upset.

685
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,690
As you very well know, I want
their love to never fade away.

686
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,050
Is that so? I never got that impression.

687
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,070
What?

688
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,740
All right, he's gone.

689
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,660
Is he all right or angry?
I just can't tell.

690
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,810
Who can read the heart of
Bangbae-dong's hedgehog?

691
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,100
Bangbae-dong's hedgehog?

692
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,490
It's nothing.

693
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,510
Ms. Dan, what would you like for dinner?

694
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,140
We'll have whatever you want.

695
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,310
Hello, a table for two?

696
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,050
I'd like udon for dinner tonight!

697
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,070
Udon?

698
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,010
Please head inside.

699
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,220
It must serve delicious food.

700
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,600
One day, I even saw her...

701
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,570
fall in love with three different men.

702
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,410
No, not that. Let's have something else.

703
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,330
Why?

704
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,540
(Sundae soup)

705
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,760
Coming.

706
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,340
They're all old ladies.

707
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,640
(Grandma's Sundae Soup)

708
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,810
May I take your order?

709
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,400
- Three times a day...
- What should I have?

710
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,230
Excuse me.

711
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,570
I need to take this call.

712
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,360
Here you go.

713
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,210
- That's where you can contact me.
- Okay.

714
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,660
Ms. Dan is quick to
fall in and out of love.

715
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,270
Why did you leave without barely eating,

716
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,980
and what do you have to say to me?

717
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,640
Ms. Dan, how can you do this?

718
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,720
I know you fall in love easily,

719
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,960
but you can't give
your number to someone else...

720
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,390
when you're with your boyfriend.

721
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,610
Sorry? What are you talking about?

722
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,600
Are you talking about
the number I gave to...

723
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,370
- the server just now?
- Yes!

724
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,160
Oh, boy.

725
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,590
The restaurant delivers sundae
soup to your residence,

726
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,980
so I gave him your address and number.

727
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,550
It seemed like a dish you enjoy,

728
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,340
so I thought it'd be nice.

729
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,880
What? What did you just say?

730
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,240
I take it that you still don't trust me.

731
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,560
I can't blame you since
I know how I've been.

732
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,850
Ms. Dan, that's not it.

733
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,010
You don't have to worry
about that anymore though.

734
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,610
It's true that I fall in
and out of love easily,

735
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,450
but now I'm only falling for
one person continuously...

736
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,850
and over and over again.

737
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,110
What does that mean?

738
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,000
When I see you smile,

739
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,700
I fall in love because it's so sweet.

740
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,650
When I see you come to work
in the morning with wet hair,

741
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,610
I fall in love because it's sexy.

742
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,490
Like that, I fall in love with you...

743
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,180
dozens of times every day,

744
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,670
and I have no time to fall for anyone else.

745
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,520
Ms. Dan, no, Moon Hee.

746
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,090
Mr. Choi...

747
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,480
No, Yun Hyuk.

748
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,040
Moon Hee.

749
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,570
What are they doing in the park?

750
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,480
Oh, gosh, look at that.

751
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,760
This was a park.

752
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,520
Should I change departments?

753
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,650
Why? Is your boss giving you a hard time?

754
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,740
No, it's just...

755
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,890
I'm thinking of going somewhere
where it's less intense.

756
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,820
Why, so suddenly?

757
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,360
It's just that...

758
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,750
we're both so busy with work.

759
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,640
It's hard for us to spend time together.

760
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,120
What use is it if I succeed
and climb up the ladder?

761
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,720
My happiness is right here.

762
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,560
Also, I think this is enough
to consider as a successful life.

763
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,080
Since it's the weekend tomorrow,
how about a movie?

764
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,650
Is there a movie you want to see?

765
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,100
Cancel that. I have to
search for a house tomorrow.

766
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,390
The lease for this place is almost expired.

767
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,940
Wow, I don't think any of the
reporters knew you were coming.

768
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,790
It's our first time escaping
from the airport this fast.

769
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,240
Who are you calling so urgently?

770
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,410
Is it Mr. Kwon?

771
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,120
Oh, no. Mr. Kwon isn't
answering any of my calls.

772
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,930
He must be mad because of the article.

773
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,530
Come on, no way.

774
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,800
But if you look at the picture,
anyone can be mistaken.

775
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,970
We all went together. Why were we
the only ones taken in that picture?

776
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,730
Hyuk Joon, I can't wait.
I'll go meet Mr. Kwon right now.

777
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,540
No, Yun Seo. I said, no.

778
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,610
A paparazzi might be hiding
somewhere at this very moment.

779
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,810
Don't behave rashly,
and go straight home today.

780
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,020
Stop pretending to be so stern.

781
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,710
Tada!

782
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,730
Tada!

783
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,320
Mr. Kwon!

784
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,950
What are you doing here?

785
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,050
This is what you call a surprise party.

786
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,350
I heard from your manager that
you were returning early,

787
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,270
and I wanted to surprise you.

788
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,580
Your manager is quite good
at keeping secrets.

789
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,180
That's why he kept telling me
to go straight home.

790
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,580
Goodness, I didn't know,
and thought you were angry with me.

791
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,690
Why would I be? Don't you know
we have trust between us?

792
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,690
Oh, right. I brought you a present.

793
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,440
Here. Open it.

794
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:13,970
It's my favorite scent.
I wanted to give it to you.

795
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,520
- Should I spray it on now?
- Yes.

796
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,780
What do you think? Doesn't it smell nice?

797
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,020
Then shall we go do what we
couldn't do for a month?

798
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,780
What do you mean...

799
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,560
I meant going over your script.
What are you thinking?

800
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,460
What?

801
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,350
I was kidding.

802
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,970
Come on, why are you teasing me?

803
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,380
I missed you so much.

804
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,590
Me too. I missed you dearly.

805
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,650
So much.

806
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,670
What? You can't print the
article denying the scandal?

807
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,480
Why? I can't understand.

808
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,580
Yun Seo, think about it.

809
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,840
There's less than a week left until
the first episode of our drama airs.

810
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,040
But if you suddenly say there's
nothing going on between you two,

811
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,310
will the viewers be able
to enjoy our drama?

812
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,410
We have to show them your chemistry
and make them confused...

813
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:32,780
whether this is a drama or reality.
That will boost our viewer ratings.

814
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,250
Don't you know that?

815
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:36,760
But still...

816
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,460
Forget it. We've already agreed
on it with Moon Ji Hoo's agency.

817
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,100
I know how you feel being caught up
in a scandal even before it aired,

818
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,630
but we can turn this crisis
into an opportunity.

819
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,840
Since we've succeeded in gaining attention,

820
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,840
just don't deny it or say it's
true until the end of the drama.

821
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,970
Mr. Yeon.

822
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:58,740
It's not like I don't
understand the situation,

823
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,730
but if we don't print an article
denying this, the whole world...

824
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,080
will be mistaken about
my relationship with Moon Ji Hoo.

825
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,490
Then how upset do you think...

826
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,120
my real boyfriend will be?

827
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,790
Yes, your friend... What friend?

828
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,650
- Boyfriend.
- Yes, boyfriend.

829
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,460
I understand your boyfriend's...
What friend was it again?

830
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,010
- My lover.
- Yes, lover. I'm sorry.

831
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,120
So your lover...

832
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,920
You have a lover?

833
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,560
- Yes.
- Yes?

834
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,070
Ms. Yang. Can you check this?

835
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,330
Is your address correct?

836
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,200
Yes. But why are you checking
my address all of a sudden?

837
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,120
Yeon Entertainment is throwing
a 10-year anniversary party,

838
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,520
and it wants to invite us since
we're their partner law firm.

839
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,280
They want to send us an invitation.

840
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,760
We'll be going to a party
thanks to Yun Seo.

841
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,560
I know. All the celebrities of
Yeon Entertainment will be there.

842
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,880
I'm so excited.

843
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,700
I think Mr. Lee's address is wrong though.

844
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,840
He lives in Jangchung-dong,
not Singil-dong.

845
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,520
Mr. Lee moved to Singil-dong.

846
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,120
I think it's been about 3 or 4 months.

847
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,760
What?

848
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,350
- Hello, Mr. Yeon.
- Hello.

849
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,650
- Is Joon Gyu inside?
- Yes, he is.

850
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,410
Oh, right. The addresses...

851
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,250
Let's talk next time. Next time.

852
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,340
Next time?

853
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,760
So you knew Kwon Jung Rok and Yun Seo...

854
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,080
were seeing each other?

855
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,410
Yes.

856
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:26,090
But Yun Seo asked me to keep it a secret.

857
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,570
I had no choice but to stay quiet about it.

858
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,870
Then what about that scandal?
Was it just a rumor?

859
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,080
- I'm glad. I was so worried.
- Is that important right now?

860
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,870
This is unbelievable.

861
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:42,010
The reason I sent Yun Seo to
your law firm is because...

862
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,280
I wanted you to take care
of her instead of me.

863
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:48,850
I asked for on-the-job training,
not on-the-job dating.

864
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,590
Do you think I'm enjoying this situation?

865
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,030
You know well that I'm Yun Seo's fan.

866
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,190
Am I just an ordinary fan?
When I found out about this,

867
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:58,100
I couldn't sleep for days.

868
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,720
I felt so sad, upset, and angry.

869
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:03,450
But what could I do?
Yun Seo is a person too.

870
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,660
You can't help it if she
develops feelings for someone.

871
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:10,740
Even if you're the agency CEO,
you can't control her emotions.

872
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,910
Then what should we do? We just
have to understand and accept it.

873
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,450
And we have to root for her future.

874
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,820
Fine, then. I'll be really generous
and understand Yun Seo dating.

875
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,690
But I don't like her partner,
that Kwon Jung Rok or whatever.

876
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,490
You said he's a total jerk.

877
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,660
Yes, he is a bit cranky.

878
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,230
Goodness, he's like a wolf.

879
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,170
He seduced my innocent Yun Seo
and blinded her with love.

880
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,920
That sly jerk.

881
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,230
You seem to be mistaken.
When it comes to innocence,

882
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,070
there's no one comparable to Kwon Jung Rok.

883
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:42,610
All he did was study when he was young,
and never held a girl's hand.

884
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,780
- He's been single all his life.
- I hate that even more.

885
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,380
All he did was study all his life.

886
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,650
I'm sure his parents must've
been overprotective of him.

887
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:53,150
My Yun Seo climbed back up
from the edge of a cliff.

888
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,620
She had the willpower to survive
from all the criticism and comments.

889
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,820
Jung Rok got his fair share of
criticism and hate comments.

890
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,560
Don't you remember the Park Su Myeong case?

891
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,550
Everyone in the country hated him
back then because of that case.

892
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,190
People wrote nothing but
hate comments about him.

893
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,100
If we were to count all
those hate comments,

894
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,230
he would've gotten as many as Yun Seo did.

895
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,540
Yun Seo got hate comments because
of her bad acting, the scandal,

896
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,300
her bad attitude, and starring
in multiple dramas at once.

897
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,320
She's like a gold medalist
when it comes to hate comments.

898
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,580
If Kim Yu Na is famous for her triple axel,

899
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,730
Yun Seo's known for
her triple hate comments.

900
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,950
On top of that, Yun Seo's a star.
She's a top star at that.

901
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:25,450
Jung Rok is the best attorney among
all the attorneys in our firm.

902
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,950
Yun Seo's a goddess.
She's outstandingly beautiful.

903
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,230
Jung Rok may not be as handsome as I am,

904
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,060
but he's very good-looking.

905
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,070
If he's not better looking than you,
then he's already disqualified.

906
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,260
- Do you want to die?
- Are you going to hit me?

907
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:41,270
No, I'm not going to hit you.
But Jung Rok is a great attorney,

908
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,670
so I'll be fine even if I did
since he'll defend me.

909
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,920
There's a CCTV installed
in this office, right?

910
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,410
Here. Go ahead and hit me.

911
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:48,840
What's that? Is that a crop top?

912
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:51,440
It's a limited edition from Pooh.

913
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,930
- What?
- Pooh.

914
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,150
How could he have moved?

915
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,220
I even met him yesterday
and today on the bus.

916
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,560
Hey, Ms. Yang.

917
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:13,370
You didn't forget about our dinner
appointment tomorrow, right?

918
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:16,530
But then again,
there's no way you'd forget...

919
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,270
since I've been asking you
so many times every day.

920
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,130
Mr. Lee.

921
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,410
Can I ask you something?

922
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,940
Yes, of course.

923
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,700
I heard you moved three months ago.

924
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,460
How did we always meet on
the same bus every day?

925
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,700
Well, the thing is...

926
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,740
Ms. Yang. This is your stop.

927
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,760
My goodness.

928
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,710
- This is your stop.
- My gosh, already?

929
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,310
Thank you for waking me up all the time.

930
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,310
I felt like no one would wake you up
if I didn't go home with you.

931
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,880
I just wanted to help you
get some rest on the bus.

932
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,210
That's why.

933
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,260
Is this the place you looked into?

934
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,730
Yes. What do you think?

935
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,500
It's too big.

936
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,410
And I can't afford this kind of place.

937
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,010
But I already signed the contract.

938
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,990
- What?
- Let's get married.

939
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,140
Let's get married and live her together.

940
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:50,610
You enjoy sunlight, so I purposely
chose a place with big windows.

941
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:53,830
We can put the sofa here
and the TV over there.

942
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,230
I'm going to lie on your lap and
watch movies every weekend.

943
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,930
And we're going to put
a large table over there...

944
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,910
because we're going to have
a big family together.

945
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,270
We'll have a son that looks like you...

946
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,860
and a daughter that also looks like you.

947
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,400
Se Won.

948
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,200
The only answer you can give me is...

949
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,150
"Yes, I'll marry you."

950
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,910
I'm not going to accept anything else.

951
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,830
Yes, I'll marry you.

952
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,190
My happiness is right here as well.

953
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:09,930
It's you.

954
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,620
Welcome. Is it just the two of you?

955
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,310
Welcome. Is it just the two of you?

956
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,830
Welcome.

957
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,270
The flowers are so pretty.

958
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,980
I think love is just like a flower.

959
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,820
It's beautiful and pretty,

960
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,110
but it also withers very quickly.

961
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:26,810
It's like a flower that
requires a lot of perseverance.

962
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,860
I always told myself...

963
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:35,130
that if love ever comes along again,

964
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,980
I'll pretend like I can't
recognize it and just ignore it.

965
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,240
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

966
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,250
You shouldn't like me.

967
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,610
I came to tell you this.

968
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:59,110
You should meet someone
who's far better than me.

969
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,930
That's what I wanted to tell you.

970
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,000
Thank you so much for always treating me...

971
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,000
so kindly.

972
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,290
I brought chicken.

973
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:40,470
The first episode of your drama airs today.

974
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,310
So I thought we should watch it
together as we eat chicken.

975
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,800
Sure, that sounds great.

976
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,680
Oh, right. Come in.

977
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,700
Okay.

978
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,450
Do you go to galleries
like you go on picnics?

979
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,250
Do you know what happens...

980
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,880
if you tell your colleagues
that you're a huge idol fan?

981
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,930
What's the big deal?

982
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,080
Here.

983
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,050
Are you nervous?

984
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,420
No.

985
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:15,510
I've been acting for 15 years now.

986
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,040
I know how much you waited for this moment.

987
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:37,250
Thank you for spending this
precious moment with me.

988
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,080
Me too.

989
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,320
It's starting.

990
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,790
My gosh.

991
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,600
You look really pretty.

992
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,980
"Oh Yun Seo, the Queen
of Romantic Comedies,"

993
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,850
"Makes a Successful Comeback".

994
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:57,710
I really like the title of this article.

995
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,820
We need to read the comments to
check the viewers' opinions.

996
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,990
Gosh, Mr. Kwon. I'm so nervous.
Should I not read them?

997
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,590
Should I read them? Should I not read them?

998
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:09,780
My gosh.

999
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,570
As the lead actress,
I should be able to accept...

1000
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,710
the viewers' reactions to the drama.

1001
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,000
My gosh, I can't do this.

1002
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,570
Then I'll read it first...

1003
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,440
and tell you if it's safe
for you to read or not.

1004
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,500
Okay.

1005
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,210
- What the...
- What's wrong?

1006
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,170
Is it that bad? Does it make you
want to report all the comments?

1007
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,120
The comments are all very positive.

1008
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,950
"Yun Seo's acting skills have improved."

1009
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,030
"It's so nice to see her on TV."

1010
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,550
"Yun Seo, my goddess,
looks so beautiful as always."

1011
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,440
"No one will question
her acting skills anymore."

1012
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,430
"The male and female lead
have amazing chemistry."

1013
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:53,650
"I think they're actually dating."

1014
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,510
Good job, everyone.
Let's raise our glasses.

1015
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:03,310
- Everybody, cheers.
- Cheers!

1016
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,250
Good job. You all did so well.

1017
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,950
- Thank you.
- You did great too.

1018
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,700
Yun Seo, you did great. Thank you.

1019
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,480
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

1020
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,450
All right then.

1021
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,880
Shouldn't we hear a few words
from our female lead?

1022
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:28,600
- Give it up for Oh Yun Seo!
- Oh Yun Seo!

1023
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,940
- Oh Yun Seo!
- Oh Yun Seo!

1024
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,670
Even though I've been
away from the industry,

1025
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:40,350
you all welcomed me
with open arms, and I'm grateful.

1026
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:44,260
For quite a long time,
I prepared for my comeback.

1027
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,420
And all that I wanted...

1028
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,850
was for my sincerity...

1029
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,170
to touch many people.

1030
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:56,370
I feel like I've achieved
a part of that wish,

1031
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:00,000
so I'm happy, and I also feel honored.

1032
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,000
Thank you.

1033
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,170
Cheers.

1034
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,450
Yun Seo, when you made that speech...

1035
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,120
in front of everyone...

1036
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,770
Gosh, please. Don't cry.

1037
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,150
I was touched.

1038
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,180
You did a great job.

1039
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,810
Since you feel that way,

1040
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:39,430
I want you to know...

1041
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,680
that I wish to do as I please now.

1042
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,330
What?

1043
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,600
I wrapped up the TV series,

1044
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,400
so I'm going to do...

1045
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,820
whatever I want.

1046
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,010
I'll get going then.

1047
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,610
Yun Seo, wait.
Are you going to cause trouble?

1048
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,320
Yun Seo! Hey!

1049
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,890
- Mr. Yeon.
- Oh, right.

1050
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:04,040
- Let me pour you a glass.
- Sure.

1051
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,600
What did she mean by that?

1052
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,440
What?

1053
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,240
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh.

1054
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,540
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

1055
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,240
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry!

1056
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,020
As Yun Seo's manager,
you should be looking out for her.

1057
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,750
When I was a manager,

1058
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,880
I was never allowed to
attend finale parties.

1059
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,200
I would wait outside after
quickly eating my dinner.

1060
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,840
How could you?

1061
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:30,760
I worked really hard to
take care of Yun Seo,

1062
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,970
so why can't I have a
drink on a day like this?

1063
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,300
- You can but...
- I even had my dinner!

1064
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,320
Right.

1065
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,210
Also, let's be honest here.
Who's responsible for her career?

1066
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,000
You? No way.

1067
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,040
It's me, Gong Hyuk Joon.

1068
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,280
Even on a rainy or snowy day,

1069
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,370
I'd pick Yun Seo up. I'd laugh with her...

1070
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,550
and be a shoulder for her to cry on.

1071
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:54,500
I even took out her trash too!

1072
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,510
I, Gong Hyuk Joon, did it all.

1073
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,750
Right, you did well.
You had to manage a lot,

1074
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,320
so stop being all of that for her now.

1075
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,120
Right now, you should lower your voice.

1076
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:04,950
Why?

1077
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,000
- Did I upset you?
- Well...

1078
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,150
Did I upset you?

1079
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,900
- No, of course not.
- Hold on.

1080
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,500
What is it now?

1081
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,970
Did I upset you?

1082
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,440
Just sit.

1083
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,710
You did well. Good job.

1084
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:21,830
Thank you.

1085
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,050
You're dead once you sober up.

1086
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,250
Good job.

1087
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,650
Sure, just go to sleep instead.

1088
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,390
Why am I surrounded by enemies?

1089
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:34,760
Mr. Kwon, will you be attending...

1090
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,440
Yeon Entertainment's 10-year
anniversary party tomorrow?

1091
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:40,030
Can we meet up before then?

1092
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,080
I have something to say.

1093
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:45,610
The outside weather is still a bit chilly.

1094
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,980
- Isn't it nice to be out though?
- Yes.

1095
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,290
Didn't you say you had
something to tell me?

1096
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,150
Let's sit here and talk.

1097
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,950
- Hold on.
- Sure thing.

1098
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:08,030
First, let's talk after
you eat this red ginseng.

1099
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,250
You have a long day ahead of you today.

1100
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:14,200
- Here you go.
- A long day?

1101
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:16,910
Don't ask questions and just eat up.

1102
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,990
Sure.

1103
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:23,820
Good job.

1104
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,210
- Do you feel energized?
- Yes.

1105
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,790
Then carry me off to the party!

1106
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:30,830
Sorry?

1107
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,600
It's only a joke. Let's hold hands instead.

1108
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:36,060
- Let's go.
- Sure thing.

1109
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,150
Why are we here?

1110
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,590
I have plenty of suits.

1111
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,840
They're for the office though.

1112
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,470
Let me get you something for the party.

1113
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:52,700
The party?

1114
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,990
I'm only attending it
as an advisory counsel.

1115
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:58,050
Don't you think these are too flashy?

1116
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:03,500
You're not going as
the show's advisory counsel.

1117
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:08,060
You'll be there as my boyfriend.

1118
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,610
What?

1119
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:15,920
I don't want to avoid things
or hide anymore.

1120
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:18,740
I want to tell everyone about us.

1121
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,810
Is that all right?

1122
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,290
Yes.
