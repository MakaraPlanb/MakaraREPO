1
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,200
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,920
Wait.

3
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,700
Mr. Kwon? He's not in his office right now.

4
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,260
There's nothing I can say on his behalf.

5
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,390
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,200
It's a new day, but we're still
getting a bunch of calls.

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,420
I wonder if we'll end up
spending the entire day...

8
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,960
answering calls again.

9
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,900
Our law firm homepage is frozen.

10
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,120
People might even present a petition
to the government at this rate.

11
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,490
What are we going to do?

12
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,600
On top of that, we've been getting
a lot fewer clients lately.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,490
We haven't gotten a client
ever since what happened.

14
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,150
- Here's this week's schedule.
- Thanks.

15
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,680
- Mr. Yeon.
- Yes?

16
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,930
Don't you think you should
make up with Mr. Kwon now?

17
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,270
- What?
- He took the case already.

18
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,640
It's too late for him to turn back.

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,340
He already has a lot of
people demotivating him.

20
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,860
If you add onto that,
it'll only give him a hard time.

21
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,280
What about me?

22
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,640
How do you think I feel having
to go through all this?

23
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,210
Gosh, he really is a stubborn one.

24
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,760
It was exactly the same five years ago...

25
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,230
Never mind.

26
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,920
Anyway, he should be the one
approaching me to apologize.

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,030
Why should I reach out to him...

28
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,800
after what he's done?

29
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,800
You should get back to work.

30
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,980
(Attorney, Kwon Jung Rok)

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,410
(Who Is the Culprit?
Im Yun Hee or Park Su Myeong?)

32
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,910
What is it?

33
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,810
I have something to tell you.

34
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,730
You acted like you were never
going to talk to me again.

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,730
What is it?

36
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,700
What's this? Is it an apology letter?

37
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,600
It's my resignation letter.

38
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,410
What did you just say?
A resignation letter?

39
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,980
I feel like I've caused a lot
of damage to our firm...

40
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,380
after having decided to
defend Park Su Myeong.

41
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,670
So I think I should quit in
order to minimize the damage...

42
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,030
So you're just going to quit?

43
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,270
Do you think it'll all be
fine if you just run away?

44
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,950
Is that what you really think?

45
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,740
Do you really think quitting
is the best decision?

46
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,260
I'll leave after I'm done
with all the cases...

47
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,100
- I'm currently in charge of.
- Hey.

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,200
This really isn't the way to go.

49
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,140
You can't do this to me.

50
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,170
I never once...

51
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,620
thought of you as my employee.

52
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,460
To me, you were a precious friend
and a trustworthy brother.

53
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,220
I thought of you more
dearly than my own family.

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,730
But on top of having taken such
a huge case without telling me,

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,390
you're now going to quit?

56
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,080
The law firm is receiving
unnecessary criticism because of me.

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,630
No one can work properly
because people keep calling us,

58
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,290
and we haven't even been
getting any new clients.

59
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,840
But even so, I must defend this case.

60
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,240
I might've ruined someone's life.

61
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,830
I need to do what I can to
put things back to normal.

62
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,220
This is the best I can do.

63
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,520
Okay, fine. Do as you please!

64
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't need an irresponsible
person like you.

65
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,610
So just do as you please.

66
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,330
You can defend whomever you want.
And you also go ahead and quit.

67
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,790
The defendant, Hong Jung Su,
is a self-made CEO...

68
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,430
who has about five million dollars.

69
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,830
He's been refusing to get divorced
because he doesn't wish...

70
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,850
to divide his property with his wife...

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,740
Let me repeat that. He's been refusing...

72
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,750
He's been...

73
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,320
He's been refusing to get divorced...

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,930
My wish is for you to
stay steady as a rock.

75
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,400
Just like you have been so far,

76
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,560
I believe that you'll serve justice.

77
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,080
Hey, Mr. Park.

78
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,210
Did you call because I asked
you to recommend an attorney?

79
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,240
Yes, did you find anyone?

80
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,880
Gosh, I don't care about how good they are.

81
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,730
They just need to be responsible.

82
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,390
It's fine as long as they
don't suddenly hand in...

83
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,800
a resignation letter out of the blue.

84
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:11,970
Yes.

85
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,240
Mr. Yeon, that's my cell phone.

86
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,750
Yes, I know that.

87
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,300
What are we going to do about the mood?

88
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,690
(Five Days Left Until
Park Su Myeong's Appeal)

89
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,200
(Does His Attorney, Kwon Jung Rok,
Not Have Any Countermeasures?)

90
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,200
I wonder if he's okay.

91
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,800
There's no one I can ask about him.

92
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,660
I think I saved his number last time.

93
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,290
(Prosecutor Kim Se Won)

94
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,190
(Kim Se Won)

95
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,210
- Hey.
- Where are you?

96
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,430
Let's have a drink.

97
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,000
No, I'm tired.

98
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,140
The thing is, someone wants to see you.

99
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,650
This person's having a
hard time letting you go.

100
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,110
What's that supposed to mean?

101
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,050
Hey, over here.

102
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,070
Hey, over here.

103
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,570
What are you doing? Get over here.

104
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,880
Sit down.

105
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,680
I was really surprised
when I got a call from Joon Gyu.

106
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,050
You're not students anymore.
Why are you guys fighting like kids?

107
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,740
Jung Rok, I heard you even
wrote a resignation letter.

108
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,030
I mean, I understand that you want
to quit because you don't want...

109
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,230
to cause trouble to the firm.

110
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,100
But you should've made
amends with Joon Gyu first.

111
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,560
How can you just hand in your resignation?

112
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,200
And from what I can gather,
Joon Gyu isn't wrong.

113
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,830
Not to gamble on uncertainty
is solid advice.

114
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,520
Your boss has a right to say that.

115
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,700
Must you be so petty?

116
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,320
Come to think of it,
I was a little hard on him.

117
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,310
I said that he'd be
branded as an attorney...

118
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,170
who takes on cases for a show.

119
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,540
A show? That is a bit harsh.

120
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,170
Were you always this cruel?

121
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,650
Se Won, that's enough.

122
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,950
It's my fault for taking a
case without his approval.

123
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,720
You took a case without
your boss' approval?

124
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,870
Do you not respect your superiors?

125
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,410
It must've been because I'm stubborn.

126
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,080
You know how cautious Mr. Kwon is.

127
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,330
Why tell him to drop the case
when you know him so well?

128
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,260
Are you kidding me?

129
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,090
Are you trying to help
us or make us angrier?

130
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,880
Pick a plan and stick to it.

131
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,680
Were my actions weird just now?

132
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,240
Yes.

133
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,000
Anyway, from what I can tell,
you both were wrong in this case.

134
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,230
Let's just say that you're
equally responsible.

135
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,150
Here.

136
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,880
Here you go.

137
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,020
So... Take this.

138
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,720
Anyway, let's bury the hatchet now.

139
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,690
Come on.

140
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,160
Darn it.

141
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,340
All right then. I'll leave you two alone...

142
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,560
to talk this out.

143
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,020
- This isn't a blind date you know.
- Can't you just stay?

144
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,390
Let go of me.

145
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,850
I don't care how you do it.
Just talk it out.

146
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,810
I'll get going then.

147
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,010
Stay.

148
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,710
Stay a little longer.

149
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,760
He can't just ask me here and leave.

150
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,280
Darn.

151
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,590
Why did he have to do this?

152
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,120
Darn it.

153
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,870
Prosecutor Kim,

154
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,560
thank you for helping me
with my case before.

155
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,320
I can't believe it took
me so long to thank you.

156
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,310
Anyway, that being said,

157
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,610
how is Mr. Kwon doing?

158
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:24,570
(Anyway, that being said,
how is Mr. Kwon doing?)

159
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,330
No, that's too obvious.

160
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,350
Anyone can tell that I'm anxious to ask...

161
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,560
how Mr. Kwon's doing.

162
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,730
Also, I've already asked the people
at the law firm too many times.

163
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,790
Mr. Kwon.

164
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,890
I mean, Jung Rok.

165
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,600
Don't you know me?

166
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,820
Did you think that I wouldn't
understand your wishes...

167
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,070
and really fire you?

168
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,680
Has our time together...

169
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,020
been nothing more than a thin relationship?

170
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,790
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,420
You asked...

172
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,420
whether or not I had responsibility
or a sense of belonging...

173
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,730
regarding our law firm.

174
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,860
What you said is right.

175
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,050
From start to finish, I've been nothing...

176
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,980
but selfish and opinionated.

177
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,040
I took this case to ease my mind...

178
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,460
and not be embarrassed by myself.

179
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,040
That's why I thought I should
endure the criticism alone.

180
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,680
I didn't want to cause
trouble to you or the firm,

181
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,440
and resigning was the best way...

182
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,730
to achieve that.

183
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,530
I know.

184
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,200
I know that.

185
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,320
I know why you chose to resign.

186
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,940
Still,

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,520
I can't see you get hurt anymore.

188
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,540
I know this will hurt you
like it did five years ago,

189
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,320
so I can't...

190
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,230
sit back and watch it eat you up alive.

191
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,290
Jung Rok...

192
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,920
Do you know what I regret most in my life?

193
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,670
I think we must stand with the victims.

194
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,320
What the victims are saying is true.

195
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,770
I'm certain of the germicide's harmfulness.

196
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,460
I checked the report that said it was safe.

197
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,740
It turns out that the lab
fabricated the conditions...

198
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,970
in order to get the results they wanted.

199
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,260
Wait...

200
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,220
Still, you're representing
Sejong Chemicals.

201
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,380
Does your boss know about this?

202
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,840
I think my boss...

203
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,290
was in on the fabricated report too.

204
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,510
Hey.

205
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,560
Are you trying to blow the whistle?

206
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,820
You're not, right?

207
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,760
No, of course not.

208
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,170
This resulted in 250 victims.

209
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,800
Even though I'm representing the defendant,

210
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,450
I still can have a conscience, can't I?

211
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,440
Jung Rok, are you insane?

212
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,730
Cut this nonsense out.

213
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,120
You know how powerful Daehan Law Firm is.

214
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,240
A whistleblower, you say?

215
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,660
If you do, they'll bury you as an attorney.

216
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,750
I'm scared too.

217
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,510
However, I can't turn
a blind eye and cover my ears.

218
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,860
Once becomes twice,

219
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,520
and I might end up...

220
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,000
becoming a monster with no conscience.

221
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,630
That is what I'm more scared of.

222
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,610
I will ask the bar association...

223
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,450
for the nullification of your law license.

224
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,380
Violation of attorney-client privilege.

225
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,350
That seems like a good enough reason.

226
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,190
Article 2 Section 3 of the
Attorneys' Code of Ethics...

227
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,660
states that attorneys must not
commit an act of misconduct...

228
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,510
and always have the
public's interest at heart.

229
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,740
I will live my life as an attorney...

230
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,800
that at least has a shred of conscience.

231
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,770
Jung Rok, you crazy idiot.

232
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,500
I can't believe you.

233
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,070
You insane jerk.

234
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,590
(Yeram Law Firm)

235
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,450
Hello, sir.

236
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,100
I'm Yeon Joon Gyu, an attorney
of the 32nd group of graduates.

237
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,140
He's a kindhearted and talented attorney.

238
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,420
I can't have him be crushed
by Daehan Law Firm.

239
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,410
How can I reject when you're
the one who's asking?

240
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,670
Thank you, sir.

241
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,650
I will never forget this.

242
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,540
Thank you.

243
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,160
The biggest regret in my life...

244
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
is not stopping you five years ago.

245
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,620
I had to watch you crumble...

246
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,700
before my very eyes.

247
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,880
Still, what is the best
thing I've done though?

248
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,320
I'm glad I saved you five years ago.

249
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,710
You joined my law firm not long after,

250
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,290
and we powered through
tough times together.

251
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,180
We may not have long conversations,

252
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,230
but we've become friends
who count on one another.

253
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,350
That's who you are to me.

254
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,330
So you resigning from the firm like that...

255
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,930
made me rethink my life.

256
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,840
So let's do this together.

257
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,900
I can't...

258
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,170
just let you crumble like this.

259
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,690
So even though we have
our work cut out for us,

260
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,180
we'll push through together.

261
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,310
Now...

262
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,110
I won't waver.

263
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,320
Will it be like walking
on thin ice again today?

264
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,240
I know, it's so uncomfortable.

265
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,300
- Good morning.
- Hello.

266
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,680
- Good morning.
- Ms. Dan, Mr. Lee.

267
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,180
We'll hold an emergency meeting
in five minutes, so get ready.

268
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,530
- Pil Gi, go tell Mr. Choi.
- Okay.

269
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,800
An emergency meeting? What is it about?

270
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,620
It's just about saving someone.

271
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,570
- Saving someone? Who?
- Who else?

272
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,890
It's Mr. Kwon, the nation's most-hated man.

273
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,930
- The nation's most-hated man?
- That's right.

274
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,200
With all those calls of complaint
and malicious comments,

275
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,140
you really are the nation's most-hated man.

276
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,920
- Get ready, then.
- Okay.

277
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,690
Thank you, guys.

278
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,900
What happened?

279
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,960
Until last night, they acted like
they'd never see each other.

280
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,070
I know.

281
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,330
I wonder what happened
to melt their hearts...

282
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,160
that were frozen solid.

283
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,730
They probably had a drink and made up.

284
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,310
Well, get ready!

285
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,580
Cue!

286
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,020
Cut! Okay.

287
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,820
- Good job.
- Thank you.

288
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,900
- Thank you.
- Great job, everyone.

289
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,360
- Good job.
- Good job, Yun Seo.

290
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,810
Thank you, everyone.

291
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,930
Let's go.

292
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,660
Thank you.

293
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,910
Good job.

294
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,190
Good job, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

295
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,230
- Yun Seo, what's wrong?
- I'm just...

296
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,990
thinking of Mr. Kwon.

297
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,910
This is where he and I used to walk.

298
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,980
Hold on, Hyuk Joon.

299
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,630
Excuse me, Prosecutor Kim!

300
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,610
Ms. Oh. What brings you here?

301
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,860
I was shooting a drama.

302
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,470
How could we bump into
each other like this?

303
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,220
I was actually thinking of contacting you.

304
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,740
Me? About what?

305
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,690
Well... Last time,

306
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,300
since you took care of the
stalking case for me,

307
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,510
I wanted to thank you.

308
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,810
Because of that?

309
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,550
And also...

310
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,320
Just tell me honestly.

311
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,750
You want to ask about Jung Rok, right?

312
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,630
You catch on quite quick.

313
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,110
So how is...

314
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,030
Mr. Kwon doing?

315
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,370
The public seems to be
criticizing him heavily.

316
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,950
- Is he doing okay?
- Of course not.

317
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,220
After he took that case,
he hasn't even been eating properly.

318
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
I'm afraid he might faint
or something soon.

319
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,990
Yun Seo, we should get going now.

320
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,730
You're going to be late for your schedule.

321
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,800
- I should go now.
- Okay.

322
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,070
Please take good care of...

323
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,460
Mr. Kwon.

324
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,470
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

325
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,980
She seems very worried.

326
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,380
Well, I told her to make her worried.

327
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,510
On January 21, 2019,

328
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,530
while being assaulted by
her husband, Kim Yeong Tae,

329
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,850
Im Yun Hee was indicted on
the charges of stabbing...

330
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,120
her husband two times.

331
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,420
Im Yun Hee's father went missing
and was presumed dead,

332
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,890
and her former husband
also died from a fire,

333
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,370
which raised suspicion
from the prosecution.

334
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,110
It's because immediately after
their death, Im Yun Hee...

335
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:26,260
received a large insurance
payout under their names.

336
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,070
The court sentenced Park Su Myeong...

337
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,700
to 20 years in prison,

338
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,070
and Im Yun Hee was released on bail.

339
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,510
Currently, Im Yun Hee has
received 2.73 million dollars...

340
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,780
out of the total 4.49 million,
and has disappeared.

341
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,490
She disappeared?

342
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,300
Why was she in such a hurry when
she didn't receive the whole payout?

343
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,130
This definitely seems fishy.

344
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,150
But Park Su Myeong is claiming
something different suddenly.

345
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,790
That he only stabbed him once.

346
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,090
If he really stabbed him just
once like Park Su Myeong said,

347
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,460
there might be another culprit,
or an accomplice.

348
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,210
Do you have any leads?

349
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,640
While I was looking into
Im Yun Hee's whereabouts,

350
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,770
a witness stated that Im Yun Hee...

351
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,260
came to receive the insurance
payout with an unknown man.

352
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,710
Currently, Im Yun Hee has no
family members that are known of.

353
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,990
Then who was it?

354
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,550
It hasn't been long since
her husband died. She already...

355
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,320
No. It might've been a relationship
that started before his death.

356
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,990
As you all know, for cases
related to affairs and divorces,

357
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,650
I'm one of the nation's number one experts.

358
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,800
My gut tells me they were having an affair.

359
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,970
Time out.

360
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,030
You said Im Yun Hee's former husband
also died from a fire 5 years ago.

361
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,410
Then there might be a possibility
that Im Yun Hee and that man...

362
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:43,140
schemed it together for the money.
It's quite convincing.

363
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,050
As for now, it's just an assumption.

364
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,340
First, our priority is to identify
the man in the surveillance camera.

365
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,440
Okay. Mr. Lee, you should...

366
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,970
look into Im Yun Hee's whereabouts
after she was released.

367
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,820
And also search all the surveillance
cameras near that area.

368
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,090
I'm certain the two of them must've
been caught on camera together.

369
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,370
Okay.

370
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,960
By the way, Mr. Yeon. It's been
a while since you sent out...

371
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,610
that vibe as a real attorney.

372
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,690
I agree. I forgot for a moment...

373
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,720
that you were an attorney.

374
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,380
Attorney Yeon.

375
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,320
Why does that sound insulting?

376
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,960
Attorney Yeon?

377
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,470
Do you know why I received a
loan to open this law firm?

378
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,190
Prosecutor Yeon, Judge Yeon.
It sounds really natural.

379
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,270
But if you match up Yeon
with 'Attorney', what is it?

380
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,600
Attorney Yeon.

381
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,560
Attorney Yeon, doesn't it
sound kind of lame?

382
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,450
I hate it when a title sounds lame. So...

383
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,660
That's why I became CEO Yeon
instead of Attorney Yeon.

384
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,980
- Attorney Yeon.
- Hey.

385
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,270
Anyway, if you have any more
opinions, let's talk again.

386
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,470
- Okay.
- Okay.

387
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,940
- Great job.
- Mr. Kwon,

388
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,340
if you need any help,
you can ask me anytime.

389
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,820
Sure. Thank you.

390
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,150
It'd be nice if he had a personal
secretary like Yun Seo right now.

391
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,890
Shall we hire a secretary for him?

392
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,690
But Ms. Hwang will be returning
soon from her maternity leave,

393
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,040
so it's not the right time
to choose another secretary.

394
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,150
I guess so. Then what should we do?

395
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,000
What about letting one of the
interns be Mr. Kwon's secretary...

396
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,200
Pick me! I can do a much
better job than Jong Hwa.

397
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,900
Please give me an opportunity.

398
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,070
I will not miss this kind of
rare chance that will never...

399
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,390
- come back again.
- Sure, do it.

400
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,280
We're choosing one person,
and you're the only one who applied.

401
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,740
You went through some tough competition.

402
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,700
Congratulations. Get ready then.

403
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,260
Yes, sir.

404
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,240
I was looking for
precedents on self-defense.

405
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,560
I wanted to be of help to you in any way.

406
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,550
Who knows? I might be able to see...

407
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,920
something that you missed.

408
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,600
I want to support you in any way I can.

409
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,310
- Yes?
- Hey.

410
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,590
As of today, Pil Gi will...

411
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,150
support you as your personal assistant.

412
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,520
I'm Kim Pil Gi.

413
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,540
I'll become an ace intern that
will be the perfect match for you.

414
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,780
I look forward to working with you.

415
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,000
He tends to overreact, but he's competent.

416
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,330
- Get to it then.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,720
Mr. Kwon, what do you want
me to do from now on?

418
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,050
If you want me to find precedents,

419
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,080
I'll find them until I pull all
the ligaments in my wrists.

420
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,330
All right. Like you just said,
go look for some precedents.

421
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,640
Yes, sir.

422
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,370
Mr. Kwon, do you need any help?

423
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,960
- No, I'm good.
- Yes, sir.

424
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,960
Where are you going, Mr. Kwon?

425
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,620
I need to copy some files.

426
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,090
- There's something I have to see.
- Okay.

427
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,940
- I'll show you the way.
- No.

428
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,660
That's fine. If someone calls,
please write down a memo.

429
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,050
There's a diary inside the drawer.

430
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,070
You can read that and
get used to your work.

431
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,460
Okay. By the way, Mr. Kwon.

432
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,300
It's lunchtime soon.
What do you want to eat?

433
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,280
Shall I go to buy something for you?

434
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,770
No, thanks. I'll take care
of it on my own. Bye.

435
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,720
Okay. Goodbye, sir.

436
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,490
No matter how cornered it gets,
a tiger is still a tiger.

437
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,220
I'm going to see how Mr. Kwon...

438
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,330
overcomes this difficulty
with my own two eyes...

439
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,830
and take in and acquire
all his knowledge and tactics.

440
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,250
Oh, right. The diary.

441
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,620
This belongs to Ms. Oh.

442
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,020
After he took that case, he
hasn't even been eating properly.

443
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,750
I'm afraid he might faint
or something soon.

444
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,980
Why did you just sigh?

445
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,510
Are you having trouble
memorizing your lines?

446
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,110
No, I'm just a little tired. That's all.

447
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,650
You must be pretty exhausted.

448
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,900
But you're done for the day once
you finish shooting this scene.

449
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,860
So you can go home and get some rest.

450
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,930
Okay.

451
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,630
I'm getting a call from the law firm.

452
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,110
Yes, this is Oh Yun Seo.

453
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,740
Hi, Pil Gi.

454
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,960
- What brings you to call me?
- Well, the thing is,

455
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,940
I'll be assisting Mr. Kwon
starting from today.

456
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,740
And when I opened the drawer of the desk,

457
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,910
I noticed that you left behind...

458
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,590
your pen.

459
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,800
And I just wanted to ask...

460
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,880
if I could keep the pen as a memento.

461
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,300
Sure.

462
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,870
No, wait.

463
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,050
Yes, Mr. Lee.

464
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,180
I asked around about the
screenshot of the CCTV footage.

465
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,050
But I couldn't get anything new.

466
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,100
Okay, that will do for now.

467
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,960
Bye.

468
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,800
You're back, Mr. Kwon.

469
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,970
Yes.

470
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,120
Did you get any calls?

471
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,230
No, not really.

472
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,130
But you do have a guest.

473
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,710
The thing is,

474
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,110
I found Ms. Oh's pen in the drawer.

475
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:27,050
So I called and told her about it,
and she came to take it back.

476
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,550
I kept offering to send it to her...

477
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,030
via courier,

478
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,190
but she said she'll come
and get it herself...

479
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,540
because it's very important to her.

480
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,500
And she came as soon as she could.

481
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,130
Mr. Yeon asked me to come to his office,

482
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,020
so I'll be back a little later.

483
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,270
Well...

484
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,120
I came for my pen.

485
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,880
And I thought I'd say hello.

486
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,960
I'm the one who left that
document there, you know.

487
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,570
Yes, I know.

488
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,670
Gosh, you knew that,

489
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,610
but you never contacted me to thank me?

490
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,050
You should've thanked me after you got it.

491
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,470
I demand compensation.

492
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,600
It's only right that you
compensate me in return...

493
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,410
for such high-quality resource.

494
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,520
Article 734 of the Civil Act.

495
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,370
"A person who manages affairs
on behalf of another..."

496
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,020
"without being bound to do so..."

497
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,540
"shall conduct that management..."

498
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,650
"in the manner most advantageous
to his or herself."

499
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,420
You know that, right?

500
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,420
So as a means for compensating me,

501
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,500
you should treat me to a meal.

502
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,870
Or...

503
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,040
should I treat you to a meal?

504
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,150
Come to think of it, I did something
you never asked me to do,

505
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,850
so I'm pretty sure I made
you feel uncomfortable.

506
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,960
So let me treat you to a meal...

507
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,750
as a means to apologize.

508
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,270
What should we eat?
Let's eat something healthy.

509
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,960
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

510
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,460
Did you forget...

511
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,700
that we broke up?

512
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,740
How could I forget?

513
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,260
Yes, I know that. But the thing is,

514
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,680
I'm worried about you.

515
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,100
You're going through a lot these days.

516
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,710
It hurt me a lot after I
saw the news articles.

517
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,000
Back when I used to have a hard time,

518
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,010
you were always there for me by my side.

519
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,350
But I can't do that for you...

520
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,520
because we're no longer a couple.

521
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,950
But I still came anyway.

522
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,120
"What if he's not happy to see me?"

523
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,320
"What if I only make him
feel uncomfortable?"

524
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,960
I was really worried, but I came anyway...

525
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,200
because I wanted to eat with you.

526
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,790
I was worried you might faint...

527
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,270
for working too hard without
even eating anything.

528
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,290
You don't need to worry
about stuff like that.

529
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,690
- Pardon?
- Like you just said,

530
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,090
we're not a couple anymore.

531
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,320
Mr. Kwon.

532
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,830
So don't worry about me...

533
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,610
and just focus on your career.

534
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:30,210
And forget about all the memories
you made while you were here.

535
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:37,360
♫ <i>Don't leave yet, don't let go</i> ♫

536
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:45,240
♫ <i>That song is playing in my ears</i> ♫

537
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:52,310
♫ <i>Don't stop, there's still so much</i> ♫

538
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:58,930
♫ <i>I haven't told you yet</i> ♫

539
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:05,530
♫ <i>I can't let go of your small hand</i> ♫

540
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:13,230
♫ <i>That touched my left hand</i> ♫

541
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:20,530
♫ <i>When we looked into each other's eyes</i> ♫

542
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:27,330
♫ <i>I can't forget that moment</i> ♫

543
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:47,540
♫ <i>Hold my hand</i> ♫

544
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,360
You were home? Why didn't
you open the door for me?

545
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,410
Yun Seo, I got you
a restorative beverage...

546
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,530
and some abalone soup for your health.

547
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,110
What's wrong? Is there something wrong?

548
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,370
All the sticky notes were gone.

549
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,510
- What?
- I heard Mr. Kwon...

550
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,880
is having a hard time these days.

551
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,220
So I visited him today...

552
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,880
because I got really worried.

553
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,900
But he didn't look at
me the way he used to.

554
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,660
And he also got rid of
all the sticky notes...

555
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,690
that I wrote for him.

556
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,600
I guess...

557
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,610
he's completely over me now.

558
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,820
I don't know how I'm
going to cope with that.

559
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,400
By the way, do you know
why Yun Seo came earlier?

560
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,410
She left behind a pen,
so she came to get it.

561
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,540
She came here to get her pen
amid her busy schedule?

562
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,870
That pen must really mean a lot to her.

563
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,240
I think I kind of get what that is.

564
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,860
There are things that
are precious to you...

565
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,610
although they might not seem
that way to other people.

566
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Back when I was in elementary school,

567
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,680
I picked up a leaf bookmark on
my way to my grandma's house.

568
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,220
I think...

569
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,260
I'll feel really sad if I lose this.

570
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,520
Right.

571
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,350
Mr. Kwon?

572
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,320
I've been checking other CCTVs,

573
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,980
but nothing stands out.

574
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,420
I contacted those I know from my
detective days, so don't worry.

575
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,570
What's wrong?

576
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,980
The photograph of this evidence is weird.

577
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,570
In what way?

578
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,000
The blood splattered
everywhere in the attack,

579
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,340
but Park Su Myeong's
jacket seems almost clean.

580
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,120
The jacket you see is the
one the defendant...

581
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,070
wore on the day of the murder.

582
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,020
According to the lab result,
only a small amount...

583
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,760
of the suspect's blood
was found on the sleeve.

584
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,260
While it proves that...

585
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,650
my client attacked the victim,

586
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,480
it also can indicate that he
only stabbed the victim once.

587
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,620
(Prosecutor)

588
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,690
The fatal wound...

589
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,030
was the second stab to the victim's chest.

590
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,510
The knife ruptured an artery
connected to the heart...

591
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,040
and the victim died of excessive bleeding.

592
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:31,330
As you can see, the floor and
the walls are covered in blood.

593
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,520
It's because when the killer
pulled out the knife,

594
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,910
his blood sprayed like water
coming from a faucet.

595
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,500
So for the killer to have...

596
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,750
close to no blood on his clothes...

597
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,810
seems implausible.

598
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,440
Also, Im Yun Hee, who was
granted bail by the court,

599
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,980
recently cashed in only
half of her husband's...

600
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,180
4.93 million-dollar life insurance
and she is nowhere to be found.

601
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,340
Why did she go into hiding...

602
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,040
after giving up over two million dollars?

603
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,660
With all these facts combined,
can you still be sure...

604
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,590
that the prosecution proved
my client's guilt...

605
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,040
beyond a reasonable doubt?

606
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,470
(Judge)

607
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,420
Will the prosecution like to add anything?

608
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,160
Your Honor, I'd like to call
a witness to the stand.

609
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,660
The sole witness of this crime.

610
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,400
Here is Im Yun Hee.

611
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,740
Yun Hee!

612
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,980
Yun Hee!

613
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,450
(Witness)

614
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,490
Witness,

615
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,670
can I ask why you've been off the grid?

616
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,240
I needed to clear my head,

617
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,000
so I went on a vacation.

618
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,400
I see.

619
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,960
You were once the suspect of this murder...

620
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,060
and now you're the sole witness,
so let me ask you this.

621
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,640
The victim, Kim Yeong Tae.

622
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,520
Who stabbed him twice and killed him?

623
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,990
Yun Hee!

624
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,360
Su Myeong.

625
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,890
I'm sorry, Su Myeong.

626
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,910
Yun Hee, don't cry!

627
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,730
Yun Hee...

628
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,190
Witness, I ask you again.

629
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,460
Once in the abdomen and once in the chest.

630
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,390
Is Park Su Myeong who's
sitting over there...

631
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,770
the man who stabbed your husband
twice and killed him?

632
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,630
Yes, he is.

633
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,630
That is all.

634
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,790
But Yun Hee...

635
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,610
Yun Hee...

636
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,580
- Ms. Im!
- Mr. Kwon!

637
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,780
You claimed that she had vanished,
but she showed up today.

638
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,720
- What are your thoughts on that?
- Do you still think...

639
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,090
that the real killer is out there?

640
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:50,780
Many are criticizing
your choice to defend Mr. Park...

641
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,040
What happened?

642
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,200
What do you think happened?

643
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,540
It was a clean win.

644
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,370
I'm glad I got in touch
with Ms. Im when I did.

645
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,780
If not, it would've been a disaster.

646
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,930
By the way, how did we
get in contact with her?

647
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,010
Well, she called in person
and asked to be a witness.

648
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,150
("The Park Su Myeong Case:
Who Is the Real Killer?")

649
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,430
What on earth happened?

650
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:25,750
I thought that we had solid evidence.

651
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,660
Tell me about it.
I had no idea that Im Yun Hee...

652
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,990
would appear in court.

653
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,540
What do you think is the truth?

654
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,610
Do you believe her innocence?

655
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,850
She wouldn't have come
to court if she weren't.

656
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,520
I don't know what's happening,

657
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,290
but the public now
hates Mr. Kwon even more.

658
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,500
("Im Yun Hee's Testimony
Corners Attorney Kwon")

659
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,010
Yun Seo, stop reading that.

660
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,610
Reading it will only upset you more.

661
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,020
I can't take this anymore.

662
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,970
Yun Seo, can you start by...

663
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,540
just slapping me really hard?

664
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,920
What on earth are you doing?

665
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,200
No, I deserve it.

666
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,050
I deserve a slap from you.

667
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,600
Attorney Kwon...

668
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,910
didn't break up with you
because he doesn't like you.

669
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,320
Yes, Mr. Lee.

670
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,830
I have the CCTV footage.

671
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,730
It's near the bank where she
received the insurance money.

672
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:13,030
February 27, 3pm. It's that day.

673
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,250
It's the clearest video I could find,

674
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,670
but it's still tricky to identify anyone.

675
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,490
What is it?

676
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,720
There isn't one that shows his face.

677
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,960
But look at this though.

678
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,740
Can I get a fingerprint of it?

679
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,080
I have a feeling that it's possible.

680
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,840
I think it is too.

681
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,870
He didn't break up with you
because he doesn't like you.

682
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,210
He did so because he adores you that much.

683
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,920
We...

684
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,300
should break up.

685
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,870
Do you suddenly feel betrayed
now that you think about it?

686
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,260
Do you feel pressured
because of all the attention...

687
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,700
I'm getting?

688
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,720
Because of all the reasons
you just mentioned,

689
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,450
I've come to a conclusion that we
shouldn't date each other anymore.

690
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:28,460
So I think it would be
best that we break up.

691
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,350

702
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,660
- Ms. Oh...
- Filming will start soon,

703
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,780
so I should get going.

704
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:31,270
I hope it gives you energy
to kick butt at court today.

705
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,350
Make sure you eat it all.

706
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:42,260
♫ <i>Oh love, what do I do? What if love?</i> ♫

707
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,260
♫ <i>You're probably my</i> ♫

708
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,060
♫ <i>One, one, one, my one</i> ♫

709
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:52,760
♫ <i>The only one, one, one, you are</i> ♫

710
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,580
Mr. Kwon, would you like
to have dinner with me?

711
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,570
I know a restaurant that's secluded.

712
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:00,660
Let's go there.

713
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:04,292
♫ <i>What if this is the love</i> ♫

714
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,520
Why are you doing this?

715
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:13,100
If you keep coming like this,
someone might take a picture,

716
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,090
and you might be caught in a scandal.

717
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:18,090
Like I told you,

718
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,700
- you should forget about...
- I don't want to forget.

719
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,840
I'll decide whether I'll forget or not.

720
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,350
I'll do what I want to do,
and not forget you.

721
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,640
I'll long for you...

722
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,120
and come to see you if I'm worried,
and come see you...

723
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,710
when I miss you.

724
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:56,960
Su Myeong.

725
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:00,770
Is it tough in there?

726
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,510
I'm sorry, Su Myeong.

727
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:07,100
Don't cry, Yun Hee. Don't cry.

728
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,380
Don't cry, Yun Hee.

729
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,430
Su Myeong, all you did was to save me.

730
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,320
Su Myeong.

731
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,300
That day when you came to my house.

732
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:27,870
- Do you remember?
- I stabbed him.

733
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,210
I saved you. I stabbed him.

734
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,470
You're right.

735
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,100
You saved me.

736
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:38,830
But Su Myeong. Don't you remember...

737
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,110
stabbing him two times?

738
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,000
No, Yun Hee. I stabbed him once.

739
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,560
I stabbed him once.

740
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,160
No.

741
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,160
You stabbed him twice.

742
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,060
You killed him.

743
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,370
(Yeo Reum)

744
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,050
Yes, Yeo Reum.

745
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,230
I checked the identity
through the fingerprints.

746
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,750
But something's strange.

747
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:25,830
The fingerprints belong to a dead person.

748
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:27,660
What?

749
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:30,160
A dead person's fingerprints?

750
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,380
Choi Sang Ho.

751
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,640
He was arrested three times
for violence and once for fraud.

752
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,030
Choi Sang Ho?

753
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,100
- He is...
- That's right.

754
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,780
He's Im Yun Hee's ex-husband.

755
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,360
Do you mean her ex-husband is alive?

756
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,670
Yes. The bodies have been switched.

757
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:58,840
The person who died from
a fire wasn't Choi Sang Ho.

758
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:03,340
We've requested an arrest warrant
for Im Yun Hee and Choi Sang Ho.

759
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,260
Let's watch the video.

760
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:12,260
The man you see in this video
is the man who took...

761
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,210
the insurance payout with Im Yun Hee.

762
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:19,830
We were able to obtain his
fingerprints from this glass wall,

763
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:23,000
and after fingerprint analysis,
we found out his identity.

764
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,550
This man is...

765
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:29,040
Im Yun Hee's dead ex-husband, Choi Sang Ho.

766
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:31,120
How could this be possible?

767
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,410
How could a dead man...

768
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,300
be walking on the streets?

769
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:39,410
Choi Sang Ho, who was
supposedly dead due to a fire,

770
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,890
was in fact alive,

771
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:43,970
and he was an accomplice
to Im Yun Hee's crime.

772
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,200
Further, in order to check...

773
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:49,350
the identity of the man who
died in the fire accident,

774
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:55,070
I compared the dental records
of the corpse with...

775
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,510
Im Yun Hee's acquaintances,

776
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,620
and I was able to confirm the
real identity of the corpse.

777
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:06,300
It was Im Yun Hee's father,

778
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,770
who was known to have
been missing, Mr. Im Oh Joong.

779
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,070
Mr. Choi Sang Ho.

780
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,770
Is that your name?

781
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:47,130
You know you're the prime suspect
of the Kim Yeong Tae Case, right?

782
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,170
You have the right to take the Fifth,

783
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,870
but if you don't say anything,
you will take the full blame...

784
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,660
for everything.

785
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,790
Im Yun Hee is claiming...

786
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,050
you're the one who is solely
responsible for this crime.

787
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,900
No, that brat...

788
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,010
That brat made me do it. I'm a victim too.

789
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:15,060
Then, shall we begin with
the Kim Yeong Tae Murder Case?

790
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,710
Tell me what happened.

791
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:21,610
Yun Hee!

792
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,550
One week before the incident,

793
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,770
Yun Hee kept calling Park Su Myeong
to her house for a delivery.

794
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:28,940
Thank you for coming again.

795
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,130
She showed herself after being assaulted,

796
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,460
and brainwashed him with the same words.

797
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,830
I wish...

798
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,880
someone would kill him for me.

799
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,580
That jerk!

800
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,250
She kept saying she wished
someone could kill him for her.

801
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,340
Su Myeong.

802
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,350
Su Myeong, snap back into it.

803
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,500
- Yun Hee.
- Listen to me carefully.

804
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,070
Today, you weren't here.

805
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,290
You didn't see anything...

806
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:08,560
and didn't do anything, okay?

807
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:10,870
Don't tell anyone about this.

808
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,630
Can you promise me?

809
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,170
- Yes.
- Okay?

810
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:18,320
Go. Go now.

811
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,920
It's over. Come out.

812
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:46,900
What are you doing?

813
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,880
If you used him to kill him,
you should call the police.

814
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,060
Are you mad?

815
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,740
The police will suspect me too then.

816
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,420
Don't you know I'll become a
suspect if I'm at the scene?

817
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,250
First, I'll confess...

818
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,960
and when they find out
he's the real culprit later,

819
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,530
I'll receive sympathy...

820
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,660
and get rid of any suspicions
that this was insurance fraud.

821
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,520
We're done here, so get lost.

822
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,700
I called you just in case,
but I didn't need you.

823
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:13,190
Okay.

824
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:31,980
Give it to me.

825
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,500
I'll take care of this, so don't
come near here from now on.

826
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,120
Don't call me either.

827
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,910
Im Yun Hee, who was on trial
for the murder of her husband,

828
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:54,720
has been arrested for
conspiracy to commit murder...

829
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,480
and murder by the prosecution.

830
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,690
Ms. Im schemed with her
former husband, and conspired to...

831
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:01,410
murder her ex-husband Kim Yeong Tae.

832
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:04,450
She also murdered her father and
disguised it as a fire accident.

833
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,460
Afterwards, she made the corpse
look like her ex-husband's,

834
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,300
and illegally received the insurance
payout of her father and ex-husband.

835
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,470
Okay.

836
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,160
So her father wasn't missing,
but murdered...

837
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,740
and her ex-husband
didn't die from a fire...

838
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:19,610
but they disguised the corpse of
her father to look like his, right?

839
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:22,710
That's how they received the
insurance payout for two people.

840
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,180
They used up all that money on gambling,

841
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,460
and they approached another man
and killed him for more money.

842
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,980
How could a human being
commit such an atrocity?

843
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,120
Anyway, it's been revealed that
Im Yun Hee is the worst evil ever,

844
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,780
and I'm so glad.

845
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,790
Mr. Kwon, who exposed
the truth became a star.

846
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,790
Tell me about it.
Mr. Kwon eventually succeeded.

847
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,030
Wait. Where is Mr. Yeon?

848
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,170
He's busy doing interviews over the phone.

849
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,630
Interviews?

850
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,780
Yes, I am...

851
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,290
I'm Kwon Jung Rok's spiritual
leader and role model.

852
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,980
I'm Yeon Joon Gyu,
the CEO of Always Law Firm.

853
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,170
There we go.

854
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,950
Oh, yes. Kwon Jung Rok...

855
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,860
is an excellent attorney and colleague...

856
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,900
who's doing a great job in
following my footsteps...

857
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,530
of righteousness and honesty.

858
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,750
By having taken this case,

859
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,400
it shows that Kwon Jung Rok fully
understands our firm's motto.

860
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,750
And that personally makes
me feel very proud of him.

861
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,910
The motto of Always Law Firm is...

862
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,940
"Pursue the truth and achieve justice."

863
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:38,190
And of course, I was the one
who came up with that motto.

864
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,120
Oh, is this all you need?

865
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,860
Well, I still have a lot more
I'd like to say.

866
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,030
Are you not curious about
my childhood background...

867
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:50,730
and how I was able to become
such a magnificent CEO?

868
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,970
What about my ideal type of woman
or my future plans to appear on TV?

869
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,890
Hello? Hello?

870
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,030
Why did he hang up?

871
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,330
I don't understand.

872
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,000
I should call him again.

873
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,580
(Record of evidence)

874
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,850
Jung Rok, we should drink
on a day like this.

875
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,910
What do you want to eat?
I'll buy you anything.

876
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,860
Rib eye? Lobster? Perch?

877
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:22,130
Corn dogs? Just tell me.
I'll buy you everything you want.

878
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,220
Maybe next time. I'm a little tired today.

879
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,140
Yes, I guess you should
go home and get some rest.

880
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,320
You haven't slept for days.

881
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,540
Then let's take a rain check...

882
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,070
and get wasted next time.

883
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,400
I'll see you.

884
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:57,100
By the way, can I ask you something?

885
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,990
You refused to go to the company dinner...

886
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:02,320
because you were tired.

887
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:06,440
So why did you ask me
to drink soju with you?

888
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,230
I just wanted...

889
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:15,180
to drink with you alone today.

890

♫ <i>I wish everything would just stop</i> ♫

891
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,170
Mr. Kwon, we should drink tonight.

892
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,860
How about we meet at the pork
back-bone stew restaurant...

893
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,720
that we went to after we
won a case last time?

894
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,780
♫ <i>Those words won't leave my head all day</i> ♫

895
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,810
Two servings of pork
back-bone stew, please.

896
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:41,900
Okay.

897
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,710
♫ <i>I'm just smiling, not knowing anything</i> ♫

898
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,670
Welcome.

♫ <i>In the photographs in my hands</i> ♫

903
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,700
Can we talk outside for a while?

♫ <i>You're just smiling</i> ♫

905

♫ <i>But you're never coming back</i> ♫

906

♫ <i>You're never coming back</i> ♫

907
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,070
Ms. Oh, why are you doing this?

908
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,400
What did I do?

909
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,200
You know we shouldn't be meeting
each other like this anymore.

910
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:45,050
No, not really.
I don't get why we can't meet.

911
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,930
I heard...

912
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,670
why you decided...

913
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,900
to break up with me.

914
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:02,400
I had to go through a lot of things,

915
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,320
but you were the reason why I
managed to overcome everything.

916
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,930
And in that process, I became stronger.

917
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,070
I'm more scared about losing you...

918
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,590
than losing an opportunity
in this industry...

919
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:23,930
because of a scandal.

920
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,270
So...

921
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:32,110
if you really care about me,

922
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,210
please stay by my side.

923
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,750
Let's start over again.

924
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:01,570
Are you still not going to hold onto me?

925
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,210
If you let go now,

926
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,390
we'll never get to see each other again.

927
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,270
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

928
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,310
I love you.

An advisory counsel?

950

- Is no one interested?
- I'll do it.

951
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,080
What's your problem? You're so annoying.

952
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,140
In order to protect you,

953
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:18,890
we should be more careful from now on...

954
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:20,540
so that no one finds out
about our relationship.

955
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,720
We should be more careful from now on?

956
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,430
I get that he's your manager,
but he should respect your privacy.

957
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,730
Yun Seo, I need to use your bathroom.

961
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,720
I forgot about the kissing scene
in episode four.

962
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,550
I think the two might start dating
because of this drama.

963
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,060
I'll do my best...

964
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:44,500
- to help you practice.
- Goodness.

965
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,030
