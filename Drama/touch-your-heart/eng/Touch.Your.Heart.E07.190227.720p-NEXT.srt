1
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,940
I'm worried.

2
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,310
Just as much as you worry
about me and console me,

3
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,540
I wish...

4
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,350
to do so for you too.

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,100
Does that mean...

6
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,880
I've become a bit more...

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,630
special to you...

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,650
than before?

9
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,360
Yes.

10
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,580
Yes, this is Kwon Jung Rok.

11
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,010
Hello, Judge.

12
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,820
You don't need to send me
the sentencing report.

13
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,410
Okay.

14
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,410
Anyway, thank you for
working hard to help me...

15
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,590
win the difficult trial.

16
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,770
You should get some rest for tomorrow.

17
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,840
Wait.

18
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,480
"For tomorrow"?

19
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,130
Is tomorrow a special day or something?

20
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,550
Is he going to ask me out?

21
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,760
He probably would've asked me out
if he didn't get a call earlier.

22
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,680
My gosh!

23
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,170
Goodness me. He'll ask me out tomorrow.

24
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,420
(Episode 7)

25
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,090
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

26
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,590
- Hello.
- Good morning.

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,700
Good morning!

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,330
Did something good happen to her?

29
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,090
I don't know.

30
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,000
Did he go somewhere?

31
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,630
What's with the flowers?

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,250
Are they from Mr. Kwon?

33
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,780
"The cold that didn't seem to
want to back off finally did,"

34
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,640
"and warm spring days are drawing near."

35
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,190
Gosh, can he be any more romantic?

36
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,690
"Although it's nothing grand,"

37
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,550
"the gift was chosen from the heart,"

38
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,730
"so I hope you willingly accept it."

39
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,100
What do you mean it's nothing grand?
It couldn't be more precious!

40
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,590
"The battle was tough,
but you never gave up."

41
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,980
"That's why she wasn't made a scapegoat."

42
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,930
A scapegoat?

43
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,530
"Thank you for taking Im Yun Hee's case."

44
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,830
"From President Lee Yeong Ok of
the Korean Women's Association."

45
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,460
Oh, you're here.

46
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,890
- These...
- The flowers?

47
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,760
The Korean Women's Association sent them.

48
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,270
I don't like flowers,

49
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,160
so I put them here for you to enjoy.

50
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,230
I see.

51
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,600
Mr. Yeon's calling everyone
to go over their cases.

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,900
All right.

53
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,870
Let's get ready and head out.

54
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,700
Before we begin the briefing,

55
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,350
let's give a round of applause to Mr. Kwon,

56
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,900
the hope...

57
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,150
and gem of our law firm,

58
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,040
for successfully winning
the Im Yun Hee Case.

59
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,150
That's enough, everyone. Thank you.

60
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,250
There's no reason to be embarrassed.

61
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,950
Although, that's what
makes you so charming.

62
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,560
Then let's get on with the briefing.

63
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,040
Our law firm is taking
on the Sangji-dong Case.

64
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,860
Since it's a big case,

65
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,490
Mr. Kwon will brief us
and we'll share ideas.

66
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,740
Sure.

67
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,560
Before I begin, let me show
you the defendant's photo.

68
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,730
What's going on?

69
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,460
Why is there a photo of Yun Seo,
the universe's goddess?

70
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,370
What crime did she commit?

71
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,530
Her crimes?

72
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,620
She committed theft by stealing my heart.

73
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,470
She committed assault by
blinding me with her beauty.

74
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,390
She even committed attempted murder
by making me break my heart...

75
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,410
if I don't see her even for a day.

76
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,820
I argue Jin Sim receives
life imprisonment...

77
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,680
and be with me for the rest of my life.

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,320
Jin Sim,

79
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,200
will you go out with me?

80
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,220
Take me. Put me in cuffs.
Take me right away!

81
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,430
Ms. Oh?

82
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,010
What are you doing?

83
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,400
What is this?

84
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,670
(Sangji-dong Parricide Case)

85
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,070
Him! He will...

86
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,480
be imprisoned for sure.

87
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,510
Mr. Kwon will do his best...

88
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
to make that happen.

89
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,230
Ms. Oh, you can be quite silly at times.

90
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,550
That's what makes her so charming.

91
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,850
Her looks are stunning,
but she has a whimsical side.

92
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,240
Thank you for thinking of me so nicely.

93
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,010
Anyway, he's a bad man.

94
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,270
Let me begin the briefing then.

95
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,770
Are you insane? What's wrong with you?

96
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,350
Get a grip on yourself.

97
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,540
You're an actress,
so wait for him elegantly.

98
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,840
Be hard-to-get.

99
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,650
It's already 6pm.

100
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,410
Gosh, is that a heart?

101
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,780
Is he sending it my way?

102
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,590
He's telling me how he feels
by small, trivial gestures.

103
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,610
Was he just wiping the glass?

104
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,640
I've been too busy to notice,
but the office is a mess.

105
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,860
I guess I should complain to the cleaners.

106
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,220
I'll do that, so don't worry about it.

107
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,170
Good night.

108
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,440
Wait.

109
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,690
Is that it?

110
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,100
Don't you have anything else to say?

111
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,190
- Sorry?
- Whatever.

112
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,390
It's nothing.

113
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,010
I'll head home first then.

114
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,010
I dolled myself up today for nothing.

115
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,600
You're doing it again.

116
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,700
You promised yourself that you'd wait.

117
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,160
Now, turn on the hard-to-get actress mode.

118
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,660
♫ <i>One step at a time</i> ♫

119
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,720
I'll nonchalantly wait for him.

120
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,550
♫ <i>Too much for your mind </i> ♫

121
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,110
♫ <i>I was only being kind</i> ♫

122
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,940
♫ <i>There's no need to analyze</i> ♫

123
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,440
Nonchalantly.

124
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,630
(Secretary Oh Jin Sim)

125
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,380
- Jin Sim...
- I can't wait.

126
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,300
- Sorry?
- I can't wait any longer.

127
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
I won't play hard-to-get.

128
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,080
I'd rather just say
everything that's on my mind.

129
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,040
I've been going insane...

130
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,580
waiting for you to ask me out.

131
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,120
- What do you mean?
- Do you not want to?

132
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
Okay, fine.

133
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,580
I'll make the first move then.

134
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,610
My gosh. Now that I have to say it...

135
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,690
Hold on a second.

136
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,960
I like you, Mr. Kwon.

137
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,830
Do you remember what I told you?

138
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,440
I said I had...

139
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,030
something to tell you.

140
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,090
I couldn't say it now,

141
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,030
but I promised to tell you someday.

142
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,150
Do you remember that?

143
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,960
My gosh.

144
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,040
Anyway, that's...

145
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,200
I love you.

146
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,700
You see...

147
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,690
You have taken a spot...

148
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,880
in my heart.

149
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,470
I mean...

150
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,140
In my heart that is clean, clear, and pure,

151
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,530
you came and made a place for yourself.

152
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,560
That's what I mean.

153
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,990
That's why...

154
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,890
when you said last night...

155
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,950
that I've become a bit more special to you,

156
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,510
I felt so happy.

157
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,670
And I waited all day for
you to say something else.

158
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,680
But how could you humiliate me like that?

159
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,050
I'm Oh Yun Seo!

160
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,620
- Mr. Kwon, you're so mean!
- Jin Sim.

161
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,580
Jin Sim?

162
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,140
What are you doing?

163
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,980
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

164
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,730
Is the case you're working
on giving you trouble again?

165
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,910
Forget it.

166
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,510
What's the matter with him? Gosh.

167
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,230
I'll state the facts only,
so listen carefully.

168
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,580
A man started to develop
feelings for a woman.

169
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,450
So he told her,
"You've become a special person to me."

170
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,790
This is what he said.

171
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,100
The man thought that would be enough.

172
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,880
He thought they could take things slow,
since they liked each other.

173
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,820
But the woman had different thoughts.

174
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,120
She wanted him to make the next move,
but when he didn't,

175
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,240
she got extremely angry.

176
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,260
Is this really the man's fault?

177
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,600
Is this really about a case? Not you?

178
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,750
It's not about me!

179
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,350
- It's about my client.
- You've got to be kidding me.

180
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,620
Did you set up a dating
agency or something?

181
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,800
My goodness.

182
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,880
Forget it. It's no use asking you.

183
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,010
It's not the man's fault.

184
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,080
What you said isn't actually wrong.

185
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,520
- Right?
- Still,

186
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,790
I'd like to side with the woman.

187
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,960
Who on earth takes dating so
logically like you just said?

188
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,300
You normally get to know
each other as you date.

189
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,100
The man already made the first move.

190
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,990
He said something crucial,
by saying she was special.

191
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,200
But if he cuts her off suddenly,
who would like that?

192
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,860
You still don't understand?

193
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,280
Listen. Let's say you're at a trial.

194
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,930
"Your Honor, considering all
the circumstantial evidence,"

195
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,260
"the defendant did not behave
like that purposely, and..."

196
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,790
"his alibi on the day of the
incident has been confirmed."

197
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,940
"Therefore, I..."

198
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,320
How would you feel if the
trial ends like this?

199
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,590
- It feels uncomfortable.
- Right?

200
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,240
You said all the important words,
but there is no conclusion.

201
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,450
That's what you...

202
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,110
No, your client has done...

203
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,810
to that woman. Okay?

204
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,630
Jin Sim, I'm sorry.

205
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,580
I thought we were in the stage
of getting to know each other.

206
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,990
Jin Sim, I was inconsiderate.

207
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,080
Please forgive me, and be my...

208
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,540
Jin Sim, let's meet tomorrow and talk.

209
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,530
Yes, what is it this time?

210
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,610
Well, there's something you
should tell your client.

211
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,710
He should ask her out soon,

212
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,340
and prepare flowers,
or something small and shiny.

213
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,960
He should prepare anything that she likes.

214
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
- What?
- Going empty-handed...

215
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,240
when he asks her out...

216
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,310
is like going to a trial
without any evidence.

217
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,650
I know I've never met that client of yours,

218
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,710
but I'm just giving advice since
he seems really bad at dating.

219
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,530
- Good luck then.
- I'll make sure to tell him that.

220
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,800
What happened?

221
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,990
Did I fall asleep here?

222
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,220
(Jin Sim, let's meet tomorrow and talk.)

223
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,910
Meet and talk?

224
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,210
About what?

225
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,240
Did I make a mistake or something?

226
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,570
I've been going insane waiting
for you to ask me out.

227
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,660
In my heart that is
clean, clear, and pure...

228
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,000
I like you, Mr. Kwon.

229
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,040
I felt so happy.

230
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,050
Did you faint out of happiness?

231
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,270
Mr. Kwon, you're so mean!

232
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,920
What will he say to me?

233
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,080
"I really hate women like you."

234
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,490
"Let's never see each other again?"

235
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,800
Yun Seo, are you still sleeping?

236
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,070
Hey, you were awake.

237
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,200
Hyuk Joon, get me a white envelope.

238
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,470
A white envelope? Is it a
money gift for a wedding?

239
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,670
No. I won't put money in it.

240
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,050
- Then what?
- My letter of resignation.

241
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,210
- Letter of resignation?
- I won't go to work now.

242
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,340
No, I can't go now.

243
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,740
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

244
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,480
Mr. Kwon, I'm glad to see you.

245
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,110
My cousin just called me.

246
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,020
He said Yun Seo can't
make it to work today.

247
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,410
- What?
- Why?

248
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,010
Is she sick?

249
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,920
I don't think so. I said...

250
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,590
I'd bring some flowers and
porridge and go see her,

251
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,560
and he said she's not sick,
but had a personal matter.

252
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,060
He tried to avoid talking about it.
I guess there's another reason.

253
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,640
Maybe she just wants to take a day off.

254
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,680
No way.

255
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,380
Yun Seo didn't seem like such
an irresponsible person.

256
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,170
That's strange, Ms. Yang.
You're finally taking Yun Seo's side.

257
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,030
I have to admit,

258
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,280
she did work very hard all this time.

259
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,690
She's right. At first,

260
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,880
I also had a bias against her
since she's a celebrity,

261
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,640
but during Yoon Ha's case last time...

262
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,490
and the recent Im Yun Hee Case,
she seems like a decent person.

263
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,180
She seems like a scarecrow
standing silently...

264
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,750
but sincerely in the
middle of a field in fall.

265
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,120
A scarecrow seems a bit strange.

266
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,360
Anyway, I wonder what's wrong.

267
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,390
Mr. Kwon, what's wrong with your face?

268
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,410
Did something happen
between you and Yun Seo?

269
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,130
- Nothing happened.
- I don't think so.

270
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,440
Your face is setting off all
these signals right now.

271
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,910
Was she stressed out because
you made her work so much?

272
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,250
Come on.

273
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,880
- It's nothing like that.
- No?

274
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,200
If it's not about work,
is it a relationship matter?

275
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,650
What if it turns out these two
were dating or something?

276
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,120
Come on, it's just a joke.
You're not even amused.

277
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,450
He's very talented, but horrible
when it comes to humor.

278
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,900
He's just the worst.

279
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,750
The caller you have dialed is
not answering the phone...

280
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,530
(Oh Jin Sim's Personal Information)

281
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,320
He should prepare flowers,
or something small and shiny.

282
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,460
He should prepare anything that she likes.

283
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,850
(Things Oh Jin Sim likes...)

284
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,550
(Things Oh Yun Seo likes)

285
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
(Oh Yun Seo's favorite rib eye)

286
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,480
Rib eye?

287
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,710
It's not even a holiday.

288
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,410
(Oh Yun Seo's ideal type of man)

289
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,530
It's time to have a sincere talk
at today's star's favorite bar.

290
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,560
Let me introduce today's
star of our talk show.

291
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,260
Don't be shocked.

292
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,200
She's Oh Yun Seo, the most beautiful
woman in the universe. Hello.

293
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,200
Hello, everyone.

294
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,640
(My goddess, your goddess,
the universe's goddess, Oh Yun Seo)

295
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,670
Once again, it's an honor to see you.

296
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,370
But I have to say,
this is quite unexpected.

297
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,120
I feel like you'd prefer to
eat at fancy restaurants.

298
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,230
But we're at a chicken feet restaurant.

299
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,560
I really like the chicken
feet they sell here.

300
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,780
It's near my house,
so I sometimes take it to go.

301
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,820
And they taste even better if you
eat them when you're feeling down.

302
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,830
- Chicken feet?
- Yun Seo, can you tell me...

303
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,630
your ideal type of man?

304
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,460
I have a feeling that you'll like...

305
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,750
competent guys who are really good-looking.

306
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,770
No, I don't care too much about looks.

307
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,750
I'd rather be with a guy...

308
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,650
who knows how to touch my heart.

309
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,980
For example, a guy who gives me
handwritten letters.

310
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,150
Handwritten letters?

311
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,320
It'd be nice if he asked me out
with a handwritten letter.

312
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,490
How am I supposed to...

313
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,330
Doesn't that sound so romantic?

314
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,750
Hello.

315
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,530
Gosh, she's driving me crazy.

316
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,170
Why won't she go to work?
What's her reason?

317
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,890
I'm not sure. She won't tell me why.

318
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,870
She won't come out from her room.
What should I do?

319
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,880
Writer Lee said she'll
give Yun Seo a chance...

320
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,790
only if she works at a law firm
for at least three months.

321
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,280
But it really doesn't seem
like Yun Seo will give in.

322
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,360
And it's not like we can
find another law firm...

323
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,910
that can keep a secret
as good as this place.

324
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,440
Don't worry. I'm here.

325
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,580
I'll do whatever I can to
make her go back to work.

326
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm not sure if you'll be able to do that.

327
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,970
Hey, I'm Yeon Jun Seok.

328
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,870
I'm Yeon Jun Seok, the president
of Yeon Entertainment.

329
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,270
Have you seen anyone that's better
than me at handling Yun Seo?

330
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,290
No, sir.

331
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,840
Trust me.

332
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,880
- It's this way.
- Oh, really? Okay.

333
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,070
Yun Seo.

334
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,330
Yun Seo, Mr. Yeon's here.

335
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,930
I heard...

336
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,840
you said you want to stop
working at the law firm.

337
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,470
Yes. I'm not going to work there anymore.

338
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,740
No, I can't work there anymore.

339
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,030
Okay, good thinking.

340
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,660
You should quit.

341
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,180
- What?
- Mr. Yeon.

342
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,580
Why are you both so startled?

343
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,560
If she doesn't want to
work there, she shouldn't.

344
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,950
I get that she's doing this to be
able to act more realistically.

345
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,390
But she's my goddess, your goddess,
and the universe's goddess.

346
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,560
It obviously won't be easy
for someone like her...

347
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,370
to work at a law firm for three months.

348
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,390
To be honest, I never got
a good night's sleep...

349
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,370
after you started working there.

350
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,980
I was always worried about how
difficult it must be for you.

351
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,230
So you should stop working there.
Just quit.

352
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,770
Then she won't get to play the
attorney in Writer Lee's drama.

353
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,200
Is that so important?

354
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,270
She can play the role of a
jobless woman later on.

355
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,680
Once she quits the law firm...

356
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,520
and fails to make a comeback
with Writer Lee's drama,

357
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,820
she'll end up having to
rest at home for years.

358
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,930
Then I'm sure she'll be able
to play the role of a bored,

359
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
jobless woman better than anyone.

360
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,340
She'll seem bored all the time.

361
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,520
Don't you agree, Yun Seo?

362
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,430
- Mr. Yeon.
- Yes?

363
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,810
Do you suddenly want to go back to work?

364
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,570
No, not exactly. Right now,

365
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,710
I just want to kick you out.

366
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,550
I'm already really annoyed right now.

367
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,910
Why are you trying to threaten me?
Did you think I wouldn't catch that?

368
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,820
Yun Seo, you've become quick-witted
after all the socializing.

369
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,670
And I've become a really
angry person as well.

370
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,410
My gosh.

371
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,840
- Gosh.
- Yun Seo, where are you going?

372
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,800
I'm going out for some fresh air!

373
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,840
Wait for me. I'll give you a ride!

374
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,540
Hey, don't you know her?
She's too stubborn to listen.

375
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,440
Let's just see what happens.

376
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,570
Bring me some beer from the fridge.

377
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,730
My gosh!

378
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,810
A teddy bear.

379
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,800
She likes pink.

380
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,930
Pink.

381
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,240
Jin Sim, this letter is for you.

382
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,610
I, Kwon Jung Rok,
saw you for the very first time...

383
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,020
on February 6, 2019
at the secretary's office...

384
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,570
of Always Law Firm that's
located in Seocho-gu, Seoul.

385
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,670
As we interacted with each other
many times through work...

386
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,000
and ate about six meals together,

387
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,530
I realized that your feelings weren't fake.

388
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,580
I realized that they were actually sincere.

389
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,170
Therefore, I, Kwon Jung Rok,
request you, Oh Jin Sim,

390
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,270
to officially go out with me.

391
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,840
And I hope you give me your approval.

392
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,010
I might as well write a letter to a judge.

393
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,300
(Suspect of the Husband Murder
Case Gets Reversed in Court)

394
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,420
(Suspect of the Husband Murder
Case Gets Reversed in Court)

395
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,160
Prosecutor Yoo, let's go eat.

396
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,940
I'm not hungry.

397
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,980
Okay, then. We'll just go without you.

398
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,680
Okay.

399
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,060
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

400
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,640
You're eating late.

401
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,940
Yes.

402
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,110
By the way, where's Prosecutor Yoo?

403
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,510
Is she having lunch outside?

404
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,690
No, she's in her office.
She doesn't have an appetite.

405
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,320
I think she's really stressed
because of Im Yun Hee Case.

406
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,640
She rarely eats these days.

407
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,190
Really?

408
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,520
(Chicken feet)

409
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,190
Let's cheer me up.

410
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,590
Welcome.

411
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,200
One serving of chicken feet to go, please.

412
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,300
Long time no see.

413
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,750
One serving of chicken feet to go.

414
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,260
- I want them spicy.
- Make them really spicy.

415
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,680
We have a regular customer.

416
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,450
Jin Sim?

417
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,880
No, I'm not Oh Jin Sim.

418
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,510
Wait...

419
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,580
Jin Sim.

420
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,940
- Jin Sim, let's talk.
- My gosh.

421
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,090
Jin Sim.

422
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,340
Gosh, why did you have to run after me?

423
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,500
Well...

424
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,980
Can we talk?

425
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,180
Why did you run away?

426
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,220
And why didn't you come to work today?

427
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,730
Because I was too embarrassed to face you.

428
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,110
You were embarrassed?

429
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,410
Of course, I was embarrassed.

430
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,280
I got drunk and asked you out.

431
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,900
I'm the one who did a lousy
job of asking you out.

432
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,140
Pardon?

433
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,540
I made you wait...

434
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,700
by expressing myself very ambiguously.

435
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,070
And that even ended up
making you feel embarrassed.

436
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,300
So I'm the one who did a
lousy job of asking you out.

437
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,230
Mr. Kwon.

438
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,970
So although it may be late,

439
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,060
I'd like to ask you out properly this time.

440
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,760
What's this?

441
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,200
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I searched the web a little.

442
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,060
And I saw a video clip of
an interview you did...

443
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,330
at your favorite chicken feet restaurant.

444
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,300
You like its chicken feet dish...

445
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,340
and want to be asked out
via a handwritten letter.

446
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,670
Then is this...

447
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,610
I didn't get you the chicken feet,
but please accept at least that.

448
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,050
Are you going to read it in front of me?

449
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,250
Yes, of course.

450
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,330
- The curiosity's killing me.
- But...

451
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,510
Then I'll wait for you in the car.

452
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,320
(Let's date.)

453
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,360
Yes, I'd love to!

454
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,940
Let's date!

455
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:55,820
♫ <i>My one</i> ♫

456
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,260
♫ <i>The only one, one, one, you are</i> ♫

457
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,860
♫ <i>If this is love, love</i> ♫

458
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,370
Thank you for accepting my proposal.

459
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,140
Thank you for finally telling me.

460
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,610
♫ <i>What should I do? What if this is the love?</i> ♫

461
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,910
You'll wear it out.

462
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,280
I'll read it until I do then.

463
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,920
Hold on a second.

464
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,230
I'll go and get changed.

465
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,660
We'll head to the office together.

466
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,210
- You should get some rest today.
- Why?

467
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,280
You have cases backed up due
to the Im Yun Hee Case.

468
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,620
You'll be up to your neck with work.

469
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,380
It'll be harder without me around.

470
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,810
You knew that, but you chose
not to come to work today?

471
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm grateful, but you should rest
since you already have the day off.

472
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,180
I won't be at the office
anyway in the afternoon.

473
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,240
Why not?

474
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,840
I'm heading to the court,
the prosecutor's office,

475
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,280
and then to meet a client.

476
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,870
I'll be done at around 7pm.

477
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,360
- What do you say?
- Wait. What?

478
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,960
We should go on a date...

479
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,210
since it's our first day as a couple.

480
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,070
Why are you laughing?

481
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,030
Just.

482
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,320
You saying "date" and
"the first day as a couple"...

483
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,950
is just so pretty.

484
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:44,260
Then I'll pick you up at around 7pm.

485
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,450
All right.

486
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,960
See you later then.

487
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,870
The defendant turned out to be a victim.

488
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,340
We're being pressured to reveal
if there was any coercion.

489
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,110
What are you going to do?

490
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,590
She wasn't coerced.

491
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,320
How could you not investigate and
blindly believe her confession?

492
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,600
- I'm sorry.
- You're dismissed.

493
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,080
The case should've gone to Prosecutor Im.

494
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,460
I heard the news.
Your suspect became the victim.

495
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,140
That really was a twist.

496
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,670
- Please don't.
- Well,

497
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,160
you're just like that too.
You're a bundle of twists.

498
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,960
You were belittling your seniors,

499
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,090
so I thought you must have a great talent.

500
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Instead, you're sloppy and ditsy.

501
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,570
Why did you only arrest
the innocent Ms. Im?

502
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,910
What do you mean she's innocent?

503
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,950
She may not have killed him herself,

504
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,340
but she either helped or at
least did nothing to stop it.

505
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,290
She actively covered up for Park Su Myeong.

506
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,480
You humiliated this office,

507
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,690
but you're still running your mouth.

508
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,580
I think it's best if I was
present during the questioning.

509
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
Yes, of course.

510
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,250
I'll schedule it with the
prosecutor and get back to you.

511
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,280
Sure.

512
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,550
Yeo Reum.

513
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,050
Hi.

514
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,590
Are you all right?

515
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,830
You seem pale.

516
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,880
How did you know that
Park Su Myeong was at the scene?

517
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,900
You caught on to it, but why didn't I?

518
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,530
I know you're not to blame,

519
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,680
so we'll talk some other time.

520
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,970
Yeo Reum!

521
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,560
(Hankuk Medical Center)

522
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,340
She has acute gastritis
brought on by stress,

523
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,040
and lethargy led to a fever.

524
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,490
She'll be fine once her temperature drops.

525
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,340
The case starts the day
after tomorrow, right?

526
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,980
Can I see the files?

527
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,000
When will we question the suspect again?

528
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,040
- That will be conducted tomorrow.
- I see.

529
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,400
The person you have reached is unavailable.

530
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,110
Please leave a message...

531
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,240
(Attorney Kwon Jung Rok)

532
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,930
Yes, Mr. Kwon. Are you here?

533
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,630
I'm sorry, but we'll have
to take a rain check.

534
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,490
Why?

535
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:53,010
Prosecutor Yoo fell ill,
so I brought her to the ER.

536
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,210
What happened?

537
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,830
She has gastritis and a fever.

538
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,780
I called another friend
to look after her today,

539
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,770
but I still have to meet with the client.

540
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,950
I'm afraid we won't be able to meet today.

541
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,940
I see. There's no other way, I guess.

542
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,690
All right.

543
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,720
Sure.

544
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,480
What happened?

545
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,220
You fainted after talking to Jung Rok.

546
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,170
Don't you remember?

547
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,100
What are you doing here though?

548
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,630
You finished your fluids,

549
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,330
and the doctor said you can leave.

550
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,120
- I asked what you were doing here.
- Is that really important?

551
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,870
I could ask you the same thing too.

552
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,720
You can't be this sensitive.

553
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,860
We'll keep having trials,

554
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,830
and some we'll lose.

555
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,150
You can't survive if you
let them get to you.

556
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,610
That's who I am though.

557
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,870
I hate it.

558
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,940
I hate that I crumbled after...

559
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,080
losing a trial.

560
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,700
Also, I hate that you're...

561
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,350
seeing me like this.

562
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,510
I hate it too.

563
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,030
I hate that this is how we are now.

564
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,730
Back then,

565
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,250
you used to be honest in front of me.

566
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,840
You'd laugh when you want...

567
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,180
and cry when you want.

568
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,140
I wonder if he's still busy.

569
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,970
How could he not call me even once?

570
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,040
He called. It's him.

571
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,600
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

572
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,460
Did I wake you up by any chance?

573
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,700
No.

574
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,750
Are you going home now?

575
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,030
Yes. My meeting with the client
took longer than I thought.

576
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,860
You must've already had dinner by now.

577
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,050
Do you want to go for some tea?

578
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,720
Tea?

579
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,480
It's okay.

580
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,850
You must've had a long day,
so you should go get some rest.

581
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,940
I'll see you tomorrow.

582
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,640
But Mr. Kwon...

583
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,370
Yes? What is it?

584
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,360
I don't want today to be
our first day as a couple.

585
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,450
- Sorry?
- Just listen to me.

586
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,280
Who lets their first day pass
by so meaninglessly like this?

587
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,350
So why don't we make...

588
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,730
tomorrow our first day as a couple?

589
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,340
All right.

590
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,700
Then tomorrow will be our first day.

591
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,910
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise today.

592
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,630
Don't worry about it.

593
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,270
Drive safely then. I'll see you tomorrow.

594
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,090
Okay.

595
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,140
Okay. We've talked on the phone,
so that's enough for now.

596
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,420
Alright, let's start dating
properly from tomorrow.

597
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,880
Let's start dating.

598
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,610
What? You want me to go
to Mr. Choi's office?

599
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,730
Well...

600
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,120
Can you do me this favor
for just a couple of days?

601
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,120
The thing is, during this period
right after the holidays,

602
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,300
the divorce rate goes up rapidly.

603
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,130
Shall we call it a peak
season for divorces?

604
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,420
So Mr. Choi has dozens of
divorce cases waiting...

605
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,490
to be processed right now.

606
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:14,490
And Ms. Yang is really caught
up right now helping...

607
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,970
Ms. Dan with the
pharmaceutical company case.

608
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,470
But, the thing is...

609
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,870
if I'm not here, Mr. Kwon
will have a hard time alone.

610
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,150
You just wrapped up the Im Yun Hee Case.

611
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,110
Is there something you have
to take care of urgently?

612
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,260
No, I guess not, at the moment.

613
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,780
- I'll be fine.
- Thank you for understanding.

614
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,350
And since you're the ace here,
can't you manage well on your own?

615
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,120
If that's all, I'll get back to work.

616
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,180
Thank you.

617
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,100
I'll get going too.

618
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:58,090
Thank you for understanding, everyone.

619
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,760
I really have such considerate
employees around me.

620
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,470
Hey, Jun Seok.

621
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,940
Like you asked, I split up
Mr. Kwon and Yun Seo.

622
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,350
Thanks, Joon Gyu.

623
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,320
I'm afraid Yun Seo didn't want to...

624
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,760
go to work yesterday
because of that lawyer.

625
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,110
I heard from her manager, and those two...

626
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,530
had many issues all this time.

627
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:26,830
I heard Yun Seo said she'd crush
Kwon Jung Rok by all means.

628
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,540
Was it that bad?

629
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,270
Anyway, from now on, you should...

630
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,150
recycle... No, split them up.

631
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,680
Don't worry about it.

632
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,200
If it's for Yun Seo's happiness,

633
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,410
I'll make sure those two don't
even talk to each other.

634
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,720
Honey, it's me.

635
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,460
I was wondering if I could
drop by during lunch.

636
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,680
Oh, you're busy.

637
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:58,520
No, it's fine. Have a good day then.

638
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,220
Okay.

639
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:02,760
Ms. Dan.

640
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,900
Did you get a new boyfriend?

641
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,850
Yes, well...

642
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,150
I did get one, but...

643
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,440
But what? Why are you sighing?

644
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,770
- Well...
- Yes.

645
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,390
Forget it. Last time, you told me...

646
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:22,930
I had a chance with that
delivery guy, so I made a move...

647
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,730
and was rejected. Don't you remember?

648
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,520
I made up my mind then.

649
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,830
I will never receive dating
advice from you ever again.

650
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,710
I'm sorry about that time.

651
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:37,250
But there are more couples
that succeeded with my advice.

652
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,140
During "Sandabang", a couple
received counseling from me...

653
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,600
and expressed their feelings truthfully.

654
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,080
And they ended up getting married.

655
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,410
Married?

656
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,680
- They got married?
- Yes.

657
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,980
This is a secret, but my boyfriend is...

658
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,200
the owner of the cafe
that's across the street.

659
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,460
He's chic and handsome like americano,

660
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,260
but his voice is smooth like a latte,

661
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,490
and when he asked me out saying
he always had his eyes on me,

662
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,670
it was sweet like caramel macchiato.

663
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,900
That's so romantic.

664
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,510
So? Why are you sighing?

665
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,240
Well, the problem is...

666
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,690
I feel upset because it feels
like I'm the only one in love.

667
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:18,980
I want to put all things
aside to meet him...

668
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,510
and stay by his side all the time.

669
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,920
But I guess he doesn't feel the same.

670
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,350
Is that so?

671
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:27,510
We were supposed to go on
a date last night too.

672
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,820
But he suddenly said some
coffee beans arrived.

673
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,130
He said he had to roast them,
and canceled our date.

674
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:36,800
Just now, I told him I'd drop
by briefly during lunch,

675
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,150
but he said he's busy squeezing
oranges or something.

676
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,670
I can understand that he's busy,

677
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:48,490
but it seems like I'm always the
one nagging and wanting to meet.

678
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,160
It's so upsetting.

679
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,410
Me too.

680
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,400
- What?
- What?

681
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,490
I mean, if I was in your situation,

682
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,700
I'd feel really upset too.

683
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,730
Yun Seo, you...

684
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,800
are really good at sympathizing
since you're an actress and all.

685
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,970
I thought you were upset too
because you've started dating.

686
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,090
That's totally ridiculous.

687
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,710
Jin Sim, about yesterday's...

688
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,930
Yun Seo, thanks for
volunteering to help me out.

689
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,880
Since I have such high
win rates, my clients...

690
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,810
come to me like moths to a flame.

691
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,860
By the way, this is a table of my schedule.

692
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,940
You can call the clients and
tell them when they can visit.

693
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,410
Okay, I understand.

694
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:08,870
Hold on.

695
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,720
Ms. Hwang Yeon Du who's supposed
to come for counseling at 2pm.

696
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:15,930
It's not the Hwang Yeon Du
that I know, is she?

697
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,720
She probably is.
Wasn't she your rival once?

698
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,480
If you're talking about
the actress, it's her.

699
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,640
Oh, right. You working here
is confidential.

700
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:29,690
Then why don't you step
out briefly later on?

701
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,850
Yes, I guess I can do that.

702
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,880
But is she...

703
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,140
getting divorced?

704
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,450
Seeing that she's coming
to me for counseling,

705
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,970
I believe so.

706
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,850
Why? Why is she getting divorced?

707
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,580
Article 26 of the Attorneys-at-Law Act.

708
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,990
"The attorney shall not disclose
any confidential information..."

709
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,670
"relating to the
representation of a client."

710
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,570
This is quite upsetting.

711
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,500
I thought she was living
happily after getting married.

712
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,610
Were you close to her?

713
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,600
Close...

714
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,100
my foot.

715
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,690
She was like my arch enemy.

716
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,100
Oh Yun Seo.

717
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,150
What on earth? Why did you get so tall?

718
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,190
How high are your heels?

719
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,690
- 7cm.
- Stylist.

720
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,280
- Yes?
- Bring me 10cm heels.

721
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,780
No, bring me 20cm heels!

722
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,120
Okay.

723
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,210
- I love you.
- I love you too.

724
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,570
Sir.

725
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,330
Use more reflectors for my scene.

726
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,070
2. No, 3 times more.

727
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,720
That's the kind of person she was.

728
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:19,350
She had to be better than me,
and she had to get treated well.

729
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,580
From the very beginning of her
career until she retired,

730
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,460
she really made things difficult for me.

731
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,670
I suddenly don't want
to defend her anymore.

732
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,060
Should I not take this case?

733
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:33,960
That's not right.

734
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,100
This is your work.

735
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,800
And you're a professional.

736
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,230
Then I'll just talk to her like a robot...

737
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,900
that has no feelings.

738
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,870
Are you here for counseling?

739
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,390
Things must be very difficult for you.

740
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,680
I'll even defend her in court...

741
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,790
like the AlphaGo that has no soul.

742
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,400
Watch carefully.

743
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,930
My client...

744
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,740
holds no responsibility...

745
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,410
for what happened.

746
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,370
My gosh, it's 1:30pm already.

747
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,640
- I might run into her.
- That can't happen.

748
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,840
You should go.

749
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,610
I'll call you once I'm done talking to her.

750
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,310
- Okay, please let me know.
- Sure.

751
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,980
I'm here to meet my attorney.

752
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,090
- Did you make a reservation?
- Of course.

753
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,030
What are you doing?

754
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,020
There's a fellow actress outside.

755
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,410
You know that no one's supposed
to find out that I work here.

756
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,920
Thank you.

757
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,070
Then I'll pull down the blinds.

758
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,600
You can stay in my office.

759
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,690
No, she has the eyes of a falcon.

760
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,640
It'd be better for me to just go outside.

761
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,360
Hello, my name is Hwang Yeon Du.

762
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,330
Hello, my name is Choi Yun Hyuk.

763
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,360
- Please take a seat.
- Okay.

764
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,450
I'm sure you already know me
since I used to be so famous.

765
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,200
My goodness.

766
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,280
My designer brand wallet is
full of cash and credit cards.

767
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,040
And I must've left it in the restroom.

768
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,650
- Please wait here for a minute.
- Sure.

769
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,570
Oh Yun Seo?

770
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,230
No, I'm not Oh Yun Seo.

771
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,290
I must've been mistaken. I'm sorry.

772
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,450
No problem.

773
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,810
My goodness, what are you doing?

774
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,010
See? It is you, Yun Seo.

775
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:00,420
How dare you lie to me?

776
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,850
But what are you doing here at a law firm?

777
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,850
I'm here as a client.

778
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,690
My goodness.

779
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,600
Do you have to go to court again?

780
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,080
My gosh.

781
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,320
It hasn't even been that long
since you last caused a ruckus...

782
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,820
by going to court.

783
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:26,230
You have such an unfortunate life.

784
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,680
Shouldn't you ask a shaman
to perform an exorcism?

785
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,500
Do you need some money?

786
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,290
What about you? What brings you here?

787
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,220
Aren't you here as a client as well?

788
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,070
Why would I come to a law firm as a client?

789
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,120
As you already know,
I'm being loved by my rich husband,

790
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,020
and I'm living a proud and happy life.

791
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,620
I'm just here...

792
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,620
to take a look at the building
because I might buy it.

793
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,510
I'm really interested in
buildings these days.

794
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,040
I'm sorry. I feel like
I'm boasting too much.

795
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,400
You won't be able to make
a comeback as an actress,

796
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,640
you're probably struggling financially,

797
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,390
and it even seems like you got
yourself involved in a lawsuit.

798
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,980
You've practically hit rock bottom.

799
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,050
I think I was a bit too harsh on you.

800
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:15,470
Yun Seo.

801
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,340
Go home safely.

802
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,270
Make sure the reporters
don't take photos of you.

803
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,590
Or do the reporters not
care about you anymore?

804
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,610
Yeon Du!

805
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,090
My gosh.

806
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,390
It's like she was born to harass me.

807
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,970
One time, I had a dress picked out
for an awards ceremony,

808
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:37,350
but she took it from me
and wore it herself.

809
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,470
And another time, she went to see
the director that cast me...

810
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,450
as the main character of his drama.

811
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:44,370
Then she told him that she
can do better than me...

812
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,720
and that she'll even get paid less than me.

813
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:49,220
So eventually, she ended up getting
the role of the main character.

814
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:50,540
My gosh.

815
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:55,060
That drama incident still makes angry.

816
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,300
Mr. Kwon, is it too late
to file a lawsuit on this?

817
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,130
Yes, it's too late.

818
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,620
What?

819
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,100
In order for it to be an obstruction
of business or an illegal act,

820
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,550
she had to spread false information
or make you get fired unfairly.

821
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,110
But what she did was merely
making a better offer...

822
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,720
by offering the director
to get paid less than you.

823
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,850
She wasn't being deceptive or unfair.

824
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,460
Gosh, you are very logical.

825
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,310
Pardon?

826
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,710
I was just complaining to my boyfriend.

827
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:36,900
But I actually thought I was getting
counseling from an attorney.

828
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,100
If you ever tell me that
someone was mean to you,

829
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,100
I feel like I'd take your side
regardless of who did what.

830
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,720
And I feel like I'd
really hate that person.

831
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,320
But you must not feel that way.

832
00:56:58,850 --> 00:56:59,900
That's not it.

833
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:02,070
Also...

834
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,980
Never mind.

835
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,290
I'll be off now.

836
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,670
And I'm really sorry to say this,

837
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,760
but I don't want today to
be our first day either.

838
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,530
I'm sorry, but we'll have
to take a rain check.

839
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:03,930
There's no other way, I guess.

840
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,670
All right.

841
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,540
She did sound a little down that day.

842
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,460
You want me to go to Mr. Choi's office?

843
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,040
No, I guess not, at the moment.

844
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:16,840
I'll be fine.

845
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,670
And she did seem a little upset then.

846
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,080
But I only agreed to that for her sake...

847
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:29,030
because it'd be better for her
to experience various cases.

848
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,080
Does he even like me at all?

849
00:58:57,690 --> 00:58:58,740
My gosh.

850
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,290
Mr. Kwon, what are you doing here?

851
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,760
Your cell phone was turned off.

852
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,460
Is it turned off?

853
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,380
Is that why you came?

854
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,050
- To tell me that?
- No.

855
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,460
- Let's go on a date.
- What?

856
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,700
A date?

857
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,370
What's going on all of a sudden?

858
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:32,250
I really didn't think we
should delay another day.

859
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,470
I don't want to put it off anymore.

860
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,600
Let's make today our first day.

861
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,030
That's what I'd like to do.

862
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:45,670
- Do you not feel the same way?
- No, I'd love to.

863
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,710
Let's go, then.

864
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,300
Where are we going?

865
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,200
I've never been to an observatory before.

866
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,730
How did you think of this place?

867
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,640
It was too late to go anywhere,

868
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,200
and we couldn't have our first date...

869
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,630
at a 24-hour pork backbone stew restaurant.

870
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:22,000
The location had to be
special but not crowded.

871
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:24,050
I weighed my options...

872
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,940
and came up with a place...

873
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,070
decent enough to go on a date on at night.

874
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:28,900
Do you like it?

875
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:30,030
I love it.

876
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:31,950
It's the best.

877
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:36,980
It must be easier to spot stars over there.

878
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:38,250
Let's go.

879
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,220
A shooting star!

880
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,490
Did you see it?

881
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:56,660
No, I didn't.

882
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,910
My gosh.

883
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,330
You should've been right behind me.

884
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,980
Why do you walk so slow?

885
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:11,510
Why are you looking at me like that?

886
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,240
Because I'm sorry.

887
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:15,950
What?

888
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,090
Jin Sim,

889
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,340
I'm sorry that I'm on the slow side.

890
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:25,480
This isn't anything to
apologize about though.

891
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,280
I thought about my actions,

892
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,620
and I was inattentive.

893
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,340
It took me a long time to ask you out...

894
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,210
and I canceled our first date.

895
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,370
I kept upsetting you in a lot of ways.

896
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,250
It's all because I'm awkward
at expressing my feelings.

897
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,460
I feel bad that my ineptness
is the cause of it.

898
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,190
I tend to be slow,

899
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:57,510
so I might not be able to match your pace.

900
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:01,920
However, I'll take steps towards you...

901
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,420
at my own pace though.

902
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:09,200
Slowly and but for a long time.

903
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,810
Actually, Mr. Kwon,

904
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,700
could I ask you something?

905
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,650
Do you like me?

906
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:54,680
Sorry?

907
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,610
It's nothing. Forget you heard anything.

908
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:23,580
I like you.

909
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:29,630
I like you, Jin Sim.

910
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,020
A lot.

911
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,290
♫ <i>I'm looking at you for a while</i> ♫

912
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:52,170
♫ <i>Wondering if you feel the same way</i> ♫

913
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:55,690
♫ <i>Of course, I really don't know</i> ♫

914
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:59,960
♫ <i>It's still so hard</i> ♫

915
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,260
♫ <i>My heart has slow footsteps</i> ♫

916
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:10,210
♫ <i>So with all my strength,
I chased after you</i> ♫

917
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:13,660
♫ <i>Each step I take</i> ♫

918
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:18,960
♫ <i>You're right there
so why am I hesitating?</i> ♫

919
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:28,220
♫ <i>Oh love, love is, what is it, what is love?</i> ♫

920
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:32,090
♫ <i>Oh love</i> ♫

921
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:34,900
(Touch Your Heart)

922
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:38,210
Ms. Oh will have men
vying for her attention,

923
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,890
so do better if you wish to keep her.

924
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,990
Let's get back to work.

925
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,070
Wait, are you...

926
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,000
- jealous?
- Of course not.

927
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,040
She used to be very popular.

928
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:48,910
Her commercials aired all the time.

929
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,430
She sure is a goddess.

930
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:54,580
I'll try being with Ms. Oh then.

931
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,330
I wonder what kind of men she'll date.

932
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,990
There's no way it's Mr. Kwon.

933
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,750
I want to be the one who makes you laugh.

934
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,840
Mr. Kwon, can we...

935
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,360
kiss?

936
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,180
Here?
