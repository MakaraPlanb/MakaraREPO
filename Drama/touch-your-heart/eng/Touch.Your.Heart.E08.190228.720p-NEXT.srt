1
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,300
What did you want to talk to me about?

2
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,760
- It's hard, isn't it?
- Pardon?

3
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,060
You can cry.

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,300
Feel free to cry all you want,
and use this to wipe your tears.

5
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,150
You're such a fool.

6
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,270
You should've told me how
difficult things were.

7
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,410
Why are you telling me to cry?

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,770
And what do you mean I'm such a fool?

9
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,500
Jun Seok told me everything.

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,740
I heard Jung Rok's been very hard on you.

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,910
I heard he was spiteful, rude,
and always made you work overtime.

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,360
I heard the reason you took
the day off a few days ago...

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,260
was because you really couldn't
stand Jung Rok's tyranny anymore.

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,100
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,650
I'd fire him right now if I could,

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,040
but he's very competent contrary
to his nasty personality.

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,430
Plus, he's in charge of
a lot of trials right now.

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,620
So I've been thinking.

19
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,770
How about you work with Mr. Choi
for the remaining two months?

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,280
- No.
- Pardon?

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,900
Mr. Kwon was never hard on me.

22
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,670
I took the day off because
of personal reasons.

23
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,750
It has nothing to do with Mr. Kwon.

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,570
It was all a misunderstanding.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,450
Then why did you say you
want to destroy Jung Rok...

26
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,550
and end up in the fiery pit?

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
My goodness, Mr. Yeon even told you that?

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,030
Yes.

29
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,800
I said that when I first
started working here.

30
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,930
Everything's all fine now.

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,440
I learn a lot from him, and he's
so considerate. I'm very grateful.

32
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,670
Does that mean you wish to
continue working as his secretary?

33
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,700
Of course.

34
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,140
I'm so relieved.

35
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,480
I was so worried that you
might take the hard road.

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,060
You don't need to worry.

37
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,390
I'm relieved.

38
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,720
Why did Mr. Yeon have to say
something so unnecessary?

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,870
Life without Mr. Kwon would be horrible.

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,570
Wait.

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,770
From what I know, he's free tonight.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,150
Should I ask him to go on a date?

43
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,550
"Restaurants".

44
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,650
This isn't good.

45
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,620
(Restaurants that are good for dates)

46
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,760
"Restaurants where there
aren't a lot of people..."

47
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,640
"and offer privacy."

48
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,030
(Restaurants where there aren't a
lot of people and offer privacy.)

49
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,160
Let's see.

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,110
How pretty.

51
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,110
- I'll call you.
- Okay, bye.

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,150
Bye.

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,390
How do you feel? Are you okay?

54
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,370
Yes, thanks to you.

55
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,310
Thank you for taking me to the ER that day.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,340
No problem.

57
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,100
Take care of yourself.

58
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,910
Jung Rok.

59
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,580
Don't you think we should get
rid of this awkward vibe...

60
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,020
between us?

61
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,130
Let's have a beer tonight.

62
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,690
(The Star I Love)

63
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,770
I'm back.

64
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,250
- Hello.
- Mr. Kwon.

65
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,760
Do you also have a star you love...

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,310
deep down in your heart?

67
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,250
Well, yes. I guess.

68
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,980
A star.

69
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,600
- I'm back.
- You're back.

70
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,300
How did the trial go?

71
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,590
- I won.
- That's good.

72
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,830
Well, I was thinking... About tonight...

73
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,850
I was just about to tell you.

74
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,370
I think I need to drink tonight.

75
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,230
You even want to drink? Sure.

76
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,590
- What?
- What?

77
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,990
- What?
- What?

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,750
I'm having drinks with Ms. Yoo.

79
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,420
With Ms. Yoo?

80
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,300
Well, it's true that we bumped heads...

81
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,540
on the Im Yun Hee Case.

82
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,660
I ended up making the
situation worse for her.

83
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,670
We're still friends in some ways,

84
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,700
so it's best if we quickly
bury the hatchet.

85
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,030
Will it upset you?

86
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,250
No, of course not.

87
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,140
What's wrong with two
friends grabbing a drink?

88
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,460
I knew you'd say so.

89
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,710
Did you find the case I asked for?

90
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,070
It's here.

91
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,470
Okay.

92
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,830
(Booking complete!)

93
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,560
Do you have plans tonight?

94
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,150
What? Well...

95
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,440
With whom?

96
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,000
Well...

97
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,140
With Ms. Dan.

98
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,990
I booked the restaurant for me and Ms. Dan.

99
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,790
Are you two close?

100
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,220
Of course. We're like best friends.

101
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,560
We even confide in one another.

102
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,330
I'm glad to see that you have friends here.

103
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,630
I support your friendship.

104
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,060
Then...

105
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,670
Sure, whatever.

106
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,550
I've never been to a place
like this before. It's great!

107
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,070
It's a first for me too.

108
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,590
You're right. It's nice.

109
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,980
I'm curious though. Did you really...

110
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,780
book this place for the two of us?

111
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,190
Anyone can tell that it's a dating spot.

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,090
Oh, please.

113
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,900
I really booked this
place for the two of us.

114
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,030
It's the romantic couple's course.
Please enjoy.

115
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,420
You invited me to such a place...

116
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,150
and then even booked a
romantic dinner course.

117
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,810
Ms. Oh...

118
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,100
You must be dying to go on a date.

119
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,480
You should quickly find someone.

120
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,940
Yes, right.

121
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,020
I'm sorry for being so petty.

122
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,670
I wanted to win this case and then join...

123
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,290
the special prosecution department.

124
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,680
It's why...

125
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,390
I thought of this case
as my express ticket.

126
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,610
I was focused on the prize and
lost sight of what's important.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,130
I've learned my lesson.

128
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,820
I apologize for being mean to you too.

129
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,100
It's fine.

130
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,190
I'm sorry for calling a witness
that wasn't notified in advance.

131
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,370
Right. You should be.

132
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,390
I honestly can't believe you.

133
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,360
How could you stab me
in the back like that?

134
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,940
How on earth could you reveal
the real killer in court?

135
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,290
Ms. Oh, you were absent from
the office a few days ago.

136
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,840
Did something happen?

137
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,460
I was just feeling under the weather.

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,830
I see.

139
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,010
I thought that maybe you
argued with Mr. Kwon.

140
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,260
What's there for us to argue about?

141
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,050
Isn't there a lot?
He can be very prickly, you know.

142
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,130
To be honest,
I was surprised by his actions...

143
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,960
during the Im Yun Hee Case.

144
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,620
I always knew that he was cold-hearted,

145
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,660
but I didn't expect him to
be that way with Ms. Yoo.

146
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,880
How can he make a fool
out of his first love?

147
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,190
What?

148
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,550
His first love?

149
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,380
You probably don't know.

150
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,320
This is a secret but...

151
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,090
I heard from a friend who went to
the same university as Mr. Kwon.

152
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,230
He used to...

153
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,920
like her.

154
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,580
Were they together?

155
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,750
No.

156
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,240
She dated Prosecutor Kim Se Won instead.

157
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,180
Who's he?

158
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,350
Well...

159
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,080
Let's say that this is Mr. Kwon,

160
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,320
this is Ms. Yoo, and this is Mr. Kim.

161
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,360
The three were very close friends.

162
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,770
Mr. Kwon liked Ms. Yoo,
but she liked Mr. Kim.

163
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,930
The two started dating,

164
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,330
and Mr. Kwon was left heartbroken.

165
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,470
You and I should meet
up for a meal one day.

166
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,500
Sure, I'd love to.

167
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,020
Watch it or I'll be touched.

168
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,190
If you have time, how about lunch?
Does pasta sound good?

169
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,090
I'm sorry, but can you
go back to the office first?

170
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,790
So he used to like her?

171
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,190
No wonder...

172
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,460
This is only what I think, but...

173
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,800
It feels like...

174
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,980
Mr. Kwon still likes her.

175
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,280
The way he looks at her...

176
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,520
gives me that vibe.

177
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,780
Ms. Oh, what's wrong?

178
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,430
The macaroon is too small, that's all.

179
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,010
Shouldn't it at least be
the size of one's palm?

180
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,970
Are you kidding me?

181
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,450
Have them all then.

182
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,000
Not this one.

183
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,080
Yes, Ms. Oh.

184
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,210
I was going to call you once I get home.

185
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,190
Mr. Kwon, can we meet?

186
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,500
What? Right now?

187
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,360
Yes, there's something I need to say.

188
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,810
I'll come to you, so tell me where you are.

189
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,530
I'm near my house.

190
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,540
Let me text you my address.

191
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,660
Is something wrong?

192
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,310
You actually came all this way.

193
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,630
I could've come to you.

194
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,810
Mr. Kwon,

195
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,970
I heard that you used to like Ms. Yoo.

196
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,310
You and another friend both liked her.

197
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,350
Is that true?

198
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes, that's true.

199
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,750
Why are you saying it with such pride?

200
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,720
Should I be embarrassed about it then?

201
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,000
It's all in the past.

202
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,010
Still, even though it's in the past,

203
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,000
it's weird...

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,770
to have drinks alone with the woman...

205
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,970
you used to like.

206
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,350
No girlfriend would understand that.

207
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,700
But we're only friends now.

208
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,940
That's only what you think!

209
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,780
You're still good to her...

210
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,250
and even get together alone.

211
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,320
Others could think that...

212
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,490
you still have feelings for her.

213
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,630
Jung Rok!

214
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,760
What are you doing here?

215
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,370
Who's this?

216
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,730
Are you Jung Rok's girlfriend?

217
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,380
Yes, hello.

218
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,680
Hello.

219
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,930
I'm Jung Rok's roommate, Kim Se Won.

220
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,890
- Kim Se Won?
- Gosh, it's nice to meet you.

221
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,560
I've been dying to meet his girlfriend.

222
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,150
Why don't you come in with us?

223
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,840
Let's order fried chicken
and have some beers.

224
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,130
Well...

225
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,600
Maybe next time.
We'll get together formally.

226
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,100
Why bother when we're here together now?

227
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,930
Don't be burdened by it and just...

228
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,630
join us for a beer.

229
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,100
Come on. Let's go.

230
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,060
- But she's busy...
- Come on.

231
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,150
Me?

232
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,620
- What do I do?
- Bring her inside. Come on.

233
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,480
Hurry up.

234
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,870
The fried chicken's here. Come this way.

235
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,310
This way. Take a seat.

236
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,000
It's not much but enjoy.

237
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,650
Thank you.

238
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,500
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

239
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,400
I've been wondering who
he's been talking about.

240
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,650
Did He talk about me?

241
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,850
Of course.

242
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,760
Weren't you two at a company dinner once?

243
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,570
You even watched a movie together.

244
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,130
When he got back, he kept gazing...

245
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,500
at the ticket.

246
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,570
That's when I knew.

247
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,340
This is love.

248
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,500
This is really love.

249
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,460
Shut up and eat your chicken.

250
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,900
Why? Do you feel embarrassed? Do you?

251
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,600
By the way, don't you feel uncomfortable?

252
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,990
Why are you still wearing sunglasses?

253
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,000
That's...

254
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,970
Well, we might be seeing each
other often from now on,

255
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,330
so...

256
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,610
You look just like Oh Yun Seo.

257
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,870
I am Oh Yun Seo.

258
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,280
For real? You're that Oh Yun Seo?

259
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,820
My goddess, your goddess,
the universe's goddess, Oh Yun Seo?

260
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,310
- You know that chant too?
- Of course.

261
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,420
Do you know how popular she was?

262
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,510
Her commercials were always on
whenever I turned on the TV.

263
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,300
Oh, right.

264
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,390
Didn't you shoot a commercial
for this chicken brand before?

265
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,600
Moracana Chicken is here for you

266
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,870
Sweet delicious chicken is here for you

267
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,890
- Mora, Moracana
- Moracana

268
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,710
- Moracana Chicken is here for you
- Moracana Chicken is here for you

269
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,750
This is unbelievable.

270
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,120
Unbelievable.

271
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:10,150
I thought Jung Rok was
dating his secretary.

272
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,880
Are you saying that secretary is you?

273
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,070
Well, the thing is...

274
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,470
Something came up, and I agreed
on working for just three months.

275
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,190
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

276
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,980
Hey! You idiot.

277
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,990
You should be thankful for dating
the universe's goddess, Ms. Oh.

278
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,930
Why on earth did you make her angry?

279
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,480
What?

280
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,850
How did you know that?

281
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,710
Actually, you two seemed to
be having a fight outside,

282
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,680
so I swooped in to mediate the situation.

283
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,230
He's just terrible at dating.

284
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,890
Ms. Oh, tell me what he did wrong.

285
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,970
Well, that's...

286
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,100
Come on, you can tell me comfortably.

287
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,330
I overheard him still having
feelings about someone.

288
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,530
She found out I used to like Yeo Reum.

289
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,790
And about our love triangle.

290
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,640
Oh, I was worried for nothing.

291
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,500
If it's about that,
you don't have to mind at all.

292
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,390
He was just attracted
briefly during college.

293
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,830
He can't even say he liked her.
It's a very...

294
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,770
petty emotion.

295
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,530
If he was serious,
we would've become enemies.

296
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,990
How can we still be friends and roommates?
Don't you agree?

297
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,750
- That's true, but...
- The way I see it,

298
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,830
the only woman in Jung Rok's
heart is you, Ms. Oh.

299
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,480
I've never seen him open his
heart so widely to anyone.

300
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,060
- Really?
- I'm telling you.

301
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,600
So stop being so upset. I know he is...

302
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,270
very cranky, and kind of a fool,
but I hope you understand.

303
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,200
Why are you saying I'm cranky?

304
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,900
Do you really not know?

305
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,470
I'm going to tell her everything then.

306
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,460
When we were in college,
I forgot to do my homework,

307
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,010
and asked him to show me his.

308
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,200
"I'll never let you see mine,
so take care of it yourself."

309
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,080
"If you still want to copy it,
pay me 50 cents per page."

310
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,270
That's what he said.

311
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,210
Still, that's better than
what I went through.

312
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,650
On my first day at work as a secretary,

313
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,600
I cleaned up Mr. Kwon's desk for him,

314
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,380
but he said I touched his
stuff without permission...

315
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,180
and got furious at me.

316
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,050
He totally humiliated me.

317
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,330
I can totally picture it in my head.

318
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,060
"Why did you touch my stuff
without permission?" Did he say this?

319
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,870
No.

320
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,970
He looked at me with blazing eyes and said,

321
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,470
"Why did you touch my things
without permission!" Like this.

322
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,880
- A little more? Like this?
- Yes.

323
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,130
"Why did you touch my things
without permission!"

324
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,820
That's right.

325
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,860
When did I shout like that?

326
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,770
I just said, "Why did you touch
my things without permission?"

327
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,390
I said it in a gentle tone.

328
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,450
You must be still mistaken.

329
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,530
When did I get angry like that?

330
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,350
- Just like that.
- That's right.

331
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,830
Do you remember now?

332
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,550
Mr. Kim is such a funny person.

333
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,300
Yes, he's very bright.

334
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,270
That's why he was popular among women.

335
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,270
So that's why he took away
Ms. Yoo from you.

336
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,480
I was just joking. A joke.

337
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,160
Do you feel better now?

338
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,370
Well, I don't know.

339
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,490
When I first heard that,
I was extremely jealous.

340
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,910
But...

341
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,290
like you said, it's all in the past.

342
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,200
And like Mr. Kim said,

343
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,820
I'm the only one...

344
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,100
that's inside your heart.

345
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,260
I'm grateful that you think that way.

346
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,190
I think jealousy is the most
unnecessary emotion there is.

347
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,650
As long as we trust each other,
the past doesn't matter.

348
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,420
Let's not waste time,
and stay true to our current emotions.

349
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,340
You're back, you thief.

350
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,750
What? Thief?

351
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,680
You're Korea's third most famous thief.

352
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,860
Number one is marinated crab,
two is Rain who married Kim Tae Hee,

353
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,680
and you're number three,
who's dating Oh Yun Seo.

354
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,510
You better treat her properly.

355
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,710
Ms. Oh will have men
vying for her attention,

356
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,050
so if you don't want to lose her,
you better be nice.

357
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,940
- How do you do that?
- What?

358
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,490
Being nice to her. How do you do it?

359
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,850
Why are you asking me something like that?

360
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,390
If she wants something, give it to her.

361
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,960
If there's a problem,
care for her and show her affection.

362
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,320
That's it.

363
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,740
It's not as easy as it sounds though.

364
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,380
If it weren't for you earlier,
I would've been in a pickle.

365
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,330
Thanks.

366
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,380
My goodness. I can't
believe he just said that.

367
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,090
It really is love. True love.

368
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,310
It's very moist.

369
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,600
Why are you applying this
on your lips suddenly?

370
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,920
I wonder what it is
you're thinking of doing.

371
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,450
If you have time to tease me,
why don't you look for a house?

372
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,450
When will you move out?

373
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,870
Stop bragging that you have a house.

374
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,980
How's it going with Yeo Reum?

375
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,100
What do you think? I'm just
lost in our memories alone.

376
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,110
Get back to it then.

377
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,420
Apply it thoroughly so it's moist.

378
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,070
Right, moist.

379
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,110
Ms. Oh, what brings you here?

380
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,470
What do you think?
I wanted to go to work with you.

381
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,300
Isn't this the secret joy
of dating at work?

382
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,810
Where did I put it?

383
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,480
- Did you leave something at home?
- Yes.

384
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,360
It's jealousy.

385
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,210
I left my jealousy at home.

386
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,150
That meaningless emotion will
only make us drift apart more.

387
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,370
From now on, I won't bring
jealousy with me anywhere.

388
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,350
- Then, shall we?
- Wait.

389
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,350
Give me the car key.

390
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,480
Why?

391
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,830
You're really bad at driving,
and it stresses you out.

392
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,590
I cannot let that happen.

393
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,490
Gosh.

394
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,780
Is he worried about me again?

395
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,540
He just can't get enough of me.

396
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,520
That mirror is so small.

397
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,740
Isn't it cute?

398
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,690
It's my lucky mascot.

399
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,180
The day I bought this,
I was cast on the streets.

400
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,720
So I believe this brought me a fortune.

401
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,370
But you won't need anything like this.

402
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,400
That's because the person
holding this lucky mascot...

403
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,280
and the goddess of fortune
is your girlfriend!

404
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,600
Gosh, you really know how to
make someone feel embarrassed.

405
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,540
Can I hold your hand?

406
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,380
What?

407
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:58,150
Why would you ask me something
like that all of a sudden?

408
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,140
Like I already announced,
these two law-school students...

409
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,840
will be interning at our
firm starting from today.

410
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,900
Say hello.

411
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,570
- Hello.
- Hello.

412
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,730
Can you guys introduce yourselves?

413
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,980
- You should go first.
- No, you should go first.

414
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,580
Okay.

415
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,650
Hello, my name is Lee Jong Hwa.

416
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,290
Hello, my name is Kim Pil Gi.

417
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,150
And I will be an intern who always
takes notes of everything you say...

418
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,560
so that I won't ever forget
all the lessons you teach.

419
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,350
By the way, Jong Hwa.

420
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,220
Your name is a little feminine.

421
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,720
But unlike his name, he looks
very manly and handsome.

422
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,910
Yes, I agree. He's not as handsome as I am,

423
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,170
but he does look pretty decent.

424
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,220
I look forward to working here.

425
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,670
Mr. Yeon Joon Gyu. Mr. Kwon Jung Rok.

426
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,530
Mr. Choi Yun Hyuk. Ms. Dan Moon Hee.

427
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,950
How did you memorize all our names?

428
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,130
Did you notice? I went into
the main page of our law firm.

429
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,070
It's only right for an intern
to memorize the names...

430
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,950
of his or her seniors.
Don't you agree with that?

431
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,170
Exactly.

432
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,230
I am very honored that I got a chance...

433
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,840
to engrave...

434
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,610
all your brilliant and noble names...

435
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,050
on both my left and right brain.

436
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,740
By the way, we're going on
a workshop this weekend.

437
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,150
Jong Hwa and Pil Set...

438
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,680
Pil Gi, sir. My name is Kim Pil Gi.

439
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,190
Yes, Pil Gi. You and Jong Hwa
should join us if you can.

440
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

441
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,980
I'm sorry I'm late. I had to
answer a call from a client.

442
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:11,030
♫ <i>Oh I come alive
Oh I come alive, oh I come alive</i> ♫

443
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,060
Were they previously informed
that Ms. Oh is working here?

444
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,360
Of course, I already told them.

445
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,720
And I even made them sign a
confidentiality agreement.

446
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,570
They're totally bewitched.

447
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,970
Yun Seo, please look
after these two interns.

448
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,500
They'll be learning from Jung Rok.

449
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,140
What? Me?

450
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,470
Yes, I'm going to make them
work with everyone.

451
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,980
And they can start with you.

452
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,180
Jung Rok, I need to talk to you.

453
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,250
Okay.

454
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,270
You must feel so upset.

455
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,800
You're probably dying inside
because you want to teach Jong Hwa.

456
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,220
You're a fanatic for good-looking guys.

457
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,920
That's enough nonsense from you.
I have a boyfriend now.

458
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,370
I forgot. I was supposed
to keep it a secret.

459
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,400
Really? By any chance, is your boyfriend...

460
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,550
a social worker?

461
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,110
My boyfriend owns a cafe nearby.

462
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,910
Look.

463
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,790
He's really attractive, isn't he?

464
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,290
Every morning, I went to his cafe
and drank a large-sized Americano...

465
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,520
I'm sorry. It's too boring.

466
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,640
You should apologize.
Hurry up and apologize!

467
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,290
Okay, then.

468
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,030
I will now begin your orientation.

469
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,400
There are a few rules you
need to keep in mind...

470
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,920
if you want to work with Mr. Kwon.

471
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,090
Number one.

472
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,470
You must come to work on time.

473
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,290
Mr. Kwon hates people who are tardy.

474
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,680
Number two. You must get off work on time.

475
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,890
Mr. Kwon also hates people...

476
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,490
who cannot finish their
work within working hours.

477
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,280
Number three. This one's important.

478
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,420
Mr. Kwon also hates people...

479
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,250
who touches his things without permission.

480
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,200
There are many other things...

481
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,890
that he hates.

482
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,670
But you can learn about
them as you work with him.

483
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,080
However, you must, by all means,

484
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,860
make sure you never break the
three rules I just told you.

485
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,350
- Okay.
- Okay.

486
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,420
Okay, then.

487
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,630
Excuse me, Ms. Oh Yun Seo.

488
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,270
You can just call me "Ms. Oh".

489
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,420
Oh, okay. Ms. Oh.

490
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,870
Well, excuse me for asking.

491
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,470
But can I get an autograph?

492
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,000
- An autograph?
- Yes.

493
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,660
I'm a huge fan.

494
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,340
Then can I take a photo with you?

495
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,780
Then can I shake your hand?

496
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,380
- Then can you wish me good luck?
- Then can you...

497
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,480
- Get to work.
- tell me to get to work?

498
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,510
What should I do, Ms. Oh?

499
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,970
I think Mr. Kwon's really angry.

500
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,080
I think he hates me.

501
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,380
You know what? I think I should
get on my knees and apologize.

502
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,170
Wait. Don't get mistaken.

503
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,190
He always looks like that.

504
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,880
Here's the document you asked for.

505
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,320
Okay, thanks.

506
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,810
By the way, you must be happy
that they're your fans.

507
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,980
To be honest, I kind of forgot
that I'm actually a celebrity...

508
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,090
ever since I started working here.

509
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,880
But it does feel nice to
hear compliments from them.

510
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,420
By any chance, are you jealous?

511
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,300
Of course not. Didn't I already tell you?

512
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,330
Jealousy is such a useless emotion.

513
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,500
I also left my jealousy at home.

514
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,570
I personally wouldn't
mind if you got jealous.

515
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,410
What?

516
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,290
Never mind. It's nothing.

517
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,120
I'll be off, then.

518
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,020
After we finished questioning the witness,

519
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,710
it seemed like the judicial
panel agreed with our opponent.

520
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,750
What if we the chief prosecutor gets
angry at us for losing the case?

521
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,540
No one knows what will happen until
the judge gives a final ruling.

522
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,350
Don't get scared, and search
again for additional records.

523
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,450
If we missed anything out,
we can ask to reopen the case.

524
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,150
Don't worry too much.

525
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,300
Thank you, ma'am. I'll see you again.

526
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,990
Okay, bye.

527
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

528
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,340
It seems like you're finally
back to being your old self.

529
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,050
It didn't suit you to look so weak.

530
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,470
Cut the nonsense. You should
make time so we can have a meal.

531
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,650
I need to pay you back.

532
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,490
You didn't even want to
look me in the eyes.

533
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,560
Are we close enough to eat together now?

534
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,330
I just told you that I'm
trying to pay you back.

535
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,750
Forget it if you don't want to.

536
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,200
I'd love to. Go ahead and pay me back.

537
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,680
You better pay me back properly.

538
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,980
How about tonight?

539
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,920
No, I have to look over a lot of
documents today. I'll see you.

540
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,650
Then let's try to set a date
again as soon as possible, okay?

541
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,510
- A shot of espresso, please.
- Espresso.

542
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,550
Yes.

543
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,600
Okay, I'll hand in a written
opinion by Wednesday.

544
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,790
You should take a look at
it and come to a judgment.

545
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,610
Yes, okay.

546
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,780
I'll call you again. Bye.

547
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,400
My boyfriend owns a cafe nearby.

548
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,920
He's really attractive, isn't he?

549
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,000
Here's your espresso, sir.

550
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,510
Okay, thank you.

551
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,790
- Sorry for making you wait.
- No problem.

552
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,870
- Thanks for this.
- Sure.

553
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,740
- I heard you have a girlfriend.
- A girlfriend, my foot.

554
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,870
I'm just letting her think we're
dating because she's so into me.

555
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,760
What's the matter? I heard she's
really nice and competent.

556
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,970
- Isn't she an attorney?
- So? I don't find her attractive.

557
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,610
Then don't date her.

558
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,500
I'm facing a lawsuit
with the building owner.

559
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,950
It's going to cost me so much money
to hire an attorney for that.

560
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,490
Plus, she buys me food and gifts.

561
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,200
She's not entirely useless.

562
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,460
Ms. Dan.

563
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,360
Ms. Dan.

564
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,000
Ms. Dan.

565
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,440
Ms. Dan.

566
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,240
Ms. Dan.

567
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,210
Are you okay?

568
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,610
No, I'm not okay.

569
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,930
I'm not okay.

570
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,330
I already knew that he didn't like me.

571
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,390
He was always busy to go on dates...

572
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,490
and he hated when I went by his workplace.

573
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,650
That's not how you treat someone you like.

574
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,720
Still,

575
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,540
I thought that I could change his mind.

576
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,190
Not knowing how he truly felt,

577
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,520
like a complete idiot, I...

578
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,990
I can't end things this way.

579
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,780
He'll at least get an earful.

580
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,500
Ms. Dan!

581
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,710
She's back.

582
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,580
You can't fool around with
people's hearts like that.

583
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,770
How could you?

584
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,850
Unbelievable.

585
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,720
I never asked you out.

586
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,790
I never said I liked you.

587
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,530
Did you really think that
I had feelings for you?

588
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,730
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,490
I was wondering what kind of
man you turned me down for.

590
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,490
Is this piece of trash...

591
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,050
really the reason you rejected me?

592
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,550
Piece of trash? Are you out of your mind?

593
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,460
I won't let you take someone
like her away from me.

594
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,440
She's too great to give up on.

595
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,600
Let's go.

596
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,130
Ms. Dan, I know it's not the
best time to give this advice,

597
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,610
but consider personality...

598
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,510
when you fall for men and
not just their looks.

599
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:53,990
What?

600
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,090
There are many decent guys in this world,

601
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,990
so why cry over a scumbag like him?

602
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,710
Get home safely then.

603
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,180
Thank...

604
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,450
Thank you.

605
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,220
Yun Seo, must you go to the workshop?

606
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,700
Why attend it when you're
not actually an employee?

607
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,340
You never know.

608
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,930
A workshop scene could
come up in the series.

609
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,070
I need to experience the real thing...

610
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,240
to be able to make the scene more real.

611
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,910
You're packing way too much for
it to be realistic though.

612
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,580
Are you off to Europe instead?

613
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,650
Isn't this too much for an overnight trip?

614
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,320
Why do you have a bath bomb?

615
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,950
It's good for insomnia.

616
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,950
I'm going to take a bubble bath before bed.

617
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,090
If you have one at a workshop,

618
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,220
people will think you're pretentious.

619
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,990
You'll be sharing a bathroom.

620
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,630
Washing up should be limited
to about three minutes.

621
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,700
Three minutes?

622
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,200
Is that how things will be?

623
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,320
How can I let someone so clueless go there?

624
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,180
I'm really nervous.

625
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,470
Let me pack you one suitcase instead.

626
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,280
- There are too many clothes.
- Not that!

627
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,920
It's too much.

628
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,000
These you need though.

629
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,950
Wait...

630
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,320
There's an essential item
you must not forget.

631
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,450
- What's that?
- Your dignity as an actress.

632
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:30,380
Don't make drunken mistakes
and keep it classy.

633
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,770
All right.

634
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,660
The workshop is important
but so is our health.

635
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,800
I'm almost there.

636
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,930
- Mr. Kwon, have one too.
- Sure.

637
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,290
Mr. Kwon, how's my outfit for the workshop?

638
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,780
Don't I look classy and trendy?

639
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,550
No, I think you lack both of them.

640
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,090
You don't know anything
about fashion, do you?

641
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,840
- Look. I'm...
- There's a real fashionista.

642
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,880
See? The younger ones know
what they're talking about.

643
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,380
I wasn't talking about you.

644
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,830
- Look at Ms. Oh.
- What?

645
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,030
Our Ms. Oh shines even
brightly outside the office.

646
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,650
Seeing her every day made me forget,

647
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,060
but she sure is a goddess.

648
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,520
Tell me about it.

649
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,910
I want to spank myself for forgetting.

650
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,350
I'm sorry. I must be the last one here.

651
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,380
All that matters is that
you're here right now.

652
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,170
To wish you good health,
I give you two of these.

653
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,100
Thank you for coming.

654
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,600
Oh, please. The pleasure's mine.

655
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,840
I've never been on a group trip before.

656
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,100
Really? What about school trips?

657
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,990
In middle school, I had to stay behind...

658
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,840
because of my appendectomy.

659
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,080
In high school, I couldn't go
because I had debuted as an actor.

660
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,650
I've never traveled
anywhere in a group before.

661
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,390
That's why I'm so excited
about this workshop.

662
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,180
If everyone's ready, let's hit the road!

663
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,430
Let me carry that for you.

664
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,540
Let's go.

665
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,820
Ms. Oh, aren't you coming?

666
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,330
Actually,

667
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,400
the rest area's too crowded.

668
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,860
Yes, of course. I guess
that's a little inconvenient.

669
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,970
Even though I'm desperate to pee,
I'll hold it...

670
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,050
and keep you company.

671
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,600
Me too. I'll keep you company as well.

672
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,150
It's all right. Get something to eat...

673
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,450
and also some fresh air.

674
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,090
I'll pee and be right back then.

675
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,530
I'll be back even quicker.

676
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,020
- I'll be back.
- Sure thing.

677
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,730
The fish cake bar looks delicious.

678
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:18,260
(Corn dog, Fish cake bar,
Sausages, Corn dog)

679
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,450
- One fish cake bar, please.
- Sure.

680
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,040
Fish cake bar, fish cake bar,
fish cake bar, fish cake bar.

681
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,100
I see you like fish cake bars.

682
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,110
Ms. Oh, please take this.

683
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,240
It's not much, but take this bouquet...

684
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,130
- of fish cake bars.
- He forgot the ketchup.

685
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,500
I didn't though.

686
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,170
So that the choice could be yours,
I brought the entire bottle.

687
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,030
Mine even has mustard on it.

688
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,930
I didn't bring mustard since
you're allergic to it.

689
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,410
Let me wipe it off then.

690
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,960
She hates things that are disgusting.

691
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,310
Did you hear that I'm
on the Im Yun Hee Case?

692
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,540
It would've been cleaner
if I had it from the start.

693
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,430
Because of one ambitious colleague,

694
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,740
I have to go through extra hoops.

695
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,380
Se Won!

696
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,680
Joo Yeong.

697
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,220
Sit with us.

698
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,090
Se Won, have some more meat.

699
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,270
This isn't necessary.

700
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,230
You two seem quite close.

701
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,560
One might think you're
making a move on him.

702
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,850
We're both young, so what if I am?

703
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,340
Okay, sure.

704
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,270
You look great together. Go ahead and date.

705
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,020
I'll try my best.

706
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,560
Is that all right, Ms. Yoo?

707
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,350
Joo Yeong!

708
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,520
- Do you need my permission?
- No.

709
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:05,250
Still, I thought I should ask
if I am allowed to make a move.

710
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,920
Then don't make a move.

711
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,290
- Why not?
- No matter how hard you try,

712
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,160
you won't get what you want.

713
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,340
You'll be deeply disappointed.

714
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:33,210
(Mount Seoun)

715
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,370
This is great.

716
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:41,190
While filming, I'd usually
stay alone in a hotel room.

717
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,300
Seeing us gathered here,
it feels like we're on a field trip,

718
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,160
and I feel so happy.

719
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,300
Isn't it lovely?

720
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,380
This place is nice, but there's
another amazing place behind there.

721
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,780
Right, there's a really nice
walking trail over there.

722
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,320
Why don't we all go for a walk?

723
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,650
- That sounds good.
- Great.

724
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,450
All right. Let's unpack first,
and go on a walk.

725
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,510
This way. There are two paths.

726
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,780
Right and left.

727
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,690
Do you like her that much?

728
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,290
- What?
- You like Ms. Yang.

729
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,290
I do?

730
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,370
No, I don't.

731
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,670
Are you tired?

732
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,580
You should exercise regularly.

733
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,200
Ms. Oh, aren't you tired?

734
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,090
Not at all. This is so fun.

735
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,570
It's my first time going on
a walk with so many people.

736
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:29,880
I'm excited.

737
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,260
Ms. Oh, you're like Princess Ann
in "Roman Holiday".

738
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,410
You get sick of the
royal family and run away.

739
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,720
Then you feel happiness from
this simple type of life.

740
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,030
I'm honored.

741
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,310
I really like Audrey Hepburn...

742
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,470
It seems like you've caught a cold.

743
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,800
Really? It's quite chillier than I thought.

744
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,360
Ms. Oh, use this.

745
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,340
It's an electric handwarmer,

746
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,550
and it's incomparable to those
disposable hot packs...

747
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,950
that are made out of cheap fabric.

748
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,220
- It feels warm.
- You can have it.

749
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,480
Okay.

750
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,990
Here, you should wear this.
You seem so cold.

751
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:16,090
No, it's fine. You'll be cold.

752
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,750
Don't worry about me.

753
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,300
I'm all set with this light-weight jumper.

754
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,390
Ms. Oh seems to have a dry throat.

755
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,860
Ms. Oh, you should have some vin chaud.

756
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,100
It's perfect to drink in cold weather.

757
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,470
This morning, I remembered
when I drank vin chaud...

758
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,340
at the Seine River in Paris...

759
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,650
and prepared this special drink.

760
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,850
I'm very glad I did.

761
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,380
It's tasty.

762
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,480
It feels like it's warming up my body.

763
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,900
Everyone's worried that
she's not warm enough.

764
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,720
How could you stand still like that
with your hands in your pockets?

765
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,370
You're just gazing into space, aren't you?

766
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,800
Aren't you even a little
bit interested in her?

767
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:04,110
I know. We all went to
buy fish cakes for her,

768
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,990
but only he came back empty-handed.

769
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:08,860
If it were me, I'd take special
care of my personal secretary.

770
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,310
Mr. Kwon, you're so cold-hearted!

771
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,400
Ms. Oh seems very cold,
so let's stop walking and go back.

772
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,370
Let's go and prepare for
our barbecue party.

773
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,590
Let's go.

774
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,720
Stop hiking up and come back down!

775
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,130
- Keep going?
- Come down!

776
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,800
- Over here?
- Yes.

777
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,530
- You look very cold.
- I'm fine.

778
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,630
Let's go down first.

779
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:36,050
- We brought so many drinks.
- We did.

780
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,670
I can't see Ms. Oh. Where is she?

781
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,400
She went to her room, saying she'll
prepare for the barbecue party.

782
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,200
Over there. Look...

783
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,140
Why are you wearing a dress?

784
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,130
You said we were having a
barbecue party at night.

785
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,200
Isn't it time yet?

786
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:09,800
Why aren't you all dressed?
Aren't you going to change...

787
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:12,340
into dresses and tuxedos?

788
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,570
Oh, that..

789
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,830
A barbecue party at a workshop
is not actually a party.

790
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,410
We just grill some pork neck...

791
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,990
and drink soju and beer.

792
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:23,050
You can just wear comfortable clothes.

793
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,900
That's what the party is.

794
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,090
I didn't know.

795
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,830
I'll go change into
something else in no time.

796
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:37,800
Isn't Ms. Oh so clumsy sometimes?
That's why she's more charming.

797
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,200
I know. She seems like
a very innocent person.

798
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,610
Right. At first, I thought
she'd be very cold and chic,

799
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,050
but she's actually cute.

800
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,130
I never imagined her wearing a dress.

801
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,190
Why are you smiling?

802
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,520
- You're scaring me.
- What's scary about that?

803
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,970
And who bought so many chips?

804
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,620
Did you come here to eat
chips or something?

805
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,550
Why are you getting angry at me?

806
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,200
Be careful.

807
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,330
I'll do this.

808
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:16,000
It may not seem like much,
but it requires know-how.

809
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,410
First of all, I must see which
direction the wind is blowing.

810
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:21,610
Oh, this way. I have to
turn my back this way.

811
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,190
And then... I see you
chose some nice firewood.

812
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:28,760
Next, I'll apply heat to this
for exactly three seconds.

813
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,180
One,

814
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,020
two,

815
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,620
three.

816
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,190
What's the matter with this?

817
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,070
Let me try it again.

818
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,920
Can I try it? It looks really fun.

819
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,010
You want to try?

820
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,260
You can try it for fun.
I'm sure it'll be quite difficult.

821
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,140
Okay.

822
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,050
One,

823
00:48:58,550 --> 00:48:59,580
two,

824
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,050
three.

825
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,770
- Were you in the Girl Scouts?
- It's like a campfire.

826
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,990
I've never had a barbecue
outdoors like this.

827
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,820
Alright, fill up your glasses.
It's time for a toast.

828
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,180
Eat up. I prepared special
Korean pork for you guys.

829
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,050
We've brought a major change
in the law firm industry.

830
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,900
We are the new giants of
the law firm industry.

831
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,680
For Always Law Firm!

832
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,280
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

833
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,510
- Great job.
- Enjoy it.

834
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,690
- Okay.
- Eat up.

835
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,590
Since the mood is set,

836
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:45,130
I will announce the beginning of...

837
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,430
the Always Awards ceremony.

838
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,950
Always Awards? What is that?

839
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,140
We always open an award
ceremony during our workshop.

840
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,360
Really? Awesome.

841
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,530
It's nothing much.
Since all of you work so hard...

842
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,410
for Always, and if you each receive
an award at this workshop,

843
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:04,510
it will make you feel much better.

844
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,020
It's all from my sincere heart as the CEO.

845
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,250
Then let's begin the award ceremony.

846
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,980
The first winner is...

847
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,070
Kwon Jung Rok! Give him a hand.

848
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,870
The name of the award is...

849
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,140
"Number One Sales Person Award"!

850
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,970
Am I an insurance man or what?
Number one in sales?

851
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:28,410
Why? It's a quite witty name.

852
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,000
As a gift, we've prepared two books.

853
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,750
"The Guide to Humor for Idiots".

854
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,440
Let's give him a big hand.

855
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,270
The next winner is...

856
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,900
Attorney Choi Yun Hyuk.

857
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,600
It's called, "I'll Be
Number One Tomorrow Award".

858
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,130
I hope you work hard this year
and catch up with Mr. Kwon...

859
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,700
and become the number one attorney.

860
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,370
Here you go. Give him a hand.

861
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,920
All right. I know it will be hard,

862
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:01,870
but I will disregard justice
or my sense of duty...

863
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,470
and become a lawyer that
can increase our profits.

864
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,250
The next winner is Attorney Dan Moon Hee.

865
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,820
It's called, "Stop Being So Timid Award".

866
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,820
Ms. Yang Eun Ji.

867
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,030
"You Are Always Consistent Award".

868
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:27,470
It's called,
"Just Your Face is Scary Award".

869
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,090
Although you have a scary face,

870
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,700
you take care of your work so smoothly.
I feel proud.

871
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,070
The last award is...

872
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:35,930
"The Idol of the Information Desk Award".

873
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,380
Give her a big hand.

874
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,410
We've prepared two tickets to a concert.

875
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,740
Give her a round of applause.

876
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:45,360
This will be the end of Always Awards,

877
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,650
but I changed my mind.

878
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:50,220
I've prepared a special
award for this occasion.

879
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,300
The special award!
Today's special award...

880
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,790
goes to...

881
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,930
Oh Yun Seo!

882
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,800
Really? You're giving me an award too?

883
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,870
Please come out.

884
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:09,660
As a gift, we've prepared a
pair of comfortable slippers...

885
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,180
for you to wear in the office.

886
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,610
"The Vitamin of Always Award".
Give her a big hand!

887
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,280
Since you're receiving such
an enthusiastic reaction,

888
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,380
I will read what it says on this award.

889
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,960
"Winner of The Vitamin of
Always Award, Oh Yun Seo."

890
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:29,140
"As a former universe's goddess,
she overcame difficulties..."

891
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:32,180
"and devoted her best with
a bright and cheerful smile."

892
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,070
"She became someone that
is needed at Always,"

893
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,160
"and she's the vitamin that
we need in this office,"

894
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,050
"and we present this award to her."

895
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,700
Thank you.

896
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm qualified
to receive this award.

897
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:52,480
But from now on, I'll consider it
as a motivator to work harder,

898
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:54,870
and accept it happily.

899
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,420
Thank you!

900
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,260
Listening to Ms. Oh's speech like this,

901
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,180
doesn't it seem like the
year-end award ceremony on TV?

902
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:07,610
She should've just kept that dress on.

903
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,110
All right. Let's wrap up now.

904
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:19,840
Yes. I'll adjust the schedule
with the prosecution and call you.

905
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,910
Okay.

906
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:25,110
We ran out of beer,
so I'm bringing some more.

907
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,470
You look very happy today.

908
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,660
Yes, I am.

909
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,180
Everything is a first time for me,
and it's so exciting.

910
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,260
And everyone seems so nice.
They're all nice to me.

911
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,820
- I want to be nice too...
- What are you doing there?

912
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:43,590
Why are you all coming back?

913
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,450
It's a little chilly,
and everyone seems tired.

914
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,530
Are we calling it a night already?

915
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,740
- Let's go inside.
- Let's go.

916
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,740
I think something's inside my eye.
Does anyone have a mirror?

917
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,460
- I don't have one.
- I have one.

918
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,250
Really? Can I borrow it?

919
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,610
Gosh.

920
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:05,550
Your mirror is beautiful
just like its owner.

921
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,460
I'll use it well and give it back to you.

922
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,740
Let's go inside.

923
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:13,830
Let's go.

924
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,240
Are we going to sleep?

925
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:25,910
I don't want to sleep already.

926
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,110
Then we should chat a little
before we go to sleep.

927
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,820
By the way, don't you guys
crave something spicy?

928
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:34,390
We kept eating meat,
so my stomach feels a little greasy.

929
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,690
Then how about we have some spicy noodles?

930
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,930
I bought the ingredients earlier...

931
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,630
because I thought we might have
it for a late-night snack.

932
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,520
You're the best, Ms. Yang.

933
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:46,230
You're so well-prepared just
like how you are at work.

934
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,250
Wait here.

935
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,980
Okay.

936
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,970
Ms. Dan, why aren't you eating?

937
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,520
You don't look so well either.

938
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,090
Is there something wrong?

939
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:06,350
I think she broke up with her boyfriend.

940
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:10,080
How did you know that?

941
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,960
It's pretty obvious.

942
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,390
You're always looking at your cell phone...

943
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,300
waiting for your boyfriend to text you.

944
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,600
But now, you're just staring into space...

945
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:18,970
and constantly sighing.

946
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,790
And that means you no longer have
a boyfriend that will text you.

947
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,860
What... What happened? You seemed so happy.

948
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:32,480
Well, it turns out that
he never actually liked me.

949
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,820
He was only using me because
he was facing a lawsuit...

950
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,550
- with a building owner.
- What a crazy jerk.

951
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,170
I'm surprised to hear an actress
say something like that.

952
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,230
I mean... It just makes me so angry.

953
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,330
Ms. Dan liked him so much. Right, Ms. Dan?

954
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:53,330
How could he think of using
her pure feelings for him?

955
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,790
I'm never going to fall in love again.

956
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:58,380
From now on, my heart will be...

957
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,560
taking a temporary break.

958
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,330
There aren't any more towels
left in the bathroom.

959
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:12,590
This was the last one.

960
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,400
My gosh, Jong Hwa.

961
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,830
Then you should've dried yourself
with your own clothes or something.

962
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,170
What are they going to use then?

963
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,710
Gosh, stop overreacting.

964
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,270
I heard there are a lot of towels
in the ladies' accommodation.

965
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,540
You should ask them to bring us some.

966
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,670
Okay, sir. I'll call them right now.

967
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,850
Yes, it's no big deal.

968
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,640
What are you looking at?
You've been smiling for so long.

969
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,500
Oh, this? I'm looking at the
group photo we took earlier.

970
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,970
Isn't Ms. Oh so pretty?

971
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,430
She's so pretty. On top of that,
she's really nice too.

972
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,960
And she's pure at heart.

973
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,360
I already liked her,
but I like her even more now.

974
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,790
I know, right?

975
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,620
I wonder what kind of guy
she'll end up dating.

976
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,260
Now that we're on the subject,

977
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:03,160
I actually searched Ms. Oh's
ideal type of guy on the web.

978
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:05,580
And apparently,

979
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:09,680
she likes guys who're
able to touch her heart.

980
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,120
My goodness gracious.
I'm exactly that kind of guy.

981
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,690
I bought her a fish cake bar
at the rest area earlier.

982
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,790
And I even gave her some vin chaud.
She would've been so touched.

983
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,990
What are you talking about?

984
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:23,160
You only got her one fish cake bar.

985
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:25,730
And that sin chaud... I mean vin chaud...

986
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,340
You brought that for yourself,
and you only gave her a sip.

987
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,730
I'm probably the one who touched her heart.

988
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,640
How many fish cake bars did I get her?
A bouquet.

989
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,770
I even gave her my jacket because
I didn't want her to catch a cold.

990
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,110
And lastly, I even gave her award.

991
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:43,760
I practically hit three
consecutive home runs.

992
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:46,630
You're incredible, sir.

993
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,300
I only got her one fish cake bar
and an electric handwarmer.

994
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,100
I was the one who pointed out
that she has a dry throat.

995
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,350
But that's not enough, is it?

996
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,740
- Of course, it's not enough.
- That's too weak.

997
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,900
You should've done better.

998
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,430
I personally think I'm
the strongest candidate.

999
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,260
But one thing's for sure.
Jung Rok definitely isn't her ideal type.

1000
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,180
- What?
- It's obvious.

1001
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,570
Who's the one that least
touched her heart today?

1002
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,490
It's you.

1003
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,010
You're already pretty
indifferent to her at work.

1004
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:15,430
But try to look back on how
you treated her today.

1005
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,670
Were you nice to her or not?
No, you weren't.

1006
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,610
Mr. Kwon, you're out.

1007
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:22,270
Jung Rok, you're out.

1008
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,080
- You're not her ideal type.
- You're out.

1009
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:27,090
And since you're out,
you should go get the sheets.

1010
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,360
Let's get rid of this and sleep.

1011
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:32,730
- Go get the sheets.
- Okay.

1012
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,860
Jung Rok's handsome,

1013
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,760
- but he's too haughty.
- I agree.

1014
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,870
Look at her. We didn't even use
a filter, but her skin is perfect.

1015
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,900
Why are you wearing this to sleep?
Are these your pajamas?

1016
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,240
I'm going to get changed soon.

1017
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,380
What's the matter?

1018
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,040
- What's wrong?
- You asked for the sheets.

1019
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:50,320
So I was in a rush to get them for you.

1020
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,880
I guess I was in too much of a rush.

1021
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,280
Yes, that was too much.

1022
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,800
- My hair's all ruined. My gosh.
- What's his problem?

1023
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,950
Hey, can I borrow a mirror?

1024
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:02,130
Actually, I have a mirror that
I borrowed from Yun Seo...

1025
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,370
I put it in here.

1026
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,380
I'm pretty sure I got it
from her and put it in here.

1027
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,990
Gosh, I must've dropped it.
This is driving me crazy.

1028
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:15,310
My goodness, where did it go?

1029
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,770
Ms. Yang, do you not want to date anyone?

1030
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:21,280
That's out of the question.

1031
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,990
I'm so busy with work and
taking care of the household.

1032
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,520
And I should use my extra
time to take care of Jin Hee.

1033
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,490
But what if there's a guy
who knows your situation...

1034
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:36,240
and also understands everything?

1035
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,560
Don't you think it'd be okay
to open up to a guy like that?

1036
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,330
I'm not sure. I'm not really confident...

1037
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:43,870
about dating someone again.

1038
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,270
You know what?

1039
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:53,940
How about we have some drinks?

1040
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:59,210
What's that?

1041
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,420
Ta-da.

1042
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:03,280
What's this? Did you bring wine?

1043
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,530
It looks really expensive.

1044
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,760
To be honest, I brought it with me...

1045
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,220
because I thought there'd
be a party tonight.

1046
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,810
And I feel like now is just the
right moment to drink this.

1047
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,330
I personally hope you'll end up...

1048
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,570
meeting a really nice guy, Ms. Yang.

1049
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,860
And Ms. Dan, you should cheer up.

1050
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,720
The moment we go back to Seoul,
we should take revenge on that jerk.

1051
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,840
- Revenge?
- Yes, we should do something.

1052
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,770
Should I write "Jerk"
on the walls of his cafe?

1053
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,700
Thank you, Ms. Oh.

1054
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,580
You cussed him out, and you're even
willing to take revenge for me.

1055
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:44,520
Now that we're all badmouthing him,

1056
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,900
I think I feel a bit better.

1057
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:51,130
Anyway, it's nice to
talk about my feelings.

1058
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:54,330
I'm really enjoying this as well.

1059
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,920
To be frank, I've been a celebrity
for a really long time,

1060
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:02,840
but I never had a friend to talk to,
and I was quite lonely.

1061
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,010
But on TV,

1062
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,950
you seemed really close
with other actresses...

1063
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:10,290
such as Kim Min Ji and Yang Soo Jin.

1064
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:13,000
- Aren't you close with them?
- That was all just for show.

1065
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,600
I don't even know their phone numbers.

1066
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,500
- Can you give me your cell phone?
- What?

1067
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,250
This is my number.

1068
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,440
I'm not really good with words,

1069
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,890
and there's not much I can do for you,

1070
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,120
but you can at least call me
whenever you crave spicy noodles.

1071
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,850
Let's all clink glasses.

1072
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,370
- Cheers.
- Okay.

1073
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:47,790
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1074
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:50,930
Bottoms up.

1075
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,780
That's right. The best revenge...

1076
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,100
is to get over him and live a better life.

1077
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:07,060
I'll meet a guy who's far better than him.

1078
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:31,570
I'm sorry. I thought this place was empty.

1079
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:34,870
I'm glad you're here.
I didn't want to reuse my towel.

1080
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:36,500
Nice timing.

1081
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,130
You should be careful.

1082
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:09,210
Mr. Kwon, what are you up to?

1083
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,730
Are you asleep?

1084
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,750
Ms. Oh.

1085
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:16,380
Mr. Yeon, you're still up.

1086
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,170
My gosh.

1087
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,750
I'm so sorry.

1088
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,350
- What is it?
- Well,

1089
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,490
I think I lost the mirror you gave me.

1090
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:27,390
I remember putting it in my pocket,

1091
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,290
but I think I must've dropped it somewhere.

1092
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,330
- What do I do?
- It's all right.

1093
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,260
It's nothing important,
so don't worry about it.

1094
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,900
I can always buy you another mirror.

1095
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,580
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1096
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:42,380
I worried about nothing then.

1097
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:44,440
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

1098
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:45,970
It's all right.
You should get some sleep now.

1099
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:47,470
Good night, Ms. Oh.

1100
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:48,520
You too.

1101
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:10,430
It's okay. It's only a mirror.

1102
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,670
I had fun today. It's all that matters.

1103
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:33,500
(Mr. Kwon, what are you up to?
Are you asleep?)

1104
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,480
Ms. Oh.

1105
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,220
Mr. Kwon?

1106
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,110
What are you doing out here at this hour?

1107
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,830
I thought you were in bed.

1108
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:06,140
I have insomnia,
so I have trouble sleeping.

1109
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:09,040
I came outside to get some fresh air.

1110
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,370
I had something to look for too.

1111
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,420
So what are you doing out here this late?

1112
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:16,740
Well...

1113
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:25,450
My gosh. How...

1114
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,090
I overheard Mr. Yeon saying
that he had lost it.

1115
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,720
You said it was your lucky charm,

1116
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,730
so I wanted to find it for you.

1117
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,890
Were you out here this
late looking for this?

1118
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,570
Thank you, Mr. Kwon.

1119
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,220
I was finally able to do something for you.

1120
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:51,460
What?

1121
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,700
Truth be told, I wanted to do...

1122
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,090
nice things for you.

1123
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,500
I wanted to give you what you want...

1124
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,700
and also anything you lack.

1125
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:03,550
I wanted to do so,

1126
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,580
but I kept losing my chance.

1127
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:12,240
I want to be the one who makes you laugh,

1128
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:15,030
but others keep beating me to it.

1129
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,540
That's why I've been depressed.

1130
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,160
Mr. Kwon, are you being...

1131
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,210
jealous?

1132
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,500
Yes, that's right. I'm jealous.

1133
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,180
I thought that jealousy...

1134
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,950
was a pointless emotion.

1135
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:42,330
However, it's hard to control
your emotions when you like someone.

1136
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:51,970
Why are you looking at me like that?

1137
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,170
Do I seem childish?

1138
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,010
No, I quite like it.

1139
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,900
It sounds as if you like me so much...

1140
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,900
that it's hard to control your emotions.

1141
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,550
I couldn't be happier.

1142
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,860
Mr. Kwon,

1143
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,210
can I...

1144
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:26,950
kiss you?

1145
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,630
What?

1146
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,910
Here?

1147
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,060
Why would you ask first though?

1148
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:46,170
You were just so adorable right now.

1149
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:51,580
When you kiss me, you don't have to ask.

1150
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:54,940
If you want to, I mean.

1151
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,040
It's cold. We should head inside.

1152
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,130
You said I shouldn't ask.

1153
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:27,190
♫ <i>So much that I don't know</i> ♫

1154
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:33,040
♫ <i>Honestly, it's hard</i> ♫

1155
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,310
♫ <i>I don't know the right timing</i> ♫

1156
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:40,950
♫ <i>Why do things keep messing up?</i> ♫

1157
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,150
♫ <i>My heart has slow footsteps</i> ♫

1158
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:51,400
♫ <i>So with all my strength, I chased after you</i> ♫

1159
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,310
♫ <i>Each step you take</i> ♫

1160
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:59,860
♫ <i>I'm right there so why are you hesitating?</i> ♫

1161
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:09,100
♫ <i>Oh love, love is, what is it, what is love?</i> ♫

1162
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:16,700
♫ <i>Oh love, what do I do? What if love?</i> ♫

1163
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,870
(Touch Your Heart)

1164
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:22,340
Ms. Oh. No, Jin Sim. Jin Sim!

1165
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:24,340
You're very pretty.

1166
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,550
Who are you? The Kwon I know
doesn't speak sweetly like that.

1167
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:30,180
Won't our colleagues grow suspicious of us?

1168
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:31,650
We should be careful.

1169
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:34,420
Is there a reason why you
drove her home today?

1170
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:35,560
That's enough!

1171
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,040
Why on earth can't you eat alone?

1172
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,540
I'll help you, so let's practice.

1173
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:43,990
You'll be leaving the law firm
in about a month.

1174
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,730
Mr. Kwon, will you be upset
when Ms. Oh leaves?

1175
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:50,300
I learned that you
shouldn't keep secrets...

1176
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:52,270
from those close to you.

1177
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:54,170
Where is Lee Gang Joon again?

1178
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:56,100
How on earth did he know where I was?

1179
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,760
Ms. Oh's problem is now my problem too.
