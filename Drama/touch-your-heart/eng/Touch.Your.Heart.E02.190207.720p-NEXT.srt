1
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,850
Hold on.

2
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,600
I just want to ask this.

3
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,790
Do you perhaps hate women?

4
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,700
What?

5
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,900
I mean...

6
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,270
Well...

7
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,570
Do you hate women?

8
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,740
I'm sorry I don't match your expectations.

9
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,380
What are you doing?

10
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,890
I...

11
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,190
like women.

12
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,930
I like them a lot.

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,960
I really do.

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,000
It's just that...

15
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,280
I'm not at all interested
in you particularly.

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,460
Can you please leave my office now?

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,610
Hey.

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,440
Let me give you a word of advice
since you love women so much.

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,440
You should change your personality.

20
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,160
No woman would want to be with
someone so fussy and sensitive.

21
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,130
I won't ever ask you
to like me, so don't worry.

22
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,050
Who says I'm worried?

23
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,370
You better stick to what you just said.

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,490
What's wrong? Are you not confident?

25
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,630
No, it's because I don't have time.

26
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,620
I really need to find the documents
that you lost, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,050
My name is Oh Yun Seo, okay?
It's Oh Yun Seo!

28
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,970
Hey, Ms. Oh. We're having
a welcoming party for you...

29
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,950
Did I do something wrong?

30
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,520
I think it's because she
had a fight with Mr. Kwon.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,070
Why? Are they not on good terms?

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,910
How would I know?

33
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,270
Then why did you just assume
that they had a fight?

34
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,050
No reason.

35
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,880
- What was that?
- What was that?

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,120
(Episode 2)

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,460
Kwon Jung Rok, you son of a gun!

38
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,820
You darn little jerk!

39
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,860
You obnoxious son of a gun!

40
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,450
I'm so angry at him!

41
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,540
Gosh, it's cold.

42
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,090
This is what Vivien Leigh said...

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,050
in "Gone with the Wind".

44
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,510
"After all, tomorrow is another day."

45
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,890
Gosh, it's cold.

46
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,240
I really want to just
disappear with the wind.

47
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,360
Jung Rok, what are you doing?
Are you looking for something?

48
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,070
No, it's nothing.

49
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,790
By any chance, did you fight with Yun Seo?

50
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,590
- No, we didn't.
- But then again,

51
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,690
why would you fight with such
an incredible secretary?

52
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,560
You know that I rarely
compliment people, right?

53
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,910
But I can't help but compliment Yun Seo.

54
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,790
Her looks and personality are
all nothing but perfect.

55
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,010
She'd be better off with me since
I'm far more perfect than you.

56
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,470
Don't you think Mr. Yeon assigned
her to the wrong attorney?

57
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,300
- Did you come here to tell me that?
- My goodness, I almost forgot.

58
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,490
I came to return this to you. Thank you.

59
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,360
- Why do you have this?
- What's your problem?

60
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,210
I told you yesterday that
I'll be borrowing it...

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,480
Oh, right.

62
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,460
I was going to tell you
when you came, but I totally forgot.

63
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,820
Why did you take my stuff
without even telling me?

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,610
I'm sorry. I have to file a request
for a preliminary injunction...

65
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,450
against a transfer of possession.

66
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,170
So I took a look at
that case for reference.

67
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,790
I was going to tell you,
but I forgot because I was so busy.

68
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,310
I hope you'll forgive me since
we're both very busy people.

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,460
(Application for Injunction
Against Transfer of Property)

70
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,720
(Things To Do In The Morning!)

71
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,210
I'm meeting with a client
straight after court today.

72
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,470
Whatever.

73
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,380
Also...

74
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,350
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,820
About what?

76
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,560
The files you misplaced...

77
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,170
I mean, the files I thought
you had misplaced...

78
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,410
were taken by Mr. Choi.

79
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,860
What?

80
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,790
I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions.

81
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,920
Hold on a second. Are you saying...

82
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,550
that it was your fault and not mine?

83
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,970
Is that it?

84
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,650
Yes, I apologize...

85
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,680
Do you think that'll cut it?

86
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,480
I'm already hurt,

87
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,460
so an apology won't fly.

88
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,130
If those files were that important,

89
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,520
you should've been more careful with them.

90
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,550
Why yell at me for something you did wrong?

91
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,050
Anyway, from now on,
refrain from those kinds...

92
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,320
of imprudent actions.

93
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,010
If I clear your desk,

94
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,250
appreciate it rather than
being prickly about it.

95
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,870
I don't think so.

96
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,410
I apologize for my hasty actions,

97
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,680
but I organize my desk
according to a system,

98
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,560
so don't touch it ever again.

99
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,840
Then...

100
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,640
Then?

101
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,670
What was that?
Is that supposed to be an apology?

102
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,080
Gosh.

103
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,430
Mr. Kwon, don't forget
about Ms. Oh's welcoming party.

104
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,340
I already said I'm meeting with a client.

105
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,920
How could you not be there?

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,340
She's your secretary, isn't she?

107
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,200
Right, so who made plans without
checking with me first?

108
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,090
I did.

109
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,660
You wouldn't have come
even if you were free.

110
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,920
She'll be disappointed if you're not there,

111
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,040
so don't forget it.

112
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,600
Sir, please!

113
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,350
Please hear me out.

114
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,060
Save it. You're not the
only attorney, you know.

115
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,580
How dare you make me sound like a criminal!

116
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,400
But sir, wait!

117
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,640
I'm sorry, sir.

118
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,270
He's a man of money who's
refusing to pay his taxes.

119
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,690
Lady Justice in me just popped out.

120
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,610
You did well. Being just is important.

121
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,270
Who cares if we earn less?
We'll only fall behind on rent.

122
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,800
We may have to move out,
but we'll still have our conscience.

123
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,380
You did good, all right?
Do you get my gist?

124
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,590
The doors are closing.

125
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,360
The evidence seems definitive.

126
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,300
The sentence won't be less than 15 years.

127
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,770
Right. Good job.

128
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
- Wrap it up nicely then.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,110
Sir, it's about the woman
who stabbed her husband.

130
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,410
Let me take the case.

131
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,910
I'll have her behind bars.

132
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,150
What case is that?

133
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,050
She stabbed and killed her husband,

134
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,980
and it turns out that her
former husband died in a fire.

135
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,270
I smell something fishy.

136
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,130
There might've been foul
play there as well.

137
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,730
What reasons do you have
for your speculations?

138
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,390
I checked the investigation log,

139
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,400
and she seemed like a temptress.

140
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,630
I hear that Kim Se Won will be back.

141
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,610
He starts work again tomorrow.
Didn't you hear?

142
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Haven't you been in touch
since the breakup?

143
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,440
Don't cause any trouble.

144
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,180
I don't care about your personal affairs,

145
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,470
but I won't let you
disgrace this office again.

146
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,560
Right, I'm sorry.

147
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,540
First floor.

148
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,000
It's been a while.

149
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,570
Right.

150
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,320
I heard the news.

151
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,170
You're back at the office.

152
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,710
Yes, so it seems.

153
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,260
How have you been?

154
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,460
Good, thanks to you.

155
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,880
Did you just meet with
the chief prosecutor?

156
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,540
Yes.

157
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,670
Have you had lunch?

158
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,980
Yes.

159
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,090
Well, you should eat up. You seem gaunt.

160
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,490
A welcoming party?

161
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,840
Must you attend that?

162
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,080
What if you get drunk and make a mistake?

163
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,050
Don't worry. I'll watch my intake.

164
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,630
I at least should have a glass
since the party's for me.

165
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,080
Anyway, I'll call you when it's over.

166
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,350
All right. I'll be waiting...

167
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,000
somewhere in the vicinity, so call me.

168
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,720
Don't drink too much, all right?

169
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,290
I heard you.

170
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,860
Hyuk Joon, I'm Oh Yun Seo.

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,020
Do you really think that
I'd make a fool of myself?

172
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,640
I'll maintain my elegant and refined image,

173
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,580
so don't you worry.

174
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,910
What I'm saying...

175
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,280
is that I just want to do my best.

176
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,490
I only want a compliment, that's all.

177
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,690
That's why I did what I did.

178
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,150
You know that, right?

179
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,780
Yes, of course I know
the hard work you put in.

180
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,910
You seem to have drank a
little too much though.

181
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,360
But Mr. Choi...

182
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,480
yelled at me and even belittled me.

183
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,910
Could he perhaps have anger issues?

184
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,270
I guess you can say that.

185
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,810
Earlier today, I made a mistake
anybody can easily make,

186
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,720
but his face still turned sour.

187
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,510
Right? That's how he is!

188
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,880
That's what I'm saying.

189
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,740
Anyway,

190
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,390
why on earth...

191
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,400
is Mr. Kwon not here?

192
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,170
There's something I need to say to him.

193
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,720
She's out.

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,180
Gosh, she seems wasted.

195
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,050
We'll have to wait until
she sobers up a bit.

196
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,750
Poor Ms. Oh though.

197
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,330
She and Mr. Kwon must not be getting along.

198
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,860
Sir, this is what I've been talking about.

199
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,950
This wouldn't have happened had
you sent her to me instead.

200
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,460
I would've mentored her
and helped her adapt.

201
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,400
- And date her.
- Yes, and date her.

202
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,020
Seriously, Ms. Dan?

203
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,030
I'm sorry. I just thought that you...

204
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,560
were interested in her.

205
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,210
I can't say that I'm not.

206
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,670
Why would you be?
How dare you be interested in her?

207
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,220
How dare I? It's not that I lack anything.

208
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,110
I have good looks,
a great personality, money, and talent.

209
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,110
- Also, I'm a good son.
- A mama's boy.

210
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,450
Yes, I'm a mama's boy.

211
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,350
Ms. Dan, are you trying
to get on my nerves?

212
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,000
No, of course not. Why would I?
I'm sorry about that.

213
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,250
What's wrong with me?

214
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,440
Will it be okay to continue like this?

215
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,530
Her and Mr. Kwon, I mean.

216
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,140
According to the tabloids,

217
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,830
Ms. Oh is said to have quite the temper.

218
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,190
What if she tears the office apart one day?

219
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,640
Don't worry. Before that happens,

220
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,770
I'll do my job as CEO
and mediate their dispute.

221
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,640
Anyway, where is Mr. Kwon?

222
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,010
Is he here?

223
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,870
Where is he?

224
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,280
Mr. Kwon?

225
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,620
What happened to your face?

226
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,430
Is it the alcohol?

227
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,670
You're looking scarier by the minute.

228
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,490
It's in your best interest to
settle instead of going to trial.

229
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,410
Yes, of course.

230
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,350
I'm a man who's looked up to by
his peers and in his community.

231
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,840
I don't want to look bad
by suing someone...

232
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,320
over an issue with a dog.

233
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,650
However, because of that dog barking,

234
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,010
my kid can't focus on his studies.

235
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,630
He still hasn't been
accepted into university.

236
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,520
I see.

237
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,770
He's already at his fourth attempt.
If he...

238
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,710
I'm sorry, but that's all I have time for.

239
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,890
Why?

240
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,650
Well, at least have a drink with me.

241
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,080
It's a rule of mine not
to drink with clients.

242
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,510
Also...

243
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,520
(CEO Yeon Joon Gyu)

244
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,980
I'll sit down with the
opposing attorney shortly.

245
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,190
All right then.
Now let me pour you a drink.

246
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,840
I'm sorry, but you'll have to excuse me.

247
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,280
Good night.

248
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,160
All right.

249
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,860
Mom, what do you think of a
celebrity for a daughter-in-law?

250
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,010
What? Over your dead body?

251
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,770
But mom... Why must you be so drastic?

252
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,600
Please allow it.

253
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,740
I'll see you at home then, Mother.

254
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,850
Are we going for round two?

255
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,820
There's a wine bar across the street.

256
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,850
Let's turn in for the night.

257
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,030
Everyone's exhausted,
and Ms. Oh's still drunk.

258
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,360
But it's too early to call it a night.

259
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,760
So where's Ms. Oh?

260
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,210
Her manager... No, wait a second.

261
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,560
I mean her cousin.

262
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,150
She's on the phone asking
him to pick her up.

263
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,370
- With her cousin.
- I'm sorry, but...

264
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,070
may I go now?

265
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,310
It's almost time for Jin Hee
to get off from academy.

266
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,250
Sure, you should go.

267
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,110
Mr. Lee, you can go too.

268
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,570
- Do you go in the same direction?
- Yes.

269
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,290
Then like the foam on top of today's beer,

270
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,190
I hope you spend a rich and smooth night.

271
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,870
- Good night then.
- Good night.

272
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,180
Hold on. Beer foam?

273
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,890
What did he mean, Mr. Yeon?

274
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,180
I don't know what he meant either.

275
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,600
- Mr. Kwon is here.
- You're here.

276
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,530
- Mr. Kwon.
- You're late.

277
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,930
We waited so long for you.

278
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,090
My meeting took longer than I thought.

279
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,810
Hey. It's Kwon Jung Rok. Kwon Jung Rok.

280
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,210
Mr. Kwon, why are you coming now?

281
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,280
I have so much...

282
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,170
things to tell you!

283
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,980
- Are you drunk?
- I'm not drunk at all.

284
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,370
I am not drunk!

285
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,630
Attorney Kwon Jung Rok.

286
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,690
When we're still sober,

287
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,270
let's go have a serious talk!

288
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,760
Did you just hurl me to the ground?

289
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,650
Kwon Jung Rok.

290
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,870
- What are you doing here?
- I'm starting work tomorrow.

291
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,510
- So?
- I came in a hurry,

292
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,910
and have no place to stay.

293
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,280
- So?
- Let me stay with you.

294
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,380
Did you have dinner? You're late.

295
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,950
- Let's go in.
- Kim Se Won.

296
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,410
What?

297
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,730
I'm freezing right now.

298
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,290
I waited here for two hours.

299
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,910
Let's go in.

300
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,730
Come on. Let's go.

301
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,760
It's so warm and nice in here.

302
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,760
Gosh.

303
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,020
I heard you hired a new secretary.
Was it a welcoming party?

304
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,190
- How did you know?
- Joon Gyu told me.

305
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,450
That she's an amazing woman.

306
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,530
- Did he tell you who she is?
- No.

307
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,450
Why? Do you know her?

308
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,810
You don't have to know.

309
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,060
Why? Who is it?

310
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,990
What about Yeo Reum? Did you meet her?

311
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,650
Briefly.

312
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,300
She didn't even look at me properly.

313
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,990
What were you expecting?

314
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,130
I guess so.

315
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,260
She lost weight.

316
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,260
- Did she?
- And she's still pretty.

317
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,380
This place is perfect for two.
Shall we just live together?

318
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,980
If you can sleep on the couch
with no blanket, suit yourself.

319
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,350
How about next to you?

320
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,020
- Can you get lost?
- No. I'm going to stay.

321
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,910
Do you have beer in the fridge?
Of course you do.

322
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,720
- This is humiliating. My goodness!
- Calm down, Yun Seo.

323
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,820
Yun Seo, calm down a bit.

324
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,450
What do you mean, humiliating?

325
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,620
An actress should never feel that way!

326
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,880
Why? Isn't this the best way to
express how I feel right now?

327
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,800
I was so humiliated earlier,
and I really wanted to die.

328
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,080
I understand.

329
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,140
Kwon Jung Rok, that jerk.

330
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,940
How could he hurl me to the ground?

331
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,990
When I heard it,
he didn't actually hurl you down.

332
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,310
Right. If that jerk just
grabbed you at that moment,

333
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,850
you wouldn't have fallen
down so pitifully like that.

334
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,820
Does it cost money to grab
someone from falling or what?

335
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,080
That cheap lawyer.

336
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,280
- That's what I'm saying!
- Yes.

337
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,090
I won't just forget about this.

338
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,590
I'm going to get revenge on him.

339
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,680
How will you get revenge? Goodness.

340
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,200
I'll avenge you!

341
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,160
What should I do?
Should I chop him up to pieces?

342
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,540
No. I'll do it myself.

343
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,890
- You'll chop him up to pieces?
- Not that.

344
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,450
I'll become the perfect secretary,

345
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,800
and make him someone who can't
do anything without me.

346
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,860
After I suddenly quit after three months,

347
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,570
he'll realize how important
I was and cry miserably.

348
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,450
That sounds like getting
revenge on an ex-boyfriend.

349
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,760
I'm going to crush you, Kwon Jung Rok.

350
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,580
I will get my revenge and make him pay!

351
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,400
- The office will be empty, right?
- Of course.

352
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,030
Work starts at 9am, and it's just 8am now.

353
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,180
It will be embarrassing
if you bump into anyone,

354
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,020
so go to your office and just stay put.

355
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,340
Right. I was going to focus
on my work like crazy anyway,

356
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,110
so I'll stay in my office
and focus on nothing but work.

357
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,280
Focus? Wow, I like that word.

358
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,140
Good idea. Yun Seo,

359
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,850
you should work like crazy today!

360
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,450
Ready...

361
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,840
I hope she doesn't go too crazy.

362
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,570
What are you...

363
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,140
I was picking this up.

364
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,480
Are you all right?

365
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,860
Of course I am.

366
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,650
Ms. Oh.

367
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,110
- Good morning.
- Hello.

368
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,760
Good morning.

369
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,800
Right. Are you okay?
Didn't you get a bruise?

370
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,460
No, I'm fine.

371
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,830
- What do you mean?
- Oh...

372
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,560
Ms. Oh totally flopped to
the ground last night.

373
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,190
Flopped to the ground?

374
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,170
Well, Mr. Kwon joined us
a bit late last night,

375
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,400
and Ms. Oh went running up to him
saying she had something to say.

376
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
But she suddenly lost balance...

377
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,340
and started to stumble
around here and there.

378
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,640
Mr. Kwon didn't grab her and
just dodged her, so she fell down.

379
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,350
Oh my gosh. Mr. Kwon dodged her?

380
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,010
- Yes.
- Isn't it so disappointing?

381
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,580
So Ms. Oh tried desperately
not to fall down.

382
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,040
She pushed a trashcan and ran
to the end of the hallway,

383
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,850
but eventually fell down.

384
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,320
But I don't understand.

385
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,910
What do you mean,
she pushed a trashcan and ran?

386
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,520
Well, that's...

387
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,050
It was like this.

388
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,530
Stop it.

389
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,540
Oh... I'm sorry.

390
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,810
I just wanted to help her understand.

391
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,070
Don't worry about it. It's all right.

392
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,810
Excuse me.

393
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,870
Gosh, this is so humiliating.

394
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,090
Wait. Why did they all come so early?

395
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,460
- Mr. Kwon.
- Yes.

396
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,240
You were so mean.

397
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,950
Seriously, so mean.

398
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,420
Why did you act like that last night?

399
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,570
What do you mean?

400
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,140
You really don't know?

401
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,470
You should've grabbed Yun Seo.
How could you...

402
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,130
How could you just dodge like that?

403
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,760
When did I lift my leg like that?

404
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,220
- I just turned slightly.
- You turned and lifted your leg.

405
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,820
If someone is about to fall,
it's an instinct to grab him. Look.

406
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,640
Like instinct. You should've caught that.
Why are you dodging?

407
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,070
My goodness.

408
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,790
Anyway, it's a relief we were alone.
What if someone else saw?

409
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,620
People might post pictures and
try to humiliate Yun Seo.

410
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,360
Anyway, I don't know if Yun Seo
will be able to handle this.

411
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,800
An actress like her being humiliated
in front of all those people.

412
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,570
What if she says she won't
come to work from now on?

413
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,920
She might not come to work?

414
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,480
What is that face?
Are you looking forward to it?

415
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,250
If Yun Seo stops coming to work,
you should stop coming too.

416
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,810
- Are you serious?
- I was joking.

417
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,660
Be nice to her. Okay?

418
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,090
Please, be nice to her.

419
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,520
Come on, be a nice guy.

420
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,590
Anyway, be nice to her for
my cousin's sake at least.

421
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,530
I've never even seen your cousin.

422
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,820
He looks cute.

423
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,800
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

424
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,170
- Hi, Mr. Yeon.
- Hello.

425
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,240
I didn't know you were
so merciless, Mr. Kwon.

426
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,530
I'm so disappointed in you.

427
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,080
I also heard what happened,

428
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,770
and it sounded like you were
a little mean yesterday.

429
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,990
He wasn't a little mean.
He was really mean.

430
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,190
Yun Seo seemed really upset today.

431
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,030
What are you going to do now?

432
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,230
Instead of getting a bouquet of
flowers on her welcoming party,

433
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,970
she got a bouquet of humiliation.
So of course, she's upset.

434
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,300
Why did you do that to her?

435
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,540
I'm sorry. I'd like to apologize...

436
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,970
if I upset you.

437
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,630
Good morning, Mr. Kwon.

438
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,920
Yes, good morning.

439
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,050
Would you like a cup of coffee?

440
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,530
No, it's okay.

441
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,430
If there's anything you need,
feel free to tell me.

442
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,770
I made up my mind to become
a perfect secretary...

443
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,910
starting from today.

444
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,910
About yesterday...

445
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,440
What's this? Is he trying to apologize?

446
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,790
I'll gladly accept his apology.

447
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,990
You were really drunk yesterday.

448
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,270
It wasn't a pleasant sight to see.

449
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,830
- What?
- I think you should refrain...

450
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,520
from drinking too much from now on.

451
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,040
What kind of nonsense...

452
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,150
You should be apologizing to me,
not giving me advice.

453
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,420
Apologize?

454
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,000
I fell down yesterday...

455
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,270
because of you.

456
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,350
To be exact, it wasn't because of me.

457
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,180
You fell on your own.

458
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,380
So are you telling me...

459
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,520
that you did nothing wrong?

460
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,220
I do feel a sense of moral responsibility.

461
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,210
Moral responsibility?

462
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,140
Negligent homicide.

463
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,700
You stepped to the side
even when you knew...

464
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,630
that I could get injured
if you didn't grab me.

465
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,370
You neglected a person who
was too drunk to even stand.

466
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,940
You know some stuff about law.

467
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,110
Well, I went to law school.

468
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,810
That's not the main point.

469
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,250
If you have a counterargument,
I'd like to hear it.

470
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,410
Then what about the fact that
you drank until you got wasted?

471
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,790
- Pardon?
- I'm sure you already knew...

472
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,470
that it would've been dangerous
to drink that much yesterday.

473
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,080
And that can also be considered
as gross negligence.

474
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,280
Bye, then.

475
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,220
"Bye, then"? Seriously?

476
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,660
He's so annoying.

477
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,000
How does it feel to be back?

478
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,460
I'm just grateful that you
asked me to come back.

479
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,480
I guess this is why they
say connections matter.

480
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,610
Did you look at all the case files?

481
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,950
I'm sorry for bombarding you
with work as soon as you're here.

482
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,480
Isn't that why you asked me to return?

483
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,320
By the way, isn't CEO Jung Ji Ho...

484
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,740
the guy that recently got indicted...

485
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,060
for gambling abroad?

486
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,440
Yes, Prosecutor Park is
in charge of that case.

487
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,760
Meanwhile, I want you to
check for embezzlement.

488
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,070
Is there any evidence?

489
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,130
Someone reported it to us.
There were rumors about it before,

490
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,440
but we couldn't indict him.

491
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,900
- Why not?
- Why do you think?

492
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,970
Are you trying to make me take
full responsibility for it?

493
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,890
No, it's just that no one would
be able to investigate it...

494
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,820
unless it's a lunatic like you.

495
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,300
Well, if that's how highly you think of me,

496
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,420
I'll do my best to dig up what I can.

497
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,680
You won't be able to do it alone.

498
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,410
I'll send someone who can help,
so give it your best shot.

499
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,540
Thank you, sir.

500
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,480
Sir, by any chance,

501
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,980
are you Prosecutor Kim Se Won?

502
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,410
Yes, I'm Kim Se Won.

503
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,850
Hello, sir.

504
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,480
I'm Kim Hyung Sik, your investigator.

505
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,390
I'm Yoo Hyun Ji, an administrative staff.

506
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,610
I look forward to working with you.

507
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Me too.

508
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,390
I'm Prosecutor Lee Joo Yeong.

509
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,890
I helped Prosecutor Park Seo Yeon
with the overseas gambling case,

510
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,740
so I know very well about Jung Ji Ho.

511
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,450
Then we'll be quickly be able to proceed.

512
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,250
Organize your stuff.
Then let's start with a briefing.

513
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,530
We'll have a meeting in three minutes.

514
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,560
Three minutes? How can we
get ready in three minutes?

515
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,910
I did hear rumors about him.

516
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,930
It takes longer to even cook curry.

517
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,960
Exactly.

518
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,450
Hello, this is Always Law Firm.

519
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,530
And you've reached Attorney Kwon's office.

520
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,960
- Yes.
- What's the point of answering?

521
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,660
Yes, just a second.

522
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,660
What are you doing? I forwarded your call.

523
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,830
He's Kim Myung Hwan, your client.

524
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,690
Okay.

525
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,870
Yes, this is Kwon Jung Rok.

526
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,380
Yes, I know.

527
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,520
I'll meet you in an hour.

528
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,080
Okay, bye.

529
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,810
I'm heading out to meet a client.

530
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,610
Okay, go ahead.

531
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,120
I don't think I can eat
lunch with you today.

532
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,090
Okay, don't worry.

533
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,150
I'll take care of my own lunch.

534
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,590
Okay, then.

535
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,700
Gosh, what am I going to eat for lunch?

536
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,520
You want pho? Okay, I'll get it for you.

537
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,860
What was that about?

538
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,640
Yun Seo asked me to get her pho
because she has no one to eat with.

539
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,340
Oh, really? Go ahead and buy her one.

540
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,060
It's not like she asked you to buy
an entire restaurant. Go ahead.

541
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,700
By the way, doesn't Yun Seo
look really pretty...

542
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,710
when she eats something?

543
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,750
She really does eat well.

544
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,820
Right? She's so pretty, isn't she?

545
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,550
That's what made me fall for her.

546
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,050
I signed her right there and then.

547
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,350
Really?

548
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,030
She was really pretty.

549
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,900
I don't think working as a
celebrity manager suits me.

550
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,920
(14 years ago)

551
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,210
Should I just get a loan...

552
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,770
and open a bar?

553
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,640
- Four bungeoppangs, please.
- Okay.

554
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,170
Okay, fine.

555
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,810
Let's have soju one day.

556
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,940
Buy me some drinks.

557
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,070
Okay, bye.

558
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,120
Hey, you just bought
bungeoppang, didn't you?

559
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,520
- No.
- Don't lie to me.

560
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,050
- I don't have any.
- Come on. Let's share.

561
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,310
Let me see.

562
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Here it is. There are four.

563
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:24,300
♫ <i>I love everything,
even the sorrow of this world</i> ♫

564
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:34,210
♫ <i>Being youthful is a good thing,
let's take a look at the sky</i> ♫

565
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,630
♫ <i>Ghada</i> ♫

566
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,720
- Here it is.
- "Here it is."

567
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,390
Yun Seo became a huge star after
shooting that commercial.

568
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,720
And thanks to that,
I also became financially stable.

569
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,260
Time really flies.

570
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,200
I'm...

571
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,040
going to make sure...

572
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,480
Yun Seo gets back on her feet.

573
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,720
I'm suddenly tearing up.

574
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,910
Do you think it's andropause?

575
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,600
Guys with andropause apparently
can't control their emotions.

576
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,330
Oh, really? Shut it.

577
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,650
Who's this?

578
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,750
Hey, Mr. Yoo. What's up?

579
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,960
Oh, really?

580
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,090
Okay, don't worry. Bye.

581
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,550
Min Ji needs to go to the
suburbs on a business trip.

582
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,720
And I need you to go with her.
Mr. Yoo's a little sick.

583
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,620
Then who's going to drive Yun Seo...

584
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,680
Tell her to take a cab.
I mean, you're getting her pho.

585
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,880
Min Ji's on the rise right now.
She deserves our full support.

586
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,100
You're a manager. You should know that.

587
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,240
What's wrong? Do you feel upset?

588
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,860
It's nice and warm, right?
And the noodles didn't get soggy at all.

589
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,210
I tried really hard to prevent the
noodles from getting soggy...

590
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,580
so you could eat it in its best state.

591
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,950
You're really the best.

592
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,790
I finally feel a little better now.

593
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,170
I guess it was worth my effort.

594
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,910
But why don't you eat lunch
with your colleagues?

595
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,690
How can I eat with them after
what happened yesterday?

596
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,800
Goodness. By the way,
did that rude attorney apologize?

597
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,940
He didn't apologize. Instead,
he told me that he did nothing wrong.

598
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,410
That rude little punk
must be out of his mind.

599
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,280
If I ever run into him,
I'll make sure I teach him a lesson.

600
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,130
Hey!

601
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,320
- What?
- That's him right there.

602
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,220
Who? What are you talking about?

603
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,750
The rude attorney.

604
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,200
What? That little punk...

605
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,240
Hold your temper.

606
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,210
He's really handsome.

607
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,870
He's not handsome.
Take a proper look at him.

608
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,350
I looked again,
and he's still very handsome.

609
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,340
Well, now that I think about it,
he does seem like a weasel.

610
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,750
- Why are you hiding though?
- What?

611
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,510
Isn't it obvious?

612
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,550
My cover story is that
I'm starting anew with this job.

613
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,720
I can't be seen with my manager.

614
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,450
Also, eating pho in the car...

615
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,750
is far from elegant.

616
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,880
I should get going then.

617
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,320
A perfect secretary never
leaves her station.

618
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,420
He really is good looking though.

619
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,650
The food here is decent.

620
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,910
We should order in often.

621
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,970
Yes, it's good.

622
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,490
Why doesn't Ms. Oh
join us for meals though?

623
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:51,750
Actually, I don't think
she eats lunch at all.

624
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,830
She must be embarrassed about...

625
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,260
falling down in front of us last night.

626
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,300
Judging by what she said while drunk,

627
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,140
she can't eat alone.

628
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,200
I wonder who she'll eat with today?

629
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,030
Will she just have Job's tears tea again?

630
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,250
I see her drink it for lunch
every time Mr. Kwon isn't around.

631
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,810
- You're back.
- Right.

632
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,610
Why are you standing here though?

633
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,610
Is there something you need?

634
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,070
- Let's go to lunch.
- Sorry?

635
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,860
You probably have a hangover,
so how about pho?

636
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,210
Pho?

637
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,700
I don't think I'll need to.

638
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,680
Really? Why?

639
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,450
- I'm trying to lose weight.
- Lose weight?

640
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,650
Yes, I suddenly felt the need for it.

641
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,140
I see. Then, excuse me.

642
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,900
That was out of the blue.

643
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,460
Couldn't he have asked sooner?

644
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:27,710
♫ <i>I've chosen to be faithful,
I've chosen to obey you</i> ♫

645
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,750
Hold on. What's with her?

646
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,260
You're here.

647
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,630
Yes, hello.

648
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,910
Honey oat bread with honey
mustard sauce, right?

649
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,520
Yes, honey.

650
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,100
Yes, that's my order.

651
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,790
How did you remember it though?

652
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,860
Why wouldn't I? You're a special customer.

653
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,940
A special customer?

654
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,490
You see,

655
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,940
you look so much like my grandmother.

656
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,100
Your grandmother?

657
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,480
You feel like family to me,

658
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,260
so can I call you "Auntie" from now on?

659
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,570
Sure.

660
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,200
Ms. Dan, you can't ignore
a person like this.

661
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,340
Why aren't you acknowledging me?

662
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,200
Please forget everything you saw in there.

663
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,440
What would that be?

664
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,810
I was preoccupied with my sandwich
to notice anything.

665
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,130
- Really?
- Yes.

666
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,410
All I heard was that the
employee you're interested in...

667
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,730
said you looked like his grandmother,

668
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,590
and that he wants to call you
"Auntie" from now on.

669
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,980
Congratulations on your nephew!

670
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,210
That's enough.

671
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,740
Don't be too hurt by it.

672
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:31,040
You'll soon fall in love again...

673
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,680
quite shortly.

674
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,640
That's how you are.

675
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,870
Mr. Kwon, would you like a cup of coffee?

676
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,360
No, I'm good.

677
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,910
It's 3pm, the hour
when people feel most fatigued.

678
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,100
I'll bring a cup over quickly
to improve your productivity.

679
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,330
That's not necessary...

680
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,780
This is humiliating.

681
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,230
Why did I get caught
by Mr. Choi of all people?

682
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,580
Who cares? It's not like it's a first.

683
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,120
What?

684
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,000
If I were prettier,

685
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,700
if I were as pretty and
slender like Oh Yun Seo,

686
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,070
I wouldn't have been treated this way.

687
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,160
I bet she's never been
humiliated like this before.

688
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,010
Of course she hasn't.

689
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,850
Just look at our attorneys.
Also, many male celebrities...

690
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,320
have openly said that
she's their ideal woman.

691
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,650
She was very popular.

692
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,820
Right, no wonder why she was...

693
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,590
rumored to be with the son
of a conglomerate CEO.

694
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,870
- What do you think happened?
- With the drug scandal?

695
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,090
She was ruled as innocent.

696
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,110
No, not that.

697
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,810
I'm curious of her relationship
with the son of a conglomerate CEO.

698
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,230
It's a fact that she was at the scene.

699
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,910
You're right. She wouldn't have
been there with a stranger.

700
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,180
- I saw on a recent tabloid...
- Hi.

701
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,040
I see you two are here.

702
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,020
You must've been enjoying some tea.

703
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,530
I'm here to get a cup
of coffee for Mr. Kwon.

704
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,070
I see.

705
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,670
- You put on makeup today!
- I always put on makeup.

706
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,180
Really?

707
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,050
It looks great today though.

708
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,660
Come in.

709
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,460
Here you go. Please enjoy.

710
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,970
It smells great.

711
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,840
Thank you.

712
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,150
What is it? Is something wrong?

713
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,000
What?

714
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,640
No, of course not.

715
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:31,080
What is it? Did that attorney
give you a hard time again?

716
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,390
I'll tell Mr. Yeon and
have him swap attorneys for you.

717
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,640
It's fine. Like I said,

718
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,570
I'm going to be the best secretary...

719
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,400
and get my revenge on him.

720
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,100
I got him back for many things today.

721
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,890
I connected his calls,
mastered the copy machine,

722
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,560
and even brought him a
perfect cup of coffee.

723
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,110
I'm proud of you.

724
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,750
By the way, you'll be going...

725
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,100
to the office on your own tomorrow.

726
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,390
- I can't pick you up.
- Why not?

727
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,920
I have civil defense training.

728
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,390
What am I supposed to do tomorrow?

729
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,390
Take the cab.

730
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,130
But I don't like them.

731
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,760
I hate when the drivers recognize me too.

732
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:19,520
I know. I was going to get you a driver,

733
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,770
but all the managers are busy tomorrow.

734
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,760
All right.

735
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,290
I'll manage on my own tomorrow,

736
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,910
so good luck on the training.

737
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,470
All right.

738
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,980
- Hold on.
- Yes?

739
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,670
- Did you serve in the military?
- Of course.

740
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,110
What do you take me for?

741
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,330
I served in one of the toughest units.

742
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,420
I guess I've been too gentle with you.

743
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,410
Let me speed up a bit.

744
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,120
You're home early. Have you had dinner?

745
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,240
Not yet.

746
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,820
That's why I waited for you.

747
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,650
Aren't I the perfect roommate?

748
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,900
Don't you wish I'd keep sticking around?

749
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,260
Move out as soon as possible.

750
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,960
Must you be that harsh?

751
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,670
Yeo Reum might ask you out to drinks soon.

752
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,800
She's probably stressed because of me.

753
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,860
- You should...
- Don't drag me into your business.

754
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,880
Come on. Yeo Reum likes you, you know.

755
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,870
She trusts and relies on you.

756
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,150
If that's the case,
she would've chosen me over you.

757
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,950
- Right.
- Don't brag. It's annoying.

758
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,450
Stop being so prickly, will you?

759
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,550
Tone down that temper a little.

760
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,560
If not for me,

761
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,830
there won't be anyone who could endure you.

762
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,160
Your new secretary...

763
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,140
will have a hard time trying
to adjust to your personality.

764
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,390
Whatever.

765
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,620
"Whatever."

766
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,590
(Application for Injunction
Against Transfer of Property)

767
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,180
I can't even spot those I
must review right away.

768
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,300
Did you forget that I told you before
that you could just lounge around?

769
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,870
I'm trying my best here,
so you didn't have to be so mean.

770
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,980
I may not know how to do many things,

771
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,790
but I'm willing to learn, you know.

772
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,180
- I saw on a recent tabloid...
- Tabloid?

773
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,390
Hey. You were all in here.

774
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,590
Have some. It smells nice.

775
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,000
Thank you.

776
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,260
Well. That's how I should drive.

777
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,810
All right. As long as I
don't get nervous...

778
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,930
I'll be able to get there safely.

779
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,330
Ready...

780
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:34,750
Action!

781
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:48,910
All right!

782
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,520
I'm trying my best to go forward.

783
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,650
You better drive properly!

784
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,220
- I want to drive properly too.
- Roll down your window.

785
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,360
Roll down your window. Roll it down!

786
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,010
- I'm almost there. Come on.
- Get out of the car!

787
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,270
Hey! I told you to get off the car!

788
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,880
You're not getting off?
Fine, you're dead now.

789
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,220
Oh, my gosh.

790
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,820
What on earth? Why isn't he going?

791
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,140
Okay, let's go.

792
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,940
Oh, gosh. Did I just hit that car?

793
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,050
Actress Oh Yun Seo has
caused another public fuss.

794
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,630
She had temporarily retired due
to a drug scandal two years ago.

795
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,000
Actress Oh Yun Seo...

796
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,090
is being criticized this
time for reckless driving.

797
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,970
She is being criticized.

798
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,060
Oh, gosh.

799
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,280
Get out. Hey, get out of the car.

800
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:50,980
Lady, get out!

801
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,700
Goodness. This is so annoying
from early in the morning.

802
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,950
My car is wrecked.

803
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,430
You wrecked my car! Get out now!

804
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,730
Hey, lady! Let me see that face of yours.

805
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,680
Take off your sunglasses.
Roll down the window. Get out!

806
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,760
Why isn't he answering the phone? Goodness.

807
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,200
You wrecked my car.
Come out and see for yourself!

808
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,830
Do you want me to break this? Look.
I'll break this window.

809
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:14,970
Hey. I'm going to break it now.

810
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,860
Stop it.

811
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,360
- Who are you?
- You can talk to me from now on.

812
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,720
I am her attorney.

813
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,010
What? Attorney?

814
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,490
If you're an attorney, do you think
you can just let this slide?

815
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,590
Of course we can't let it slide.

816
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:37,960
And I won't let what you did slide either.

817
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,990
- What did I do?
- What you did...

818
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,030
is called driving for revenge,
or reckless driving.

819
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,260
According to article 151-2
of the Road Traffic Law,

820
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,560
it may be punishable up to 1 year
in jail or a fine of 5,000 dollars.

821
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:51,350
Listen to me. This lady...

822
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:54,570
ran into my car from the back first!

823
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,300
Yes.

824
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,520
We can check the dashcam
and see exactly what happened.

825
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,580
We'll also be able to check
if you changed lanes suddenly...

826
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,110
without turning on your blinkers.

827
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,830
Come to think of it,
it's not even a big scratch.

828
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:17,330
Stuff like this happen all
the time while we drive.

829
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,870
If we get angry at each other
over something like this...

830
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:22,180
and overreact, it's bad for both of us.

831
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:25,160
I'll be considerate,
so let's settle on it. Come out.

832
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,590
No. Let's settle it according to the law.

833
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,640
I'm quite fond of the law.

834
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,810
Why are you staring at me like that?

835
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:39,870
I didn't stare at you.

836
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,730
Why are you staring at me like that?

837
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,800
I'm wondering if you don't
have to go to the hospital.

838
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,130
I don't have to go.

839
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,730
I'm fine.

840
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,010
By the way, how did you know it was me?

841
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,660
I saw you.

842
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,300
Get out. Hey, get out of the car.

843
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:14,820
Lady, get out!

844
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,220
Goodness. This is so annoying
from early in the morning.

845
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,090
You wrecked my car! Get out now!

846
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,320
Anyway, thank you for stepping in...

847
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,690
and helping me.

848
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,910
In order to repay you,
I'll work really hard today.

849
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,350
Okay. Suit yourself.

850
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,550
Good morning, Ms. Oh.

851
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,180
Good morning, sir.

852
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,080
Excuse me.

853
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,390
Mr. Kwon, your expression
is consistently stern.

854
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,060
Yes, it looks so stern.

855
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,440
If you bumped into Yun Seo
early in the morning,

856
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:03,160
you should be smiling from ear to ear.

857
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,170
You're the one who works closest to her.

858
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,680
How could you be so unfriendly?

859
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,050
If you met her outside,
you'd act like a total stranger.

860
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,070
- Don't you agree?
- Well, I guess.

861
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,470
Smile. Smile like this.

862
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,280
I know it feels extremely awkward
when you're around Mr. Kwon,

863
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,780
but I'll help you often,
so hang in there, Ms. Oh.

864
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,490
- Okay, sir.
- Good.

865
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:35,060
And Mr. Kwon...

866
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,500
turns very obedient
if I tell him off strictly.

867
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,210
So if he gives you a hard time
or harasses you, tell me anytime.

868
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:44,480
And you should never think about quitting.

869
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,510
I doubt that. He might be a
better person than we think.

870
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,270
Sorry?

871
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,580
What? It's nothing.

872
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,440
Did I hear wrong?

873
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,970
- Ms. Oh Jin Sim.
- Yes?

874
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,300
Did you go to law school?

875
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,080
Yes. Just for the first
semester of my freshman year.

876
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,620
I wasn't expelled. I just decided to quit.

877
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,080
I was too busy with my schedule and all.

878
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,720
Have you ever looked for precedent cases?

879
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:35,910
No.

880
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:39,660
If you search the key word on
the official Supreme Court website,

881
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,420
you will find relevant precedent cases.

882
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,800
Find everything that's
relevant to the case.

883
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,460
What do I have to find?

884
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,740
Cases about noise complaints due to pets.

885
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,570
It doesn't have to be pets only.
It can be about conflicts...

886
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,680
or lawsuits between neighbors
or noise between floors.

887
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,910
Okay. Since this is my first job,
I'll do my best.

888
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,980
Okay. Well...

889
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,180
There weren't many previous
cases than expected.

890
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,560
Especially, lawsuits about noise
complaints due to pets are scarce.

891
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:27,210
But I remembered a story I heard
before and searched it up.

892
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,380
This isn't a case in Korea. But in the US,

893
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,710
someone sued a neighbor because of...

894
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:34,840
the pet next door made so much noise,
and won the lawsuit.

895
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,100
And do you know how much he
received for compensation?

896
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,040
500 million dollars. Isn't it amazing?

897
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,620
When did you hear about that case?

898
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:50,060
During my freshman year,
we opened a mock trial,

899
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,850
and I remembered another team
that mentioned this case.

900
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,850
It must've been a long time ago.
You still remember that?

901
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,950
I have quite a good memory.

902
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,300
Although the movie directors never
complimented me on my acting,

903
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,850
I was complimented often for
memorizing all my lines.

904
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,930
Well, I didn't mean to brag about it.

905
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,740
It is something to brag about.

906
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,010
What?

907
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,700
Anyway, this has been helpful.
You may leave now.

908
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,580
Okay.

909
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,250
Yes, well...

910
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:34,200
♫ <i>But the day we walked together,
your warm laugh</i> ♫

911
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,700
♫ <i>Changed things, it made me curious</i> ♫

912
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,760
♫ <i>It's very complicated in my head</i> ♫

913
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:45,510
Is it because he's the star of
this law firm? He has so much work.

914
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:50,530
♫ <i>Now have changed
into a different memory</i> ♫

915
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,330
He said he'd hate me
if I didn't go home on time.

916
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,890
Should I really go home?

917
00:54:55,895 --> 00:54:59,360
♫ <i>When I thought of you</i> ♫

918
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,520
♫ <i>I just wanna be your star for you</i> ♫

919
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,260
♫ <i>With my heart that I hid</i> ♫

920
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:13,480
♫ <i>I'll shine on you

922
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,370
I didn't know it was so late.

926
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,370
I wasn't sleeping.

927
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,410
I was just thinking about
your schedule tomorrow.

928
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,950
Why haven't you gone home yet?

929
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:03,360
Well, just in case you'd have to
add something to your schedule.

930
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,120
Let's go have dinner.

931
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,210
- Sorry?
- Let's go for dinner.

932
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,620
What is wrong with you today?

933
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,300
Why are you being so nice?

934
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,550
You stepped in and
helped me with the car accident.

935
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,110
You gave me a hard time, saying I
wouldn't be of any help to you.

936
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,400
But today, you even gave me work.

937
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:27,620
You complimented me, and now,
you even want to have dinner.

938
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,080
It's so strange.

939
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,610
No way.

940
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,260
You gave me a hard time, saying I
wouldn't be of any help to you.

941
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,650
But today, you even gave me work.

942
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,830
You complimented me, and now,
you even want to have dinner.

943
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,290
It's so strange.

944
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:51,120
No way. Am I about to be laid off?

945
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,040
Are you being nice
because this is my last day?

946
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,770
Is having dinner like a farewell party?
Am I right?

947
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:57,770
It's not that. I really just
meant we should have dinner.

948
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,530
Let's go.

949
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:11,180
Oh, gosh.

950
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,080
Do you come here often?

951
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,470
There aren't any customers,
but is it a hidden famous restaurant?

952
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,840
No. The food here doesn't taste that good.

953
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,500
The meat tastes kind of dry too.

954
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,980
Then why did we come here?

955
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,430
Didn't you say it's uncomfortable
going to crowded restaurants?

956
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:42,970
Then did you come here for me?

957
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,410
How long are you going to
wear those sunglasses?

958
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:50,060
Well, I guess no one will notice me here,

959
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,510
and there's no one here anyway.
I'll take them off.

960
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,440
I'm the model of that soju advertisement.

961
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,590
Do you remember?

962
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,150
I never change?

963
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,830
It's because I never forget
how I was in the beginning.

964
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:11,350
That's why I like drinks
that are just like me.

965
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,000
An unchanging taste from beginning to end.

966
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,520
"Like The Beginning"!

967
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:24,470
Come on, you're embarrassing me.

968
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,270
Can I drink a lot today?

969
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,030
You drink a lot often.

970
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,130
I felt down during the
welcoming party, that's why.

971
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,000
Today, I feel...

972
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:39,170
not so bad, so I'll drink more.

973
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,260
- Hello.
- It's cold.

974
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,140
Sir, you should change
that poster on the wall.

975
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,360
The model of our soju company
changed a long time ago.

976
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,910
We don't have any customers anyway.
No one will see.

977
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,830
That's why I brought this for you.

978
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,910
- I'll change it.
- Okay.

979
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:07,650
(An unchanging taste from beginning to end)

980
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,830
I think we came to the perfect spot.

981
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,020
It might've been awkward for
if someone really recognized me.

982
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,260
(An unchanging taste from beginning to end)

983
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,380
Have a good day.

984
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:39,600
You seem like a stronger
person than I thought.

985
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,500
Well, I've become used to
it while being a celebrity.

986
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:49,120
People gossip about me all the time,
and post malicious comments.

987
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:51,620
The tabloids talk about
things I didn't even do.

988
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,950
I've experience that for a long time,
and now I'm used to it.

989
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,580
It would be a lie if I said
I'm totally fine with it.

990
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,200
How is your work at the law firm?

991
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,040
It was tough until now,

992
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,790
but today, I enjoyed it.

993
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,310
Today, you gave me work,

994
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:16,770
complimented me,

995
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:18,880
and even bought me gopchang as a bonus.

996
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,250
Mr. Kwon. I'll see you tomorrow.

997
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,640
- Good night then.
- Bye.

998
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,290
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

999
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:49,590
Seriously, I told him it's Oh Yun Seo.

1000
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:52,760
Yes?

1001
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,550
Until now, I have never thought of you...

1002
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,170
as my secretary.

1003
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,250
You were a person who'd
stay briefly and leave.

1004
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,410
It's true that I used to
think of you as a nuisance.

1005
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:11,250
But I'd like to change how I
think of you from now on.

1006
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,260
- What?
- I'd like to give you...

1007
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,510
a chance to properly be my secretary.

1008
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:21,760
Let's start over from the beginning.

1009
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:24,430
Really?

1010
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,020

1011

but this is close to slavery.

What do you think?
No one will recognize you, right?
