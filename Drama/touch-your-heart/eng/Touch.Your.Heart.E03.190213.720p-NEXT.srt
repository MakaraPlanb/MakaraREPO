1
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,170
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,640
Yes?

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,260
Until now, I have never thought of you...

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,810
as my secretary.

5
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,950
You were a person who'd
stay briefly and leave.

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,960
It's true that I used to
think of you as a nuisance.

7
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,940
But I'd like to change how I
think of you from now on.

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,050
- What?
- I'd like to give you...

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,110
a chance to properly be my secretary.

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,340
Let's start over from the beginning.

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,140
Really?

12
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,840
Thank you, Mr. Kwon!

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,610
I'm really going to try my best!

14
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,060
My goodness!

15
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,190
I...

16
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,090
didn't dodge this time.

17
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,860
Anyway,

18
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,000
I look forward to working with you.

19
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,980
Yes, me too.

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,950
- I'll be off now.
- Bye.

21
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,100
♫ <i>Your warm laugh</i> ♫

22
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,510
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

23
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,180
♫ <i>It made me curious</i> ♫

24
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,440
♫ <i>It's very complicated in my head</i> ♫

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,630
- Yes?
- You need to go this way.

26
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,130
Oh, right. It's that way.

27
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,270
♫ <i>With my heart that I hid</i> ♫

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,580
♫ <i>I'll shine on you
when things get dark and tiring</i> ♫

29
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,180
♫ <i>I'll embrace your day</i> ♫

30
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,360
♫ <i>I just wanna be your star with my heart</i> ♫

31
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,200
♫ <i>With twinkling starlight</i> ♫

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,400
Seeing that he caught me to
prevent me from falling,

33
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,250
he must have a sense of comradeship.

34
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,190
And he's not as rude as I thought he'd be.

35
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,430
(Episode 3)

36
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,350
Im, a 35-year-old woman...

37
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,910
who is being suspected of
having murdered her husband,

38
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,660
got taken into custody by
the prosecution tonight.

39
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Her husband's corpse was
severely damaged...

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,840
along with two stab wounds.

41
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,580
And Im ended up getting
hospitalized for nine weeks.

42
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,120
- You're late.
- Yes.

43
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,200
What's wrong? Did you miss me?

44
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,720
Of course not.

45
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,720
I had to take a look at some case files.

46
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,090
- By the way, did you drink?
- Yes.

47
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,350
- You have a lot of team dinners.
- It wasn't a team dinner.

48
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,600
Then was it a date?

49
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,070
It wasn't a date either.

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,680
Something's fishy.

51
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,140
Nothing's fishy.

52
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,960
I had a few drinks with the new secretary.

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,310
Was it just the two of you?

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,130
I thought you didn't like her.

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,860
- Yes, that was the case.
- "That was the case"?

56
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,600
She must be okay now seeing that
you're speaking in the past tense.

57
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,290
Yes.

58
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,960
Is she pretty?

59
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,870
- You lunatic.
- You just said she's okay.

60
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,540
I meant she's okay as my secretary.

61
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,270
As your secretary?

62
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,840
Gosh, you punk.

63
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,220
Hurry up and wash.
You have fine dust all over you.

64
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,050
Now that I officially got
acknowledged as his secretary,

65
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,700
I should really do my best.

66
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,880
Then I'll need to dress
properly like a real secretary.

67
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,370
I should go shopping during the weekend.

68
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,730
Hey, are you here already?

69
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,880
What? You got injured?

70
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,180
- Where did you get injured?
- Well...

71
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,520
I sprained my leg during my civil
defense training yesterday.

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,930
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,070
I don't think I'll be able to
pick you up for a few days.

74
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,890
That's the least you
should be worried about.

75
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,840
- It's not serious, is it?
- No, it's not.

76
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,870
I asked another manager to drive you
to and from work, so don't worry.

77
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,860
And call me if anything happens.

78
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,880
By the way, let me know right
away if that rude attorney...

79
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,070
is mean to you again. Okay?

80
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,860
He won't be mean to me anymore.

81
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,940
I think he finally realized my true value.

82
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,790
He officially asked me to work for him...

83
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,260
as his secretary.

84
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,550
He even bought me beef tripe.

85
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,370
So don't worry about me,

86
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,690
and just make sure you get better. Okay?

87
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,640
(Life)

88
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,490
Good morning, everyone.

89
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,760
- Good morning.
- Hello.

90
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,310
I hope you all have a great day. Good luck!

91
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,090
Yun Seo seems to be in a good mood today.

92
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,160
I wonder if it's because she saw me.

93
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,360
Yes?

94
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,920
Good morning, Mr. Kwon.

95
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,290
You must be exhausted from
a long day yesterday,

96
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,870
but you're still here early.

97
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,370
Right, well...

98
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,290
Anyway, that necktie suits you quite well.

99
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,240
You seem to have a good sense of fashion.

100
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,030
Do you perhaps do your shopping yourself?

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,520
Ms. Oh Jin Sim?

102
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,680
Take this.

103
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,640
I put together a list of tasks you will do.

104
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,980
Tasks that I should do?

105
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,450
Connecting calls and making copies...

106
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,140
aren't the only things a
secretary of a law firm does.

107
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,740
This diary was your predecessor's.

108
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,740
Detailed instructions will be in here.

109
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,140
Thank you.

110
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,870
Right.

111
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,890
Gosh, what was that?

112
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,860
I thought we'd become friends.

113
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,310
"Check the court's schedule..."

114
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,000
"and inform clients."

115
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,850
"Check for typos..."

116
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,480
"and hand in the file
in a PDF format." What?

117
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,460
What's with the long list?

118
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,960
All cases must be sort into codes...

119
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,550
and then categorized depending
on received or sent.

120
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,500
(Case name, Case number)

121
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,040
All files related to the
case must be stamped...

122
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,690
as "For opposing party",
"For court use", or "Archives".

123
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,900
Also, bring me the
certification of contents.

124
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,170
Would you like to put a rush on it?

125
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,980
The faster the better, I guess.

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,330
Sure.

127
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,390
I'm all done.

128
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,510
10 of these, 10 of these,

129
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,190
and 15 copies of these, please.

130
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,980
I'll meet the client and call it a day.

131
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,770
He said he'd give me proper work,
but this is slavery.

132
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,090
I shouldn't have had
dinner with him yesterday.

133
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,520
But I really want to be in this series.

134
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,370
This scene especially.

135
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,360
The one where the lead actress
explodes with charisma in court.

136
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,550
I think I'll look really cool.

137
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,860
Bujin Constructions, your place of work,

138
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,270
signed a demolition contract
with the defendant...

139
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,580
which was implemented.

140
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,620
Yes.

141
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,500
The defendant had Bujin Constructions...

142
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,840
complete the demolition,

143
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,170
but failed to pay the cost...

144
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,320
due to the lack of funds!

145
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,470
"Your Honor, the witness..."

146
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,980
"is lying on the stand."

147
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,820
I love you!

148
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,040
I bet he'll have another list
of tasks for me tomorrow.

149
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,280
Seeing attorney's in action
is what'll help me though.

150
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,140
What? Really?

151
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,340
Can I really go with you...

152
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,480
to meet a fellow attorney of yours?

153
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,680
He's not just another attorney though.

154
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,120
He's the opposing attorney
on the JN Company...

155
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,410
victim compensation case.

156
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't you normally meet
the opposing attorney...

157
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,070
to sense them out, see what they have,

158
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,810
and get into a war of nerves?

159
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,610
I'm not sure that's a place for me.

160
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,870
We're just getting together
for friendly meal.

161
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,740
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

162
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,520
I just thought it'll help you
with your work as a secretary.

163
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,820
Of course. It sure will. I'm going.

164
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,680
It's a secret that I work here,

165
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,150
so I'm going to need a disguise.

166
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,400
What if I added a mole here?

167
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,720
Would that really be enough?

168
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,640
I'm already prepared for it,
so leave it to me.

169
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,950
Really?

170
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,570
You sure are meticulous, aren't you?

171
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,480
What do you think?
You're unrecognizable, right?

172
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,630
Of course.

173
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,580
Who'd recognize me in this state?

174
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,240
Gosh.

175
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,530
Is this really necessary though?

176
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,500
It makes no sense...

177
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,690
for a law firm secretary
to wear this to work.

178
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,070
People rarely recognize me
when I wear sunglasses anyway.

179
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,390
- He's not just anyone though.
- What?

180
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,710
He's a passionate fan of yours.

181
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,020
Still, it...

182
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,840
Sorry? He's a fan of mine?

183
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,580
Yes, he's watched every show
you've been in.

184
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,310
Oh, my. Goodness me.

185
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,890
I see that this attorney has great taste.

186
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,620
You should just lose this case, you know.

187
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,690
Why try to win against someone so sweet?

188
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,610
Sorry?

189
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,350
I'm only joking.

190
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,070
Anyway, once he finds out
that you accompanied me,

191
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,330
he'll be solely focused on you.

192
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,360
It'll make you uncomfortable,

193
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,170
and I'm not fond of those situations.

194
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,120
If that's the reason, I'll put these on.

195
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,630
I will right away.

196
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,540
I have one more favor to ask.

197
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,770
What is it?

198
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,640
You can't say a single word.

199
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,870
Why is that?

200
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,970
Because he might recognize my voice?

201
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,620
Got it. Don't you worry.

202
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
Hello.

203
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,910
Jung Rok, it's been a while.

204
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,730
- You look great.
- Thank you.

205
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,300
This is my secretary, Ms. Oh.

206
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,890
She's been accompanying me
in most of my meetings...

207
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,670
to familiarize herself with the job.

208
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,420
What's with her outfit?

209
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,050
Her clothes were ruined on the way to work,

210
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,640
so she put on the company's tracksuit.

211
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,710
Meanwhile, her face...

212
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,650
is all blotchy due to a skin condition.

213
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,480
Ms. Oh, can you take off your mask briefly?

214
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,860
You have to eat with us.

215
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,280
Sir, do you still play golf?

216
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,010
I have no time for that.
I'm overflowed with work.

217
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,750
And the lawsuit I'm working on
lately is quite bothersome.

218
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,650
- Shall we go golfing next time?
- Shall we?

219
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,330
Sure. Let's play a round,
and go eat some healthy food.

220
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,660
I know a place that makes
amazing grilled eel.

221
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,120
That sounds great.

222
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,310
By the way, I'm sorry we're
the only ones eating.

223
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,070
She's on a diet,
so you don't have to mind her.

224
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,240
She put on 3kg lately,

225
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,460
and none of her clothes fit her.

226
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,320
What? My face is all blotchy
due to a skin condition?

227
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,840
I put on 3kg, and nothing fits me?

228
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,080
He said he was the opposing lawyer,
so I thought they'd play mind games.

229
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,170
Why are they talking about
things so meaningless?

230
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,650
If I knew this wouldn't be helpful,
I wouldn't have come.

231
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,540
I look so lousy right now.

232
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,110
Ms. Oh, was it?

233
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,110
You didn't have a single bite to eat.

234
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,040
Aren't you hungry?

235
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,930
By the way, I'm curious about something.

236
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,800
Mr. Kwon is good at his work, but
his personality is messed up.

237
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,940
Isn't it tough to work
for a boss like that?

238
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,940
If you have any second thoughts,
you can call me anytime.

239
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,520
One of our secretaries quit lately,
so there's a vacant position.

240
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,810
What are you doing? Take it.

241
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,220
Those fingers look strangely familiar.

242
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,810
Your face seems familiar too.

243
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,280
Where did I see you?

244
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,060
Can you take off that mask?

245
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,000
Or those sunglasses. I know it's an excuse,

246
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,800
but even your neckline
seems strangely familiar.

247
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,390
This isn't sexual harassment.

248
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,500
It's just because you seem really familiar.

249
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,040
Can you please take off that mask?

250
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,670
I can't stand it when I'm curious.

251
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,100
What are you doing here?

252
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,980
- Did you hear us talking?
- Yes.

253
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,420
Don't act rudely anymore...

254
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,780
to my secretary.

255
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,450
Let's go.

256
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,430
Are you all right?

257
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,300
What?

258
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,930
Sure. Although he was very rude.

259
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,600
Why are you staring at me like that?

260
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,890
I was reminded of another rude person.

261
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,740
I don't have skin trouble!

262
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,010
I have great skin.

263
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,680
And I didn't put on 3kg!

264
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,930
I'm always maintaining a weight of 48kg.

265
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm sorry. That seemed like the most
persuasive excuse at that moment.

266
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,220
I know. I know, but it's still so annoying.

267
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,470
Let's get something to eat.

268
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,450
You must be hungry since
you didn't eat anything.

269
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,230
I'll buy you something tasty.

270
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,420
Forget it. I'm not hungry.

271
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,890
I'll go to the closest restaurant then.

272
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,730
How is Yun Seo doing?

273
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,710
She's doing great. She's adapting so well.

274
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,210
She can even stay 30
years, not just 3 months.

275
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,550
She's good at work, kind, and even pretty.

276
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,740
She gets along with the
employees so well too.

277
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,280
But I heard that she's not on good terms...

278
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,960
with the attorney she's working for.

279
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,410
I heard they clash with each other often.

280
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,120
What was his name? Kwon Jung Rok?

281
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,920
- I heard he's really obnoxious.
- Obnoxious?

282
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,920
Obnoxious...

283
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,660
Well, you can say that.

284
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,960
Why did you team Yun Seo up
with a guy like him then?

285
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,630
He's the best at his work.

286
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,120
He's number one in winnings,

287
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,840
and he's the most preferred attorney
among our clients. He's our star.

288
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,340
That's why you can't control him.

289
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,820
Do you know how much money he makes for us?

290
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,050
Goodness. You're so frustrating, Joon Gyu.

291
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,160
A CEO must have charisma.

292
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,490
The moment it seems he's
invading your dignity or class,

293
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,560
you have to fire him, regardless
of whether he's a star or not.

294
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,530
That's how you'll earn
his respect as a CEO.

295
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,760
- Why? Are you offended?
- A little.

296
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,410
It does sound convincing though.

297
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,060
I'm the CEO of Always Law Firm,

298
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,350
and I can't lose my dignity and
class because of a punk like him.

299
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,380
I'll call in Mr. Kwon soon
and tell him off strictly.

300
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,890
I'll tell him to prepare for a
major restructuring in our staff.

301
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,910
That's it.

302
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,620
What is that? Someone's calling.

303
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,110
Yes, Min Ji.

304
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,440
Min Ji? The first love of all men in Korea?

305
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,620
What's wrong?

306
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,150
What about the shooting scene?

307
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,510
What? You want to quit
shooting that program?

308
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,170
Are you kidding me?

309
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,480
Hey. When did I get angry at you?

310
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,190
What? You won't extend the contract?

311
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,850
Min Ji, what are you talking about? Hello?

312
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,660
Min Ji. Come to think of it,

313
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,390
I understand why you're mad.

314
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,780
You must be very upset.

315
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,320
I'll call the director and have
a nice good talk with him.

316
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,130
So let's just extend the
contract as planned.

317
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,730
Beef tripe? Sure, let's have beef tripe.

318
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,300
And remember, I didn't get
angry at you just now.

319
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,530
Something got caught in my throat,

320
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,010
so my voice came out all hoarse.
Don't take it the wrong way.

321
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,940
Okay, Min Ji. Good luck!

322
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,870
Okay, I'll see you later.

323
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,140
My throat...

324
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,040
You look so dignified.

325
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,440
If something like this happens again,

326
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,390
you might be begging on your knees.

327
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,060
- Why? Are you offended?
- No.

328
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,420
This isn't easy.

329
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,410
I just dropped by to tell
you how Yun Seo is doing,

330
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,650
but if I keep staying, I'll just see
how pitiful you are, so I'll leave.

331
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,160
Okay, Joon Gyu. Bye.

332
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,600
What?

333
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,130
Why do I never get used to
you calling me my name?

334
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,100
It doesn't matter when we're alone.

335
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,220
You can call my name whenever we're alone.

336
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,740
But how do you think I'd feel if you
call me that in front of others?

337
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,360
Joon Gyu, I went to see a
dermatologist recently.

338
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,020
Do you know what she said?

339
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,770
She told me to wear a school uniform.

340
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,940
Look at this clean, smooth skin.

341
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,330
It's like baby skin.

342
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,450
I just imagined you wearing a
school uniform, and it's creepy.

343
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,890
Your skin isn't the problem.
Go see an otolaryngologist.

344
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,750
I think you're hearing things.
I'm leaving now.

345
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,250
Okay, Joon Gyu. Wait.

346
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,350
Take some macarons.

347
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,760
This came in as a gift. You can
share it with your employees...

348
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,250
or play hockey with it.

349
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,150
This is so random.

350
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,720
- See you.
- Okay.

351
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,390
Enjoy your meal.

352
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,610
This looks so delicious!

353
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,760
Are you really going to eat all of this?

354
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,830
Even if I can't, I'll try
since you're buying today.

355
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,270
I'm going to get revenge
for being rude to me.

356
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,550
Action!

357
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,080
By the way, you did that
on purpose, didn't you?

358
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,410
- What do you mean?
- What you made me do.

359
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,010
You made me wear that outfit intentionally.

360
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,500
I don't know what you mean.

361
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,930
Like I told you,
he's a passionate fan of yours.

362
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,730
- I have to protect...
- If you were that worried,

363
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,320
you shouldn't have taken me
there in the first place.

364
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,740
I thought about it, and it was so strange.

365
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,270
You shouldn't have taken me from the start.

366
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,570
I wondered why you took me by
taking such extreme measures.

367
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,170
Did you do it to draw
attention intentionally?

368
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,200
What is on your mind?

369
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,560
To be honest, he's notorious in this field.

370
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,960
He pretends to be kind and uses
his outgoing personality...

371
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,110
to take information from
the opposing attorney.

372
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,730
There are many attorneys
who were fooled by him.

373
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,100
I knew he was a jerk.

374
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,660
But he gets distracted easily.

375
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,040
He's good at one-on-one meetings,
but if there's another participant,

376
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,410
he gets distracted easily
and tends to make mistakes.

377
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,210
Is that why you took me with you?
To make me distract him?

378
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,810
I also wanted to let you
get familiar with work,

379
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,120
but yes. That is true also.

380
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,500
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.

381
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,220
I thought about telling you,
but you might've acted awkwardly.

382
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,020
What? Act awkwardly?

383
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,430
That's what everyone says.
You're awkward when you act.

384
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,260
My goodness. I can't believe it.

385
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,490
No one has ever said that to me before.

386
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,600
Can I sue you for defamation?

387
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,960
Well, yes.

388
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,020
But does that mean you're also going
to sue everyone in the country?

389
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,700
What?

390
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,000
Gosh, forget it.

391
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,050
Here are the cases for this week.

392
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,340
- Hey, you're here.
- Hey.

393
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,040
Come here.

394
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,640
Okay, everyone. You're all running
low on sugar, aren't you?

395
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,830
How about some macarons for dessert?

396
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,340
Gosh, this is my favorite dessert.

397
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,590
Strawberry macarons are my favorite.

398
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,590
It's okay. I don't want any.

399
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,050
[START] Why not? I thought
you'd love them the most.

400
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,440
But then again, why do you look so down?

401
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,510
She got rejected by the
part-timer at the sandwich shop.

402
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,000
Gosh, that's why?

403
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,460
You got rejected by the second son...

404
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,530
of the pork rib soup restaurant owner.

405
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,720
You got rejected by a chef that
works at an Italian restaurant.

406
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,470
And you got rejected by a
barbecue restaurant owner.

407
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,490
You've already been rejected so many times.

408
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,340
But you always quickly got over it
and started liking someone else.

409
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,290
This time, it was different.

410
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,230
This time, I really loved him.

411
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,850
I won't ever be able to fall in love again.

412
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,540
I'm sorry. I guess I made a mistake.

413
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,710
Is Ms. Dan Moon Hee here?

414
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,270
♫ <i>From the moment I saw you</i> ♫

415
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,000
♫ <i>Saw you baby, oh</i> ♫

416
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,010
♫ <i>You were something to behold</i> ♫

417
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,060
Yes, that's me.

418
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,390
Oh, okay. Here you go.

419
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,250
Okay.

420
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,540
Can you please sign this?

421
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,730
- It's right here.
- Oh, okay.

422
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,130
Thanks. Have a good day.

423
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,500
Thank you.

424
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,540
Wait.

425
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,210
I'm sure you're running low on sugar
since you're going here and there.

426
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,180
You should have a macaron before you go.

427
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,900
♫ <i>I can't be without your love</i> ♫

428
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,390
She fell for that delivery man
like a flash of lightning.

429
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,190
Don't you think she falls
for guys way too quickly?

430
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,050
Let's eat.

431
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,160
Hey, Jung Rok. Come over here.

432
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,990
- Hello.
- Hey.

433
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,880
Didn't you leave with Yun Seo?

434
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,050
Why are you coming back alone?

435
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,250
She went to the District Attorney's Office.

436
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,300
What?

437
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,130
Did she get arrested again?

438
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,380
No, she went there to
copy a litigation record.

439
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,770
Gosh, you startled me.

440
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,680
Then that's what you should've said.

441
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,630
But wait.
Are you telling me that Yun Seo...

442
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,490
already knows how to copy
litigation records on her own?

443
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,580
Yes.

444
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,490
It only took her this much
time to become a professional?

445
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,780
My goodness, she's become
a true member of our firm.

446
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,410
I am extremely moved. I really am.
Aren't you?

447
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,830
Next year, she could become
an attorney herself.

448
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,710
The seolleongtang we had
today tasted pretty good.

449
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,910
Yes, it's a great meal
to eat when it's cold.

450
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,530
- Let's eat there again next time.
- Sure.

451
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,560
The victim got hospitalized
for nine months!

452
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,390
- Hospitalized for nine months!
- Hospitalized for nine months!

453
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,230
Her imprisonment is completely absurd!

454
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,060
- It is absurd!
- It is absurd!

455
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,930
Acknowledge the fact that she was
only trying to defend herself!

456
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,090
Sir, I know I've already
asked you this before.

457
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,780
But can you put me in charge of that case?

458
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,630
Why? The news is always talking about it.

459
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,230
Do you want the case because
the press is focused on it?

460
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,090
No, that's not why.

461
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,580
I just find it weird that
both her ex-husband...

462
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,110
and current husband died.

463
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,470
What's so weird about it?
Let's hurry up and go inside.

464
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,110
The victim got hospitalized
for nine months!

465
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,940
- Hospitalized for nine months!
- Hospitalized for nine months!

466
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,960
Her imprisonment is completely absurd!

467
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,890
- It is absurd!
- It is absurd!

468
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,730
Acknowledge the fact that she was
only trying to defend herself!

469
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,620
- Acknowledge it!
- Acknowledge it!

470
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,500
Mr. Kwon, I found the case
you told me about...

471
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,330
and sent you the list of evidence
via email. I did a perfect job.

472
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,880
Great work.

473
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,690
You worked hard today,
so you can get off work now.

474
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,130
- Get off work?
- Yes. Goodbye, then.

475
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,720
But it's only 3pm.

476
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,090
Am I really allowed to just go home?

477
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,020
It'd be nice if I could see a trial
since I came all the way here.

478
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,260
Then why don't you?

479
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,530
Gosh, you startled me.

480
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,560
Yun Seo, who do you call
when there's a fire?

481
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,260
Pardon? Oh, well, a firefighter.

482
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,730
- What if someone steals something?
- A police officer.

483
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,220
Then how about when there's
something you really want?

484
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,400
Well... What?

485
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,670
Me! You can call me when that happens.

486
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,140
I happen to have a trial today.
It's a pro bono case.

487
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,370
In other words, it's a case
given to me by the government.

488
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,620
Bonobono?

489
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,390
Pro bono.

490
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,080
It's kind of like volunteer
work where I defend people...

491
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,890
who don't have enough money
to hire an attorney for free.

492
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,200
You could call it "Noblesse oblige".

493
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,440
Excuse me. You're not allowed
to wear sunglasses in court.

494
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,690
Okay.

495
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,280
I forgot to tell you. It's illegal
to hide your face in court.

496
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,230
The rules are strict, aren't they?

497
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,050
That's probably why people get
nervous when they're in court.

498
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,460
I'm more excited than nervous.

499
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,370
You're excited?

500
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,320
I guess it's because
I'm sitting next to you.

501
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,750
No, that's not why.

502
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,800
The thing is, I watched
a courtroom drama yesterday.

503
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,080
And it was really cool.

504
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,710
So I'm really excited at the fact
that I'm getting to watch it...

505
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,190
in real life.

506
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,390
Everyone, please stand.

507
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,060
Let's get up.

508
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,230
The defendant got into a
quarrel with the victim...

509
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,060
while he was trying to park his car.
And when he got angry,

510
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,770
he continuously punched the
victim's face and chest...

511
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,540
which eventually made the victim
get hospitalized for eight weeks.

512
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,670
What is your opinion on the
charges pressed against you?

513
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,370
I really feel upset about this.

514
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,630
That guy hit me first.

515
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,540
Even so, you made him get
hospitalized for eight weeks.

516
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,530
So it's inevitable that you get punished.

517
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,370
- He got hit first?
- Goodness.

518
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,090
Kim Yoon Ha, the defendant, told the
victims that she's close friends...

519
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,800
with Ji Hong, a famous idol star
and member of X-Teen.

520
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,430
Then she lied to them saying she'll
get him to sign autographs...

521
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,820
and received 530 dollars in
return for promising to do so.

522
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,590
Defendant, do you admit to all the charges?

523
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,690
Yes, I admit to the charges.

524
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,640
If you don't come to a
settlement with the victims,

525
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,280
you won't be able to
receive a mild punishment.

526
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,090
I already settled with them.

527
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,350
Really?

528
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,190
But I don't have the
documents to prove that.

529
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,580
It says here that the victims
do not wish to settle...

530
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,580
and want you to receive punishment
because you didn't pay them back.

531
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,080
I did pay them back. I just
didn't pay the full amount.

532
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,110
So that means you only paid back
a small part of the total sum.

533
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,010
To whom and how much money did you give?

534
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,620
I don't know. I can't remember.

535
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,700
Is she lying to the judge right now?

536
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,910
Yes.

537
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,690
The quality of this trial is a mess.

538
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,400
You should pay attention to the next one.

539
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,530
The attorney will be interrogating
with a very sharp insight.

540
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,460
It's my turn.

541
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,700
Your Honor.

542
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,060
The defendant raised two
children on her own...

543
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,240
Wait.

544
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,690
It says here that she
doesn't have any children.

545
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,510
Pardon?

546
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,280
You told me that you have children.

547
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,580
I was talking about my cats.

548
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,460
I think of them like my children.

549
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,540
Anyway, Your Honor.

550
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,990
The defendant had to raise two cats...

551
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,010
all on her own...

552
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,790
and also had to take care of her
single mother at the same time.

553
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,590
And all her neighbors admired
her for her filial love.

554
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,430
This kindhearted defendant made...

555
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,040
just one mistake...

556
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,610
No, I didn't do anything wrong.

557
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,510
It wasn't my fault.

558
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,020
I can't admit to the charges.

559
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,090
Please...

560
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,450
Please just stay still.

561
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,200
- Yun Seo.
- Yes?

562
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,180
I may have lost the trial today,

563
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,710
but I didn't exactly lose.

564
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,140
- Pardon?
- My client...

565
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,400
committed a crime.

566
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,090
And she ended up getting punished...

567
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,680
which means justice won.

568
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,960
I may have lost the trial, but justice won.

569
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,390
So that means I didn't really lose.

570
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,370
What exactly are you saying?

571
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,010
Anyway, I need to talk to my client.

572
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,140
- Sure, go ahead.
- I'll see you tomorrow at the firm.

573
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,730
I guess not all attorneys...

574
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,770
are competent and charismatic like
the great Mr. Kwon. My goodness.

575
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,100
What did I just say?

576
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,100
"The great Mr. Kwon"?
I must be out of my mind.

577
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,620
My gosh.

578
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,810
- Hello?
- It's me, Su Cheol. I just arrived.

579
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,750
I'll see you up front.

580
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,510
Okay, I'll be right there.

581
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,780
Do you need coffee or anything?
I'll buy it for you.

582
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,370
It's okay. I don't need anything.

583
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,510
Wait. You'll probably
see a bookstore nearby.

584
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,240
Can you go there and buy me a book?

585
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,070
It doesn't matter whether it's
civil law or criminal law.

586
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,990
Buy me all books on law that you can find.

587
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,220
I checked the email. Good job.

588
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,540
Even his messages are cold and stern.

589
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,580
Mr. Kwon, I bought books...

590
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,870
to brush up on my knowledge about the law.

591
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,430
128 dollars' worth of books.

592
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,820
I'll study hard...

593
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,040
to become a secretary that
can be of assistance.

594
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,350
A case fell on your lap.

595
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,330
It's the public defender
case you applied for.

596
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,280
(Complaint)

597
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,110
A female high school student
received money from friends...

598
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,320
in return for an autograph
from Ji Yong of X-Teen.

599
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,560
She pocketed the money though.

600
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,020
She's still young,
so a punishment would be harsh.

601
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,810
Can you look into the case?

602
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,170
Sure.

603
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,040
You want me to get petitions?

604
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,010
They'll help us get her a lenient sentence.

605
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,430
When I went to court
with Mr. Choi yesterday,

606
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,070
I was able to see her case as well.

607
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,830
She's obviously guilty.

608
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,210
A judge decides whether
one is guilty or not.

609
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,960
My job is to just represent my client.

610
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,080
Still, she committed fraud...

611
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,730
and lied to the judge.

612
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,260
She's a piece of work.

613
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,790
Do you think it's possible to
only represent the innocent?

614
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,010
Of course not, but...

615
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,510
I already talked to Ms. Yang,
so get it done please.

616
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,570
Right, sure thing.

617
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,350
(I have a headache and a fever.
I'll wait for you at home.)

618
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,520
Ms. Yang,

619
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,740
Mr. Kwon told me to get
the petitions with you.

620
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,360
When can we leave?

621
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,760
Gosh, I'm terribly sorry.

622
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,070
My daughter just contacted me.

623
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,440
She left school early
today because of a fever.

624
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,940
There's no one to take care of her,

625
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,360
so I was going to head home
after letting Mr. Yeon know.

626
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,380
Of course you should go.

627
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,610
What about the petitions then?

628
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,180
I'll go with you.

629
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,660
- With you?
- Yes.

630
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,120
I collected many back
when I was a detective.

631
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,600
I'll accompany Ms. Oh, so head on home.

632
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,390
Thank you.

633
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,120
(Evidence log)

634
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,460
It's the Im Yun Hee case.

635
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,980
The one where the wife
murdered her violent husband.

636
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,480
Wasn't this case for Prosecutor Im?

637
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,100
Is it because of the women's organization?

638
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,130
Yes, they're already saying
we're on a witch hunt.

639
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,970
Our bosses think it'll be better
for a female to take the lead,

640
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,510
and I agree.

641
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,000
- I'm being put up as a shield.
- Don't you want it then?

642
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,590
No, it's good.

643
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,830
I was interested in this case anyway.

644
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,930
Handle this case properly,

645
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,550
and you'll be able to work at
the department of your choice.

646
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,560
I'll do my best.

647
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,230
- Hey, Yeo Reum!
- What's going on?

648
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,840
What's with him?

649
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,580
- Yes?
- You insolent cow.

650
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,110
Are you that greedy for success?

651
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,600
How greedy do you have to be to
take the case your senior wanted?

652
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,900
From what I know, the case was never yours.

653
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,480
Is that why you just took it?

654
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,670
Like you said, I thought
it'd propel my career,

655
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,410
so I just didn't decline.

656
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,460
Hey!

657
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,950
I think you should stop.

658
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,030
Let go of me.

659
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,540
Didn't you just hear this wench?

660
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,880
Later. You should talk later.

661
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,720
- What was that?
- Seriously?

662
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,210
You had better behave.

663
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,680
I'll be watching you.

664
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,710
What's with him?

665
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,640
- Who does he think he is?
- Mr. Im!

666
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,400
- What's going on?
- She took his case.

667
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,220
How can she take a senior's case?

668
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,630
It's just nasty.

669
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,270
- I know.
- She's known to be like that.

670
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,210
- No way.
- I knew she'd cause trouble.

671
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,240
Did she steal his case?

672
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,570
Which one?

673
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,480
Oh, the one with the murdered husband?

674
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,480
That sure is bold of her.

675
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,770
- Ms. Yeo.
- Yes?

676
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,970
Take this if you aren't feeling well.

677
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,500
It's digestive medicine.

678
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,900
How did you know?

679
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,520
Mr. Kim Se Won handed it to me.

680
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,260
I don't have much time.

681
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,240
Here. I heard you gave me this.

682
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,430
I don't need it.

683
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,480
(Internal Medicine)

684
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,430
Do you have more to say?

685
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,580
Don't bother with useless generosities.

686
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,920
It's not who we are now.

687
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,740
What do you mean by that?

688
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,390
You might not know it since you're selfish,

689
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,240
but even colleagues treat
each other this way.

690
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,130
You're the one misreading our situation.

691
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,970
I won't, so don't worry.

692
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,540
- Is that all you have to say?
- Yes.

693
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,930
Ms. Oh,

694
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,120
you can stay in the car
if you're worried...

695
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,200
about being recognized.

696
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,590
It's all right. I've been
out and about these days,

697
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,240
but no one's recognized me.

698
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,250
Let's go then and get these petitions.

699
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,780
Sure.

700
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,780
A petition, my foot.

701
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,160
I won't write such a thing.

702
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,100
The autograph isn't all
she lied about anyway.

703
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,770
She said her grandma was
Korea's best fortune teller.

704
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,710
As her blood relative,

705
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,300
she said she'd soon have the gift too.

706
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,800
It turns out that she
doesn't have a grandma.

707
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,700
She said she had the final
stage of esophageal cancer.

708
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,090
I was good to her because I
felt bad, but it was all a lie.

709
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,660
What she has isn't cancer but mythomania.

710
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,900
She craves attention.

711
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,110
She said she was a K-pop idol trainee,

712
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,340
but that was a lie too.

713
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,780
Anyway, she can beg
like this all she wants.

714
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,320
There's no way I'm forgiving her.

715
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,110
Hold on.

716
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,480
What's this though?

717
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,880
Is it true that you're close
friends with Ji Yong of X-Teen?

718
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,940
Then why didn't you get the autographs?

719
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,760
It just happened.

720
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,840
Why did you receive money
as exchange for them?

721
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,160
Because I needed it, that's why.

722
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,960
Couldn't you have asked
your parents for some?

723
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,270
I don't have parents.

724
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,900
(Document of Family Relations)

725
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,930
According to this document,
you do have parents.

726
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,050
She's lying again.

727
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,580
Giving the money back to the victims...

728
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,850
will help you get a lenient sentence.

729
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,250
I spent it all.

730
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,130
Hey, you!

731
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,170
Mr. Kwon isn't your peer, you know.

732
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,430
Stop lying to him!

733
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,900
Lady, it's none of your...

734
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,110
- Are you Oh Yun Seo?
- The resemblance is uncanny, right?

735
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,360
I'm not her though,
so don't think otherwise.

736
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,650
Anyway, I saw you in court yesterday.

737
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,290
You even lied to the judge!

738
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,950
Also,

739
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:44,030
I just got back from meeting your friends.

740
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,110
All they had to say was that
you only told them lies.

741
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,710
Anyone can tell that you must be punished.

742
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,810
Still, he offered to
help you with your case.

743
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,690
You can't treat him this way.

744
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,020
Stay out of it, you washed-up actress.

745
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,280
Washed-up? Did you seriously just say that?

746
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,920
- What is this?
- That's right. What are you doing?

747
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,070
I mean you, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

748
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,690
Me and not her?

749
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,370
- Is Jin Sim your real name?
- It's not.

750
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,580
I'm not Oh Yun Seo either!

751
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,190
Why did you butt in?

752
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,220
She kept lying to you.

753
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,030
When an attorney and client meet for
the first time, it's essential to...

754
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,560
find a way to solve the case.

755
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,980
Why did you interfere when I was
trying to find out the truth?

756
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,460
What do you mean, interfere?

757
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,770
You still don't know?

758
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:45,570
She has no intentions of
telling you the truth.

759
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:49,300
I went to get the petition signed,
but no one believed her.

760
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,880
Can't you tell by that?

761
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,110
I just don't think you should
waste your time listening to...

762
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,650
meaningless lies like that.

763
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,160
Regarding taking cases or not...

764
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,300
is not your area of concern.

765
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,110
Working hard and exceeding
your authority are different.

766
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,390
It's clear you don't have authority
in this, so stop interfering.

767
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,920
I was just trying to help you.

768
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,530
If you say it like that,
it makes me so upset.

769
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,520
Stop being emotional.

770
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,160
That kind of attitude won't help at all.

771
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,370
Stop being picky and eat up.

772
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,380
Eating and resting well is
the best when you feel ill.

773
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,320
I've had enough.
I'll go to my room and rest.

774
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,380
You should have some more.

775
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,340
Take your medicine.

776
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,880
Right, water.

777
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,710
Jin Hee, water.

778
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,860
What were you doing?

779
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,950
(Suspect Interrogation Report)

780
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,350
Here. I made copies like you asked.

781
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,860
There are 5 copies. I only asked for 3.

782
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,710
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry for not
listening and making more copies.

783
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,480
Is this an abuse of authority too?

784
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,490
I'll be more careful.

785
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,410
What are you doing?

786
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,510
Oh, right. You told me not to be emotional.

787
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,140
I'm sorry for having a grudge
and being so emotional.

788
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,450
Before you hate me for not going
home in time, I'll leave.

789
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,000
Then.

790
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,670
Then?

791
00:44:58,370 --> 00:44:59,680
Abuse of authority?

792
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,460
Don't be emotional?

793
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,860
All I wanted to do was help him.

794
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,000
(The Code of Criminal Procedure)

795
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,090
(Attorney's Opinion)

796
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,970
This tastes so much better after
changing the coffee beans.

797
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,400
Is that so? I don't taste the difference.

798
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,390
Viennese and Einspanner coffee are
the best coffees of them all.

799
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:52,360
Last winter, I was feeling low...

800
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,340
and went on a sudden trip to Vienna.

801
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:57,690
The moment I had a sip of that
bitter Einspanner coffee,

802
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,500
I still cannot forget that feeling.

803
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:12,070
You two seemed quiet these few days.

804
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,250
Did you fight again?

805
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,480
No, it wasn't actually a fight...

806
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,860
Something happened.

807
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,470
Don't keep it to yourself and tell us.

808
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,880
Well, it's just...

809
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,610
You know, that high school girl
Mr. Kwon was talking to.

810
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,150
She kept lying to him.

811
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:37,140
Does it make sense to lie to
someone who's trying to help her?

812
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,360
So as an adult,

813
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,750
and as Mr. Kwon's secretary,

814
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,160
I scolded her and told
her she shouldn't lie.

815
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,740
But Mr. Kwon stood on her side.

816
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,220
My goodness.

817
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,330
I want to scold Mr. Kwon.

818
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,260
That was too harsh, Mr. Kwon!

819
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,730
What do you mean?

820
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,940
What Mr. Kwon said was right.

821
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,910
Interfering with the conversation
of an attorney and a client...

822
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,830
is not the concern of a secretary.

823
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,760
But why did that girl commit such fraud?

824
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,750
She probably needed money.

825
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,320
Judging by the public defender,
her family doesn't seem well off.

826
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,370
Well, I heard she's coming
with her parents today.

827
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,880
We'll get to learn more then.

828
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,670
Wait. She came alone?

829
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,600
I thought I told you to
come with your parents.

830
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:29,800
They're busy working.

831
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,080
Tell me your parents' phone numbers.

832
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,070
They don't have phones.

833
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,390
Then tell me their numbers at work.
They must have a phone there.

834
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,560
Oh, right. They quit work yesterday.

835
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,890
I don't have anything else to say.
Can I go now?

836
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,440
If you act like that in court,
you may receive additional punishment.

837
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,670
You may also be sentenced to prison.

838
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,170
Are you trying to scare me?

839
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,490
I'm not scared of anything like that.

840
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:13,230
You pretending to be tough just
sounds like a cry for help.

841
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,520
- What do you...
- The trial will open soon,

842
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,800
and people with the right to take
away your freedom will gather.

843
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,390
According to their decision,
you may become an ex-convict.

844
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,440
The only person who can help
you in that trial will be me.

845
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,540
If you want my help,
you should trust me more.

846
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,370
Trust who? Forget it.

847
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,550
Why does she keep lying all the time?

848
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,820
And why doesn't she close the door?

849
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,750
I can't go on the weekend.

850
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,140
I think I'll have to
spend time with Jin Hee.

851
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,460
I thought she was all grown up,

852
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,910
and thought it was a relief
she grew up into a nice girl.

853
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,640
But she must've been really lonely.

854
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,080
I'm the only family she has,
but I was too busy.

855
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:14,340
She was sick yesterday,
and came home early from school.

856
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,780
But it turns out she was lying.

857
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,020
She pretended to be sick
to get my attention.

858
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,940
Attention?

859
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:27,290
Yoon Ha? Kim Yoon Ha?

860
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,300
Right, she was a trainee at
our agency until last year.

861
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,540
Really?

862
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,190
She really was a trainee?

863
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,070
Yes. Last year,

864
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,820
she didn't make it as a final
member of a girl group,

865
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,010
so she quit.

866
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,810
She joined when she was 14,

867
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,460
so she stayed about five years.

868
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,200
Do you know Ji Yong from X-Teen?

869
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,490
She auditioned together with him,
so they were really close.

870
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,390
Ji Yong joined JD Entertainment later.

871
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,550
He made his debut and became famous.

872
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,690
It's unfortunate for Yoon Ha though.

873
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,870
I remember that she had
quite a lot of talent,

874
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,890
but her family wasn't well off,

875
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:06,310
so she never came to practice
because of her part-time job.

876
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,600
What use is staying here five years?
She never improved.

877
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,100
So we had no choice but to kick her out.

878
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,970
Why do you ask, by the way?

879
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,630
It's nothing.

880
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,310
Did she start getting rebellious
after she was kicked out?

881
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,210
Good job.

882
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,530
Hyuk Joon, I know it was tough
following me around lately.

883
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,440
It must've been tiring,
since Yun Seo had no work at all.

884
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,750
It was nothing. Great job today.

885
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,690
I think you and I get
along very well together.

886
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,210
Why don't you just work with me now?

887
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,490
What are you talking about?

888
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:44,510
Do you know how long it's been
since I've worked with Yun Seo?

889
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,790
That's why I'm asking.

890
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,050
It seems she won't have
any work for a long time.

891
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,850
Honestly, all the actors
are talking about it.

892
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:53,980
Her reputation is already ruined,

893
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,480
and they say it's impossible for
Yun Seo to make a comeback.

894
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,070
Hey, Kim Min Ji!

895
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,140
Yun Seo.

896
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,890
Hi, Yun Seo. It's been a while.

897
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,660
Don't mind what I just said.

898
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,890
I just feel sorry for Hyuk Joon
being like this.

899
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:15,420
Honestly, the whole nation knows
you're on the edge of a cliff.

900
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,980
What if Hyuk Joon stays with you
and goes down with you too?

901
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,830
Don't you agree?

902
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,320
Gosh, I have to go to a meeting
for a commercial shoot.

903
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,420
You once used to be a busy actress too,

904
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,700
so you understand, right?

905
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,700
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

906
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,570
What is wrong with you? Are you insane?

907
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,110
Yes, I am insane.

908
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,710
How could I be sane when you're
disrespecting me like this?

909
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:46,920
No, Yun Seo.

910
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,230
My gosh. You darn wench!

911
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,490
Hey, stop it.

912
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,820
- Hey!
- Stop it!

913
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,400
- Let go!
- Are you crazy?

914
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,350
Don't take pictures.

915
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,690
You can't take pictures. Stop taking them!

916
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,290
- Put that down!
- Let go!

917
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:05,130
- Let go of me!
- Hey!

918
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,960
- Stop!
- Let go!

919
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,350
- Stop!
- I'm going to kill you.

920
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,270
Wow, what an amazing view.

921
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,230
Doesn't it feel so comforting
at an open place like this?

922
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,400
Right?

923
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:39,460
Yun Seo, I'll go and
get some sweet coffee for you.

924
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,580
You feel better whenever
you have something sweet.

925
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,010
Wait for me.

926
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,610
Yun Seo. Wouldn't it be
better to just go home?

927
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,770
Just call the law firm and
tell them you're sick.

928
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,700
If you go to work like this...

929
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,980
No. I'm okay now.

930
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:51,840
Hyuk Joon.

931
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,590
I'm going to finish...

932
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:57,990
this three-month project by all means.

933
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,810
And I'm going to make
my comeback as an actress.

934
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,990
I'll prove it to everyone.

935
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,940
- And Hyuk Joon...
- Yes?

936
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:15,080
Don't lie to me from now on.

937
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,610
I'll forgive you once,
but there will be no second chance.

938
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,180
- Do you get it?
- Of course I do.

939
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,380
I'll do a better job.

940
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:48,020
Yes, sir. Yoon Ha called me.

941
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,450
I'm on my way to the police station now.

942
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,520
What do you mean? The police station?

943
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,340
Did something happen to Yoon Ha?

944
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,830
The mother of the victim of
the fraud case sued her,

945
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,480
and she's been arrested.

946
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,390
You can go home after
finishing up your work.

947
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,220
I'll go with you.

948
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,520
Okay, let's go.

949
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:15,750
(Trustworthy Police, Police for the People)

(Seoul Northern District Police Station)

951
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,860
But why didn't she call
her parents first...

952
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,440
and call you instead?

953
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,620
Yoon Ha hasn't been able to
reach her parents for years.

954
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,450
What? She can't reach them?

955
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,190
Her mom ran away when she was a kid,

956
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,220
and she hasn't talked to her
dad for the past two years.

957
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,400
People may see you,
so you should stay in the car.

958
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,620
Okay.

959
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,990
Hold on.

960
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:50,170
It's true she was a trainee
at Yeon Entertainment,

961
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,610
and she really knows Ji Yong.

962
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:56,630
I mean, she's not such a bad kid.

963
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,340
Take good care of her.

964

(Trustworthy Police, Police for the People)

965
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,520
Listen to me.

966
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,640
- Calm down, ma'am.
- Forget it!

967
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,270
Lock her in jail immediately.

968
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,240
I'm Kwon Jung Rok, Kim Yoon Ha's attorney.

969
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,570
- What's the matter?
- This girl...

970
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,410
came over to my house and made a commotion.

971
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,900
I didn't make a commotion.

972
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:29,930
I just wanted to apologize to Min Ah.

973
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,930
Hey. If the victim considers
it as a commotion,

974
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:34,580
it is a commotion.

975
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,950
You came as you pleased to
settle this issue, didn't you?

976
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,370
I can't believe it.

977
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,970
I heard you live alone
without your parents.

978
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:43,060
Is it because you have
no one to learn from?

979
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,460
You're just an ill-bred brat, aren't you?

980
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,620
Please watch your mouth.

981
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,530
What you just said can
be subject to contempt.

982
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:51,990
- What?
- And...

983
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,420
going to your house to apologize
and causing a commotion...

984
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,930
are not relevant at all.

985
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,990
If it turns out you made a false
report that she caused...

986
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,760
a commotion when she
really went to apologize,

987
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,070
you may be charged for
making false accusations.

988
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,060
Why are you being so serious suddenly?

989
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,830
We tend to overreact when we're angry.

990
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,980
Do you even understand how I feel?

991
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,610
Do you know she's a swindler?

992
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,430
She lied that she was friends
with some entertainer...

993
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:15,770
to take money from my daughter.

994
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:18,370
This case hasn't been ruled as fraud yet,

995
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:21,480
and if you spread rumors that she's
a fraud, it's subject to defamation.

996
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,590
Goodness. You talk as if
everything I say is a crime.

997
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,050
Sir. A trial is currently
in progress for this case,

998
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,010
so there's nothing left
for you to investigate.

999
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,510
It seems like she made a false report too.

1000
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,840
Yoon Ha came with you voluntarily anyway,

1001
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,400
so I will take her.

1002
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,310
- Suit yourself.
- Okay.

00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:05,210
How did it go? Did you take care of it?

1005
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,370
Are you all right?

1006
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,160
You should eat up.

1007
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,250
I told you I'm not hungry.

1008
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,060
This is from an important client.

1009
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,750
Yes?

1010
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,130
Why are you staring at me?

1011
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:39,830
Yoon Ha.

1012
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,100
I know it's tough.

1013
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,070
It's tough, and you feel lonely.

1014
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,870
That's why you lied, right?

1015
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,980
Because you want to be loved.

1016
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,620
What are you talking about? That's so lame.

1017
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,340
Why? Is wanting to be loved...

1018
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:58,880
something to be embarrassed of?

1019
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:11,630
You're right.

1020
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,300
I'm Oh Yun Seo.

1021
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:17,380
Like you said, a washed-up actress?

1022
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:19,930
That was...

1023
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:23,300
People say that I'm hopeless...

1024
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,850
and that I'll never be able to come back.

1025
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,610
They say I'm standing
on the edge of a cliff.

1026
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,750
But I...

1027
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,670
want to be loved again, like before.

1028
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:42,410
I want to go back to where I
shined brighter than anyone.

1029
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,640
Should I be embarrassed of how I feel?

1030
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,600
No, well...

1031
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,920
I think I know how you feel.

1032
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,750
Your dream was to make your debut,

1033
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,820
but you were kicked out from that world.

1034
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,240
You were in despair,
thinking that everything was over.

1035
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,010
You felt lonely, thinking there was
no one on your side in this world.

1036
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,390
But Yoon Ha...

1037
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,740
I hope you stop abusing yourself.

1038
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,840
By acting like this,

1039
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,300
you're abusing yourself the most...

1040
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,520
rather than doing anyone else wrong.

1041
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,600
Do you think I'm being too nosy?

1042
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,220
I was afraid,

1043
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,390
to be honest.

1044
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,910
If I tell people the truth about me,

1045
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,610
they wouldn't ever love me.

1046
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,720
That's why I started to tell lies.

1047
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:06,630
Before I knew it, all those lies...

1048
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:10,090
became out of control.

1049
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:15,470
No, it's still not too late.
You can go back to how it was.

1050
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,020
So...

1051
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,900
don't you ever give up on yourself.

1052
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:23,180
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1053
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,210
Don't cry.

1054
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,120
We prosecute the defendant Kim
Yoon Ha on charges of fraud...

1055
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,630
according to Article 347 of the Penal Code.

1056
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,280
Attorney, how do you plead?

1057
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:06,280
We deny all charges and allegations.

1058
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,120
The defendant pleads not guilty.

1059
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:15,030
In the previous trial,
you admitted to all the charges.

1060
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:17,730
Why are you suddenly pleading innocence?

1061
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,870
Fraud is a wrongful or
criminal deception...

1062
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:24,440
intended to result in
financial or personal gain.

1063
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:28,110
However, my client is missing
one of its components.

1064
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,970
She did not deceive anyone.

1065
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,040
As a former K-pop idol trainee,

1066
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:37,590
she was close to Ji Yong of X-Teen...

1067
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,180
due to being trainees at the same agency.

1068
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:44,770
She only suggested getting his autograph...

1069
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,960
because, as his friend,

1070
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,660
she believed she'd be able to.

1071
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,010
Since she had no intention
of defrauding her friends,

1072
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,590
we plead that she is innocent.

1073
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,570
Can the fraud charges really be dropped?

1074
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,840
I'm almost certain of it.

1075
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,620
I only thought of getting
her a lenient sentence,

1076
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,320
but you came up with a
way to win the trial.

1077
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,310
I'm truly impressed.

1078
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,190
I'm sorry.

1079
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,790
What?

1080
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:33,500
I told you before not to get emotional...

1081
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,370
because it wouldn't help with cases.

1082
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,500
I apologize.

1083
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,310
Thanks to your emotional actions,

1084
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,210
Yoon Ha finally opened up.

1085
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,540
It was nothing.

1086
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,850
You did well, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

As a reward, can you tutor me?

1119
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,330
This feels like a date on a school campus.

1120
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:44,250
My secretary wanted to study up on the law.

1121
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,360
We only went there to study.

1122
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:48,310
The last thing I expected was
to see you in a relationship.

1123
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,290
It's not like I'm interested
in Mr. Kwon or anything.

1124
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,310
- Jung Rok!
- Hi, Yeo Reum.

1125
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:57,860
His walls are down completely
with that female prosecutor.

1126
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,980
You shouldn't be that
easy with your smiles.

1127
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,600
No one's ever said that to me before.

1128
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,130
It's as if you're jealous.

1129
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:06,200
Jealous? Unbelievable.

1130
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,800
- So what? What about it?
- I'm jealous.

1131
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:11,840
There's something I want to say to you.
