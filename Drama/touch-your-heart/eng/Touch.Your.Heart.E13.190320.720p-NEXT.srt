1
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,930
I had a great time today.

2
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,230
I wanted to watch that movie with you,

3
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,970
so I'm glad that we got this chance.

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,830
I'm glad you think that way.

5
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,600
It was perfect.

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,810
It was the kind of goodbye
that I expected from you.

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,620
"Goodbye" seems a bit harsh, right?

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,190
It seems like we're parting,

9
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,300
but we only won't be seeing
each other at the law firm.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,520
Although, that's quite sad too.

11
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,560
Ms. Oh Yun Seo.

12
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,750
Why are you suddenly
calling me by that name?

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,400
Thanks to you,

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,700
I was happy.

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,970
Why are you saying that?

16
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,850
Just like that movie,

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,190
you'll go back to your world,

18
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,040
and I'll go back to mine.

19
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,360
That's what I want.

21
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,870

♫ <i>Just like then</i> ♫

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,690

♫ <i>When I couldn't let go</i> ♫

28
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,830
Why are you being like
this all of a sudden?

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,900
Did I do something wrong?

30
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,840
Is it because I lied to you?

31
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,090
Do you suddenly feel betrayed
now that you think about it?

32
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,090
Or did the paparazzi photo
make you feel uncomfortable?

33
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,240
Do you feel pressured because of
all the attention I'm getting?

34
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,220
Can you please say something?

35
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,670
Why do we need to break up?

36
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,800
Yes, you're right.

37
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,610
Because of all the reasons
you just mentioned,

38
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,350
I've come to a conclusion that we
shouldn't date each other anymore.

39
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,240
So...

40
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,250
I think it would be best that we break up.

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,550
Mr. Kwon.

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,950
Thank you...

43
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,590

Yun Seo.

57
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,310
Yun Seo.

58
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,820
Is she still sleeping?

59
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,790
Yun Seo.

60
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,600
Yun Seo, what's the matter?

61
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,730
Yun Seo, did you cry?

62
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,370
Hyuk Joon.

63
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,050
Yes, that's right. I'm right here,

64
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,400
so tell me what it is.

65
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,170
What's wrong?

66
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,290
Mr. Kwon broke up with me.

67
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,210
What?

68
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,890
He said that this is
where our story ends...

69
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,370
even when he admitted to liking me so much.

70
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,920
Even when he promised to
always be on my side.

71
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,380
How can someone change so drastically?

72
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,190
How can a relationship end with
just a few exchanges of words?

73
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,820
I've never experienced a breakup before,

74
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,890
so I don't know how to act or what to feel.

75
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,330
Yun Seo,

76
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,380
you have to clear out
your desk at the law firm,

77
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,140
but I'll do that for you.
Stay home and rest.

78
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,990
No, I'll go.

79
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,450
It doesn't seem like you're
in a shape to do so.

80
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,520
Still, I need to see Mr. Kwon.

81
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,780
Yun Seo.

82
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,340
Yun Seo.

83
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,070
Mr. Yeon, why are you sighing?

84
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,850
The law firm feels oddly dim today.

85
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,200
Do we have a burned-out bulb?

86
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,910
Mr. Yeon, I don't think that's what it is.

87
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,620
The six fluorescent lights we
have are shining brightly...

88
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,540
in their designated places.

89
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,190
Is that so? Why does it seem dim then?

90
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,780
Is it because of Ms. Oh?

91
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,010
That's right.

92
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,640
The luminous goddess is gone,
and darkness is back at the office.

93
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,740
You're right. It does feel
a bit empty around here.

94
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,960
Even we feel her absence,

95
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,070
so I can't imagine how it is for Mr. Kwon.

96
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,510
Ms. Oh helped him greatly as his secretary.

97
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,660
Her presence must be irreplaceable.

98
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,530
Just imagine...

99
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,260
a young lost deer that has nowhere to go.

100
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,670
That I'm not sure about.

101
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,590
Anyway, Ms. Yang,
aid him with whatever he needs.

102
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,340
Sure. I'll look out for him more.

103
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,920
Ms. Oh?

104
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,420
Ms. Oh!

105
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,490
What are you doing here?

106
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,330
I thought you weren't coming in anymore.

107
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,950
Well, I had to clear out my desk.

108
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,240
We could've just mailed
you your belongings.

109
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,200
You didn't have to come
down here personally.

110
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,930
Just...

111
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,030
She doesn't seem like
her bubbly self today.

112
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,990
Mr. Kwon.

113
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,050
I'll get going then.

114
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,370
I'm leaving.

115
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,520
Once I leave, there's no turning back.

116
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,610
Are you really not going to look at me?

117
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,870
You did a good job during your time here.

118
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,330
I hope that you do well
even after you leave.

- If you don't have plans,

137
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,010
join me for drinks tonight.

138
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,210

139

I've actually been craving some myself.

140
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,760
Jung Rok.

141
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,820
What are you two doing here together?

142
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,220
We agreed to give us another shot.

143
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,260
You have no idea how clingy she is.

144
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,830
I agreed to accept that devotion.

145
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,690
I gave in to her tenacity and persistence.

146
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,270
Stop joking in front of him.

147
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,450
Don't you know that he takes
everything seriously?

148
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,450
Actually, you're wrong about him on that.

149
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,830
He's not the stiff and
wooden person he used to be.

150
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,150
He's totally different now.

151
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
Dating someone has made him that way.

152
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,790
- Really?
- Yes.

153
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,210
If the old Jung Rok were
like this dried squid,

154
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,510
the Jung Rok that now dates...

155
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,630
is as soft and spongy like this egg roll.

156
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,750
What's with the long face though?
Don't you like my analogy?

157
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,770
I'm sure Ms. Oh would agree.

158
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,350
While we're at it,

159
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,480
let's ask her to join us.

160
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,980
He's right. You should ask her.

161
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,650
You had better brace yourself...

162
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,310
because you'll be shocked to see
how smitten he is with her.

163
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,640
Don't just sit there. Call her.

164
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,850
Hold on. Is this place a bit too shabby...

165
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,360
to call her?

166
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,540
Shall we go to a wine bar nearby?

167
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,720
Let's do that.

168
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,310
This place is too exposed and
she might feel uncomfortable.

169
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,400
- Right?
- Yes.

170
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,600
There's no need.

171
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,510
Why?

172
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,530
Are you worried we might tease her?

173
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,360
Look at him. This is
how much he cares for her.

174
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,790
We broke up.

175
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,580
What do you...

176
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,500
What? Why?

177
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,140
If I keep staying here,
I'll just make you guys uncomfortable.

178
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,200
Let's meet up again next time.

179
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,040
I'll get going then. Have fun.

180
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,280
Jung Rok.

181
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,380
Hey, how could you leave like that?

182
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,590
Let's go for a drink of soju.

183
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,030
- I sent Yeo Reum home.
- Why?

184
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,870
What are you talking about?

185
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,910
When you said that before,

186
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,610
I should've realized that
something was wrong.

187
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,840
Let's go. Come on.

188
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,430
- Ma'am, one more soju, please.
- Okay.

189
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,310
So...

190
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,870
You broke up with her for
the sake of her happiness?

191
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,510
Why did you if you're going
to be this depressed?

192
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,180
You should've stuck with her
until the end by all means.

193
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,950
I know well how much she
wanted to go back...

194
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,630
to that path again.

195
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,170
I didn't want to become a barrier
that blocked her in that path.

196
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,890
How could I do that?

197
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,970
There was nothing else I could
do besides letting her go.

198
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,220
Still...

199
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,350
Ms. Oh doesn't even know this fact.

200
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,190
She'll just remember you as a jerk
who suddenly changed. That's so...

201
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,440
So...

202
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,780
how did you endure it?

203
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,360
After you broke up with Yeo Reum.

204
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,530
How did you endure it?

205
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,130
However, regarding the damage caused
by infringement of copyright,

206
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,090
the software developed by
the plaintiff is being...

207
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,990
sold individually and independently.
Taking this into consideration,

208
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,680
the scope of compensation for damages...

209
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,500
must be limited to the infringement
committed by the defendant.

210
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,270
I was investigating the damages for
overseas real estate development,

211
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,240
and I found out the appraisal
and assessment methods between...

212
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,090
foreign investment countries
and Korea were different.

213
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,070
And as a result, the company
suffered a five-million-dollar loss.

the Protective Labor Legislation.

Please consider the fact that
the program developed by...

220
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,850
the defendant while he worked brought
huge profits to his company.

I hope the defendant receives the
maximum amount of leniency...

Let's drink to Mr. Kwon
who recorded number one in sales.

230
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,510
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

231
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,940
Ma'am?

232
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,230
Mr. Kwon. You've been working like...

233
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,830
a madman these days. I love it.

234
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,370
It'd be nice if you answer me
when I talk to you.

235
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,070
But what's the big deal about...

236
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,030
recording number one in sales
to hold a team dinner?

237
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,610
What do you think it is?

238
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,800
It's what motivates our law
firm for a better tomorrow.

239
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,590
Mr. Choi. When will you become the
star of a team dinner like this?

240
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,450
You said you'd care more about our profits.

241
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,860
You said you'd give up
your sense of duty and justice.

242
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,580
But I just want to give you up.

243
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,500
My goodness! How could you say that?
That's too harsh!

244
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,150
You seem a bit too harsh right now.

245
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,220
Are you upset with me
over something lately?

246
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,370
Is that why you dress up like this
in order to protest against me?

247
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,690
You were terrifying
when you just did that gesture.

248
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,950
Please, Mr. Yeon.

249
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,300
She looks so pretty. Don't say that.

250
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,010
That's what I wanted to say.
You should mind yourself, sir.

251
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,270
And don't eat with food all over your lips.

252
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,260
Is that so?

253
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,120
Hearing something like that in front
of everyone is very embarrassing.

254
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,790
Wait a minute. What is this strange mood?

255
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,910
Ms. Dan and Mr. Choi took turns
just now covering for each other.

256
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,450
You can't fool my eyes.

257
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,810
Have you two...

258
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,430
formed an alliance?

259
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,840
You two recorded the lowest performance,

260
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,900
so you formed an alliance to
help each other out, right?

261
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,810
That's ridiculous, sir.

262
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,270
Still, they're better off this way.

263
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,550
Before, they used to bicker
like enemies, but now,

264
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,590
they're warm to each other
like cherry blossoms...

265
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,970
blooming in spring along the railroad.

266
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,760
Mr. Lee, you speak very poetically.

267
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,650
I don't think you know it. Am I right?

268
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,580
He might even become a poet.

269
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,700
That's a dream that I've
cherished for a long time.

270
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,870
Really? Then can you write a poem about me?

271
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,620
The subtitle can be
something like "charisma".

272
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,050
That sounds intense.

273
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,600
Don't you think? Cheers.

274
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,520
Cheers.

275
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,750
By the way, why aren't you smiling?

276
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,320
You keep scowling and ruining the mood.

277
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,460
It's okay if he doesn't
smile since he's competent.

278
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,700
You can stop smiling, as long
as you become more competent.

279
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,330
Mr. Kwon, let's have a drink.
With an expressionless face.

280
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,370
Your glass is empty.

281
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,430
Here you go. Let's say
cheers expressionlessly.

282
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,580
Eat up.

283
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,360
She's here!

289
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,080
You dropped this.

290
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,310
Oh, my. Thank you.

291
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,960
I usually hate making mistakes.

292
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,980
I don't like people who
make mistakes either.

293
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,370
But you're the first one
who still looks cute.

294
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,290
I know I wrote this,
but this is embarrassing.

295
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,420
It's okay since you said it
to Yun Seo, right?

296
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,480
Ms. Oh did a script reading recently.

297
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,900
I guess she's doing well.

298
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,740
She looks pretty. Look.

299
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,770
Look at Ms. Oh. She's gorgeous as always.

300
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,590
She looks happier than
she did at our law firm.

301
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,780
Maybe it's because she's doing
something she really likes.

302
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,190
I really miss Ms. Oh.

303
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,810
Me too.

304
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,230
I grew quite attached to her,
and I think of her often.

305
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,410
It was fun to chat with her
in the office kitchen.

306
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,870
I miss her too.

307
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,200
Right? I'm not the only one
who misses her, am I?

308
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,560
Mr. Kwon, why aren't you saying anything?

309
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,370
Don't you miss Ms. Oh?

310
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,100
Can't you hear me?

311
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,290
Goodness. He's like a human
with no heart at all.

312
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,430
Hold on. I don't see Ms. Dan and Mr. Choi.

313
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,550
I think they both have
plans for lunch today.

314
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,110
Honey.

315
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,090
How do I look today?

316
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,870
You told me that you like
women who wear dresses,

317
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,400
so I bought this on the internet.

318
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,230
It's not too bad.

319
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,760
Honey.

320
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,790
Try this.

321
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,130
I'll dip it in this peanut butter
sauce that's just as sweet as you.

322
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,100
Here you go.

323
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,050
No, Ms. Dan. It's okay.

324
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,060
And I've been meaning to
tell you this for a while.

325
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,620
I know that we're dating
each other by contract,

326
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,140
but I personally think you're being...

327
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,790
a bit too forward.

328
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,640
And that wasn't part of our contract.

329
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,130
Okay, I understand.

330
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,140
Ms. Dan.

331
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,140
By any chance, did you forget
the contents of the contract?

332
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,630
Let me remind you one more time.

333
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,110
"Article 1. We will be dating
each other for 1 month."

334
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,080
We have five more days left.
I didn't forget.

335
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,250
"Article two. We are both
forbidden to date or flirt..."

336
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,570
"with a third party..."

337
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,690
"during the period of our contract."

338
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,720
Yes, of course. I'm not seeing
anyone else other than you.

339
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,800
"Article three. During the
period of the contract,"

340
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,930
"we must eat together at
least two times a week."

341
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,530
That's exactly why we're
eating together right now.

342
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,330
What exactly is the problem?

343
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,330
There are additional articles
that can break the contract.

344
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,880
"We shall not make any
kind of physical contact."

345
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,410
Does that mean our contract
is no longer valid...

346
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,200
because our hands touched while
trying to reach out for the sauce?

347
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,950
Well, it seemed like it was an accident,

348
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,510
so I'll just end it with a warning.

349
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,150
I hope you're more careful from now on.

350
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,910
Okay, I'll be really careful.

351
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,640
Just a second.

352
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,720
Yes, this is Choi Yun Hyuk.

353
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,160
Gosh, that was really close.

354
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,070
Our contract almost got canceled.
What a nightmare.

355
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,140
Left hand, you'd better be more careful.

356
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,320
This is a warning.

357
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,010
Does she like me that much?

358
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,110
Well, of course,
I can totally understand why.

359
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,830
But her feelings for me are a bit too much.

360
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,120
What should I do?

361
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,900
I get that she's nice and cute,

362
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,020
but my heart feels so numb.

363
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,650
My heart...

364
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,830
Jung Rok.

365
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,860
It seemed odd that you never
drove to work these days.

366
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,270
Have you always been taking the bus?

367
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,620
Yes, kind of.

368
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,230
Since we ran into each other,
should we go get some soju?

369
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,120
No, let's just go.

370
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,100
Wait for me.

371
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,420
Gosh, you must be so tired.

372
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,890
Goodness, are you that tired?
You must be exhausted.

373
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,740
Did you not get any sleep again last night?

374
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,380
I have no time to sleep.

375
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,360
I need to memorize so many lines.

376
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,600
I know, right? There are so
many legal terms in the script.

377
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,490
It seemed like it'll be really
hard to memorize the lines.

378
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,940
But having worked at the law
firm really helped out a lot.

379
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,030
I've heard of most of the terms.

380
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,840
It makes it easy for me to
memorize and understand my lines.

381
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,260
We're here.

382
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,920
Already? Gosh, what are you going to do?

383
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,280
I'm pretty sure the shoot
will finish at dawn again.

384
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,450
It's okay. Gosh, my back.

385
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,420
I should go outside and
stretch my body a little.

386
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,850
Hello.

387
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,310
I'm relieved that she quickly
managed to get better again.

Her Comeback Drama, "Love Hurts")

391
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,420
I guess she's okay now.

392
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,110
Cheers.

393
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,210
By the way, what's in that big paper bag?

394
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,140
Oh, I got you some gifts.

395
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,750
These masks will protect you
from all the fine dust.

396
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,960
Are you sure you didn't
get them to protect me...

397
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,380
from all the other women?

398
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,440
Yes, you're right.

399
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,580
And these are...

400
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,940
some cosmetics that will make
your fine skin become even finer.

401
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,340
And these are vitamins that
will enhance your energy.

402
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,860
And these are...

403
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,090
Wait.

404
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,810
Ms. Dan, do you like me that much?

405
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,710
I mean, I'm very well aware...

406
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,310
of how extremely attractive I am.

407
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,870
But am I really worth all this?

408
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,120
Yes, you're worth it. You're so attractive.

409
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,160
The more I get to know you, I find
myself falling for you even more.

410
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,450
That's why it makes me feel sad.

411
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,530
I like you so much, but this happiness...

412
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,990
will only last for five more days.

413
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,060
Can you be honest with me?

414
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,720
How did you feel during the one month...

415
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,540
that we've dated each other?

416
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,600
Are you going to end it
with me cold turkey...

417
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,880
after five days?

418
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,550
You're a really good person.

419
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,810
You take such good care of me,
and you're also a little cute.

420
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,530
But how should I put this?

421
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,740
My heart feels numb when I'm with you.

422
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,160
What?

423
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,370
Are you okay? Why did you drink so much?

424
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,010
Why do you think?

425
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,720
I like you so much.

426
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,280
But once the contract's over,
we'll have to go back to being colleagues.

427
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,660
And that makes me feel miserable.

428
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,270
But I guess there's nothing we can do.

429
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,090
It's my fault for having failed
to make your heart flutter.

430
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,960
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

431
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,810
I'm okay.

432
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,140
I'm relieved. I'm sorry about that.

433
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,150
What... What's with that face?

434
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,310
Did you just fall for him?

435
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,830
Yes, isn't he so attractive?

436
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,890
But you were just telling
me how much you like me...

437
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,620
and that you feel miserable.

438
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,540
You told me that your heart
feels numb when you're with me.

439
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,130
I tend to give up really quickly.

440
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,810
Hey, wait. My leg...

441
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,680
I think I hurt my leg a little.

442
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,190
So can you give me your number?
Or can you give me a ride?

443
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,190
Wait! Hey!

444
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,110
Gosh, my heart...

445
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,660
Why does my heart hurt?

446
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,620
I tend to give up really quickly.

447
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,530
Yes, Mom. A blind date?

448
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,970
I don't want to go on a blind date.

449
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,490
Yes, okay. Bye.

450
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,540
Mr. Lee, is your mother telling
you to go on a blind date?

451
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,920
Yes.

452
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,750
But I really don't have any
plans to go on a blind date.

453
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,040
I'm one of those people who think...

454
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,320
people who are meant to be are
strongly connected to each other.

455
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,240
What kind of nonsense is that?

456
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,830
Why does the defendant's proxy
keep asking to change the date?

457
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,250
Don't you think this is a bit out of line?

458
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,770
I'll reject their request for
wanting to change the date.

459
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,800
Then I'll submit a document
to the department of justice.

460
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,100
Where's Kwon Jung Rok?

461
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,310
- Ma'am...
- Where is he?

462
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,810
Please calm down first.

463
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,840
Where's Kwon Jung Rok?

464
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,090
Where is he?

465
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,530
There you are.

466
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,710
You remember my son, don't you?

467
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:15,030
You made my son a murderer in
court in just a blink of an eye.

468
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,530
Park Su Myeong.

469
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,880
Who murdered Kim Yeong Tae?

470
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,390
The person who stabbed him...

471
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,730
- The person who stabbed him...
- No, don't say a word!

472
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,000
The defendant will sit.

473
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,070
No, don't hit her. Don't hit her!

474
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,830
I came looking for you
because he doesn't deserve this.

475
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,540
- Ma'am, please calm down...
- Let go of me.

476
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,450
How can I calm down...

477
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,080
when this man made my son
look like a murderer?

478
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,740
My son...

479
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,020
isn't cruel enough...

480
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,400
to stab someone twice and kill him!

481
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:03,910
Ma'am, I understand how you feel,

482
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,110
but Mr. Kwon wasn't the one who
decided that he was guilty.

483
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,680
The case was ruled by a judge.

484
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,190
Tomorrow's the last hearing.
What is my son going to do?

485
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,890
What if he stays locked up forever?

486
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,890
I will never forgive you.

487
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,440
Never!

488
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,910
Ma'am.

489
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,970
Mr. Kwon, don't let it get to you.

490
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,540
That's just how mothers are.

491
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,530
When push comes to shove
and the child is cornered,

492
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,810
parents show a lapse in judgment...

493
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,680
and choose to believe their innocence.

494
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,480
Ms. Yang, don't you agree?

495
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,250
Yes, that sounds about right.

496
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,310
You know how my daughter was
accused of being a bully.

497
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,460
That case taught me something.

498
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,800
When a child is pushed into a corner,

499
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,680
no parent is able to think clearly.

500
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,400
The mind goes completely blank.

501
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,260
Mr. Park's mother just needed
someone to vent her frustration on.

502
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,110
The situation isn't ideal,

503
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,720
but hating and resenting you...

504
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,910
probably kept her sane all this time.

505
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,580
So please be understanding.

506
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,190
The prosecutor will recommend a sentence.

507
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,350
(Defendant)

508
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,130
The defendant Park Su Myeong...

509
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,790
adored Im Yun Hee, the victim's wife.

510
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,950
On the night of January 21, 2019,

511
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,220
in order to save Ms. Im who was
being assaulted by her husband,

512
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,310
the defendant picked up a knife.

513
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,620
If he only wished to protect Ms. Im though,

514
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,760
he could've called the
police or ran out with her.

515
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,160
He could've come up with another solution.

516
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,570
However, the defendant chose
the most drastic action.

517
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,220
He stabbed the victim
once in the abdomen...

518
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,030
and once in the chest...

519
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,960
and brutally murdered the victim.

520
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,670
Considering all circumstances,
it's hard to say...

521
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,180
that his actions were accidental
and that he only...

522
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,690
wished to protect Ms. Im
by means of self-defense.

523
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,880
Instead, it's most likely that
his violent side came through.

524
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,090
That is why I believe he must be...

525
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,120
isolated from the public for some time.

526
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,140
I recommend a sentence
of 20 years in prison.

527
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,300
Defense Attorney,
deliver your closing argument.

528
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,320
The defendant admits all of his actions...

529
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,940
and is in deep remorse.

530
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,610
I hope you put that into consideration.

531
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,930
Case number 2019G173.

532
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,600
The defendant Park Su Myeong
is on trial for murder.

533
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,330
I will now deliver his sentence.

534
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,180
We sentence the defendant
to 20 years in prison.

535
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,760
No! You're wrong!

536
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,900
My son didn't kill anyone!

537
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,570
My son isn't a monster!

538
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,310
- No!
- Don't hurt my mom.

539
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,220
- My boy... No!
- Not my mom!

540
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,370
- Get away from my mom.
- He's innocent!

541
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,200
Mom, take me with you. I want to go home.

542
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,120
Mom, I want to go home!

543
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,870
- Mom!
- My boy!

544
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,230
- Mom!
- He's innocent!

545
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,380
Mom, I want to go home!

546
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,630
My boy!

547
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,330
Get away from my mom!

548
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,240
Mr. Kwon.

549
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,890
Please help my son.

550
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,310
He didn't kill anyone.

551
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,370
I'm sorry about how I treated you before.

552
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,210
You didn't know the truth, right?

553
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,810
So please, help my boy.

554
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,620
I understand what you're going through.

555
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,380
However, your son...

556
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,490
confessed his crimes in court.

557
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,570
That's right. Then you
should've let him finish.

558
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,750
Why didn't you hear him out completely?

559
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,580
My son only stabbed the victim once.

560
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,400
Then the second stab...

561
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,760
might have come from the wife!

562
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,640
He may be a lot of things, but my son...

563
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,900
never lies.

564
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,150
I've been suspicious of
that Im Yun Hee woman.

565
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,420
It seemed like she adored my son...

566
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,230
so much that she was willing
to go to jail for him,

567
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,160
but she hasn't visited him even once.

568
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,440
She disappeared from the neighborhood!

569
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,870
(Statement)

570
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,400
(Cell phone number)

571
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,140
The number you have
called is not in service.

572
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:59,170
Please check the number and redial.

573
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,830
Yun Seo, you're always beautiful,

574
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,220
but you look exceptional today.

575
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,050
The makeup looks smooth too.

576
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,270
She's right. You look like a goddess.

577
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,560
I should take a photo later.

578
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,040
Why would you take a photo?

579
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,390
You're not here on a picnic, you know.

580
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,720
Also, don't bother her since she
has an emotional scene today.

581
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,190
We must help our actor
stay in her character.

582
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,360
Don't you agree?

583
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,580
Why? Do you have a problem?

584
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,170
We're ready for her.

585
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,580
- Sure thing.
- I'm ready too.

586
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,060
And action!

587
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,450
What is it?

588
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,400
Why are you having a hard time telling me?

589
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,770
- What is it?
- We...

590
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,830
should break up.

591
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,430
It's over.

592
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,970
We...

593
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,480
should break up.

594
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,130
Cut. Okay!

595
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,710
Yun Seo, that was great.

596
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,100
My gosh.

597
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,440
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

598
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,520
I had no idea she could give deep emotions.

599
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,700
I know. She seems fully
absorbed in her character too.

600
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,870
Her acting has improved a lot.

601
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,600
She won't be called a
bad actor anymore now.

602
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,250
Bad actor? You won't have to
worry about that ever again.

603
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,330
- Director, please excuse me.
- Okay.

604
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,180
Yun Seo, are you okay?

605
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,820
Why are you crying?

606
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:31,180
Is it because you were reminded of him?

607
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,690
I tried to forget...

608
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,330
I tried so hard to forget about him.

609
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,520
But whenever I think about
Mr. Kwon from time to time,

610
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,840
I become unbearably sad.

611
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,220
I thought you were okay now.

612
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,470
How could I be okay? I liked him so much.

613
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,120
But there's nothing I can do.

614
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,990
I must think of my fans...

615
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,170
and everyone who is
waiting for my comeback.

616
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,270
And if I keep having a hard time like this,

617
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,080
Mr. Kwon won't like it either.

618
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,240
I'm sorry, Hyuk Joon.

619
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,980
I'll try my best...

620
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,280
to control my feelings.

621
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:29,950
Don't worry.

622
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,460
Okay. I'm sorry too.

623
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,390
You should get some rest, Yun Seo.

624
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,530
I wonder if he's doing well.

625
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,120
During Im Yun Hee's first hearing,

626
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,720
Park Su Myeong was pointed
out as the real culprit,

627
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,610
and she was released on bail.

628
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,790
After that, her whereabouts remain unknown.

629
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:04,470
I asked around the neighborhood,
but no one saw Im Yun Hee.

630
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,790
I also looked into something else.

631
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,700
There were a total of 11 insurances
signed under Kim Yeong Tae's name.

632
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:15,200
A part of the insurance
payouts went to Im Yun Hee.

633
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,110
Out of a total 4.49 million
dollars for his death benefit,

634
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,630
2.73 million was paid to her.

635
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,120
Was that insurance payout...

636
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,980
She withdrew all of it
in cash and disappeared.

637
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,400
She disappeared when the insurance
payout wasn't fully paid.

638
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,880
Something seems fishy, right?

639
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,070
First, let's go meet the employee
at the insurance company.

640
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,100
When did you first meet Ms. Im Yun Hee?

641
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,590
February 27.

642
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,880
She had to sign some papers
regarding the insurance payout,

643
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,190
so we met briefly.

644
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,800
We met at this cafe.

645
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,610
Do you remember anything
particular from your conversation?

646
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,380
For instance, did she say
where she was going...

647
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,970
or whom she was planning to meet?

648
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,480
No. There was nothing special
about our conversation.

649
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,970
But...

650
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,630
during our conversation,
she kept looking outside.

651
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,250
I wondered what it was
and looked outside...

652
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,390
A man was waiting for her?

653
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:20,840
After our meeting, I saw her
getting into his car clearly.

654
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,340
So I just thought he was
her friend or something.

655
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,530
This was such a controversial case,

656
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,850
and I was curious what
kind of person she was.

657
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:34,080
But when she came with a man,
so I thought it was strange.

658
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,320
Who do you think he is?

659
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,570
Do you think she had another lover?

660
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,890
I don't think she has any
other family members.

661
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,510
By the way, if Ms. Oh finds out about this,

662
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,100
she'll be so shocked.

663
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,280
Ms. Oh worked really hard on this case.

664
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,620
She went with you to Im Yun Hee's home too.

665
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,790
When you were attacked by
Park Su Myeong by a bat,

666
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,410
she was worried sick about you.

667
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,150
Ms. Oh, are you all right?

668
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,500
What about you? Are you hurt?

669
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,660
Oh, my gosh. It's still bleeding.

670
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,990
Oh, no...

671
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,220
Let's go now.

672
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,860
What? You'll represent
Park Su Myeong at his appeal?

673
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,220
You appointed him as a
witness during the trial,

674
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,660
and you're the one who pointed
him out as the real culprit.

675
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,780
But what do you mean,
there's another culprit?

676
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,090
You want to be Park Su Myeong's attorney?
What is this...

677
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,690
I don't know. I'll pretend I didn't
hear this, so you can leave.

678
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,400
- No, I'll just leave.
- Mr. Yeon.

679
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,230
How could you gamble over
something you're not certain of?

680
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,450
Mr. Kwon. Do you know this is
a violation of your work ethics?

681
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,580
Anyway, I cannot allow this.

682
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,510
I told you clearly not to do it.
That's final.

683
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,610
Goodness. Mr. Kwon is making me...

684
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,010
so anxious, and it's
practically killing me.

685
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,730
I might die out of anxiety.

686
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,800
What if he really...

687
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,250
insists on taking Park Su Myeong's case?

688
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,010
I doubt it.

689
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,420
This is so disturbing.

690
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,650
- I'm back.
- Hello.

691
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:57,160
Ms. Dan. How did your trial go?

692
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,050
Yes. Of course.

693
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,480
It seems like Ms. Oh is shooting
a drama in front of the court.

694
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,940
I saw a sign that read "Love Hurts"...

695
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,760
on a vehicle near there.

696
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,970
Yes, hello? This is Attorney Dan Moon Hee.

697
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,650
It'll be so fun if we all
visit her filming site.

698
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,900
Shall we go?

699
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,990
Hae Yeong, Mr. Yeon has a lot
on his mind right now...

700
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,060
and he's quite disturbed.

701
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,490
I don't think he's in the
mood to visit a filming site.

702
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,780
That's not appropriate.

703
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,230
Right. I got overexcited.

704
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,880
I was a bit out of line there.

705
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,100
Right. I'm not in a situation
to go there right now.

706
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,220
Of course not.

707
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,280
I thought we were going for lunch.
Why are we at court?

708
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,540
Why? I'm thinking of having lunch...

709
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,810
at the cafeteria that's
located inside this court.

710
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,450
The cafeteria at this place is
really famous for its food.

711
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,190
What? I've never heard anything like that.

712
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,350
I'm glad you heard it now.

713
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,560
The reason why I won all
those numerous trials...

714
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,260
is because of the delicious
food from the cafeteria here.

715
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:10,830
I received good energy
and became successful.

716
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,650
Mr. Yeon. Did you come here to
look at the drama shooting?

717
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,960
Yes... No.

718
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,910
Is that a yes or no?

719
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:22,300
Yes, no. No.

720
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,050
I mean, I didn't actually
come to see the filming site.

721
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,890
But since we're here, it's not
a bad idea to take a look around.

722
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,480
Don't take it the wrong way.

723
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,470
She used to be our staff,
and pretending not to know is rude.

724
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,230
And didn't you two say
you missed Ms. Oh last time?

725
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,320
You did, right?

726
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,520
To boost the energy of my employees,

727
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,930
I've decided to sacrifice myself...

728
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,440
and come take a stroll near here.

729
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,900
But where is Ms. Oh?

730
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,580
I'm sorry, but you can't come near.

731
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,380
- Okay.
- You might be caught on camera.

732
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,150
The camera? Wow, I know too.

733
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,750
But we're not just pedestrians passing by.

734
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,320
We are well acquainted with Ms. Oh Yun Seo.

735
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,610
I see.

736
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,860
Who here living in Korea
is not well acquainted...

737
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,250
with the famous Ms. Oh Yun Seo?

738
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:15,560
We'll begin shooting soon,
so we'd appreciate your cooperation.

739
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,490
Let's just go, Mr. Yeon.

740
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:20,170
- Ms. Yang.
- Yes, you can begin shooting.

741
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,870
Do I really have to mention
the fact that I am...

742
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,510
the CEO of the famous Always Law Firm?

743
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,880
He might not know who I am.

744
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,450
He must be so flustered.

745
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,050
No, I mean...

746
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,480
It's all right, stop mentioning it.

747
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:38,500
I didn't know, but you are
really bad at keeping secrets.

748
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,730
Why don't you just tell him that I
was also on national television...

749
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:44,360
for a debate show and
also numerous TV programs,

750
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:46,930
and that I'm a famous
attorney while you're at it?

751
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,140
Why don't you just
outright tell him that...

752
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,910
the law firm Oh Yun Seo used
to work at was our law firm?

753
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,630
Mr. Yeon.

754
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,240
Ms. Oh.

755
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,940
Ms. Oh is running towards me.

756
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,340
She's even calling my name.

757
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,850
Ms. Yang, Hae Yeong.

758
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:18,320
How did you come here?

759
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,300
I really missed you.
It's so nice to see you.

760
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,390
Me too.

761
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,200
What brings the three of you here?

762
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,340
I walk by the court like
this from time to time.

763
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:34,180
I never forget how I first felt
when I decided to become...

764
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,970
a judicial officer that
would fight for the weak.

765
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,480
Today seemed like that sort of day.

766
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,030
- Today was that sort of day?
- Yes, let's say it was.

767
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,090
Anyway, I'm glad.
My shoot has been delayed,

768
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,630
and I have some time.
You didn't have lunch yet, right?

769
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,250
Shall we have lunch together?

770
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,900
Why are you all looking at me
instead of eating your food?

771
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,390
This feels so cool.

772
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,970
It feels like I'm eating with
a celebrity all of a sudden.

773
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,810
I felt the same way when I saw
you at the film site earlier.

774
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,240
It made me realize that you're an actress.

775
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:13,020
I can't believe we used to
hang out and chat with each other.

776
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,190
Gosh, don't treat me like
I'm a different person.

777
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,780
It makes us feel so distant.

778
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:20,560
Do you even know how
much I missed you guys?

779
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,570
Really?

780
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,190
- You missed us?
- Yes.

781
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:29,830
I knew that I would've
left a hole in your heart.

782
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,000
But hearing you actually say that
is making me blush a little.

783
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,840
- You really haven't changed at all.
- No, I haven't.

784
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,430
Is everyone else doing well?

785
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,930
Mr. Choi and Ms. Dan...

786
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:46,080
are busy these days. I think
they both started dating someone.

787
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,380
And Mr. Lee is still very sensitive
and poetic as always.

788
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,860
Is Mr. Kwon also doing well?

789
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,780
No, not really.

790
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:01,240
I feel anxious because it feels like
he'll get himself in trouble soon.

791
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,910
I think he's going to
defend Park Su Myeong.

792
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:11,380
What? Park Su Myeong?

793
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,200
Mr. Kwon, are you doing well?

794
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,540
I'm texting because I suddenly
got reminded of you...

795
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:54,820
Do you remember me?

796
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,880
Yes, I remember you.

797
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:02,190
Your mother came to see me.

798
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,950
She asked me to help you.

799
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:09,160
So I'd appreciate it if you answer...

800
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,070
the questions I'm about to ask you.

801
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,870
Okay, I'll answer them.

802
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,180
I heard you stabbed
Im Yun Hee's husband just once.

803
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:21,320
Is that correct?

804
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,690
Yes, I stabbed him once.

805
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:28,690
He always beat her up.

806
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:31,150
So I got really angry and stabbed him.

807
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,730
Then Yun Hee told me to run away.

808
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:37,660
I did what she told me to do and ran away.

809
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:42,920
But where's my mom?

810
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,090
My mom's suffering.

811
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:47,960
I need to help her.

812
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,540
I need to help my mom.

813
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,060
I need to make deliveries.

814
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:56,290
I don't... I don't want
my mom to suffer anymore.

815
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,660
I really stabbed him just once. Only once.

816
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,760
I only stabbed him once. Just once.

817
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,510
Jung Rok, have you gone mad?

818
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:39,100
You're actually going to
defend Park Su Myeong?

819
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,170
Yes.

820
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,440
Okay, I'll be really generous
and try to assume...

821
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,300
that there could actually
be another culprit.

822
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,910
But if that's true,
people will criticize you...

823
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,090
for having made an innocent person guilty.

824
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:59,120
On the other hand, if Park Su Myeong
turns out to be the culprit,

825
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,070
you'll still get criticized...

826
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,580
for trying to defend him at this point...

827
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,810
when you've already accused him of murder.

828
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,890
They'll question why you're being
so wishy-washy about the case.

829
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,510
People will lose...

830
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,890
their trust for you as an attorney.

831
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,480
I've already decided to defend him.

832
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,850
I even filed a copy of the
POA at the courthouse.

833
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,510
What?

834
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,090
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

835
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,900
Why did you do it if you
were going to be sorry?

836
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:35,490
Why would you make such an
important decision on your own?

837
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,770
I knew you'd be against it until the end,

838
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:39,920
so I had no choice.

839
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:42,520
Do you think of me as a joke
because I always compliment you?

840
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,210
- Sir.
- "Sir"?

841
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,510
Do you even think of me as your boss?

842
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,690
Jung Rok.

843
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,170
People are going to start
badmouthing you from now on.

844
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,550
No one is going to be on your side.

845
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,430
You're the one who made him
get sentenced to jail.

846
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,640
And by doing this, you're admitting
that you made a mistake.

847
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,010
It's only right that I do that
because it was my mistake.

848
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,430
It may be too late,

849
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,780
- but I want to set things straight.
- Sure.

850
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,340
You think you're so noble, don't you?

851
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:18,220
But no one's going to acknowledge
your aspiration and goodwill.

852
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:21,090
You'll just get branded as an attorney...

853
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,480
who thinks of trials as a joke.

854
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,970
Like I already told you,
that's something I should deal with...

855
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,330
Then what about our firm?
What about the people who work here?

856
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,030
Do you not care that our reputation
might get ruined because of you?

857
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,730
If you have the least amount...

858
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,810
of affection and sense of
duty for this law firm,

859
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,600
you can't be doing this to me.

860
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,500
You really can't do this to me.

861
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,280
Hey, I heard you filed a POA
for the Park Su Myeong case.

862
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,690
What happened?

863
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,840
- It just happened.
- My gosh, seriously.

864
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,030
You'll have to put a lot at risk.

865
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,400
Is that really necessary?

866
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,160
To be honest, I'm scared.

867
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,730
I don't know what the truth is yet.

868
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,230
But my rash decision...

869
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,740
could've driven someone to
the point of no return.

870
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:54,570
And the fact that I could end up...

871
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:00,090
leaving a scar on someone that
they won't be able to forget...

872
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,250
for the rest of their lives...

873
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,020
really scares me.

874
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:16,210
But if I turn away from this...

875
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:21,310
and lose my chance to set things straight,

876
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:29,420
not only will I lose the right
to be anyone's attorney,

877
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,520
but I'll also lose my confidence
to defend anyone at all.

878
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,140
(Secretary Kim Hae Yeong)

879
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,150
Isn't it a nice photo?

880
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,530
You should visit the law firm
next time, Yun Seo.

881
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:24,440
(Okay.)

882
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,810
By the way, Mr. Kwon eventually decided...

883
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:29,040
to take the Park Su Myeong case.

884
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,980
Because of that, Mr. Kwon and
Mr. Yeon had a huge argument.

885
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,440
Things aren't so pretty
at the office right now.

886
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,840
Mr. Kwon will have to do
a lot of work by himself...

887
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,320
now that he no longer has a
secretary to help him out.

888
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,640
What? Kwon Jung Rok will be
defending Park Su Myeong?

889
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,560
Yes, that's what I heard.

890
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,930
My gosh.

891
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,320
He's the one who pointed
him out as the culprit.

892
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:03,700
And now, he wishes to defend him?

893
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,370
Is he joking right now?

894
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:20,560
Hello, sir. I'm Koo Sung Gil
from Daehan Daily.

895
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,970
I heard Park Su Myeong and his attorney...

896
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,490
are getting ready for an appeal.

897
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:25,880
Is that true?

898
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,630
I'm not sure.

899
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:30,760
But even if that happens,
I don't think anything will change.

900
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,580
I actually heard some interesting news.

901
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,450
- Mr. Kwon.
- He's here.

902
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,320
You claimed that Park Su Myeong was guilty.

903
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,830
Why are you suddenly
going back on your word?

904
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:50,530
That means someone innocent
is currently in jail.

905
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:51,860
Do you feel guilty about that?

906
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,200
Some say you violated the
Attorneys' Code of Ethics.

907
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,690
What's your opinion on that?

908
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,100
Is it true that you decided
to take the case for money?

909
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,640
A lawyer is now defending the suspect...

910
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,780
that confessed to the crime
of his former client.

911
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,700
He is claiming the suspect's innocence.

912
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,160
What are your thoughts on this case?

913
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,580
According to the Attorneys' Code of Ethics,

914
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,590
when a conflict of interest
arises between two clients,

915
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,470
one must only choose one.

916
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,850
Ethically, it's frowned upon.

917
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:19,360
It's not commonly practiced
in the legal field.

918
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,890
From what I think...

919
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:22,380
What is he going to do?

920
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,660
I know. He's being heavily criticized.

921
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:28,660
The Ethics Committee should
discuss this matter.

922
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:32,230
Let's stop watching it since
it'll only upset you.

923
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,390
When things were rough for me,

924
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,040
he gave me strength by my side.

925
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,990
Mr. Kwon.

926
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,380
Don't mind what the people say.

927
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:12,220
I believe that you'll win this case.
