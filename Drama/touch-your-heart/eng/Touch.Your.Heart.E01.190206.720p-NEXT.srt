00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,380
Do you admit the allegations of drug abuse?

19
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,480
What's your relationship
with the second son of Jeguk Group?

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,180
Do you still plead innocent?

21
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,170
- Please give us a word.
- How do you feel right now?

22
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,630
Do you admit to the charges?

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,900
Please tell us how you feel.

24
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,310
(2 years later)

25
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,229
Now, let's see...
(2 years later)

26
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,050
how some of the
forgotten celebrities are doing.

27
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,230
- Who are we talking about today?
- Today, we'll be looking into...

28
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,920
a celebrity who was not
only popular in Korea...

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,530
but also popular in entire Asia for
her pure image. She's Oh Yun Seo.

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,060
My goodness, I always wondered
what she was up to these days.

31
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,270
How is she doing? Do you know?

32
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,290
I heard that she's taking a hiatus...

33
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,890
and that she's waiting for the
next project to come along.

34
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,300
But she was involved in a drug scandal.

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,910
Do you really think she can start
acting again? I don't think so.

36
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,210
First of all,
her drug test came out negative,

37
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,580
and she was found not guilty in court.

38
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,500
So it's possible for her
to make a comeback.

39
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,770
- But she has a bad reputation now.
- Exactly.

40
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,370
The most important thing is
that she's forgotten now.

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
- Yes.
- That's right.

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,720
Currently speaking,
I'm more popular than she is.

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,160
No, Yun Seo!

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
Yun Seo, don't! Don't do this!

45
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,400
What are you doing?

46
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,010
What's wrong with you?

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,390
I get you're having a hard time,
but this is wrong.

48
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,570
Don't get me wrong. I understand
how difficult things are for you.

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,440
Your reputation hit rock bottom
because you were involved...

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,680
in that darn scandal.

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,410
You're penniless because you had
to pay the cancellation fee.

52
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,010
And you have so many anti-fan websites.

53
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,250
So what if you're innocent?

54
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,060
Your life's already become a mess.

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,210
You don't have a friend to talk
to or a boyfriend to lean on.

56
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,650
You play, eat, and sleep alone,
and you even gained weight.

57
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,350
So I totally understand why you'd
get depressed. But you see,

58
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,630
this is still not right.
This is just too drastic, Yun Seo.

59
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,900
What...

60
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,280
- They're vitamins.
- Vitamins?

61
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,920
What's wrong with you?

62
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,480
How are these vitamins?

63
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,350
(Multivitamin: Multy Vita)

64
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,120
- They are vitamins.
- Yes.

65
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,090
Why did you take so many?

66
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,310
It says take 30 pills.

67
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,050
Listen to me, Yun Seo.
You are way too naive.

68
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,640
It means there are 30
pills inside this bottle.

69
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,300
Look here. It says take one pill a day.

70
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,900
No wonder.

71
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,900
I was about to get really full.

72
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,310
It does say take one pill.

73
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,470
I see.

74
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,540
Look at the mess.

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,060
By the way, what brings you here today?

76
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,470
Oh, right. Hey, do you remember...

77
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,500
the headshot you took last week?

78
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,720
You came out so beautiful.

79
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,470
I brought a few of them
because you looked so pretty.

80
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,340
What's the point of taking headshots...

81
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,010
when no one's giving me any work?

82
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,850
Gosh, Hyuk Joon.

83
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
Are you sure I can make a comeback?

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,410
Of course.

85
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,570
Just wait a little more.

86
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,370
I'm sure you'll get casted
as the main character...

87
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,560
More like the main character's aunt.

88
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,970
- Do you know how old I am?
- Numbers don't matter.

89
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,790
What matters is how old you actually look.

90
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,910
To be honest, if you were
a little bit shorter,

91
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,000
I'd even cast you as a child actress.

92
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,460
You look really young.

93
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,530
A child actress is a bit too much.

94
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,690
I didn't want it to get wrinkled,
so I put it in between these papers.

95
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,650
("Love Hurts")

96
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,040
What's this? It's a script?

97
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,600
Was this meant to be a surprise?

98
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,840
The headshot was an excuse, wasn't it?

99
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,640
You're actually here to
give me a script, aren't you?

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,010
No. I mean, I didn't
exactly mean "No". But...

101
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,490
Who's the writer? What's it about?

102
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,260
It's none of your business.

103
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,540
What's that supposed to mean?

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,300
I guess it wasn't meant for me.

105
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,080
Well... Yun Seo.

106
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,330
Okay, I get it's not mine.
You don't have to hide it.

107
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,900
What are you talking about?
I wasn't hiding it.

108
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,560
Forget it. I'm not even interested.

109
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,960
Hey! Wait! Yun Seo!

110
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,630
Wait! Yun Seo, wait!

111
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,970
Yun Seo!

112
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,390
My gosh, it's a script
written by Lee Se Jin.

113
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,720
("Love Hurts")

114
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,610
"Love Hurts".

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,120
"A professional merger
and acquisitions attorney..."

116
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,840
"goes to the Middle East on vacation
and ends up falling in love..."

117
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,620
"with a military judicial officer."

118
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,770
It already sounds so fun.

133
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,690
I hate women who are clumsy too.

Still, I've never seen

135

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,530
I'm sorry...

142
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,680
for putting you in this kind of danger.

143
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,410
"You shouldn't have come.
I'm not worth it."

144
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,260
"Coming for me could cost you your life."

145
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,050
Rather than losing my own life,

146
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,850
I'm more afraid...

147
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,780
of you losing yours.

148
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,610
Soo Ae!

149
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,120
"I'm sorry..."

150
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,280
"for waiting this long to say it."

151
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,500

152
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,660
Soo Ae!

153
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,340
This is it.

154
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,620
Hyuk Joon, I just got goosebumps.

155
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,920
Goosebumps?

156
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,730
The female lead in this series...

157
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,140
is perfect for me.

158
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,910
You won't believe the similarities.

159
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,970
How so? In what way?

160
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,180
Hear me out. The female
lead is pure and innocent,

161
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,370
and that's how I am.

162
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,300
Also,

163
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,980
she's an attorney,

164
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,950
and I majored in law.

165
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,250
Not this one though. It's for Min Ji.

166
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,410
Kim Min Ji?

167
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,420
No, of course not!

168
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,730
- She won't do it anyway.
- Why not?

169
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,410
Who is she to reject a series
written by Lee Se Jin?

170
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,300
That's not why she'll turn it down.

171
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,280
80 percent of the series
will be shot abroad.

172
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,250
No one, including Min Ji,
will want to live abroad for months.

173
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,490
That's why casting has been difficult.

174
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,050
Also, due to the production costs,
no one wants to invest in it.

175
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,510
From what I can see,
this series will end up...

176
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,140
not being developed.

177
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,440
That's why I should do it.

178
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,880
Why do you think that?

179
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,180
Time is what I have the most.

180
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,160
I could even stay abroad
for the entire series.

181
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,080
Also, the production cost is high,

182
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,310
so they'll like it
if I asked for a lower payment.

183
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,320
Leave it to me. I'll
contact Writer Lee myself.

184
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,020
We became friends after
filming a show together once.

185
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,270
Yun Seo?

186
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,510
Hold on a second. Wait.

187
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,970
Hush.

188
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,990
Hello? Ms. Lee?

189
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,690
It's me, Yun Seo.

190
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,280
Yun Seo,

191
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,040
I understand clearly what
you're trying to say,

192
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,850
but I feel burdened taking on a project...

193
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,490
with you in it.

194
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,580
Your scandal was quite a big one.

195
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,490
Ms. Lee, you know it's not true.

196
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,580
The truth doesn't matter in this case.

197
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,360
The viewers just don't
want to see you anymore.

198
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,430
If I'm honest with you,

199
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,690
you're not exactly a gifted actress either.

200
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,520
Ms. Lee, even though...

201
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,540
my acting didn't send chills
up and down anyone's spines,

202
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,910
my shows always had good ratings.

203
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,610
Above all, I'm confident
that I'll create...

204
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,960
quite the buzz.

205
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,540
I guess that's true...

206
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,160
thanks to your bad acting.

207
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,060
Ms. Lee, please believe
in me just this once.

208
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,530
I really want to star in this series.

209
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,040
Hyuk Joon...

210
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,520
Ms. Lee, please give her a chance.

211
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,070
We promise to get her more acting classes.

212
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,820
I'll allow it on one condition.

213
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,800
On one condition?

214
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,510
No! I won't do it!

215
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,230
Get field experience at an actual law firm?

216
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,220
How does that make sense?

217
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,810
It does.

218
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,050
I once read an interview
of a stage actor once.

219
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,640
To play a student studying
for the state exam,

220
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,790
he lived in student housing.

221
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,750
It was so that he could
learn how students...

222
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,390
talk, dress, and do habitually.

223
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,280
Just consider this as
an acting class and...

224
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,440
An acting class?

225
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,020
Hyuk Joon, I'm Oh Yun Seo.

226
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,090
Oh Yun Seo, the actress of 15 years.

227
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Don't you agree, Mr. Yeon?

228
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,520
That's right, you're Oh Yun Seo.

229
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,830
I had to reflect on myself quietly
even though I was innocent.

230
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,120
Instead of making a dazzling comeback,

231
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,320
I can't believe I must
give into her demands!

232
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,600
- Don't you agree, Mr. Yeon?
- I guess you're right.

233
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,370
Besides, I didn't come
this far on my acting skills.

234
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,980
It was due to my good looks,

235
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,300
so why is she expecting
good acting from me now?

236
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,890
Don't you agree, Mr. Yeon?

237
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,740
Yes, you're famous for your bad acting.

238
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,030
What?

239
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,040
Wait, hold on. I didn't mean it like that.

240
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,930
I just mean that...
I can't believe Writer Lee!

241
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,800
How dare she order Yun Seo
to get field experience?

242
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,160
Tell her that Yun Seo
will decline the series.

243
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,630
Really? But sir...

244
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,740
This may be Yun Seo's last chance.

245
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,040
- My last chance?
- So what if it is?

246
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,520
She doesn't want to do it.

247
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,020
Still, it's the first series
she was offered in two years.

248
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,150
If she turns this down,
she may have to wait two more.

249
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,320
- Two more years?
- Good riddance then.

250
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,960
Think of this as the Olympics.
She can work every four years.

251
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,180
What can we do when she's not willing?

252
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,380
I...

253
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,040
I never said that I wasn't willing at all.

254
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,610
Whatever. Call Writer Lee...

255
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,530
and yell at her until her ears bleed.

256
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,600
Refuse her offer and hang up.

257
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,670
Gosh, all right.

258
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,500
Wait!

259
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,900
What is it?

260
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,270
Well...

261
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,900
I'll do it.

262
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
What was that babbling?

263
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll give the field education a try.

264
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,450
Wait, Yun Seo.

265
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,430
You're Oh Yun Seo, a top Korean actress.

266
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,210
You're the angel of the Korean Wave.

267
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,450
How do you expect to
work for three months...

268
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,300
at a law firm?

269
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,400
Why can't I do it?

270
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,590
This isn't a decision
you should easily make.

271
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,410
It wasn't easy at all.

272
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,050
Without this project,

273
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,120
I know I won't be able to make a comeback.

274
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,290
Besides, I can't forever be
known for my bad acting.

275
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,310
Fine. If you really insist,

276
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,460
I will make the call for you. Let's see.

277
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,400
Hold on. Just a second.

278
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,410
You better not ask me to cancel this later.

279
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,720
Of course. I will never do that.

280
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,730
Deal.

281
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,610
(Representative Attorney, Yeon Joon Gyu)

282
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,200
On-the-job training?

283
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,880
Do you think a law firm
is some acting academy?

284
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,850
This is a place where we
handle the sacred law.

285
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,650
If you called to ask a ridiculous
favor like that, I'm hanging up.

286
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,970
Oh Yun Seo will do it.

287
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,300
I don't care what kind of Yun Seo it is.

288
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,840
Tell her to come to work starting tomorrow.

289
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,770
I'll team her up with the most
competent attorney in here.

290
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,050
Do you understand?

291
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,190
I'm doing this because it's you.

292
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,390
No need to thank me.

293
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,500
I'm more thankful.

294
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,880
My goddess, your goddess,
the universe's goddess!

295
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,330
It's the goddess, Oh Yun Seo.

296
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,890
Gosh, I can't believe it.
Oh Yun Seo is coming.

297
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,080
Did you hear that?
Oh Yun Seo is coming to our law firm.

298
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Did you hear that? Oh Yun Seo is
coming to work starting tomorrow.

299
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,620
Gosh, this is awesome. Oh Yun Seo.

300
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,950
My Oh Yun Seo...

301
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,110
Hello. I'm the CEO of
Always Law Firm, Yeon Joon Gyu.

302
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,830
It's nice to meet you.

303
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,030
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Oh.

304
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,460
It's nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you.

305
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,940
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Oh.

306
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,000
Why do I look so awkward?

307
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,680
Maybe it's because
I'm holding out the same hand.

308
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,190
It's not time for this.

309
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,350
Let's see.

310
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,250
All right then.

311
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,600
Who should I match up with Yun Seo?

312
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,550
An expert in civil lawsuits?

313
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,990
Dan Moon Hee?

314
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,470
I just borrowed that money temporarily.

315
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,510
I couldn't pay him back
because I don't have the money.

316
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,580
Yes. But...

317
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,900
it's true that you own a
building in Gangnam, right?

318
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,250
Do you know how much money
it takes to raise children?

319
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,150
- You don't have children, right?
- No.

320
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,120
Anyway, I hope you do a good job.

321
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,020
Okay. I will try my best...

322
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,750
and make it look like you're not
a man without a conscience.

323
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,210
What? Did you just say
I don't have a conscience?

324
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,220
- No.
- She's timid.

325
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,560
That's what you just said.

326
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,990
- What did you just say?
- She's too timid.

327
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,370
She won't be helpful to Yun Seo at all.

328
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,470
That's not true, sir.

329
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,130
What did you just say?

330
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,320
Or an expert in divorce lawsuits,

331
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,540
Choi Yun Hyuk?

332
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,170
Even if you are attributable
for causing the divorce,

333
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,700
you can still receive a part
of your husband's assets.

334
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,350
Don't worry.

335
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,360
Here you go.

336
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,930
I will trust you.

337
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,210
We get married in order to be happy,

338
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,130
but we also get divorced
in order to be happy too.

339
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,130
Mr. Choi, are you married?

340
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,750
No way.

341
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,690
Excuse me.

342
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,970
Yes, Mother. What is it?

343
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,900
What do you mean, strange?
It's because I'm working.

344
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,460
The herbal tonic? Of course I ate it, Mom.

345
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,060
No, not him. Goodness, never.

346
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,680
Gosh. Never.

347
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,610
I can't make Yun Seo work
under that mama's boy.

348
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,980
I know. Mama's boys are
so tiring to be around.

349
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,260
I know.

350
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,430
You startled me.

351
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,310
- When did you come?
- Just now.

352
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,880
By the way, who is Yun Seo?

353
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,320
It's no one. Don't mind.

354
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,190
Or Attorney Kwon Jung Rok?

355
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,400
ETRI, the most reputable
organization in Korea...

356
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,100
has acknowledged the
claims of the defendant.

357
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,980
About the information deemed as
confidential by the prosecution,

358
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,010
it has submitted a report denying...

359
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,080
the nature and economic
usefulness of the said content.

360
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,410
Therefore, the information
cannot be seen as confidential.

361
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,790
I request you to find the
defendant not guilty.

362
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,110
According to the Unfair
Competition Prevention...

363
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,400
and Trade Secret Protection Act,

364
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,290
I find the defendant not guilty.

365
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,060
Although he's a bit feisty,
he's the star of our law firm.

366
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,440
He's number one in winning percentages.

367
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,330
Are you going to go with Mr. Kwon?

368
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,260
Shall I?

369
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,830
Oh, gosh.

370
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,750
So you've finally made up
your mind to go with Mr. Kwon.

371
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,150
- Do you even know what it's about?
- No.

372
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,410
(The Supreme Court of Korea)

373
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,220
Do you have something to say to me?

374
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,210
It's been decided. Congratulations.

375
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,500
What do you mean?

376
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,750
Why don't you want to do it?

377
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,860
Do I really have to explain?

378
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,280
Of course you should.
How would I know if you don't?

379
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,830
I'm going to hire a secretary for you.

380
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,530
And she's a goddess of the Korean wave.
What's wrong with that?

381
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,750
Is working at a law firm a joke?

382
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,510
How could I trust someone who
has never worked in this field?

383
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,210
Yun Seo studied law in college.
You didn't know that, did you?

384
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,620
She studied until the first semester
of freshman year, but still.

385
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,430
First semester of freshman year...

386
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,120
It means she was just admitted,

387
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,250
- and she barely knows anything.
- Right.

388
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,030
- You should help her learn more.
- Why should I...

389
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,620
There's no use talking
about this anymore. Excuse me.

390
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,910
Jung Rok.

391
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,540
Mr. Kwon.

392
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,390
Please think about it again.

393
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,850
I told you.

394
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,270
My cousin is the CEO of
Oh Yun Seo's agency.

395
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,750
He asked me for a favor desperately.

396
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,310
To let her work as a secretary
for just three months.

397
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,530
He raised her like his own child,
and her career has been ruined.

398
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,670
How upset would he be?

399
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,790
He tried desperately in order to help her,

400
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,190
and eventually ended up asking me.

401
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,800
Anyway, work with her
for just three months,

402
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,430
and teach her about this field.

403
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,950
I know you're busy,
but you're the only one...

404
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,050
I can trust for this job.

405
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,130
I decline.

406
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,500
If you really can't, I understand.

407
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,570
Five years ago...

408
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,350
I don't know why I was so nosy.

409
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,250
- Mr. Yeon.
- Yes, what?

410
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,320
How long will you keep bringing that up?

411
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,080
Continuously.

412
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,300
Until Yun Seo comes to work.

413
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,060
Let's sit down and think about it.

414
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,680
I'm not asking you to do this for free.

415
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,650
I'll double your incentive.

416
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,630
And most importantly,
I will help you out often.

417
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,940
Your first impression is important.

418
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,030
You shouldn't look
too flashy, or too ordinary.

419
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,160
You can't look like a
failed celebrity though.

420
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,320
A failed celebrity?

421
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,580
A trendy celebrity.

422
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,100
I'm worried you may look too trendy.

423
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,020
That looks pretty.

424
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,350
Yun Seo, are you sure you'll be
able to do this on your own?

425
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,940
Don't worry. Do you think I'm a little kid?

426
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,190
I know. But I'm always worried about you.

427
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,680
And did you hear what Mr. Yeon said?

428
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,180
That he can't support me with anything?

429
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,830
That's fine. I can do this alone.

430
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,210
You can't do it alone.

431
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,540
You can't even go to the bank alone.

432
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,900
Who goes to banks these days?
Everyone uses apps.

433
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,740
- You can't even drive.
- I have a license.

434
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,180
You can't even eat alone.

435
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,690
How could I eat alone?

436
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,040
By the way, you worry too much.

437
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,770
People will line up to eat with me anyway.

438
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,000
What's to worry about?

439
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,830
- I guess so.
- Yes.

440
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,400
I won't wear this.

441
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,240
- Good morning.
- Hello.

442
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,180
What is that excessive outfit?

443
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,080
Did you go shopping because
a celebrity is coming?

444
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,530
- I had this at home.
- What are those flowers?

445
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,270
I had them at home.

446
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,070
We're expecting a newcomer,
and we should welcome her.

447
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,430
I didn't get any flowers
on my first day of work.

448
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,520
Really?

449
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,720
Anyway, keep in mind not to tell
anyone that Yun Seo's working here.

450
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,100
And don't do anything to
make her feel uncomfortable.

451
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,550
For example, don't ask her for photos...

452
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,860
or autographs.

453
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,620
Don't overreact out of
excitement and just act normal.

454
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,250
Stay comfortable and natural.
Do you all understand?

455
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,760
You're the one who's overreacting
and seems the most excited.

456
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,990
- Really?
- He's here.

457
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,280
- Hello.
- Hi.

458
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,080
Hi, Mr. Kwon.

459
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,370
When Yun Seo arrives later,
please act normal.

460
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,530
Be nice to her like you normally are.

461
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,590
Gosh, he's so cold.

462
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,940
Yun Seo should be here by now.

463
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,530
Let's all act normal.

464
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,030
(Oh Yun Seo)

465
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,810
(Oh Yun Seo, Oh Jin Sim)

466
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,620
Just think of it comfortably.

467
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,500
It's kind of like hiring an intern.

468
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,570
You just need to show her
how things run in our firm.

469
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,610
I'll do it on one condition.

470
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,230
Sure. Whatever you need.

471
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,140
If she says she wants to quit,
please don't stop her.

472
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,320
Okay.

473
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,770
She's late on her first day.

474
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,660
I wonder if I should've gone
to pick her up. She's late.

475
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,960
Ms. Oh is here.

476
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,380
She's here. She's here, you guys.

Hello.

492
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,690
I'm Oh Yun Seo.

493
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

494
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,830
I look forward to spending
time with you here.

495
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,310
I'll have a lot to learn,
so I hope you'll be patient with me.

496
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,400
Yes, of course. A pretty lady like you...

497
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,790
deserves all the patience in the world.

498
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,490
Thank you.

499
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,880
You must be the CEO.

500
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,130
I'm...

501
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,210
the CEO of this law firm.
I'm Yeon Joon Gyu.

502
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,670
I see.

503
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,640
It's nice to meet you.

504
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,200
Nice to meet you. This is nothing much.

505
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,070
But I got you this with my own
money as a means to welcome you.

506
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,150
My goodness.

507
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,660
Thank you so much.

508
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,720
I didn't know you'd all be so welcoming.

509
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,330
I promise that I'll be...

510
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,640
a very hard working employee.

511
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,210
I'll repay you for your kindness.

512
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,030
My goodness.

513
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,140
It just sounded like an Oscar speech.

514
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,010
Can I ask you what kind
of cosmetics you use?

515
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,850
Your clothes look really expensive.

516
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,300
Thank you.

517
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,990
We should get to work now.

518
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,680
Oh, okay.

519
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,560
What should I do?

520
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,400
Hello, I'm Oh Yun Seo.

521
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,620
Do you not know who I am?

522
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,410
I'm Oh Yun Seo.

523
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,160
I came out in a lot of advertisements.

524
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,150
I even modeled for that laptop.

525
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,610
My laptop. Your laptop.

526
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,200
Ssamsong laptop.

527
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,670
Do you really not know who I am?

528
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,050
I also modeled for this sofa.

529
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,770
A sofa is not for sitting down.

530
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,550
A true sofa embraces you.

531
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,660
Acemiss Sofa.

532
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,510
Don't you dare ignore me!

533
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,330
Because I'm no ordinary water.

534
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,920
I'm different.

535
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,640
If you're jealous, you should drink it too.

536
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,540
When are you going to stop?

537
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,680
I mean,

538
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,660
I was just surprised...

539
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,490
to see someone in Korea
not knowing who I am.

540
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,350
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

541
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,110
My name is Oh Yun Seo.

542
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,480
There are a few rules I need you
to keep while you work with me.

543
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,650
Number one. Don't be late.
I hate people who are tardy.

544
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,650
Okay.

545
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,260
Number two. Don't work overtime.

546
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,020
I also hate people who aren't capable...

547
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,240
of finishing their workload
during working hours.

548
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,370
And the third rule I'd like you
to keep as my secretary...

549
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,770
Wait.

550
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,980
Did you just say "secretary"?

551
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,190
Ever since the scandal,
you haven't had a proper job.

552
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,270
So you figured you should
use your connections...

553
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,560
to get a job at a law firm since
you used to major in law.

554
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,630
Isn't that why you're here?

555
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,140
I guess that's the storyline
you guys all agreed on.

556
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,840
Okay, I got it.

557
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,990
Then what should I begin with?

558
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,360
Have you ever worked as a secretary?

559
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,470
Of course not.

560
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,080
Do you know anything about
what goes on in a law firm?

561
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,040
No.

562
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,870
Do you know how to answer a phone?

563
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,770
Of course. I'm really good at that.

564
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,990
I talk on the phone all day.

565
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,400
One time, I even called abroad...

566
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,570
Then we'll begin with that.

567
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,230
Transfer all my calls to my office.

568
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,450
Okay, leave it to me.
I'm a professional at that.

569
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,890
He seems a little cold.

570
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,470
But I'm sure some attorneys
are cold like him.

571
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,240
It might help with my character research.

572
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,620
The previous worker must've
been really competent.

573
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,140
(I hope you enjoy your time
with Attorney Kwon.)

574
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,750
"I hope you enjoy your time..."

575
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,490
"with Attorney Kwon."

576
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,110
(Okay!)

577
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,220
Okay!

578
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,740
I'm ready to work as a secretary.

579
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,330
I'll do my best.

580
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,870
Great.

581
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,230
Sir, she must be doing
better than expected.

582
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,740
I guess so.

583
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,630
Make sure you take care of her
until she gets used to her work.

584
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,400
Don't assign a driver. You should
drive her to and from work instead.

585
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,740
Okay. I'm already doing that.

586
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,040
Good job. Also, make sure
no one hears about this.

587
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,350
Yun Seo's future depends
on this, so stay alert.

588
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,900
Okay. I understand, sir.

589
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,170
What's wrong? Do you feel upset?

590
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,040
No, sir. I just...

591
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,490
really respect you.

592
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,940
Don't mention the obvious.

593
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,570
But what do you exactly respect about me?

594
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,680
Tell me in detail.

595
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,120
It seems like you treat
your actors like family.

596
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,370
She hasn't earned a penny
for you in two years.

597
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,910
Other agencies would've already
mentioned breach of contract,

598
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,990
so I'm impressed.

599
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,450
You know how humane I am.

600
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,670
Although, it's not a good
quality in this field.

601
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,310
Hold on a second. What's wrong with this?

602
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,460
Sorry?

603
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,560
Why are her clothes so tight?

604
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,620
Well, she's been working up
an appetite lately.

605
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,420
- Really? Then put her on a diet.
- Sure.

606
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,200
- Make her lose 10kg.
- Sorry?

607
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,670
Why? Are you against that?

608
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,040
Will you lose it with her?

609
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,080
You're admirable, sir.

610
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,060
(President Yeon Jun Seok, Hyuk Joon)

611
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,050
Personal Assistant Oh, I'm impressed.

612
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,980
- I'm amazed.
- You look charismatic.

613
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,660
I'm proud of you.

614
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,540
I'm a woman of my word, you know.

615
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,330
Hello? This is Always Law Firm.

616
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,610
You reached Attorney
Kwon Jung Rok's office.

617
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,960
Sure.

618
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,170
You wish to speak to him?

619
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,360
Sure.

620
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,330
Gosh...

621
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,370
You have a call.

622
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,140
What is she doing?

623
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,380
Mr. Kwon.

624
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,880
What are you doing?

625
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,810
The phone line is too short
for me to bring it to you.

626
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,960
Yes, this is Kwon Jung Rok.

627
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,330
Sure, I'm aware of it.

628
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,650
I'll send you the related files today.

629
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,110
Please call again if you
have any questions.

630
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,570
Sure. Good day.

631
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,880
I think you need a longer phone line.

632
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,790
Don't you know how to forward calls?

633
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,820
Forward calls?

634
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,210
It's fine. I'll answer the
phone myself from now on.

635
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,120
Ms. Oh Jin Sim, can you copy these for me?

636
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,170
Sure.

637
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,210
How many copies would you like?

638
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,610
Two of each.

639
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,340
If you could turn around,
I'll quickly pick them up.

640
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,960
I'll do this myself too.

641
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,830
Then what should I do?

642
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,070
Just relax at the office.

643
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,730
What should we have for lunch?

644
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,670
What could be delicious?

645
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,830
What about seonjiguk?

646
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,220
I'd like some water. Where can I...

647
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,420
Please let me know if you need anything.

648
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,910
Shouldn't you go for lunch?

649
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,370
Let's have sushi at the classy
Japanese restaurant out front.

650
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,190
- What do you think?
- That's a great idea.

651
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,640
They serve incredible raw tuna.

652
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,740
Raw tuna? That sounds delicious.

653
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,140
If only Ms. Oh had joined us.

654
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,270
Tell me about it.

655
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,740
Still, she said she'd wait for Mr. Kwon...

656
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,380
since it's her first day at the office.

657
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,010
Isn't she an angel?

658
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,680
It's cold, so let's go.

659
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,630
Isn't the Japanese restaurant
at the intersection?

660
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,520
Hurrah for raw tuna!

661
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:21,170
I'm reminded of the raw tuna I
ate in Hokkaido last winter.

662
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,690
Let's get going, sir.

663
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,470
We'll eat kimchi stew.
Kimchi stew with tuna.

664
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,430
What?

665
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,380
I'm suddenly craving it.

666
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,320
If we're going to have canned tuna instead,

667
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,670
why don't we have a tuna sandwich?

668
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,210
I know a good place across the street.

669
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,620
Ms. Dan, you have a crush on
the part-timer there, right?

670
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,660
Up until a while ago,

671
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,570
it was the son of the pork
back-bone stew restaurant.

672
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,590
You used to have that dish every day.

673
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,490
She's quick to fall in love.

674
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,530
One's love should never be stationed.

675
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,130
Anyway, shall we go then?

676
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,570
Let's go and have kimchi stew with tuna.

677
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,160
Wait for me!

678
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:12,490
Is it all right for me
to do nothing like this?

679
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,040
Gosh, I'm hungry.

680
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,360
- Mr. Kwon.
- Yes?

681
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,970
It's 20 minutes past lunch time.

682
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,920
Wait. Already?

683
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,850
Just so you know,
I can't go to crowded restaurants.

684
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:37,960
So?

685
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,170
I have other plans today.

686
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,510
- You can eat alone today.
- I can't.

687
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:48,460
- Why not?
- I can't eat alone.

688
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,000
- Why not?
- How on earth could I?

689
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,520
People are still gossiping
about my scandal.

690
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,800
What will they say if they see
me pathetically eating alone?

691
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,460
What's pathetic about it?

692
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,300
I eat alone nearly every day myself.

693
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,180
I'm not you though.

694
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,690
I'm Oh Yun Seo,

695
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,810
the actress that once took China by storm.

696
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,970
So how could I possibly eat alone?

697
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,400
Then order in.

698
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,820
Did he really leave? Without me?

699
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,410
Coming.

700
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,910
Over here.

701
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,770
If Ms. Oh had joined us, we would've had...

702
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,020
raw tuna sushi instead.

703
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,420
Doesn't she look even
better in person though?

704
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,580
Seeing a celebrity that
I've only seen on TV...

705
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,340
made me think that I was
watching a drama series.

706
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,810
- Mr. Choi, did you know?
- Know what?

707
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,340
We'll be able to tune in again soon.

708
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:51,280
- Let's watch it together.
- Sir!

709
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,980
- Here, have some tuna.
- Sure.

710
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,450
Isn't it weird though?

711
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:00,520
Celebrities who aren't on TV much...

712
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,800
still go into online streaming
or home shopping.

713
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,060
A personal assistant at a
law firm seems random.

714
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,310
You're right. Why does she
suddenly want an ordinary life?

715
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:10,860
What could be the reason?

716
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,960
I hear she majored in law.

717
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,150
Maybe she always wanted
to work in this field.

718
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,220
Yes, exactly. That must be it.

719
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,240
That's the reason. What else could it be?

720
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,780
Let's hurry up and eat before it gets cold.

721
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,900
It's boiling.

722
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,540
I'm so hungry.

723
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,950
I bet there's something to eat here.

724
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,120
There's nothing?

725
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,940
So much for employee benefits.
Do they not even have cookies?

726
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,590
(Job's tears tea)

727
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,800
Maybe I'll start with this.

728
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,310
Gosh, I'm starving.

729
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,540
Is this hot water?

730
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,010
What do you think you're doing?

731
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,690
I'm watering the plants.

732
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,960
Who are you?

733
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,250
I'm Lee Du Seop.

734
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,150
You're scaring me... No, Mr. Lee.

735
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,890
Hello, are you here as a client?

736
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,580
No, that's not it.

737
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,470
I am...

738
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,230
Oh, you mean you're here
because of a grudge.

739
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,480
That's not it.

740
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,910
Mr. Lee.

741
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,010
- Hi.
- You're here.

742
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,180
- Right.
- Have you had lunch?

743
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,520
I ate.

744
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,900
Yun Seo, he's our paralegal.

745
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,500
I'm the firm's paralegal, Lee Du Seop.

746
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,020
Hello, I'm Oh Yun Seo.

747
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,060
Hold on.

748
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,870
Job's tears tea?

749
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,580
This isn't you.

750
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,170
After a meal,

751
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,270
you should have a caramel macchiato.

752
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,710
Thank you.

753
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,570
(Heart Sushi)

754
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,580
How on earth could I?"

755
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,110
People are still gossiping
about my scandal.

756
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,250
What will they say if they see
me pathetically eating alone?

757
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,560
Mr. Kwon, you haven't had lunch until now?

758
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,720
Oh, this isn't for me.

759
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,030
Everyone is having a talk with Ms. Oh.

760
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,880
It would've been better if...

761
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,000
a more experienced worker
came to help your work.

762
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,600
Ms. Yang.

763
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,120
What is this?

764
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,630
This is caramel arigato.

765
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,760
- No...
- Caramel macchiato?

766
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,870
- Yes.
- But what's it for?

767
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,380
Oh, I was about to drink this,

768
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:52,440
but I suddenly don't want it anymore.

769
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,760
- If you don't want it...
- No, I'll drink it.

770
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,950
It's a waste if you throw it away.

771
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,950
I'm telling you. Because of you,

772
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,460
I almost gave up on my bar exam.

773
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,990
Gosh, is that true?

774
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,550
But I wasn't such a weak man.

775
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,940
I passed the exam,
and now I'm sitting here.

776
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,210
And I became a real man.

777
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,750
I see. You're an impressive man.

778
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,480
My mom always told me this.

779
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,930
"Manners maketh man."

780
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,560
That's how I can meet a nice woman.

781
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,760
I think it's finally that moment.

782
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,460
You're here.

783
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,020
Yun Seo, how about some coffee?

784
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,530
You're all gathered here.

785
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,350
You're here too, Mr. Kwon.
Oh, this is your office.

786
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:52,400
I had this at home.

787
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,440
Do you want some coffee?

788
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,020
That's okay. You should
all get back to work.

789
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,180
Already?

790
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,490
But I just arrived.

791
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,410
Let's all get to work then.

792
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,840
- Let's go out now.
- Manners...

793
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,700
- maketh man.
- Bye.

794
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,190
Have some coffee.

795
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,500
Excuse me...

796
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,600
What shall I do in the afternoon?

797
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,710
What can you do?

798
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,270
What?

799
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,120
Excuse me...

800
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:40,180
What shall I do in the afternoon?

801
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,360
What can you do?

802
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,840
- What?
- Just kill time and go.

803
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:46,210
There seem to be many people who like you.

804
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,880
You can drink coffee and chat with them.
However...

805
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,610
please don't do it in my office.

806
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,210
Hey.

807
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,180
Did I do something wrong?

808
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:08,440
I waited for you all this time,
and didn't even eat.

809
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,980
You're getting mad at me as soon
as you came, let alone say sorry!

810
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,970
Why are you doing this to me?

811
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,360
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

812
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,900
I said it's Oh Yun Seo!

813
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,230
This is a workplace.

814
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,530
- Sorry?
- I don't know what your CEO said,

815
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,130
but this isn't a place where
you can have fun and rest.

816
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,520
If you chose to become
a secretary at this place,

817
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,730
at least you shouldn't be
a nuisance to people...

818
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,590
who came here to work sincerely.

819
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,910
I don't want to be a nuisance either.

820
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,470
Since we're on the subject,

821
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,570
I'm not fond of people like you
who take their work frivolously.

822
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,010
Although you're famous enough to
be on TV, this is not that place.

823
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,880
So I hope you can get ahold of yourself.

824
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,810
Get... ahold of myself?

825
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,600
Yes.

826
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,970
I didn't...

827
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,720
come here to have fun either!

828
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,290
Yet you came dressed like this?

829
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,230
I haven't even started
working properly yet.

830
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:14,180
How could you judge me
by my outer appearance?

831
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,830
Don't you think you're too biased?

832
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,970
Yes, it is a bias.

833
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,410
Like you said, I know it hasn't been
long enough to judge who you are.

834
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,260
But Ms. Oh Jin Sim,

835
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,040
you should've at least
came to work on time...

836
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,310
so I wouldn't have such a bias.

837
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,760
- But that...
- If you really...

838
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,460
want to work as my secretary,

839
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,280
change into a proper outfit first.

840
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,500
If not, you can just have
fun here for three months.

841
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,770
Goodness. That guy is so annoying!

842
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,320
Who knew I would be a secretary?

843
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,890
If I knew, I wouldn't
have dressed like this!

844
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:05,480
Does he think I wanted to be late?

845
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,260
Hyuk Joon told me to go by 10 o'clock!

846
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,570
My goodness.

847
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,390
Who is he to be so rude?

848
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,020
I can't just let this slide.

849
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,620
Yes.

850
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,030
She won't even last a week.

851
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,300
She'll probably say she
wants to give up tomorrow.

852
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,500
Simply put, she's hopeless.

853
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,060
Hopeless?

854
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,180
Yes, hopeless.

855
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,320
We have concrete evidence,
but she keeps denying it.

856
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,740
This is driving me nuts.

857
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:44,020
She won't be able to deny it for long.

858
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,350
Anyway, thanks for helping out.

859
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,120
We found the evidence thanks to you.

860
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,950
No problem.

861
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,100
By the way, when are you
coming to Seoul? In two days?

862
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,660
- Does Yeo Reum know?
- No.

863
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,390
Not yet.

864
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,110
I see. It's your problem,
so you two should take care of it.

865
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,440
- I have to go to trial.
- Okay, bye.

866
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,710
- Let's have a comeback party soon.
- Okay.

867
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,690
Hey.

868
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,690
Let's have a talk.

869
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,230
I have to go to trial.

870
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,040
- I still have something...
- You may go home at six.

871
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,280
I've never seen such a cranky man like him.

872
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,640
Me being late?

873
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,800
Being dressed like this?

874
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,480
I understand he may not like it.

875
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,490
He should teach me then!

876
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,040
I went there to learn.

877
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,500
He's displeased when I'm working,

878
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,530
and displeased when I'm resting.

879
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,300
What does he want me to do then?

880
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,410
I know. What on earth does he want?

881
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,630
He's a really strange guy.

882
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:07,820
What's his issue?

883
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,300
I don't know.

884
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,570
I guess he just hates my existence itself.

885
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,830
Hold on. He hates you,
when you're Oh Yun Seo?

886
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,180
I really can't understand that.

887
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,100
He can hate women,
but how could he hate you?

888
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,340
I know.

889
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,290
Seriously, this is annoying.

890
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,730
I don't need that drama anymore,
so maybe I should just quit.

891
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,470
Come on, Yun Seo. Don't be like that.

892
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:32,040
You should understand,
as a kind and pretty woman.

893
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,600
I can't understand!
My patience has reached its limit.

894
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,430
I can't do this anymore!

895
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,330
That's it! Cut!

896
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,980
Why are you always the
one shouting that out?

897
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:47,140
It's a cut! Cut!

898
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,980
I'll go have a word with him.

899
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,610
Who does that lawyer think he is?

900
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,240
- Yes?
- I'm sorry.

901
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,770
We're shooting right now,
so please wait a second.

902
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:03,910
Okay.

903
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,450
What is wrong with you?

904
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,840
Did I say I wanted to date you?
I said I just want to sleep with you.

905
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:16,280
What on earth? Do they think
they own this road or what?

906
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,200
That must be tough.

907
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,010
Shooting outside in winter is difficult.

908
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,780
Cut! Great job!

909
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,450
- Good job.
- Thank you.

Why?

962
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,840

You should've come faster.

01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:21,160
No, I met Mr. Choi Yun Hyuk
at court yesterday.

1010
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,790
He's so consistent,
with that light mouth of his.

1011
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,990
He said he'd keep a secret.

1012
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,600
Don't worry. I'll keep it a secret.

1013
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,110
How does it feel to work with
the goddess of the Korean wave?

1014
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:32,680
Does it feel like walking
on top of the clouds?

1015
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:38,590
Rather than clouds,
it's like walking on thin ice.

1016
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,450
- What?
- It's hard to explain.

1017
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,490
- Hello, Ms. Yang.
- Hello.

1018
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,250
If you want some coffee,
shall I make you one?

1019
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,680
No, it's okay.

1020
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,140
I was so shocked when you
came here as a secretary.

1021
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,430
I heard you made it into law school,

1022
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,230
but you were expelled after
receiving academic probation.

1023
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,670
Who told you that?

1024
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,900
I just decided to quit on my own.

1025
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,800
- Really?
- Yes.

1026
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:07,970
By the way, Yun Seo.

1027
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:11,950
Can I call you by your name
since I'm older?

1028
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,120
Sure.

1029
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,950
You don't seem to know since it's
your first time as a secretary,

1030
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:21,440
but being a secretary here isn't
just about doing simple chores.

1031
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:24,160
You should consider yourself as
a legal partner of your attorney.

1032
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,130
I hope you can work harder,

1033
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,960
so you can be of help to Mr. Kwon.

1034
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,840
- I got it.
- If you get it...

1035
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,420
Ms. Yang, do you know
an American drama called, "Madman"?

1036
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,550
- Sorry?
- The directors told me it was fun,

1037
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,840
but it was so boring to me.

1038
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:47,020
Anyway, in that drama,
there is a character...

1039
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:49,020
who looks exactly like you.

1040
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,830
She nags the younger secretaries
to do this and that...

1041
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,950
just like an older sister.

1042
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,120
You're that type of character, aren't you?

1043
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:59,170
Character? What do you mean...

1044
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:00,820
Okay. I got it.

1045
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,670
Thank you for your advice.

1046
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,880
I'll really try my best.

1047
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:18,570
When the phone rings,

1048
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,540
I have to get it and say...

1049
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,820
"Yes, I'll connect you to Mr. Kwon."

1050
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:25,410
Then I press the sharp button.

1051
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,870
Number two.

1052
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,420
After I hang up the phone...

1053
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:33,360
♫ <i>I just wanna be your star for you</i> ♫

1054
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:36,600
Yes! I cleared connecting calls!

1055
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:40,280
(Things To Do In The Morning!
Mastering connecting calls)

1056
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,470
Okay. Now do what I taught you.

1057
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,870
Okay. Let's see...

1058
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,670
Choose the paper first...

1059
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:52,170
Two copies...

1060
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,210
And then, start!

1061
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:57,540
Gosh, I did it!

1062
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:59,480
Thank you so much.

1063
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,480
If you're really thankful,

1064
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,630
can you tell me what kind of
cosmetics you use next time?

1065
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:09,200
- I'd really appreciate that.
- Oh, I use...

1066
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:11,690
She didn't even listen.

1067
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,280
I've cleared using the copying machine too.

1068
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,470
What's next?

1069
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,600
Mr. Kwon.

1070
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,410
- Are you on your way from court?
- Yes.

1071
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,330
Right. I forgot telling you yesterday.

1072
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,150
Tonight is Yun Seo's welcoming party.

1073
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,590
Everyone is coming, so don't be late.

1074
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,940
She'll only be staying for three months,

1075
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,220
so why must we have one?

1076
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:44,960
All the employees want it.

1077
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:46,830
She's only here for three months,

1078
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:49,470
so they feel like every
moment will be precious.

1079
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:50,760
They're right, you know.

1080
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:53,980
Her situation calls for a grander welcome.

1081
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,320
- Will you join us?
- I have a meeting with a client.

1082
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,250
I know that, and I also
know it'll end early too.

1083
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,940
You won't have drinks anyway.

1084
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,360
I will and I might get drunk.

1085
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,410
Really?

1086
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:08,630
That's great since we find
you more comfortable...

1087
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:10,990
when you're slightly intoxicated.

1088
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,720
- What?
- The elevator is here.

1089
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:19,990
Mr. Kwon, good morning.

1090
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,930
Yes, hello.

1091
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,560
You came in late today.

1092
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,770
I had business outside the office.

1093
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:29,400
Oh, I see.

1094
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,480
You look very neat and tidy today.

1095
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:37,180
Is that so?

1096
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,350
What is it?

1097
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:51,100
- Sorry?
- You seem to have something to say.

1098
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,490
Well,

1099
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,230
while you were out,

1100
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:58,340
I tidied up your desk a bit.

1101
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,890
So many files and documents
were scattered upon it.

1102
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,860
A clean desk improves productivity,

1103
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,610
so I made sure of that.

1104
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,460
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

1105
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,630
It's not Oh Jin Sim. It's Oh Yun Seo.

1106
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,350
Why do something that wasn't asked?

1107
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:23,180
Sorry?

1108
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:25,500
My trial reports have all gotten mixed up.

1109
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:28,970
I can't even spot those I
must review right away.

1110
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:30,560
Oh, no.

1111
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,350
If you tell me what they are,
I'll quickly...

1112
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,450
Why touch people's things
in the first place?

1113
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:39,890
But, I just thought it needed a clean...

1114
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,130
It may have seemed messy to you,
but I had a system.

1115
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:46,190
Did you forget that I told you
you could just lounge around?

1116
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,450
Must you be like that?

1117
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:54,440
I'm trying my best here, so you
didn't have to be so mean.

1118
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:58,410
I may not know how to do many things,

1119
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:01,170
but I'm willing to learn, you know.

1120
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,130
Whatever. You may leave now.

1121
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:17,080
Hold on.

1122
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,780
I just want to ask this.

1123
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:24,080
Do you perhaps...

1124
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,020
hate women?

1125
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:29,920
What?

1126
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,180
I mean... Well...

1127
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:37,770
Do you hate women?

1128
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:44,050
I'm sorry I don't match your expectations.

1129
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:46,670
What are you doing?

1130
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,170
I...

1131
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:53,020
like women. I like them a lot.

1132
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,280
I really do.

1133
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,250
It's just that...

1134
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,370
I'm not at all interested
in you particularly.

1135
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:11,000

Do not touch my desk ever again.

I'm curious of her relationship
with the son of a conglomerate CEO.

1155
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,440
It's a fact that she was there.

1156
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,970
I'd like to give you a chance to
properly be my personal assistant.
