00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,490
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,120
There's something I want to say to you.

3
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,910
But...

4
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,090
I won't say it right now.

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,790
However, I will someday...

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,190
tell you...

7
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,730
the exact emotions that I'm
feeling right this moment.

8
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,090
Why can't she tell me right now?

9
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,000
(Pork Belly)

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,120
I wonder if she likes pork belly.

11
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,510
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

12
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,340
By any chance,

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,210
do you like...

14
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,540
Well... I...

15
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,300
My goodness. I think so.

16
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,950
But that was a bit too straightforward.

17
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,590
I'm so flustered.

18
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,880
But how did you know...

19
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,950
how I felt?

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,390
Because that's how most people feel.

21
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,710
That's how most people feel?

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,030
You must be more popular than I thought.

23
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,700
It's an easy choice, and it's fairly cheap.

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,750
What?

25
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,400
It's cheap?

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,710
It's cheaper than beef.

27
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,600
(Pork Belly)

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,700
Wait a minute. Were you asking me...

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,930
- if I like pork belly?
- Yes.

30
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,300
We came out to have dinner,
so I wanted to choose a menu.

31
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,860
What were you thinking when
you answered my question?

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,010
Well...

33
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,090
Pork backbone stew.
I thought you were asking me...

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,370
if I like pork backbone stew.

35
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,500
From what I know, there aren't
any pork backbone stew restaurants...

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,200
within the radius of 1km.

37
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,660
Then let's eat pork belly.
I like pork belly too.

38
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,660
- I'm so excited.
- Okay, let's go there.

39
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,710
There aren't any customers
there, so it'll be okay for you.

40
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,700
- Okay.
- Let's go.

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,570
Let's go.

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,750
- You must really like pork belly.
- Yes.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,570
I really love pork belly.

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,190
You're really quick-witted.

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,150
Yes, I am. After I started
working as an attorney,

46
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,160
I started meeting a lot of people,
so I've become really quick-witted.

47
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,680
Mr. Kwon, you've never
dated anyone, have you?

48
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,730
Why all of a sudden?

49
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,340
You don't seem to bright
when it comes to women.

50
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,220
Then what about you?
Do you know a lot about dating?

51
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,690
Of course.

52
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,920
If you can't trust me,
you can search for articles.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,030
I used to host a blind date
program called "Sandabang".

54
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,530
And I gave the best dating advice.

55
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,570
- My nickname was...
- Single since birth.

56
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,670
What?

57
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,090
That's what it says in the article.

58
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,490
Why did you have to read that one?

59
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,230
"Oh Yun Seo, the love
counselor of 'Sandabang'..."

60
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,600
"turns out she's never dated anyone."

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,700
"Famous celebrity, Oh Yun Seo,
is currently the host..."

62
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,390
"of 'Sandabang' and is giving
people sincere dating advice."

63
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,750
"However, it turns out that she's never..."

64
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,940
- "dated anyone in her entire life."
- Please stop.

65
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,110
"The director of the show said that..."

66
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,050
"despite her lack of experience in dating,"

67
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,820
"she read books on relationships
and handed out advice."

68
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,440
"He thanked her greatly for her hard work."

69
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,080
I said that's enough!

70
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,010
He thanked you.

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,200
Please have more, Ms. Single Since Birth.

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,460
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,470
We'll get even busier as of tomorrow.

74
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,140
Yes, we need to counterattack.

75
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,290
Don't worry too much.

76
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,910
I know said this already,

77
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,090
but I have a feeling that
you'll win this trial.

78
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,880
Out of all the attorneys I know,

79
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,400
you're the most talented.

80
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,910
Do you know many lawyers?

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,340
Mr. Choi, Ms. Dan, and...

82
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,300
Anyway, you know.

83
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,510
Starting tomorrow,
I'll head to the office...

84
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,760
with a stronger will and determination,

85
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,160
so let's hang in there together.

86
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,610
Sure.

87
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,210
So have you thought of
a way out of the mess?

88
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,740
Last week during the jury trial,

89
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,230
the jury swayed over to
the prosecution's side...

90
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,230
after hearing of the
life insurance policy...

91
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,260
of 4.9 million dollars.

92
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,230
I'm still thinking of a plan.

93
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,100
If we don't win the trial
for her with self-defense,

94
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,830
the public will heavily
criticize our law firm.

95
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,230
People online and members of civic groups.

96
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,110
You know they're all on Ms. Im's side.

97
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,880
I'm not burdening you,
so don't think of it that way.

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,260
Still,

99
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,680
if we lose a case that the entire nation...

100
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,200
is interested in,

101
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,570
no one will want to hire us.

102
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,060
I'm not pressuring you though,

103
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,270
so don't feel that way.

104
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,950
If that's all, I'll get going.

105
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,590
What are we going to do?

106
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,780
We only have four lawyers including me,

107
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,980
but I took out a loan to
open this law firm...

108
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,190
because I dreamed of surpassing...

109
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,090
Jang and Park Law Firm someday.

110
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,620
If you mess up this case,
instead of that grand dream,

111
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,140
I'll only be left with a heap of debt.

112
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,860
So, feel pressured.

113
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,530
No, please don't.

114
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,440
- Gosh.
- Don't worry too much.

115
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,100
Someone told me that I will win this case.

116
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,660
Who?

117
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,060
Anyway, I agree with that assessment,

118
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,790
so have faith in me and be patient.

119
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
Who on earth said that to him?

120
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,310
He must've seen a fortune teller.

121
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,080
Was it a child fortune teller?

122
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,930
A young and pretty one?

123
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,100
Anyway, I do hope it was someone good.

124
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,630
He needs to win this case.

125
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,790
I've searched every case,
but there are no precedents.

126
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,630
It's because self-defense has
never been accepted before.

127
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,110
You should head home first today.

128
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,830
No, it's all right.
I can't let you work by yourself.

129
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,070
I'm more loyal than that.

130
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,300
And I'm not a cold-hearted robot.

131
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,580
You've been pulling overtime
for days because of me.

132
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,110
So you should head home first today.

133
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,850
When will you be heading home?

134
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,650
I still have some work to do.

135
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,800
(Hyuk Joon)

136
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,940
Hi, Hyuk Joon.

137
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,640
You didn't have to.
I said I'd get home by myself.

138
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,860
Worried, my foot.

139
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,480
Okay, fine. I'll be right down.

140
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,880
I'll head home first then.

141
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,490
Sure.

142
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,110
Mr. Kwon?

143
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,210
I'm heading out too.

144
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,800
Didn't you have some work left?

145
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,430
I decided to do it tomorrow.

146
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,520
We're supposed to only
work 52 hours a week now.

147
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,390
As a man of the law,
I should set an example.

148
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,560
Then how do you explain all
those late nights this week?

149
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,770
That...

150
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,710
What's going on? Did it break down?
What do we do?

151
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,290
Yes, this is maintenance.

152
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,390
The elevator just stopped.

153
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,090
- What floor is it?
- Third floor.

154
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,300
- All right.
- Please hurry.

155
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,560
Sir, please hurry!

156
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,730
What's taking her so long?

157
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,890
Yun Seo, when are you coming down?

158
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,980
Hyuk Joon, the elevator broke down.

159
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,730
I'm trapped inside it with Mr. Kwon.

160
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,620
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

161
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,590
No, I'm not hurt.

162
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,780
Help will come soon,
so don't worry too much.

163
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,350
I'll call you if something happens.

164
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,720
All right.

165
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,480
Will something worse happen?

166
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,920
I'm not sure.

167
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,310
During the last 10 years,
there have been...

168
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,840
214 counts of major injuries
or deaths involving elevators.

169
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,940
Why would you say something
so scary right now?

170
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,730
You asked, so I told you the facts.

171
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,640
Mr. Kwon, where are you?

172
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,510
Ms. Oh Jin Sim, are you all right?

173
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,910
Are you all right?

174
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,500
Yes, we're fine.

175
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
- Yun Seo, are you all right?
- Hyuk Joon.

176
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,720
Are you sure you're not hurt?
You must be startled.

177
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,770
Well, I'm fine.

178
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,150
As if. This is why you should
leave work after hours.

179
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,140
Yun Seo, hold on.

180
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,470
- Excuse me, Mr. Kwon.
- Yes?

181
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,140
I didn't want to say this,

182
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,130
but why are you making
My Yun Seo work so hard?

183
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,590
- Your Yun Seo?
- Yes, my Yun Seo.

184
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,490
From now on, she'll only work in
the office during office hours.

185
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,930
Stop it. Are you crazy?

186
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm right, aren't I?

187
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,820
Why work overtime when you're
not an actual employee?

188
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,170
I can't believe you. Just get going.

189
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Kwon. Please disregard him.

190
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,410
- Sure.
- Hurry.

191
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,910
- What?
- Just go!

192
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,350
It's not like I said anything wrong.

193
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,290
Are you insane?

194
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,020
- What...
- Why not just stay in the car?

195
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,650
Yun Seo, wait.

196
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,160
Are you kidding me?
You probably flustered him.

197
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,690
I'm the one who's flustered.

198
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,530
I only said it for your sake.

199
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,620
Do you know how worried I was when
you were stuck in the elevator?

200
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,570
What's there to worry about?

201
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,040
I wasn't alone. I was with Mr. Kwon.

202
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,110
That's why I was worried.
Who knows what he could...

203
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,800
have done to you?

204
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,120
Done to me? Are you insane?

205
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,880
Why would he do such a thing?

206
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,720
He's a man too, you know.

207
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,580
All Korean men think
about getting with you.

208
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,050
- Yes, of course!
- Right?

209
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,140
Yes. What?

210
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,490
Anyway, nothing like that happened.

211
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,660
Is that so? Hold on though.

212
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,970
Are you thinking about
making this a permanent job?

213
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,290
You've worked overtime for days.

214
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,900
You told me to work hard.

215
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,160
Only to some extent.

216
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,190
Just look around the office
and get a gist of the place.

217
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,220
How can I pull off my character
when I don't invest anything?

218
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,350
Just stop talking nonsense!

219
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,840
- Yun Seo, you...
- I mean...

220
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,020
You're really serious
this time, aren't you?

221
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,190
Your passion to authentically
portray a character...

222
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,680
has moved me deeply.

223
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,420
I'll help you achieve
that in many more ways.

224
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,280
You'll no longer be bad at acting.
Go, Yun Seo!

225
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,910
Go, me!

226
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,640
All right. Get in then. It's quite chilly.

227
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,790
Hyuk Joon?

228
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,410
How could Hyuk Joon say that?

229
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,180
Mr. Kwon was probably still startled
from the elevator stopping.

230
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,540
By the way, I can't believe
the elevator actually broke down.

231
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,320
Gosh, it was so romantic.

232
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,580
I thought my heart would stop.

233
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,920
How could the elevator stop?

Oh Yun Seo, the working modern woman.

241
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,470
You seem like a workaholic,
and you are so sexy.

242
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,500
- Good morning.
- Yes.

243
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,120
Would you like a cup of coffee?

244
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,090
How about some coffee with plenty of sugar?

245
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,280
No, thank you.

246
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,480
Don't you remember I was
accused of overworking you?

247
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,420
By your boyfriend.

248
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,240
My boyfriend? How can you say that?

249
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,910
He isn't your boyfriend?

250
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,260
Of course not. He is...

251
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,170
He is my cousin.

252
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,290
The one who always comes to get me
whenever we have company dinner.

253
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,430
I see.

254
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,730
- He is him?
- Yes.

255
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,540
So please don't misunderstand me
like that again. It's frightening.

256
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,610
Okay.

257
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,320
You really won't have that coffee?

258
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,420
Then, can I ask you for one cup?

259
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,980
Yes.

260
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,070
That is very fragrant.
The coffee beans smell really good.

261
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,860
Ms. Yang. Do you know something?

262
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,760
No other law firm provides
such good beans like we do.

263
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,910
All they give is Solomon's seal tea,
Job's tears tea, or instant coffee.

264
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,970
But I am different.

265
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,980
- For our Always family...
- I brought these beans.

266
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,650
I got them as presents during the holidays.

267
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,600
Our office pantry also only has
Solomon's seal and Job's tears tea.

268
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,960
I see.

269
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,670
Ms. Yang, you are better than me.

270
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,240
Let's drink this ground coffee
and dream grand dreams.

271
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,230
- Hi! Good morning.
- Good morning.

272
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,090
You worked late with Mr. Kwon
last night, didn't you?

273
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,760
Did anything happen?

274
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,380
Anything...?

275
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,240
I heard the elevator broke down last night.

276
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,620
- Actually...
- I heard this from the night guard.

277
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,760
People were stuck in the elevator,
so the guard rushed there to help.

278
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,910
And there was a couple...

279
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,310
just about to kiss.

280
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,080
What? I mean...

281
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,940
Maybe they weren't trying to kiss.

282
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,020
Who were they?

283
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,540
- Who would dare to be so bold?
- I was curious, so I asked.

284
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,520
The guard remembered exactly
what they looked like.

285
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,460
First, the man was very tall...

286
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,680
with round eyes.

287
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,970
And the woman...

288
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,590
She was very pretty just like an actress.

289
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,970
A tall guy with round eyes...

290
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,560
and a woman as pretty as an actress...

291
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,460
And they were one of those
who worked late last night.

292
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,110
Yun Seo.

293
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,780
It's not me and Mr. Kwon.

294
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,770
Really, it isn't.

295
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,510
- What?
- What?

296
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,820
I'm just saying the couple who
kissed in the elevator is not us.

297
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,540
You're so funny.

298
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,550
Of course it's not you guys.

299
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,540
Everyone knows you and
Jung Rok hate each other.

300
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,970
You forgot to take your coffee.

301
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,610
- Yes, coffee.
- Right, coffee.

302
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,510
It must be a couple in a company
secretly seeing each other.

303
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,710
They might not be going out at all.

304
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,620
When a young man and woman are
stuck in such a small space,

305
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,520
they can start thinking romantic
thoughts out of the blue.

306
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,380
Hello! We are stuck here!

307
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,740
Please help us!

308
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,510
My goodness.

309
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,820
What is this situation?

310
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,430
How can I be wasting my
precious time like this?

311
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,530
Don't you think the air
is getting a bit thin?

312
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,660
It's getting difficult to breathe.

313
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,410
It's only been two minutes.

314
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,790
That's true.

315
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,930
I must be mistaken.

316
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,480
Why do I have to be stuck with him?

317
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,330
What are you talking about?

318
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,910
I could have been with the
universe's goddess, Yun Seo.

319
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,340
But I'm so annoyed I have to be
stuck with a pushover like you.

320
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,680
Though we are together in
this small closed off space,

321
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,270
you must not fall in love with
me or anything like that.

322
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,430
Maybe I should make
an ugly face on purpose.

323
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,330
- Nothing like that will happen.
- It won't happen.

324
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,400
It will not happen to me.

325
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,260
- It will never happen to me.
- It will never ever happen to me.

326
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,500
What are you doing?

327
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,680
Are you alright?

328
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,850
- Did you check that?
- Yes, I did.

329
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,170
Okay.

330
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,470
As for Jung Ji Ho's Giants Foods...

331
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,190
Include 3 directly managed stores...

332
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,060
and 2 franchise stores in
the search warrant list.

333
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,000
- Yes, I will.
- Let's take a 10-minute break.

334
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,130
I'll get some coffee. What would you like?

335
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,820
I'll go with you.

336
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,270
It's alright. I'll go by myself.

337
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,490
I have things to think about.

338
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,930
Okay. Then americano coffee for me.

339
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,770
By the way, did you hear
about the jury trial?

340
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,880
Ms. Yoo pulled a big one on Mr. Kwon.

341
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,450
Don't you think that's too harsh?
They are friends after all.

342
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,530
Ms. Yoo must really be cold as ice.

343
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,780
And there is a rumor going around.

344
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,630
She is said to have made a deal.
If she just...

345
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,900
takes care of this deal,
she will get the positions she wants.

346
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,140
I knew she was ambitious.

347
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,440
But she really is something else.

348
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,740
That's enough.

349
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,470
I don't want to hear any more.

350
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,040
Why? I thought it was over between you two.

351
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,680
Why do you get to decide
whether it's over between us?

352
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,900
One latte, one americano, please.

353
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,110
Yes, sir.

354
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,680
♫ <i>Just because I don't need you</i> ♫

355
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,170
♫ <i>You'll be wondering</i> ♫

356
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,900
Please give me this also.

357
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,860
- What's this?
- Maybe you need something sweet.

358
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,770
I'm busy.

359
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,090
You don't have to tell me. You look busy.

360
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,180
Autopsy report?

361
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,930
Goodness.

362
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,410
Do you want to read that terrible
thing in a place like this?

363
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,860
Do you have something to say?

364
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,870
No matter how busy you are,
take care of your health too.

365
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,980
- What's that got to do with you?
- A lot.

366
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,570
If you are sick,

367
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,570
I don't feel good.

368
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm leaving. You go on too.

369
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,930
It seems there is someone
waiting for the coffee.

370
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,720
Ms. Yoo. This is the
material you asked for.

371
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,130
Thank you.

372
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,840
The autopsy and the appraisal are
both advantageous to us, right?

373
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,810
Seeing that the defense counsel is quiet,

374
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,350
it seems there isn't much they can do.

375
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,710
Verdict of self-defense
seems unlikely, right?

376
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,450
But it's still too early to say.

377
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,940
I'll be stepping out for a bit.

378
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,740
Please make a note
if I get an important call.

379
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,100
I will. But where are you going?

380
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,080
Are you going to see your client?

381
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,820
I'm thinking of going
to Im Yun Hee's house.

382
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,260
If you say Im Yun Hee's house...

383
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,840
do you mean the place where
the murder took place?

384
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,230
Yes. There are some parts that
don't make sense in the records.

385
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,100
I need to go to the murder scene and
decide if the report is justified.

386
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,290
I didn't know attorneys did
personal on-site investigations.

387
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,730
It is also the role of the attorney
to provide another evidence...

388
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,420
that can discredit the evidence
provided by the prosecutor.

389
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,640
If there isn't an answer in
the records, it's at the scene.

390
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,210
Or something like that.

391
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,680
- Then, I will go with...
- That's impossible.

392
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,920
There is no reason for you
to see such a terrible site.

393
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,500
But, you can never know.

394
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,650
I might be able to see
something that you miss.

395
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,720
I studied a lot too.

396
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,240
I really want to be of help.

397
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,660
Let me go with you. Please?

398
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,760
This is...

399
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,880
Yes. It's Im Yun Hee's house.

400
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,770
Are you sure you'll be alright?

401
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,690
Of course.

402
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,780
I played the role of a detective once.

403
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,140
So I'm familiar with stuff like this.

404
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,430
I'm sure things are a lot different
in real life compared to dramas.

405
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,990
You should stand behind me
and follow me carefully.

406
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,380
Watch your step.

407
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,520
Are those blood stains from
the day of the incident?

408
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,620
Yes.

409
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,830
They're called spatter stains.

410
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,700
Spatter stains?

411
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,990
It refers to the blood that
spatters into the air...

412
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,010
after someone stabs and takes out
the knife from a person's body.

413
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,010
And by analyzing that bloodstain,
we can approximately guess...

414
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,230
the location of the victim
and the assailant.

415
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,640
Kim Yeong Tae was standing...

416
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,110
when he got stabbed.

417
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,260
He was standing when he got stabbed?
What exactly is that...

418
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,560
supposed to mean?

419
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,280
If a person accidentally stabs
someone while getting assaulted,

420
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,270
they normally stab that
person from a lower position.

421
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,070
But Kim Yeong Tae was standing
straight when he got stabbed.

422
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,910
And I think the prosecution
will use this fact to claim...

423
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,990
that she had intentions of murder.

424
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,610
Let's look around a bit more.

425
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,330
Okay.

426
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,120
Mr. Kwon, are you okay?

427
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,490
Yes, I'm fine.

428
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,360
Please call the cops for me.

429
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,180
Who are you?

430
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,630
Are you okay?

431
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,370
Should we take you to an emergency room?

432
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,090
No, I'm okay. I'll make a
statement as a victim first.

433
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,520
Ms. Oh, are you okay?

434
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,430
What about you? How's your injury?

435
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,020
Gosh, you're still bleeding.

436
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,490
My goodness.

437
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,720
Wait.

438
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,520
Look at me, Ms. Oh. I'm fine.

439
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,590
But you're bleeding right now.

440
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,140
You should go to a hospital.

441
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,930
I can't go right now.
I need to write a statement first.

442
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,700
That's not what's important right now.
You're hurt.

443
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,700
Wait a second. I have a handkerchief.

444
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,910
You seem very startled.
You should go home and rest.

445
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,480
- I'll drive you home.
- No.

446
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,900
I'll go home on my own.
You should hurry up...

447
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,510
and go to the hospital after
you write your statement.

448
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,950
I'll call you later.

449
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,740
Okay.

450
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,820
Please drive her home safely, sir.

451
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,410
What? An intruder?

452
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,300
Who was the victim?

453
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,730
Attorney Kwon Jung Rok?

454
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,960
Okay, I'll be right there.

455
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,760
(Dongbu Police Station)

456
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,840
You're here.

457
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,990
Your injury is pretty bad.

458
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,250
Are you okay?

459
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,990
Yes, I'm okay.

460
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,300
But more importantly, what did he say?

461
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,370
Well, he's Park Su Myeong,
a local resident.

462
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,050
And apparently, he thought there was
a thief inside the empty house...

463
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,740
as he was passing by.
That's why he went inside.

464
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,440
He's a member of the neighborhood patrol.

465
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,630
Do you know him?

466
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,940
His mom runs a butcher shop,
and he sometimes delivers meat.

467
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,440
Can I talk to him alone?

468
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,920
Yes, sure. Go ahead.

469
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,580
Mr. Park Su Myeong.

470
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,850
Does it hurt a lot?

471
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,150
Pardon?

472
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,800
Your head is bleeding.

473
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,270
I'm okay.

474
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,820
There are a few questions I'd like to ask.

475
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,930
Sure.

476
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,220
- Did you think I was a thief?
- Yes.

477
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,730
Are you acquainted with Im Yun Hee?

478
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,350
Have you ever been inside
that house other than today?

479
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,320
She...

480
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,430
She told me not to say anything.

481
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,500
What did she tell you not to say?

482
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,740
Did you go to her house on
the day of the incident?

483
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,130
- Did you see something or...
- Are you Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum?

484
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,240
Yes.

485
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,390
I called her since she's the
prosecutor in charge of this case.

486
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,780
How bad is the injury?

487
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,320
It's okay. It's not that bad.

488
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,280
Was he the guy at the crime scene?

489
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,880
Do you really think it'd be
okay to let him go like this?

490
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,410
It was just a misunderstanding.

491
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,490
Thank you for dropping the charges.
Su Myeong, you should thank him.

492
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,130
Thank you. Sorry.

493
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,520
Goodbye, then.

494
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,460
This is Yoo Yeo Reum.

495
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,400
I'd like you to do a
background check on someone.

496
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,790
His name is Park Su Myeong,

497
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,900
and he works at a butcher's
in Im Yun Hee's neighborhood.

498
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,290
Can you please check...

499
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,770
where Park Su Myeong was on
the day of the incident?

500
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,590
Yes.

501
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,690
Yes, that's right. Thank you.

502
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,800
Ms. Oh, what are you doing here?

503
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,280
I saw you go home in the cab.

504
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,520
I couldn't go home because
I was so worried.

505
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,350
So I asked him to turn the car around.

506
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,210
Is everything over now?

507
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,370
Who was that guy? Why did he do that?

508
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,350
Actually, you should go
to a hospital first.

509
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,280
It's okay. The bleeding
has stopped, and I'm fine.

510
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,980
That's for the doctor to decide.

511
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,170
Let's go to a hospital. Come on.
Get in the car.

512
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,440
(Regional Emergency Medical Center)

513
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,150
You don't need to worry.

514
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,590
It was just a minor concussion.

515
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,830
But you should still be
careful for the time being.

516
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,520
Okay, thank you.

517
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,290
I'm so relieved.

518
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,890
I was really worried that it
might be something serious.

519
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,460
I'm finally relieved.

520
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,270
You really don't need to drive me home.

521
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,740
You're not even feeling well right now.

522
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,640
I'm okay.

523
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,500
You even came to the hospital with me.

524
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,730
To be honest, it wasn't because of you.

525
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,370
It was for my own sake.

526
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,200
I felt really bad...

527
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,780
for leaving you earlier.

528
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,120
I also felt bad for sending
you home earlier...

529
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,650
all by yourself.

530
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,250
That's why I'm driving you home,
so you don't need to feel sorry.

531
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,630
You were really startled today.
You should go home and rest up.

532
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,070
Don't worry about me. You're the one
who should get some rest.

533
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,890
Forget about work, at least for today.

534
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,030
All right?

535
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,850
Sure, I'll do that.

536
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,500
Promise me.

537
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,240
Come on. Promise me.

538
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,800
♫ <i>I don't know the right timing</i> ♫

539
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,230
♫ <i>Why do things keep messing up?</i> ♫

540
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:34,460
♫ <i>My heart has slow footsteps</i> ♫

541
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,630

♫ <i>Each step you take</i> ♫

543
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,260
Well, you better keep your word.

544
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,700
I will.

545
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:57,410
♫ <i>Oh love, love is, what is it, what is love?</i> ♫

546
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:05,370
♫ <i>Oh love, what do I do? What if love?</i> ♫

547
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,480

551
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:27,150
♫ <i>What should I do, what should I do?
What if this is the love</i> ♫

552
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,620
You're late. Were you working
on the second trial?

553
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,090
Right.

554
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,980
Can you two never go
against each other again?

555
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,350
I feel like I'm walking on thin ice.

556
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,840
Is that so? Well, I'll just go
against you next time.

557
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,170
You jerk.

558
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,110
Wait, did you get hurt?

559
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,160
- Yes.
- What happened?

560
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,410
Who did this to you?

561
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,110
It's nothing.

562
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,060
Are you acquainted with Im Yun Hee?

563
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,110
Have you ever been inside
that house other than today?

564
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,970
She...

565
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,300
She told me not to say anything.

566
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,180
He's a witness.

567
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,270
Ms. Im told him to keep silent
because he knows something...

568
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,140
or he saw something.

569
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,910
There's a high probability
that he's a witness.

570
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,400
I already asked Mr. Lee to
look into his acquaintances.

571
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,990
We're entering a new phase then.

572
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,110
Jung Rok, please be more careful though.

573
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,870
I like that you work hard,
but you actually got hurt.

574
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,780
Tell me about it.

575
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,890
I honestly thought he was going to die.

576
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,420
Why would I die?

577
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,270
I'm capable of defending myself,
so don't worry.

578
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,660
How can I not?

579
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,910
You got knocked down in one swing.

580
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,530
If he had hit you straight on the head...

581
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,770
I actually did get hit on the head.

582
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,900
Unbelievable.

583
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,820
Ms. Oh, Jung Rok is weaker than he looks.

584
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,060
When I was involved in
a drug trafficking case,

585
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,770
I was attacked by a criminal organization.

586
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,620
- A gang?
- Yes.

587
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,650
Two criminal syndicates...

588
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,290
sued one another to frame them for a crime.

589
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:52,180
Thanks to my meticulous and just actions,

590
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,250
our side won the case.

591
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,800
14 members of the opposing gang...

592
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,440
14, 15, 16, no 17 members
came at me at once.

593
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,060
I was able to beat them with my bare hands.

594
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,790
- Want to know my secret?
- Yes.

595
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,310
Tenacity.

596
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,450
- Tenacity!
- Tenacity?

597
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,540
That's right.

598
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,780
I didn't get scared despite
the situation I was in.

599
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,060
Meanwhile, Jung Rok...

600
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,560
may be brainy, but he's not that tenacious.

601
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,720
Let's talk it out. Let's talk instead.

602
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,610
- There was a strand of hair.
- Hair?

603
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,380
Like I said, he's not particularly strong,

604
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,490
but he has a keen eye.

605
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,810
How did you spot it?

606
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,240
How fascinating.

607
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,740
He's not alarmed at all.
In fact, he didn't even react.

608
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,550
My gosh!

609
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,780
I can't believe him. How did he spot it?

610
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,420
Goodness.

611
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,310
(Daeseong Butcher Shop)

612
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,450
- You know that hair salon, right?
- Yes.

613
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,450
I'll get going then.

614
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,630
Hello, sir!

615
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,770
- I see you're on a delivery run.
- Yes!

616
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,860
- I'll get going then.
- Sure.

617
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,510
Hello, sir.

618
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,190
You're working hard in this cold weather.

619
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,100
From what I saw,

620
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,960
you seem to know the son of the butcher's.

621
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,960
I do, but why do you ask?

622
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,010
Su Myeong's been in love with her.

623
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,210
He's been following her
around all the time.

624
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,360
You must've seen the two together often.

625
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,050
Yes, of course.

626
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,070
I go around all the alleys
in this neighborhood.

627
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,030
A few times every day.

628
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:06,640
Then did you see the two together
on the day of the incident?

629
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,660
What?

630
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,300
Park Su Myeong was
at Im Yun Hee's house that night?

631
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,840
Yes, he's certain of it.

632
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,260
- Where are you going this late?
- On a delivery run.

633
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,820
I should get going.
Yun Hee's waiting for me.

634
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,030
Yun Hee's pretty.

635
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,870
Look how smitten he is.

636
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,930
Park Su Myeong's in love with Im Yun Hee?

637
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:52,160
Then he could be keeping silent
even though he saw everything.

638
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,370
I think he's a witness for sure.

639
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,850
He might not be.

640
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,520
If he's not, then...

641
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,580
Are you and Ms. Im close?

642
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,200
Yun Hee's a great person.

643
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,950
Do you know that she killed her husband?

644
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,600
I must go on a delivery run!

645
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,690
My mom said that we had many orders.

646
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,870
Were you at Ms. Im's house
on the day of the incident?

647
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,490
Did you witness it?

648
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,120
2kg of oxtail bone for Mr. Jin Soo.

649
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,860
3kg of picnic ham for Myeong Jin.

650
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,330
1kg of broth beef for Hyeok Su.

651
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,240
Also, also...

652
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,320
Who else?

653
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,750
My mom told me.

654
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,290
Who next?

655
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,990
He's not answering the questions you ask.

656
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,120
I thought that he witnessed the scene.

657
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,640
Even if he did,

658
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,630
it might not actually help our case.

659
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,210
What if he took the stand...

660
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,250
and told the court that he saw Yun Hee...

661
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,990
being beat up by her husband?

662
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,250
It'll only hurt our case.

663
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,280
You're right.

664
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,700
I asked around, and he and Yun Hee...

665
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,330
are quite close.

666
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,060
We should let him go.

667
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,010
Wait, are you going somewhere?

668
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,000
Yes, I have some things to ask Ms. Im.

669
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,330
Oh, then...

670
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,680
Eat this before you go.

671
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,070
- What's this?
- It's red ginseng of course.

672
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,620
Go ahead and eat it already.

673
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,260
- Finish it in front of me.
- Sure.

674
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,570
How is it? Do you feel energized?

675
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,480
I brought these today especially for you.

676
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,280
You're weaker than you seem, remember?

677
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,870
I'm not weak.

678
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,510
You didn't see properly
because things were hectic,

679
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,440
but I was hit really hard.

680
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,330
A normal guy would've been
knocked out for hours.

681
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,450
But I was able to get up
immediately and catch the culprit.

682
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,520
If you keep spreading rumors that
I'm a weakling and I nearly died...

683
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,790
You can be punished for personal slander.

684
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,250
You'll punish me? Me?

685
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,040
I called the police for you and
went to the hospital with you.

686
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,440
I even got you red ginseng.

687
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,450
You really have a hard heart.

688
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,440
I'm not saying I will really punish you.

689
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,240
Just asking you to refrain from...

690
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,520
such slanderous things.

691
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,710
I understand. Just take care of yourself.

692
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,250
Okay, then.

693
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,360
I hope nothing happens today.

694
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,000
I feel worried about him.

695
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,850
Can I ask you a question?

696
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,550
When the incident happened,

697
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,060
you were having injuries that
needed nine weeks to recover.

698
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,710
And your husband was much bigger than you.

699
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,770
So how could you kill him
by stabbing him just twice?

700
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,680
My only thought was to live.

701
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,370
I thought only then this would end.

702
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,240
You can't make something like
that happen just by thinking.

703
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,210
Different from what you see on TV,

704
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,540
knives get stuck on bones and organs,

705
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,830
so it's hard to penetrate the body.

706
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,450
So when someone stabs a person
for the first time...

707
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,590
they hurt their hands.

708
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,590
Do you know someone called Park Su Myeong?

709
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,680
I know him.

710
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,200
He works at the butcher shop.

711
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,200
I heard you two were very close.

712
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,670
Who said that?

713
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,330
Most of the people around you told me that.

714
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,870
That's absurd. How can I be close to him?

715
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,400
Today is Im Yun Hee's second trial, right?

716
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,600
Yes. I feel so nervous.

717
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,580
I feel so nervous too.

718
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,570
We really have to make it
more advantageous to us.

719
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,300
I feel more nervous than
holding a girl's hand.

720
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,000
- Mr. Kwon is here.
- Jung Rok.

721
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:38,930
You can do it, right?

722
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,440
You have the secret card
to turn the case, right?

723
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,940
Mr. Lee, may I see you for a moment?

724
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,460
I can tell by look at his
face that he has something.

725
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,130
He may not have good manners,
but I think he has a secret card.

726
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,460
Were you able to persuade
Park Su Myeong to...

727
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,680
come to the trial?

728
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,830
I kept going to him...

729
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,620
but he refuses so strongly.

730
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,890
I know it's hard, but you have
to bring him to today's trial.

731
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,660
I beg of you.

732
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,030
Can I...

733
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,270
Can I give it a try?

734
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,550
I will go with Mr. Lee...

735
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,740
and try to persuade him.

736
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,220
- I'll wait at the lobby.
- Okay.

737
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:42,920
Ms. Oh.

738
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,540
I don't think you should
come to today's trial.

739
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,550
What? Why?

740
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:53,060
There'll be more reporters
than the last trial.

741
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,730
Then it will be dangerous.

742
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,730
I see. I'll be going now.

743
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,050
Things will work out today.

744
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,800
The trial for the woman who
murdered her violent husband...

745
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,940
has been reopened.

746
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,970
The issue will be over whether
it was self-defense...

747
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:22,500
or a scheme to get insurance money.

748
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,700
The prosecutor for the case, Yoo Yeo Reum,

749
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,640
was confident that due to additional
evidence and circumstances,

750
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,550
she will be able to prove Im guilty.

751
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,640
No.

752
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,840
No.

753
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:47,720
Su Myeong! Where are you going?
You have to make deliveries.

754
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,090
Mr. Park Su Myeong.

755
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:55,040
- Can we talk to you?
- I'm not going. I'm not going.

756
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,470
I told you I'm not going.

757
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:59,910
I'll go talk to him.

758
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,110
She told me not to say anything.

759
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,900
She told me not to say anything.

760
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,230
She told me I cannot say anything.

761
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,460
Mr. Park Su Myeong.

762
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,830
Do you remember me?

763
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,580
You saw me last at Im's house.

764
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,970
I was there next to the attorney...

765
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,540
that you attacked.

766
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,590
I was really angry at that time.

767
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,690
The man you hit...

768
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,960
is the person I like.

769
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,470
I was really sad...

770
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,960
because the man I like was hurt.

771
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,380
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

772
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,510
I know you understand how I felt.

773
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:10,080
You don't like it when someone
you like is hurt or sad.

774
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,460
I don't like it. I don't.

775
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,610
I don't like it.

776
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,930
I don't like Yun Hee being sad or hurt.

777
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:24,410
But if you don't say anything like this,

778
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,520
Yun Hee might hurt more or become sadder.

779
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,340
You have to tell the truth.

780
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,870
No matter what it is.

781
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,570
If you don't tell the truth today,

782
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,230
you might not see her for a very long time.

783
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,880
We protest!

784
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,890
Recognize self-defense!

785
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,020
Recognize self-defense!

786
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,760
As the state researcher,

787
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,590
you personally observed and
analyzed the crime scene, did you not?

788
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,690
Yes, I did.

789
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,130
The defendant claimed that...

790
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,390
she accidentally killed the victim
while physically fighting with him.

791
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,860
Did your findings coincide with her claims?

792
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,060
They did not.

793
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,990
The spatter stains in this
case could only happen...

794
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:14,100
when the attacker stabbed the victim
very forcefully from the front.

795
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,570
That is all.

796
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,840
The defense counsel.
Do you want to cross-examine?

797
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,040
Yes.

798
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,470
With your analysis of the blood,

799
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,930
how much can you find out?

800
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,100
I can tell what happened
at the crime scene.

801
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,240
The spatter stains that appear when
the attacker stabs from the front,

802
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,890
did they appear on Im Yun Hee's clothes?

803
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,310
We didn't find...

804
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,240
No such spatter stains were found
on the defendant's clothes.

805
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,370
Isn't that right?

806
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,790
- Yes.
- That means...

807
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,920
there is a possibility that the
defendant may be innocent.

808
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:05,370
I object. He is leading the witness.

809
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,750
Denied.

810
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,410
Witness. Answer the question.

811
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,180
Just by looking at the blood traces,
that possibility can't be denied.

812
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,540
Yun Hee.

813
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,740
Your honor. I request for
a supplementary witness.

814
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,660
Your honor. I request for
a supplementary witness.

815
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,750
A supplementary witness?

816
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:46,450
It's a request for a witness that
was not previously agreed upon.

817
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,370
What is your reason for this?

818
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,790
Park Su Myeong whom I'm requesting
as a supplementary witness...

819
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,270
has been very close to the defendant.

820
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,120
He was present at the scene
on the day of the incident.

821
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,380
Even though he's been omitted
in the prosecutor's report,

822
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,940
he may be the only
eyewitness for this case.

823
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,570
But he could also be another suspect.

824
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,790
- What?
- What?

825
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,020
Please allow me to call him out.

826
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,060
(Witness)

827
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,130
Witness, I'd like you to do me
a favor before you testify.

828
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,380
Can you please write your name?

829
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,600
Okay.

830
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,030
Do you normally use your right hand...

831
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,840
for writing, eating, and doing
other everyday activities?

832
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,680
Yes.

833
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,460
You're currently living with
your mother who runs a butcher shop.

834
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,040
Am I correct?

835
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:41,890
Yes.

836
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,900
Your job is to deliver meat.

837
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,670
And your mother is in charge
of butchering the meat.

838
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,790
Is that correct?

839
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:49,830
Yes.

840
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,030
In other words, you're job
doesn't require you...

841
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,500
to do anything with a knife.

842
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,740
- Yes.
- Then...

843
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,330
when did you get that scar on your thumb?

844
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:13,450
You went to Im Yun Hee's
house to deliver meat...

845
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,280
on the day of the incident. Am I correct?

846
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,110
- Yes.
- According to his medical records,

847
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,430
the witness went to the ER on
the day of the incident...

848
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:26,160
to get the wound on his
right thumb sutured...

849
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,700
which was about 3cm long.

850
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,560
I will hand in his medical
record as evidence.

851
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,760
When a normal person stabs someone,
they often hurt their thumb...

852
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,230
because the knife doesn't
penetrate the body that easily.

853
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,810
Do you think that injury
was a mere coincidence?

854
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:49,070
Your Honor, the prosecution didn't
even investigate Park Su Myeong...

855
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,250
because they assumed the defendant
had already told them everything.

856
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:56,070
The prosecution was only focused
on wrapping this case up...

857
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,270
because it had become
such a huge social issue.

858
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,930
However, they were indifferent
to revealing the actual truth.

859
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,140
I have a question for the witness.

860
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,320
Who was the person that murdered
Kim Yeong Tae that day?

861
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,080
Objection, Your Honor.

862
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,960
There were no fingerprints or
bloodstains that belonged...

863
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,490
to Park Su Myeong at the crime scene.

864
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:24,530
The counsel is making
groundless comments...

865
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,830
based on his imagination to
confuse the justice department...

866
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,500
and the jurors.

867
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,520
That is not true.

868
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,100
Your Honor, the defendant's testimony
and the autopsy report...

869
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,760
were the only evidence handed
in by the prosecution...

870
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,660
to prove that Im Yun Hee is guilty.

871
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,450
But even that autopsy report...

872
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,450
doesn't coincide with the
defendant's testimony.

873
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,280
According to the prosecution,
a severely injured woman...

874
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,080
murdered her husband by stabbing him
in his vital spot only two times.

875
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,090
But that just doesn't make sense.

876
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,510
Park Su Myeong was at the
crime scene that day,

877
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:56,620
and he got a cut on his thumb.

878
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,730
Im Yun Hee testified that
she killed her husband,

879
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,300
but she wasn't in the condition
to do something like that.

880
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,800
Let me ask you one more time.

881
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,110
Who was the person that
murdered Kim Yeong Tae...

882
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,670
that day?

883
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:20,880
The person who stabbed him...

884
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,220
- The person who stabbed him...
- No, don't say anything.

885
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,630
Defendant, please remain quiet.

886
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,650
Don't hit her! Don't hit her!

887
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,960
Don't hit her!

888
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,820
I stabbed him. I stabbed him with a knife.

889
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:40,470
I'm the one who stabbed him with a knife.

890
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,170
Su Myeong.

891
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:47,110
That jerk... That jerk
hit Yun Hee every day.

892
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,880
He was hitting Yun Hee that day.

893
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,330
So I... So I stabbed him.

894
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,210
Yun Hee was getting beaten up that day.

895
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,500
Yun Hee was getting beaten up.

896
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,540
He was hitting her again.

897
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:06,760
Please... Stop.

898
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,830
Yun Hee.

899
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,340
Please stop.

900
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,770
Yun Hee!

901
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,170
Stop hitting her! Stop!

902
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:21,100
- What did you just say?
- Su Myeong, please run away.

903
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,570
Please just go.

904
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,080
I stabbed him. I stabbed him.

905
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,760
I stabbed him.

906
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,610
He beat her up.

907
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,540
He beat her up every day.
She got beaten up every day.

908
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,920
She's here.

909
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,190
Were you pressured...

910
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,720
- by the prosecution?
- Were you having an affair?

911
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,340
No one else's fingerprints
were found at the crime scene.

912
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,390
Why did you purposely try to
conceal what really happened?

913
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:12,220
Why didn't you confess that
someone else killed your husband?

914
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,420
Please tell us.

915
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,670
I might as well have been the murderer.

916
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,440
Because I always imagined
killing him dozens...

917
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:24,600
No, hundreds of times.

918
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:28,110
It turns out that Kim Yeong Tae
was murdered by someone else.

919
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,460
Park confessed his crime...

920
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,860
and testified that it was
an accidental murder.

921
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:36,450
The police found a pair of gloves
covered in bloodstains in his room.

922
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,130
And he was wearing them on
the day of the incident.

923
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,260
They're assuming that the
bloodstains belong...

924
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,930
to the late Kim Yeong Tae and Park.

925
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,230
And they announced that they've
requested a DNA analysis.

926
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,260
Yes! Yes!

927
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,500
Jung Rok really is the
best attorney in our firm.

928
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,770
I agree. I never imagined that
there might be another culprit.

929
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,720
Really? You didn't think of that?

930
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,510
I already knew.

931
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,010
If you knew, you wouldn't have
been able to keep quiet about it.

932
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,440
You would've obviously caused a huge fuss.

933
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,710
Cause a fuss?

934
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:06,850
Do you seriously mean that? Do you?

935
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,000
I'm back.

936
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:12,190
Jung Rok. Come over here.

937
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,340
You did a great job. Come on.

938
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:18,060
No, I really want to give you a hug today.

939
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,170
I love you, Jung Rok.

940
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,430
We should celebrate the happy occasion.

941
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,070
Let's have a company dinner.

942
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:28,410
Let's eat beef and go
to a karaoke afterward.

943
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:30,950
What do you say?
Does that sound good? Okay.

944
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:34,030
- I'm sorry, but maybe next time.
- Why?

945
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,130
I'm tired today. I'm sorry.

946
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,410
Then how about we just go without him?

947
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,120
What are you talking about?

948
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,520
The hero of the event won't be attending.

949
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,230
Have you ever seen a fan signing
event with no celebrity?

950
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,060
Have you ever seen a birthday
party without the birthday boy?

951
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,070
You need to get to your senses.

952
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:57,790
Gosh.

953
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,880
- You're going home early today.
- Yes.

954
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,600
You must be tired.
You should go home and rest up.

955
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,080
Take a good rest.

956
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,050
Ms. Oh.

957
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,780
Would you like to have soju with me?

958
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:31,650
What?

959
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,490
(Bom's Table, Onam Pork Backbone Stew)

960
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,040
You don't seem like you're in a good mood.

961
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,520
That's weird.

962
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:54,500
You normally seem really happy
every time you win a case.

963
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,660
Are you upset...

964
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,110
because of Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum?

965
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,020
Do you feel sorry about winning
because she's your friend?

966
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,180
Yes, that's one reason.

967
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,390
I understand why Im Yun Hee wanted
to cover up Park Su Myeong's murder.

968
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,500
But I also understand why Park Su Myeong...

969
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,590
ended up murdering Im Yun Hee's husband.

970
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,770
So I don't really feel happy
about the entire situation.

971
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,150
Here.

972
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:00,820
Thank you.

973
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,520
- For what?
- For telling me that I'll win...

974
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,560
and for worrying about me when I got hurt.

975
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,660
Don't mention it.

976
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,100
By the way,

977
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,820
can I ask you something?

978
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,230
You refused to go to the company dinner
because you were tired.

979
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:30,150
So why did you ask me
to drink soju with you?

980
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,060
I just wanted...

981
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,950
to drink with you alone today.

982
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:00,190
It's colder than I expected.

983
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,890
Why are you giggling?

984
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,490
I suddenly remembered the time...

985
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:14,710
we went to the arboretum together.

986
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:18,280
You told me to put my hands...

987
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,310
in my pockets if I were cold,

988
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:24,150
but I misunderstood that and
put them in yours instead.

989
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:27,850
You won't believe how embarrassed I was.

990
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:32,640
I've been on too many TV dramas...

991
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,430
and that interferes with
my sense of reality.

992
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,320
You had no reason to let me...

993
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,980
put my hands in your pockets
to warm them up.

994
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,700
I'm worried.

995
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,120
Just as much as you worry about me...

996
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,480
and console me,

997
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,610
I wish...

998
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,530
to do so for you too.
