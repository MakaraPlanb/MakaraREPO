1
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,320
I'm really upset.

2
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,730
I don't have a problem with
accepting fair criticism.

3
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,160
But they said they wouldn't
eat our macaroons...

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,500
even if someone offered them money...

5
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,740
and that they even got
stomachaches after eating them.

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,220
How are we supposed to deal with such lies?

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,950
Is it possible to sue the power blogger...

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,660
and all the people that
left comments on the post?

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,700
Of course.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,220
You can sue them for spreading
false information and slander.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,180
First, you should file a complaint.
And at the same time,

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,870
you can also file a damage suit
against particular suspects.

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,790
I have nightmares every single day.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,340
I've come to respect the celebrities...

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,960
that I see on TV.

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,230
I wonder how they manage to bear
with all the mean comments online.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,800
By the way, your secretary
must really like macaroons.

18
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,670
Send me screenshots of the comments
that you think can be a problem.

19
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,460
I'll send you the petition as
soon as I'm done writing it.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,870
And if you're fine with that,
I'll go ahead with the suit.

21
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,970
Okay.

22
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,520
Thank you for buying me so many.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,130
Thanks to you,
I'll get to eat so many macaroons.

24
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,620
No problem. You can eat them and
give me an objective opinion.

25
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,300
See if they're bad enough for people
to make harsh comments about them.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,670
Is that why you took me with you?
To make me taste the macaroons?

27
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,440
Okay, sure. You can count on me.
I really love macaroons.

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,720
But even if you like them that much,

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,450
do you really think you can eat
everything all by yourself?

30
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,430
I'm not going to eat this all by myself.

31
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,640
I'm only going to have one and share
the rest with everyone at the firm.

32
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,970
I'm a loyal woman, you know.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,360
Not only are you loyal,

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,120
but you're also attractive
and warm-hearted.

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,520
Who are you?

36
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,260
Mr. Kwon I know isn't
capable of being sweet.

37
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,430
Who are you?

38
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,340
I'm kidding.

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,480
I didn't know you could
make such sweet comments,

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,880
so I couldn't believe what I just heard.

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,520
From now on, you should say
that kind of stuff more often.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,540
Okay.

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,830
Aren't you going to eat one?

44
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,540
Yes.

45
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,350
Which one should I eat?

46
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,710
The names of the macaroons
are really interesting.

47
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,070
"A taste I cannot stop craving,
mocha macaroon".

48
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,960
"Tasty and pretty, chocolate macaroon".

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,400
"A taste that calls for
a kiss, mint macaroon".

50
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,710
I wonder what kind of
taste calls for a kiss.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
- We're back.
- Hello.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,050
Hello.

53
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,130
Ta-da.

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,030
Mr. Kwon bought macaroons for us.

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,070
- They look so delicious.
- You can take whatever you want.

56
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,040
I want the strawberry flavored one.

57
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,470
I want the chocolate flavored one.

58
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,830
I'm going to have the Earl Grey flavor.

59
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,230
Yun Seo, you should have this one.

60
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,740
"A taste that calls for
a kiss, mint macaroon".

61
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,210
Goodness, I don't want to kiss anyone.

62
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,370
- My goodness.
- What?

63
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,940
Mr. Kwon, do you need anything?

64
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,850
From now on, I'm not going to ask.

65
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,060
What? What do you mean?

66
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,050
You said I shouldn't ask.

67
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,830
You're not going to ask?

68
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,980
Here?

69
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,110
That's right.

70
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,980
I always checked if you delivered
the sentencing properly.

71
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,860
but I won't anymore since
you always do a good job.

72
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,960
Gosh, I'm tired. I need a cup of coffee.

73
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,180
You're insane! Even if it was that good...

74
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,250
What are you talking about?
What do you mean it was good?

75
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,510
Well, I can't say that it wasn't.

76
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,800
Darn it! Whatever.

77
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,050
This is a sacred workplace.
Yun Seo, please.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,430
Just focus on your work.

79
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,470
Focus. Concentrate!

80
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,110
Here's the material you asked for.

81
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,160
Thanks.

82
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,750
It's just like the owner said.

83
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,250
The hate comments are unbelievable.

84
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,200
The macaroons were of decent quality,

85
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,620
but some spoke ill of it just
because they were angry.

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,190
Some even wrote lies about how...

87
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,720
he didn't work at a German bakery.

88
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,810
He must be truly upset over this.

89
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,170
Many wrote hate comments
about me back in the day,

90
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,270
so I know how he feels.

91
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,200
I tell myself hundreds
and thousands of times...

92
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,280
to not care and to be strong and brave.

93
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,450
However, some comments
stabbed me in the heart.

94
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,320
I still haven't forgotten about them,

95
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,900
and where they stabbed me
sting from time to time.

96
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,180
Why didn't you sue them?

97
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,370
Well, I did.

98
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,100
I met them, and
they were either students...

99
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,540
or a mother and father with children.

100
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,570
Punishing them didn't seem right.

101
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,120
I dropped the charges after they
promised not to do it again.

102
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,630
The phone's ringing.

103
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,920
Just how brutal were the hate comments?

104
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,230
(Oh Yun Seo)

105
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,590
("Top Celebrity Oh Yun Seo
Questioned on Drug Use")

106
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,950
I'm pressing charges.

107
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,770
Sorry? On what?

108
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,300
I looked up the comments written about you.

109
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,720
These aren't just hate comments.
It's a crime.

110
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,210
They must know what they did...

111
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,210
by writing such malicious things.

112
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,220
Also, they should be severely punished.

113
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,470
So right this instant...

114
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,140
Why are you laughing when I'm dead serious?

115
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,250
I'm happy, that's why.

116
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,830
What?

117
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,880
What are you happy about?

118
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,630
How could I not be?

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,340
You rarely show emotions.

120
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,910
This is how you normally are,

121
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,350
but you're outraged because
of what happened to me...

122
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,200
as if it happened to you.

123
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,020
From now on,
what's your business is my business.

124
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,130
I'm really fine.

125
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,350
Thank you for caring though.

126
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,460
Ms. Oh, how about we go to dinner...

127
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,420
What?

128
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,920
Okay, fine. I got it!

129
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,590
Precedents? I'll look them up for you!

130
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,940
Did you really need to grill me about them?

131
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,240
My timing was awful, wasn't it?

132
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,600
I'll let you get back to your business.

133
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,190
Mr. Kwon, are you all right?

134
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,220
- Yes, I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

135
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,110
I improvised so that we
wouldn't get caught.

136
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,190
I even acted a little.

137
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,220
Right. I applaud your fast-thinking.

138
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,750
You're quite strong too.

139
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,350
Actors seem like they live glamorous lives,

140
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,460
but it must be a lot of stress.

141
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,950
Awful comments must be considered
an occupational hazard.

142
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,680
Still, I had more fun moments though.

143
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,160
An exciting script would
make my heart thump.

144
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,580
Being on a busy set made
me feel like I'm alive.

145
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,030
When my work is received well,

146
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,640
I feel gratified.

147
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,580
Most of my memories are of fun incidents.

148
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,550
There was a show I worked
on called "Signal".

149
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,860
That's the one I remember the most.

150
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,530
I had to bring out a new side
that was hidden within me.

151
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,220
It must be memorable because
it was a challenge.

152
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,920
I liked every project I worked on though.

153
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,400
However, you wouldn't know
since you never watched any.

154
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,230
Well...

155
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,410
Sorry, I need to take this call.

156
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,210
Yes, this is Kwon Jung Rok.

157
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,150
Sure. I'm outside right now,

158
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,950
but I'll send you the document
as soon as I get back.

159
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,390
Sure, of course.

160
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,910
Take care.

161
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,880
Do you need to head back to the office?

162
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,430
- Yes.
- Then why did you leave?

163
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,480
I wanted to give you a ride home.

164
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,540
Really?

165
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,870
You didn't have to.

166
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,420
This must be why people
get into relationships.

167
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,350
I have someone who cares about me
and looks out for me.

168
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,190
It's nice.

169
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,170
There was a show I worked
on called "Signal".

170
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,860
That's the one I remember the most.

171
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,010
However, you wouldn't know
since you never watched any.

172
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,670
"A woman becomes an insurance planner..."

173
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,840
"at Signal Insurance."

174
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,090
"She turns her life around..."

175
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,680
"after becoming a top salesperson."

176
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,630
Detective Lee?

177
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,500
Just what on earth happened...

178
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,210
in 1997?

179
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,120
I know though.

180
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,080
You had your appendix removed.

181
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,890
However, your insurance didn't cover any...

182
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,770
of your actual expenses.

183
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,010
Life doesn't end at 60.

184
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,740
You can change your future.

185
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,340
Please don't give up!

186
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,330
How could you cheat on me?

187
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,650
How can you love two women...

188
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,430
with only one heart?

Although, that's the reason
why I didn't call ahead.

203
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,570
What are you doing here at this hour?

204
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,300
Ta-da.

205
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,580
I come bearing a late-night snack.

206
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,830
You ought to be slightly hungry by now,

207
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,770
and I wanted to see how you
were doing without me.

208
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,160
Also, I missed you.

209
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,790
So what were you watching when I walked in?

210
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,690
The TV series you were in.

211
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,750
You look amazing in them.

212
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,820
Right? Don't I give off a unique vibe?

213
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,220
I know I'm not a master at acting,

214
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,510
but my acting isn't all that bad either.

215
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,980
That's right.

216
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,030
Even if you see those comments,
there's no need to feel discouraged.

217
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,750
- Since they aren't true at all.
- I can't agree more.

218
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,870
If you see those types
of comments from now on,

219
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,570
press the thumbs down button.

220
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,200
Okay.

221
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,610
Why are you looking at me like that?

222
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,550
I wonder how much you were hurt...

223
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,260
in order to become this composed.

224
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,300
I know you went through some hard times.

225
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,400
I feel happy that you overcame it.

226
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,580
Ms. Oh. Mr. Kwon didn't
come back yet, right?

227
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,930
Join us for lunch then.

228
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,750
Oh, well...

229
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,670
I'll just wait and have lunch with him.

230
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,480
He'll be back pretty soon.

231
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,310
If I say I ate alone,
he might think I'm disloyal.

232
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,310
All right then. Enjoy your lunch.

233
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,220
You too, Ms. Yang.

234
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,360
When is Mr. Kwon coming back?

235
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,630
These dumplings really taste amazing.

236
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,700
Mr. Yeon, you spattered
hot stew on my face.

237
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,640
From now on, I think we should
exclude hot stews like this...

238
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,480
from our lunch menu.

239
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,440
What if I suffer a burn
on my handsome face...

240
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,780
just because of a pot of dumpling stew?

241
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,320
That's what you call,
"Penny wise and pound foolish."

242
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,620
Penny wise and pound foolish my foot.

243
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,370
Ms. Dan, are you going to
put up with this nonsense?

244
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,720
- Say something.
- What?

245
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,020
- Me?
- Yes.

246
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,960
I know you loathe Mr. Choi.

247
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,790
So don't hold back and
criticize him all you want.

248
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,270
When did I say I loathed him?

249
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,070
I think you should stop eating dumplings.

250
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,210
There is a total of 8 dumplings,
and we should each have 2.

251
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,500
But you've already had your share.

252
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,580
Why are you being so cheap over a dumpling?

253
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,390
We can just order more.

254
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,550
Shall we order more then?

255
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,370
But it might take time for
them to cook new dumplings.

256
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,290
We don't have time to wait.

257
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,240
Mr. Choi, you can just
let me have your share.

258
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,590
No way. I love the dumplings
at this restaurant.

259
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,310
I will never give my dumpling
to you, Mr. Yeon.

260
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,600
It tastes too great to give up on.

261
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,180
I won't let you take someone
like her away from me.

262
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,390
She's too great to give up on.

263
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,050
Do you know how much this vest costs?

264
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,200
♫ <i>Olé!</i> ♫

265
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,090
Oh, gosh.

266
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,630
What's wrong, Ms. Dan?

267
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,620
What are you doing?

268
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,470
Why are you holding your cheek like that?

269
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,150
Is it a toothache?

270
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,750
Do you have a rotten tooth?
Open your mouth.

271
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,670
If it hurts, you should hurry
and go to a dentist.

272
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,190
It's not that.

273
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,360
Come on, it's obvious you're
suffering from a toothache.

274
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,900
You're not usually a bright person either,

275
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,070
and if you keep scowling like that,
your clients will feel uneasy.

276
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,840
If it hurts, go to a dentist.

277
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,940
I'm telling you, it's not a toothache!

278
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,560
Ms. Dan, you must like salad.

279
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,990
Hot pot bulgogi, jjajangmyeon.

280
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,170
Kimchi stew and rice?

281
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,700
Pizza?

282
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,500
Everything sounds so good.

283
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,270
Gosh, lunchtime is almost over.
When is he coming back?

284
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,540
(Mr. Kwon)

285
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,330
Yes, Mr. Kwon. When are you...

286
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,880
What?

287
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,320
You'll be late?

288
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,470
Yes, my meeting is taking
longer than I thought.

289
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,170
I'll just have lunch here.

290
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,450
You should go have lunch too.

291
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,800
Okay. I'll see you later then.

292
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,790
Okay.

293
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,240
I should've gone with
Ms. Yang to lunch earlier.

294
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm so full.

295
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,010
Wasn't the stew a bit salty today?

296
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,460
Really? You ate two bowls of rice,

297
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,660
so I thought you had a huge appetite.

298
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,700
I ate two bowls because
the stew was too salty.

299
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,560
I was neutralizing the saltiness with rice.

300
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,480
You should've drunk water then.
Who mixes more rice?

301
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,270
(I heard dandelion tea
is good for gastritis.)

302
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,110
I heard dandelion tea
is good for gastritis.

303
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,440
Drink this instead of coffee.

304
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,270
By the way, when are you
going to pay me back?

305
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,370
(Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum)

306
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,640
Among the items we confiscated,

307
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,410
there was no smoking gun that
could prove his charges.

308
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,610
For now, our request to extend
Jung Ji Ho's imprisonment...

309
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,870
won't be accepted.

310
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,370
When Jung Ji Ho was caught
for illegal gambling abroad,

311
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,540
his company probably pulled
strings for him in advance.

312
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,630
This wasn't completely unexpected.

313
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,370
Attorney Choi Yoon Su is
an expert in this field.

314
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,830
Do you know Mr. Choi well?

315
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,660
I used to.

316
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,990
We worked together at the
special prosecution department.

317
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,880
He used to be the best prosecutor
in catching economic criminals.

318
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,120
Now, he's just an attorney who does
the dirty work for conglomerates.

319
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,760
Anyway, good job.
I'll take care of the rest.

320
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,870
Okay.

321
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,280
How about dinner next week?
I'll pay you back then.

322
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,950
What are you smiling about?

323
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,550
- Who is it?
- Yeo Reum.

324
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,310
What?

325
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,590
Since we're on the subject,
let's make things clear.

326
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,810
I still have feelings for Yoo Yeo Reum.

327
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,260
She is the only person
who I feel attracted to.

328
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,650
So from now on, don't cross the line.

329
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,750
I don't want to lose a competent junior...

330
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,450
who's good at her work. Okay?

331
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,150
Mr. Kwon, this is the
material you asked for.

332
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,210
Thanks.

333
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,560
It's time to go home now. You should go.

334
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,580
Okay.

335
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,880
Oh, it's because...

336
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,230
I didn't have lunch.

337
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,500
Why didn't you have lunch?

338
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,930
What do you think?

339
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,000
I wanted to eat with you, so I waited.

340
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,240
But you suddenly called me
that you'd be coming late.

341
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,350
So all I had was Job's Tears Tea.

342
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,710
You should've ate something alone then.

343
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,920
You know that I can't eat alone.

344
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,170
Why on earth can't you eat alone?

345
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,730
Mr. Kwon, you must've forgotten because...

346
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,380
I'm always by your side,
and you see me every day.

347
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,640
I used to be a celebrity.

348
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,430
If I went about on my own,
I might've gotten into trouble.

349
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,550
And I was a top star who
didn't have time to eat alone.

350
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,180
But you're not now.

351
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,170
Gosh, seriously.

352
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,360
That's true, but...

353
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,390
I can't suddenly do something
that I've never done before.

354
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm reluctant since I might
look pitiful if I eat alone.

355
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,330
Anyway, it's difficult for me.

356
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,890
You must be starving. Let's go
get something to eat first.

357
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,390
That sounds like a good idea.

358
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,170
- I'll go and finish up then.
- Okay.

359
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,670
Is this the place you want to recommend?

360
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,650
- Is it a famous restaurant?
- No, it's a one-person restaurant.

361
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,030
- A one-person restaurant?
- Yes.

362
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,690
All the seats are separated by
partitions like a reading room,

363
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,100
so you won't know who is sitting
next to you, or what they're eating.

364
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,800
It's the perfect place to
learn how to eat alone.

365
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,570
Wait. Time out.

366
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,330
Learn how to eat alone?

367
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,610
Why should we eat separately
when we came here together?

368
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,540
You need to practice in advance,
just in case you need to...

369
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,010
eat alone when I'm not around.

370
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,650
Still, I don't want to eat alone.

371
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,160
If you can't eat alone, there is
nothing you can do on your own.

372
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,210
I'll help you, so let's practice slowly.

373
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,030
Why are you sitting so far away?

374
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,300
To help you think that
you're actually here alone.

375
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,150
Mr. Kwon, would you like a dumpling?

376
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,920
Act like you're here by yourself
and focus on your meal.

377
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,150
(Act like you're here by yourself
and focus on your meal.)

378
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,090
To be honest, I feel
really awkward right now.

379
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,550
I really don't know where to look.

380
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,090
I figured it might be less
awkward if I text while I eat.

381
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,790
That's only going to make it longer
for you to finish your meal.

382
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,810
So let's talk later.
You should focus on eating for now.

383
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,790
♫ <i>Yes, everything is so new for me</i> ♫

384
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,550
♫ <i>Something that has a feeling, you know?</i> ♫

385
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,670
♫ <i>Whatever it is, make it hip and elegant</i> ♫

386
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,240
♫ <i>I'm pretty picky</i> ♫

387
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,030
♫ <i>I'm good at pretending I don't know</i> ♫

388
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,470
♫ <i>Don't be discouraged, be careful</i> ♫

389
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,640
♫ <i>Yes, I'm like thunder, I shine</i> ♫

390
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,400
♫ <i>Look out for me, it's about to get noisy</i> ♫

391
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,530
♫ <i>(Say) Hi lovely!</i> ♫

392
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,880
Mr. Kwon.

393
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,810
I just told you to focus on eating.

394
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,920
No, that's not it.

395
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,500
I wanted to ask you to take
a photo of me eating alone.

396
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,020
It's really meaningful to me,
so I'd like to keep a record of it.

397
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,230
Make it look like a
paparazzi photo if you can.

398
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,540
♫ <i>(Blink Blink) Don't act like you don't know</i> ♫

399
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,540
♫ <i>You're gonna fall for me</i> ♫

400
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,520
♫ <i>Hurry and show yourself</i> ♫

401
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,980
♫ <i>Ya, what you gonna do?</i> ♫

402
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,670
♫ <i>What you gonna do? Woo hoo</i> ♫

403
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,620
♫ <i>What you gonna do? Woo hoo, say hey</i> ♫

404
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,410
♫ <i>Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on now</i> ♫

405
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,120
♫ <i>What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?</i> ♫

406
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Mr. Lee, you're going home late.

407
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,490
I had some work to finish up.

408
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,170
Why are you going home at this hour?

409
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,420
I met up with a friend for a cup of tea.

410
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,390
I see.

411
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,190
She must be really tired.

412
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,750
She was also dozing off like this
when I first saw her.

413
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,440
I'm sorry.

414
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,910
I'm Lee Du Seop,

415
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,040
and I'll be working here as a
paralegal starting from today.

416
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,530
He used to be a detective,
so he'll be of great help.

417
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,420
Ms. Yang, I told you to go home.

418
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,080
I'll go right after I'm done with this.

419
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,440
Yes, sir.

420
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,890
Ms. Yang looks really tired.

421
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,210
Once she goes home, she even
needs to take care of her kid.

422
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,980
She has a kid?

423
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,780
Isn't she cute?

424
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,930
Her taekwondo instructor sent it to me.

425
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,500
She looks so cute.

426
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,920
Yes, she's cute.

427
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,620
I thought to myself that her
smile looks really pretty.

428
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,800
So I wanted her to keep smiling.

429
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,220
She seemed exhausted,

430
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,370
but I hoped that her life would
be filled with things...

431
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,920
that constantly made her laugh.

432
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,640
That's probably when...

433
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,610
I started liking Ms. Yang.

434
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,980
Ms. Yang.

435
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,250
Ms. Yang.

436
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,110
- It's time for you to get off.
- Goodness, already?

437
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,740
Thank you always.
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Lee.

438
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,270
- Okay, go home safely.
- Bye.

439
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,550
Why are you sitting there all
by yourself in the dark?

440
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,420
No reason.

441
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,530
Can you fix me a meal? I'm hungry.

442
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,740
Thank you for driving me home.

443
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,920
You worry about all the
mean comments that I get,

444
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,540
and you even taught me how to eat alone.
You're really...

445
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,600
I give you 99 points out of 100.

446
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,290
Why did I lose one point?

447
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,840
Because of the way you talk to me.

448
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,440
If you weren't so formal to me,
you would've gotten 100 points.

449
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,110
Can't you talk to me...

450
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,470
more comfortably?

451
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,110
You always call me "Ms. Oh Jin Sim".

452
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,160
But instead of calling me that,

453
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,440
you can call me Ms... No, wait.

454
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,950
Just call me Jin Sim.

455
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,030
- Gosh, that's too...
- Why?

456
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,960
You should treat me more comfortably
like you treat Prosecutor Yoo...

457
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,430
and Prosecutor Kim.

458
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,690
I'm close with them because of
the time we spent together.

459
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,910
If you suddenly ask me to
change the way I talk to you,

460
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,740
don't you think I'd feel taken aback?

461
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,450
"Don't you think I'd feel taken aback?"

462
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,140
Did you just imitate me?

463
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,430
"Did you just imitate me?"

464
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,610
See? Doesn't it sound really formal?

465
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,770
It sounds scary, doesn't it?

466
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,760
No, it's cute.

467
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,480
I don't think I can suddenly
change the way I talk to you.

468
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,260
Plus, if I suddenly change
the way I talk to you,

469
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,880
people at the firm will
be suspicious of us.

470
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,260
I think it'd be better for me
to be careful of your sake.

471
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,680
Okay. I guess you do have a point.

472
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,160
By the way, I have a question.

473
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,040
You'll be leaving the law
firm in about a month.

474
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,120
What are you planning to do after you quit?

475
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,100
- What?
- You went to law school,

476
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,370
and that shows that you
were interested in law.

477
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,880
Are you planning on
pursuing a career in law?

478
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,720
Well...

479
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,010
Hyuk Joon! My goodness.

480
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,410
Go away. Hey.

481
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,510
Hyuk Joon. What are you doing here?

482
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,710
I told you that I'll come home on my own.
Why did you come?

483
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,520
I came to give you some side dishes.

484
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,120
But... Hey, Mr. Kwon.

485
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,480
Why did you drive her home today?

486
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,190
- Why would you ask him that?
- I mean, it's just weird.

487
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,330
What will you do if a paparazzi
takes a photo of you guys?

488
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,800
That's nonsense. It's been ages
since I had a paparazzi follow me.

489
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,680
My gosh, let's go. Hurry.

490
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,340
Mr. Kwon, I hope you go home safely.

491
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,130
Let's go.

492
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,830
Where did he go?

493
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,980
What's the matter with you?

494
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,210
Come on.

495
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,140
Her cousin is overly protective of her.

496
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,670
I really don't get your relationship
with that attorney.

497
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,480
Sometimes, it seems like you like him.

498
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,030
But sometimes,
it seems like you resent him.

499
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,250
You seemed like best friends today.
You guys seemed awfully close.

500
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,700
We're close. We've grown on each other.

501
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,660
Hyuk Joon, about this project...

502
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,600
- This project?
- Yes.

503
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,430
I'm talking about the on-the-job
training I'm doing...

504
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,090
for Writer Lee's drama.

505
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,650
- Yes, what about it?
- I was thinking...

506
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,730
Would it be okay if I told
Mr. Kwon about it?

507
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,640
Why? Why would you tell him?

508
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,340
I just feel bad...

509
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,410
about lying to him.

510
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,700
I see him every day,
and it makes me feel guilty.

511
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,080
I know Writer Lee and Mr. Yeon...

512
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,190
told me to keep it a secret.

513
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,820
But it's not like Mr. Kwon has a big mouth.

514
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,440
So I was thinking about telling him.

515
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,630
Hyuk Joon, Mr. Kwon is
a very trustworthy guy.

516
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,200
If I tell him about my situation,

517
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,910
I'm sure he'll understand everything.

518
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,750
Yun Seo, I get that you feel uncomfortable.

519
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,370
But the main point of this
project is to keep it a secret.

520
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,200
Writer Lee wants all the
attention to go to her writing.

521
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,040
Her first and foremost condition
was to keep it a secret...

522
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,810
that you got cast for her drama...

523
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,250
before an official article got released.

524
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,780
We need to keep that promise.

525
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,250
I'm just worried that Mr. Kwon
might get disappointed...

526
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,290
if he finds out about it later on.

527
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,250
So what? You won't be seeing
him again once you quit.

528
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,730
Yun Seo, don't worry about
disappointing the attorney.

529
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,980
Instead, worry about how disappointed...

530
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,450
Mr. Yeon and I would be
if you mess up this project.

531
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,710
Telling him will put me in trouble,

532
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,700
but lying to him makes me feel awful.

533
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,170
Will he feel betrayed
when he finds out later on?

534
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,330
Because I wasn't honest?

535
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,540
Yes, dried squid.

536
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,600
You're late.

537
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,460
Were you on a date with
the universe's goddess?

538
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,580
Stop it before I kick you up there.

539
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,210
How about some beer and grilled squid?

540
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,270
I'm good.

541
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,370
If that's what she wants,

542
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,960
then I'll try.

543
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,510
Ms. Jin Sim. Jin Sim?

544
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,450
Jin Sim, did you get in safely?

545
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,480
Jin Sim. Jin Sim. Jin Sim.

546
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,920
Jin Sim, you're very pretty.

547
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,180
Unbelievable.

548
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,110
It looks delicious.

549
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,130
Hi, Jin Sim.

550
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,970
Jin Sim. Jin Sim?

551
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,130
- Jin Sim.
- This is truly unbelievable.

552
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,280
You were with her all day,

553
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,450
yet you're here yearning for her.

554
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,250
Love. It must be love.

555
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,710
Why didn't you knock?

556
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,790
- Can you come here?
- Why?

557
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,580
Are you showing me a photo
of your gorgeous girlfriend?

558
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,680
No, it's a photo of the house
you'll be moving into.

559
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,510
Oh, this one looks nice.

560
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,960
You can move in instantly.

561
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,490
- Instantly?
- Yes.

562
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,720
Don't you think that's a little harsh?

563
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,000
Check the layout.

564
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,640
Like this. See?

565
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,900
It looks nice and all,

566
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,690
but I'd rather take
my time looking for one.

567
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,110
Anyway, just keep practicing.

568
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,540
Jin Sim, how about we go to lunch?

569
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,510
My gosh.

570
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,680
- This is awful.
- Tell me about it.

571
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,720
What are you two looking at?

572
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,920
This video was uploaded on an
online site I frequently visit.

573
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,890
Someone recorded a video...

574
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,840
of middle school girls
harassing other girls.

575
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,840
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

576
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,640
Keep your promise.

577
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,720
- Don't forget it next time.
- Aren't they mean?

578
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,570
They are.

579
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,300
What are you talking about?

580
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,520
My daughter's at the police station?

581
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,370
(Sangdo Police Station)

582
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,490
Keep your promise.

583
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,580
- Don't forget it next time.
- Hold on.

584
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,360
You're saying that this girl's my daughter.

585
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,800
Mom, it's not me. It really isn't!

586
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,660
That's what Jin Yi claims,

587
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,200
but the bullies at the school...

588
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,940
who are also harassing
the girl in the video...

589
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,880
as well as the victim Park Min Joo...

590
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,910
all say that...

591
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,640
- Jin Yi took part in it.
- It's the truth!

592
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,150
She'd steal my daughter's money...

593
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,780
and harass her for no reason.

594
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,980
You have no idea how devastated I've been.

595
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,110
The money she stole isn't
a small amount either.

596
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,180
What did you spend it on?

597
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,620
It wasn't me.

598
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,190
- It really wasn't.
- Of course it was!

599
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,470
How dare you lie to me!

600
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,270
You mean little wench.

601
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,240
Ma'am, I understand that you're upset,

602
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,340
but nothing's been proven yet,

603
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,810
so please refrain from harsh comments.

604
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,010
Nothing's been proven?

605
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,290
The other kids have already testified,

606
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,600
and she's there in the video.

607
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,120
The bully's face can't be
properly seen in the video,

608
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,620
so you can't be sure that it's my daughter.

609
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,500
Also, she doesn't own
a down jacket like that.

610
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,120
- Still...
- I'm almost sure that it's not her,

611
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,160
because that's not who she is.

612
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,750
My daughter wouldn't harass and
bully her friend like that.

613
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,300
Look here.

614
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,330
That's what all mothers of bullies say.

615
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,870
They all say that their kids are sweet.

616
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,250
But your daughter isn't!

617
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,250
She's mean and cruel!

618
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,030
I thought I made myself clear.

619
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,410
Please refrain from harsh comments.

620
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,090
If you find any issues,

621
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,920
please investigate according
to the procedure.

622
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,040
Let's go.

623
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,600
I'm pressing charges.

624
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,520
I'll sue you!

625
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,850
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

626
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,420
Thanks for believing me.

627
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,510
There's no need to thank me.

628
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,340
It's a mom's job to believe her children.

629
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
You should get going.
You'll be late for class.

630
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,870
Buy a snack if you get hungry.

631
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,410
All right. I'll get going then.

632
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,250
Take care.

633
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,300
I see.

634
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,740
Don't worry, Ms. Yang.

635
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,110
Why would you when all we
have are attorneys here?

636
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,860
Of course. We'll talk
more in detail tomorrow.

637
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,390
Don't worry too much, okay?

638
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,200
Is Ms. Yang in some sort of trouble?

639
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,210
Her daughter Jin Yi was
named as a school bully.

640
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,410
She seems to have been framed.

641
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,520
- Could you perhaps help her out?
- Of course.

642
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,760
Really? That's unexpected.

643
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,220
What do you mean?
Is that what you think of me?

644
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,430
You're prickly,

645
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,930
but also talented.

646
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,820
Anyway, help her in any way you can.

647
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,960
Ms. Yang only has Jin Yi, remember?

648
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,460
Unbelievable.

649
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,400
How dare they say that about my daughter.

650
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,070
Gosh.

651
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,220
Is it so hard to hang your clothes back up?

652
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,570
Goodness, let me see.

653
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,700
The number you have called...

654
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,680
Why isn't she picking up?

655
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,400
It can't be true.

656
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,720
Is this how it's going to be?

657
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,790
Jin Yi, I didn't do it on purpose.

658
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,340
Ms. Yang, don't look so glum.

659
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,940
Our top attorney has agreed
to help you, so why worry?

660
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,190
He's right. There's no need to worry.

661
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,630
I'm sure it'll all work out.

662
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,820
From what I hear,
your daughter has been framed.

663
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,120
I don't think she was.

664
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,580
I guess...

665
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,940
I didn't raise her right.

666
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,660
She was bullying her friend.

667
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,190
When I asked her where she
got her down jacket from,

668
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,330
she couldn't answer me.

669
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,320
I think...

670
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,250
she bought it with the money
she took from the other kids.

671
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,040
I always felt sorry for her...

672
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,580
because I couldn't provide much,

673
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,200
but I was confident I loved her
more than any other parent could.

674
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,150
I'm not sure about anything else,

675
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:57,290
but I thought I raised her into
a kind and sincere daughter.

676
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,080
But how could she...

677
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,460
How could she do that?

678
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,920
Ms. Yang.

679
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,150
What should we do?

680
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,710
Ms. Yang went through so much raising her.

681
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,630
Are you sure the girl in the
white down jacket is Jin Yi?

682
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,230
Considering the circumstances.
Ms. Yang said so too.

683
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,610
Jin Yi is consistently denying
that she didn't do it.

684
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,680
And usually in these types of situations,

685
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,930
the parents are the ones who
lack objectivity the most.

686
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,980
Because they can't help
but react emotionally.

687
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,610
For that reason, we need to
focus just on the facts.

688
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,190
You're right.

689
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,610
We can't confirm the
assailant's face properly.

690
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,290
And the statement that Jin Yi is
the assailant may not be true.

691
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,610
As long as we're on this case,

692
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,750
we shouldn't make any
prejudgments whatsoever...

693
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,930
that our client is guilty.

694
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,940
Then like you said, I'll go listen
to Jin Yi and think about this...

695
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,150
- from her perspective.
- Okay.

696
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,330
Is it okay if I go with Ms. Oh?

697
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,980
Sure, go ahead.

698
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,860
I heard a lot about you from Ms. Yang.

699
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,830
I always wanted to meet you.
It's nice to finally meet.

700
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,060
It's not me.

701
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,540
I really didn't do it.

702
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,150
I know. We believe you.

703
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,150
So can you tell us honestly?

704
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,220
The victim pointed you out as the person...

705
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,240
who bullied her.

706
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,750
Why do you think she did that?

707
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,680
Did she have a grudge on you from before?

708
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,330
I didn't even know her.

709
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,800
Then what about the other bullies?

710
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,800
The ones who blamed you for everything.
You don't know them?

711
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,170
Then can you tell me
about your down jacket?

712
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,120
Your mom said she didn't
know how you got it.

713
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,760
I'm sorry, but I'll leave now.

714
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,720
My mom doesn't even believe me.
What more can I say?

715
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:45,750
- Jin Yi.
- Wait.

716
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,730
Isn't she the one in that video?

717
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,330
She doesn't look like a bully.

718
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,710
I know. What's wrong with her?

719
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:00,130
Jin Yi.

720
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:05,410
Why are you following me?
I have nothing more to say.

721
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,040
By any chance, do you...

722
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,200
like tteokbokki?

723
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,080
What?

724
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,120
How did it go?

725
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,880
Well, Jin Yi kept refusing to talk to me.

726
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,070
But it seems that Jin Yi...

727
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:31,350
isn't a girl who would
do something like that.

728
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,440
Maybe she's being threatened.

729
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,720
Threatened? By whom?

730
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,880
Do you mean the real assailant?

731
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,620
Is that why she can't say anything...

732
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,770
even when she's being framed?
Because she's afraid?

733
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,430
Usually, there are two reasons
why victims don't point out...

734
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,480
the assailant.

735
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,330
They're either being
threatened by the assailant,

736
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,250
or they want to protect the assailant.

737
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,040
For Jin Yi's case, I think it's the latter.

738
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,140
According to the statements
from the victim's parent,

739
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,340
the victim suffered from
continuous bullying at school.

740
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,850
- So to check if it was true,
- Hold on.

741
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:17,460
I checked the footage of whenever
Jin Yi and the victim were together.

742
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:20,990
Yes. She's the girl who fought with
Jin Yi in front of the academy.

743
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,710
I thought Jin Yi was bullying her.

744
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:30,750
Excuse me.

745
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,650
Who are you?

746
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,290
I'm Seo Jin Yi's mom.

747
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,440
Do you have time to talk?

748
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,610
The assailant, Park Seon Yeong, was...

749
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,260
close friends with Jin
Yi since they were kids.

750
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,050
But at a certain point,

751
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,380
she started hanging out with
other bullies and started to change.

752
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,660
She borrowed Jin Yi's down jacket...

753
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,240
and assaulted the victim.

754
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,500
That video spread across the internet,

755
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,290
and the real assailant framed
the owner of the jacket, Jin Yi...

756
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,480
because she was afraid of being punished.

757
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:04,370
Then the reason Jin Yi
didn't mention this is...

758
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,130
They were close friends
since they were young.

759
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,100
And she still had affection for her.

760
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,240
I think Jin Yi was waiting
until she confessed.

761
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,670
Since she has confessed, the police
will end the internal investigation.

762
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,150
They'll book her on charges
of assault accordingly.

763
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:19,870
I'm glad.

764
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,750
Do you have something to say?

765
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,510
I promised Jin Yi that
I'd keep this a secret.

766
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,520
But I think you should know.

767
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:50,640
It turns out, Jin Yi...

768
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,720
met with her dad sometimes.

769
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,980
I'm not going to meet you from now on.

770
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:04,280
I don't want to lie to Mom
and keep meeting like this.

771
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,150
That's just wrong.

772
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,700
She said her dad bought
that down jacket for her.

773
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,150
Really?

774
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,440
But why didn't she tell me?

775
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,410
Well, she was worried you might get hurt.

776
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,550
That's why she couldn't tell you honestly.

777
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,670
She couldn't say anything about...

778
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,450
her meeting her dad or being framed...

779
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,380
by her close friend.

780
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,330
It must've been really tough for Jin Yi.

781
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,130
Did you meet your dad?

782
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,650
What?

783
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,960
I was walking by, and I saw you with him.

784
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,290
Well...

785
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,700
I'm sorry, Mom.

786
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,180
Why are you sorry?

787
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,940
Dad is someone who hurt you.

788
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,460
You must hate him.

789
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:12,090
I'm sorry I met him behind your back.

790
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,550
It's alright.

791
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,700
I'm sorrier.

792
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,220
You must've needed your dad,

793
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,740
but I didn't even understand how you felt.

794
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,690
I made you suffer so much.

795
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:31,510
I'm sorry.

796
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,790
♫ <i>Starry light, lighty light</i> ♫

797
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:36,970
And...

798
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,400
I'm sorry for not trusting you...

799
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,310
until the end.

800
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,680
I'm sorry, my daughter.

801
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:53,790
♫ <i>Oh starry light, lighty light</i> ♫

802
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:59,320
♫ <i>Starry light, light light</i> ♫

803
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,600
♫ <i>Starry light, lighty light</i> ♫

804
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,380
♫ <i>Starry light, lighty light</i> ♫

805
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,610
Thank you.

806
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,220
Thank you.

807
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,500
This is so cute. There's no need for this.

808
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,370
You went through so much trouble for me.

809
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,430
I feel grateful and sorry to you.

810
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,290
There's no need to feel sorry.

811
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:25,930
All of us here receive so much
help from your mom all the time.

812
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,000
Compared to what she did for us,

813
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,210
this isn't even comparable.

814
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:31,670
So you don't have to feel sorry.

815
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,360
- Okay.
- So...

816
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,470
from now on, don't do anything
to upset your mother.

817
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,620
You know how much
your mother adores you, right?

818
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,150
Of course I do.

819
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,110
This is so cute.

820
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,590
How is Yun Seo at work lately?

821
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,970
There's no trouble with that
Kwon Jung Rok guy anymore?

822
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,300
No, she's doing fine these days.

823
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,120
It's a pity Yun Seo met such an
ill-tempered boss like that.

824
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,950
Do you know what stresses
people out the most at work?

825
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,310
It's stress due to their bosses.

826
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,380
They should all just get along,
but they continuously...

827
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,160
nag their subordinates
over nothing important.

828
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,510
I hate it. It's so annoying.

829
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,130
It is annoying. I can't
agree with you more, sir.

830
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,940
By the way, is that the
only shirt you have?

831
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:23,610
You wore the same shirt two days ago.

832
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:27,400
Really? Your memory is incredible, sir.

833
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,500
You're more incredible.

834
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,270
Are you going to wear that
30-dollar shirt for 30,000 years?

835
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,470
It's like you've become
one with that shirt.

836
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,070
You should think about our
company's reputation.

837
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,170
- Get yourself a new shirt.
- Yes, sir.

838
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:42,860
Gosh, that's hot.

839
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,820
Why would you gargle with coffee?

840
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,520
I mean, the way you made that noise...

841
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:53,090
I hate it when people make noises
when they drink or eat.

842
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,380
- Don't do it again.
- Yes, sir.

843
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:59,310
- Why? Do you have a problem?
- No, sir.

844
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:06,890
It really is hot.

845
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,570
Sir, someone sent a gift
for Ms. Oh Yun Seo.

846
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:14,580
Really? You can put it right there.

847
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:18,930
Thanks.

848
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,270
Gosh, it's been ages since
someone sent Yun Seo a gift.

849
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,690
I didn't know she still had a loyal fan.

850
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:37,000
Hey, isn't that something he used
to send her from time to time?

851
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:38,790
Yes, it is.

852
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,350
Where is Lee Gang Joon...

853
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,190
right now?

854
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,580
From what I know,
he's currently living in the US.

855
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,400
Unlike the steel industry which
is going through a slump,

856
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,570
Jeguk Biotech is constantly
showing signs of profit.

857
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,700
Their goal is to raise 30 percent
of their current stock price...

858
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,990
by the end of the year.

859
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,410
I guess she's doing well.

860
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:37,810
Why are you looking at me like that?

861
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,680
Because you're so handsome.

862
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,670
What? Why all of a sudden?

863
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:49,110
I always come to respect you...

864
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,900
every time you win a case.

865
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:56,750
I think being an attorney is really cool.

866
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:02,630
To be honest, I didn't major in law
because I was interested in it.

867
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,660
I actually made my debut back
when I was in high school.

868
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,940
But my dad was really against it.

869
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:12,430
He was worried that I might get hurt...

870
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,840
because the entertainment
industry is so harsh.

871
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:18,750
But I kept insisting on pursuing
my career as an actress,

872
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,970
and that's when he told me
to go to law school.

873
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,080
He said he'll approve
if I got into law school.

874
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,430
That was his way of saying...

875
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:27,740
that he'll never let me work as an actress.

876
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,910
That's how impossible it was.

877
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:35,130
It wasn't like I was
really good at studying.

878
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,810
But you see, I studied really hard...

879
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,550
and got myself accepted to law school.

880
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,950
Like I already told you,
I'm really good at memorizing stuff.

881
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,110
But because I went there
with the wrong purpose,

882
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,320
I didn't find it any fun.

883
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,410
That's why I quit after a semester.

884
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,740
But if I knew how cool this job was,
I would've studied harder.

885
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,460
I keep having regrets these days.

886
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,380
It's not too late.

887
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,960
If you wish to study law,
I'll help you out.

888
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,990
After all, you started working here...

889
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:13,210
because you wanted to learn about the job.

890
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:17,210
Right.

891
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,540
- Jung Rok.
- Yes?

892
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,200
How about you, me, and Yun Seo
go for a drink after work?

893
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,470
- What?
- It's for having helped Ms. Yang.

894
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:34,160
I'm grateful that you helped her
out without even getting paid.

895
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,350
I wanted to treat you guys,
so I already made a reservation.

896
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,720
But Mr. Lee apparently can't make it today.

897
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,930
So the three of us will
have to drink without him.

898
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,740
What do you say?

899
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:47,290
Yun Seo, what do you say?

900
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,840
- Sure.
- Great.

901
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,490
I'll see you guys later, then.

902
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,190
Maybe I shouldn't have agreed to go.

903
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:59,090
To be honest, I'm not really
feeling very well today.

904
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,210
Then I'll drink on behalf of you.

905
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,360
You will?

906
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:06,480
Can you hold your liquor?

907
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:08,870
I can't exactly drink a lot,

908
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,600
but I don't like getting wasted
in front of other people.

909
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:13,720
So I always stay alert...

910
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,300
and make sure I never drink over my limit.

911
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,930
In other words, I'm really good
at keeping myself under control.

912
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:28,160
I have never gotten drunk
in my entire life.

913
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,060
Can you hold your liquor?

914
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,690
I can't exactly drink a lot,

915
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:37,210
but I don't like getting wasted
in front of other people.

916
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,430
So I always stay alert...

917
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:42,160
and make sure I never drink over my limit.

918
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,890
In other words, I'm really good
at keeping myself under control.

919
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:54,020
I have never gotten drunk
in my entire life.

920
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,250
Mr. Yeon.

921
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,600
- Do you know Thomas Hobbes?
- Thomas Hobbes?

922
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,000
Yes, Thomas Hobbes.

923
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:13,580
Thomas Hobbes, the philosopher.

924
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:18,300
"The state of men is nothing else
but a mere war of all against all."

925
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,810
That's what he said.

926
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,840
I can't agree with that statement.

927
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,980
Especially, his statement of
limiting an individual's interest...

928
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:27,940
- for the public's interest...
- Jung Rok.

929
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:31,830
I don't know if I'm here to
drink or to have a debate.

930
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,160
- Let's stop talking about Hobbes.
- Oh, okay.

931
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,350
Then let's start talking about
"actio libera in causa".

932
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,150
- What?
- Sure, that sounds like fun.

933
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,580
Who is she? Your ex-girlfriend?

934
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,790
It's quite an unusual name.

935
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:53,080
Creating the condition of
his or her own defense.

936
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,610
"Actio libera in causa".

937
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:56,520
Article 10, Section 3 of the Criminal Law.

938
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,480
If someone intentionally
or accidentally incurs...

939
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:02,250
their own mental disorder...

940
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:05,900
and gets themselves in
trouble or commits a crime,

941
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:09,260
do you think it's right
for them to get punished?

942
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,470
What do you think, Mr. Yeon?

943
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:17,500
How is that you're boring
even when you're drunk?

944
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,900
Seriously, Jung Rok.

945
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:23,230
Is he like this every time he gets drunk?

946
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,090
This is my first time seeing him drunk.

947
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,110
Jung Rok, why did you drink so much today?

948
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:31,180
Oh, right.

949
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,380
I drank on behalf of Ms. Oh.

950
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,350
That's why I drank a lot.

951
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,940
Ms. Oh told me that she's
not feeling so well today.

952
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,720
Why would you drink for her just
because she's not feeling well?

953
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:48,170
You're normally so cold-hearted
and merciless. So why would you...

954
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,060
Well...

955
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,650
I guess he was worried that I might
not be able to work tomorrow...

956
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,800
if my condition got worse.

957
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,240
In that sense,

958
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,880
let me go...

959
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:12,570
to the bathroom.
I need to go to the bathroom.

960
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,650
I'll be right back.

961
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,640
- Hobbes.
- Hobbes.

962
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,970
- Actio libera in causa.
- Actio libera in causa.

963
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,450
I thought he was giving you a hard time,

964
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,780
but I guess he cares about you.

965
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,600
- Yes.
- Back when you told me...

966
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:42,520
that Jung Rok teaches you a lot
of stuff and is considerate,

967
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,020
I didn't buy it.

968
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,380
I just couldn't believe it.

969
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:49,020
But seeing how he even
drank on behalf of you...

970
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:50,830
with that coldhearted personality of his,

971
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,620
I guess he really does care about you.

972
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:56,380
It seems like you guys became very close.

973
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,030
Yes, I guess so.

974
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:00,500
I'm starting to think...

975
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,530
that Jung Rok might feel sad
once you leave our firm.

976
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:08,580
By the way, are you preparing
well for the drama?

977
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,880
Yes.

978
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:13,380
When I first heard...

979
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,510
that you're getting ready to act
as an attorney in a new drama,

980
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,730
When I first heard that...

981
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:21,080
you'd be working with us for three months,

982
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,080
my heart almost exploded...

983
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:24,660
due to the excitement.

984
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,750
We only just said hello,
but you'll be leaving soon.

985
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:29,410
You only have a month left.

986
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:32,420
Time sure flies, doesn't it?

987
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:36,520
I've been keeping my lips sealed,
so only I know of this.

988
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,350
But when you go back to acting...

989
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,810
and appear as an attorney in a show,

990
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:44,410
the people at the law firm will be shocked.

991
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:48,620
Even Mr. Kwon who rarely gets surprised.

992
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,950
Right?

993
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,990
Ms. Oh, thank you.

994
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,060
It all worked out thanks to you.

995
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,830
I honestly didn't do much.

996
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,020
Anyway, I'm glad everything was cleared up.

997
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:25,240
My daughter and I promised...

998
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,460
to never keep secrets between us again.

999
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:31,620
We felt that those closest...

1000
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:33,880
shouldn't keep such things.

1001
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,020
Are you all right?

1002
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,280
Yes.

1003
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,580
Here, have some water.

1004
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,750
Thank you.

1005
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,840
Thanks.

1006
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:06,060
How can you be serious
even when you're drunk?

1007
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:07,670
You talk in the same manner too.

1008
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,730
Do I?

1009
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,640
"Do I?"

1010
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:18,170
Still, I got to see you drunk.

1011
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,080
I'm happy that I got to
see a new side of you.

1012
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,510
I'm happy too.

1013
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:27,610
I'm glad to get to know
a new side of you...

1014
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,620
every day.

1015
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:33,580
I heard about your time of hardship...

1016
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:38,100
and saw how adorable
you were as an actress.

1017
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:43,300
I'm happy to see, hear, and know...

1018
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,030
a new side of you.

1019
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:47,370
Actually,

1020
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:51,340
I...

1021
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,370
haven't told you everything yet.

1022
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:00,500
There are things I still haven't told you.

1023
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:04,190
Well, you see...

1024
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,210
I didn't keep it a secret
to hide the truth.

1025
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:11,720
But...

1026
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,460
It's nothing.

1027
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,210
We should head inside. It's cold.

1028
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:31,240
Let's go.

1029
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,280
It's all right. You don't have to tell me.

1030
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,300
Even if you are keeping a secret,

1031
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,330
I couldn't care less.

1032
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,780
If you're doing so for your sake,

1033
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:58,450
then I'm okay with it no matter what.

1034

I've thought about it,
and I don't want a point deducted.

1053

Isn't it thrilling and romantic?

1054
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:05,570
Being in a secret relationship sure is fun.

1055
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,410
- Is there something in your eye?
- Yes.

1056
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:10,450
I think I'm going crazy. Why do I keep...

1057
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:13,960
It's destiny! Destiny, my foot.

1058
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,930
Is this why people get married?

1059
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,960
- You should come to my house.
- To her house?

1060
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,420
What if she thinks
I'm after something else?

1061
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:23,390
I've never had a boyfriend
come to my house before.

1062
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:26,280
I wanted to enjoy the time
we had left together.

1063
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:28,650
You'll leave in about a month.

1064
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,010
I don't want to provoke him.

1065
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:32,230
I know.

1066
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,960
I know he caused trouble for you.

1067
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,710
Lee Gang Joon's back in Korea.

1068
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,990
Is everything all right with Ms. Oh?
