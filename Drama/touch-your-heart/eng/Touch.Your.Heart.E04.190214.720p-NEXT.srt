1
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,750
Thanks to your emotional actions,

2
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,580
Yoon Ha finally opened up.

3
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,900
It was nothing.

4
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,360
You did well, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

5
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,670
Can you say that again?

6
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,860
Sorry?

7
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,270
Can I hear the compliment once again?

8
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,690
It was actually...

9
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,040
really nice.

10
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,400
Can you please say it again?

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,420
Please...

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,350
You did well.

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,950
You did well, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

14
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,800
We should go now.

15
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,520
(Episode 4)

16
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,630
We're back.

17
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,790
- Hey.
- You're back.

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,730
- Yun Seo.
- Yes?

19
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,600
How did the trial go today?

20
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,050
I heard he argued that
his client is innocent.

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,890
- Did he really do that?
- Yes, he did.

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,270
Gosh, I find it really sexy when
attorneys turn the tables...

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,470
at the very last moment.

24
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,490
Come to think of it,

25
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,360
Ms. Kwon is really competent,
and he's good-looking too.

26
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,570
Don't you think he's a little attractive?

27
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,220
I don't know. I never really
thought of him that way.

28
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,060
Bye, then.

29
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,410
He's not attractive.

30
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,400
The subject of rights...

31
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,460
What are you reading?

32
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,530
I told you I bought law books so
that I could study law again.

33
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,330
It's time to go home.

34
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,570
Is it time to go home already?

35
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,600
I hope you enjoy your weekend.
I'll see you on Monday.

36
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,190
Weekend? Wait!

37
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,200
Do you remember...

38
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,600
complimenting me earlier
saying I did a good job?

39
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,720
Yes.

40
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,090
Is that it?

41
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,960
What?

42
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,160
Is that all I'm going to get?

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,890
You should give me a reward.

44
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,760
A reward?

45
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,800
I want you to teach me.

46
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,080
I became really eager to learn,
so I bought all these books.

47
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,780
But it's not easy.
It's also hard to understand...

48
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,010
because I'm studying alone.

49
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,300
So can you teach me tomorrow...

50
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,560
as a reward?

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,610
Okay.

52
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,160
You do deserve to get a reward
for what you've achieved.

53
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,820
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

54
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,140
What did I just do?

55
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,950
I noticed that the light in
your dressing room keeps flickering.

56
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,090
I'll change the light bulb for you.

57
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,920
Why did I do that?

58
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,250
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,970
What? No, it's nothing.

60
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,500
- Okay.
- Yes.

61
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,020
I'm planning to visit
my professor tomorrow morning.

62
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,590
How about we meet up and
study in an empty classroom?

63
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,760
It'll be a better place to
study than a crowded library.

64
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,960
How considerate.

65
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,310
Gosh, don't mention it.

66
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,940
I'm just changing a light bulb.
It's not that big of a deal.

67
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,860
Gosh, Yun Seo. Did my kind gesture
of changing your light bulb...

68
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,710
- end up moving you?
- Yes, totally.

69
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,300
It's so touching.

70
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,950
Well, this isn't the end.
You're in for a ride.

71
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,730
There's one more thing I did for you.

72
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,780
I made a reservation
with Dr. Kwon tomorrow.

73
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,000
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

74
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,680
You still have trouble sleeping
these days, don't you?

75
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,630
You should get a consultation and
get enough medicine prescribed.

76
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,480
Oh, well... I'm sorry. I can't go tomorrow.

77
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,930
I have to study tomorrow.

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,980
You have to do what?

79
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,510
Study.

80
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,510
I mean, I'm working at a law firm,

81
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,720
so I figured I should at least
learn the most basic legal terms.

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,850
So I promised to meet Mr. Kwon
and study with him tomorrow.

83
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,190
- With that attorney?
- Yes.

84
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,970
You're meeting him on a weekend?

85
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,260
Yun Seo, are you perhaps...

86
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,230
- What?
- You...

87
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,010
- Yes?
- You're...

88
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,650
completely on the outs with that attorney!

89
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,620
It's why you're calling him out
on the weekend to torture him.

90
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,100
Talk about a sweet revenge.

91
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,160
Good for you.

92
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,530
It's truly exhausting to
be around you, you know.

93
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,160
Monday to Friday,

94
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,300
and now on the weekend too.

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,120
Gosh, I feel bad for that attorney.

96
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,520
My heart goes out to him.

97
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,690
I'll hurry up with the light bulb.

98
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,320
(Attorney Kwon Jung Rok)

99
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,200
Sure thing.

100
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,890
Hold on.

101
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,310
This is too gorgeous on me.

102
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,540
He might think that I tried
to look pretty for him.

103
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,300
With this one, I look too elegant.

104
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,440
This makes me look pretty
in a down-to-earth way.

105
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,190
Meanwhile, I look like an
innocent angel in this.

106
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,970
Gosh, I look good in everything.

107
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,250
I'll be late!

108
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,430
I should just go with the first outfit.

109
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,720
I'm like an angel.

110
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,110
You're here early.

111
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,030
Traffic wasn't as bad as I expected.

112
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,960
Anyway, thank you for sparing me...

113
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,990
some of your time today.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,620
Don't mention it.
The classroom is that way.

115
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,890
Let's go.

116
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,180
Hold on. He looks different
when not in his suit.

117
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,460
Wait. This feels like
a date on a school campus.

118
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,480
Could this be what he's
thinking of right now?

119
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,590
That's why the special law...

120
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,520
- takes precedent in this case.
- I see.

121
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,950
Men.

122
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,950
Somebody please help them.

123
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,720
Money promised to fund one's gambling...

124
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,230
doesn't actually have to be lent.

125
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,380
According to Article 103 of the Civil Code,

126
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,350
actions that violate rules of society
and harm virtuous customs...

127
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,750
are considered invalid.

128
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,130
Therefore, you are not
legally responsible...

129
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,720
to lend money for gambling
even if you promised to.

130
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,140
What if you lent someone the money?
Could you get it back?

131
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,390
You're probably curious of that.

132
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,350
According to Article 746 of the Civil Code,

133
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,250
performance for illegal cause...
It's in the book.

134
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,680
When money has been
exchanged for illegal use,

135
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,640
the law stipulates that you
can't request its return.

136
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,870
You can't get it back.

137
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,240
Do you understand?

138
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,680
I guess so.

139
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,100
- Right.
- Mr. Kwon.

140
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,820
You can teach me all this...

141
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,080
while sitting, you know.

142
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,870
No, it's better with the board.

143
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,730
Let's move onto the next chapter then.

144
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,830
Article 747 of the Civil Code...

145
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,890
Hold on.

146
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,700
Can we study somewhere else?

147
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,330
But there won't be a board.

148
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,240
I thought you wanted to study.
Why are we here?

149
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,770
Who says that studying...

150
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,380
should only be done with a white board...

151
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,720
while the student memorizes every line?

152
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,350
A legal movie was just released,

153
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,480
so I thought we could study it instead.

154
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,660
Have you been to a drive-in theater before?

155
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,190
Regular theaters are uncomfortable for me,

156
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,540
so this is where I usually come.

157
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,850
I've never been to one before.

158
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,490
It's been a while since I saw a movie too.

159
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,510
How long has it been?

160
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,300
The last movie I saw was
the "Avatar" in 2009.

161
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,130
What? "Avatar"?

162
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,270
Yes, the movie with...

163
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,510
blue-skinned natives that inhabit Pandora.

164
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,570
Then this is your 1st movie in 10 years.

165
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,140
I was busy studying and
I'm not interested in movies.

166
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,100
I only watched "Avatar"
because Yeo Reum begged me to.

167
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,570
Yeo Reum?

168
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,240
She's a university friend.

169
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,180
That'll be 22 dollars.

170
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,380
This is the transaction statement
of Professor Jang's wife's account.

171
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,130
Just like you said, 20,000
dollars of cash was deposited.

172
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,860
The source of this money...

173
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,400
That's so cool.

174
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,440
It won't be valid as evidence.

175
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,350
I guess so since the attorney
is trying to serve justice.

176
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,700
No, not that.

177
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,370
I'm talking about the clothes.

178
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,940
Look at how flashy his
secretary's clothes are.

179
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,720
I have many like those, you know.

180
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,820
Can't you let me wear...

181
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,950
colorful outfits too?

182
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,760
I never said you couldn't.

183
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,910
You told me off, remember?

184
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,130
You said that I wasn't wearing
appropriate attire for the office.

185
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,080
That's because you looked
uncomfortable in it.

186
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,760
The color doesn't matter.

187
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,260
Really?

188
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,950
Then can I wear something in pink?

189
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,290
- You can.
- Yes!

190
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,760
I thought you were here to
study the movie though.

191
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,000
By the looks of it,
you could've watched it alone,

192
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,190
so why did you ask me to come?

193
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,920
Oh, that's...

194
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,130
Well, I wanted to ask you questions...

195
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,630
if something I didn't know came up.

196
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,920
I see.

197
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,180
Like this, for example.

198
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,410
What about that previous scene?

199
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,940
Is it against the law...

200
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,480
for a superior at the office to
excessively tell employees...

201
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,100
what and what not to wear?

202
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,710
According to the Labor Standards Act,

203
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,750
it is allowed if it affects the
particular work that is done.

204
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,090
It must be reasonable though.

205
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,180
If not, it'll be a violation of one's...

206
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,330
right to pursue happiness
and the right to free will.

207
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,620
I see.

208
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,000
See? I couldn't have asked
that had you not been here.

209
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,020
You're right.

210
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,240
Ask me anything you want to know then.

211
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,730
Another one?

212
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,300
I wasn't trying to hold hands.
Please believe me.

213
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,550
I'm not the kind of woman who
takes advantage of the dark.

214
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,310
Sure, I believe you.

215
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,490
Don't you worry.

216
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,660
Right.

217
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,370
Oh, there's something
else I wanted to know.

218
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,060
Just like now, I wanted
to lean on this armrest.

219
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,650
You also wanted to which is why you were...

220
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,070
leaning on it first.

221
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,680
What if this happens at a theater?

222
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,990
Who has the right to this armrest?

223
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,810
The law can't define all rules of society.

224
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,020
That's why we have good faith
and normal social rules.

225
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,420
It tells us to act
according to common sense.

226
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,620
I see.

227
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,080
It seems like you know everything
when it comes to the law.

228
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,530
Well, I'm an attorney.

229
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,100
Right. That you are.

230
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,200
Thank you.

231
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,130
What is it?

232
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,670
Who's that?

233
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,110
Earlier, a woman came up to you...

234
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,450
to talk.

235
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,100
What was it about?

236
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,400
Did she ask for directions?

237
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,980
No, she asked for my number.

238
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,370
So? Did you give it to her?

239
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,860
I didn't.

240
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,000
For something that should've been short,

241
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,300
you talked for quite a while.

242
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,790
I declined, so she asked
if I had a girlfriend.

243
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,940
I said that I was single,

244
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,990
so she asked why I couldn't
give her my number.

245
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,680
I explained to her that...

246
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,420
me being single and me not
giving her my number...

247
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,320
had no correlation at all.

248
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,910
That's why it took so long.

249
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,550
Why are you laughing?

250
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,710
You just seem to have...

251
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,810
a thick wall up with women.

252
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,470
Why are you looking at me like that?

253
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,290
I've never seen you smile so brightly.

254
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,060
Why do you look so serious again?

255
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,550
Smile like you did just now.

256
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,890
It was so nice when you just smiled.
Come on.

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,870
I'll smile when I want to.

258
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,360
Thank you for the ride.

259
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,730
No problem. I'll see you on Monday.

260
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,430
(Drive-in Theater Ticket)

261
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,150
You watched a movie, didn't you? With who?

262
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,370
It's none of your business.

263
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,330
Why not? I'm dying to know.

264
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,220
The last thing I expected was
to see you in a relationship.

265
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,900
- I'm not in a relationship.
- I doubt that.

266
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,530
It's obvious if a guy like you who
never watches movies does this.

267
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,370
I'm telling you, it's not like that.

268
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,790
- I met her to study.
- What? Study?

269
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,590
My secretary wanted to study up on the law.

270
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,360
We just watched a movie about
the law, in order to study.

271
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,140
Do you think that makes sense?

272
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,890
Do you think it makes sense for
you to keep living in my house?

273
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,140
Isn't it time you leave now?

274
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,390
Fine, then. I won't pry anymore.

275
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,750
Get some rest then.

276
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,520
The man who watched a movie to study law,

277
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,650
Mr. Kwon Jung Rok.

278
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,990
Goodness.

279
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,510
Mr. Kwon, thank you so
much for making time...

280
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,870
to tutor me today.

281
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,510
Good night.

282
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,250
(New Message)

283
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,640
Sweet dreams, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

284
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,510
Get off. I'm going to break this window.

285
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,370
You can talk to me from now on.

286
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,720
I am her attorney.

287
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,210
Gosh. Why on earth did
he help me back then?

288
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,080
Why, why?

289
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,410
Because he was worried about me?

290
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,940
You did well.

291
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,770
You did well, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

292
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,930
He could've just handed me back my scarf.

293
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,630
Why did he put it around my neck?

294
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,430
Why, why?

295
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,330
Why did he smile so brightly?

296
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,850
Maybe he can't help but smile
whenever he looks at me.

297
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,530
Gosh, I can't believe it.

298
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,400
Why? Why did he smile like that?

299
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,530
(Merian Law Town Building)

300
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,090
Good morning, Mr. Kwon.

301
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,860
- Your suit looks so great...
- Well, well.

302
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,070
Hi there, Yun Seo.

303
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,300
- Good morning.
- Hello.

304
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,890
Yun Seo, the elevator
tends to get crowded...

305
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,100
- in the morning. Is that okay?
- Sorry?

306
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,420
I'm concerned other people
might recognize you.

307
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,900
Oh, gosh. Can you recognize me?

308
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,190
Of course I...

309
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,720
Am I the only one?

310
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,130
I can even recognize you when
you're wearing a niqab. Why?

311
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,760
Because I'm the devoted...

312
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,670
CEO of your company.

313
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,950
I'm impressed, Mr. Yeon.

314
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,500
Do you wait for me every day
in front of the elevator?

315
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,320
It seems we meet in here every time.

316
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,380
You're right.

317
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,100
We always meet in the elevator.

318
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,650
That is truly strange.

319
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,690
This is what you call fate.

320
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,980
Me, you...

321
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,790
and Yun Seo.

322
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,260
Fate.

323
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,020
Don't you think, Yun Seo?

324
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,890
- I guess so.
- Right?

325
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,160
Excuse me.

326
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,170
Yes? Producer Lee?

327
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,970
He's a producer from the
broadcasting station.

328
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,470
One more person?

329
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,060
What is this urgent meeting about?

330
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,890
It's nothing much.

331
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,470
We received a request to
appear on a TV program.

332
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,210
And the request came to me personally.

333
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,080
What program is it?

334
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,400
It's a discussion about the
fourth industrial revolution.

335
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,170
They want to hear what we think...

336
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,170
from an attorney's perspective.

337
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,430
I thought about doing it myself,
but it makes me uncomfortable.

338
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,880
You all know that I'm not
interested at all in...

339
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,410
receiving attention or
becoming a famous celebrity.

340
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,180
I'm just a man who devotes my best
to the work that's given to me.

341
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,470
You know, right?

342
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,390
But that producer is really begging me.

343
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,370
And this is a good opportunity
to promote our law firm.

344
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,920
I decided to sacrifice myself...

345
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,410
and eventually agreed on
appearing in this program.

346
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,340
You already posted it on
your social media account.

347
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,500
(I'm Yeon Joon Gyu from Always Law Firm.)

348
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,490
Hello. I'm CEO Yeon Joon Gyu
from Always Law Firm.

349
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,430
I've decided to go out on a debate program.

350
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,680
It will air on 9am on February 15.

351
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,760
I hope you all tune in.

352
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,200
Anyway, it's a live show that
will air on 9am tomorrow.

353
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,150
I just received a call from the producer.

354
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,230
He wants one more lawyer
to come out on the show.

355
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,310
One more person. Who should do it?

356
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,190
In my opinion, he must not get
nervous when he talks on TV.

357
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,860
He must have the ability of speech...

358
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,210
and a handsome face appropriate for TV.

359
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,000
I would like to suggest Mr. Kwon.

360
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,120
Right? Mr. Kwon is the
best choice, right? Okay.

361
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,530
Then Mr. Kwon and I will go out
on tomorrow morning's program.

362
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,000
No, I'll have to refuse.

363
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,230
I have a lot of work tomorrow.

364
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,510
If this is the agenda of this
urgent meeting, please excuse me.

365
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,370
Get ready, we have to go to court.

366
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,140
Okay.

367
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,700
How could a man be so cold-hearted?

368
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,980
Even if he refuses, can't he
at least do it with a smile?

369
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,880
You already know that Mr. Kwon
doesn't smile easily.

370
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm not sure about that.

371
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,220
Wouldn't he smile in front of
someone that makes him smile?

372
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,020
He'll probably smile if he's truly happy.

373
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,380
For example...

374
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,200
It's nothing. Excuse me, then.

375
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,550
Anyway, if Mr. Kwon won't do it,
who is our next choice?

376
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,410
Mr. Choi and Ms. Dan,
would you like to volunteer?

377
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,650
- Yes!
- Yes!

378
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,060
- You both want to do it?
- Put your hand down.

379
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,370
Ilegal parking. Pull out.

380
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,150
So the next trial will open in...

381
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,970
- two weeks, right?
- Yes.

382
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,630
- Check the date and location.
- Okay.

383
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,370
Kwon Jung Rok.

384
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,370
Yeo Reum.

385
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,420
Yeo Reum? Oh, I remembered.

386
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,120
- Did you have a trial?
- Yes.

387
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,950
- Did you get off work now?
- Yes.

388
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,150
I'm glad. Do you want to go
grab a coffee somewhere?

389
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,620
Shall we? I have about 30 minutes.

390
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,710
Hello. You must be Ms. Oh.

391
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,960
How do you know me?

392
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,430
I heard about you by coincidence.

393
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,410
Do you want to go for some tea?

394
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,780
Ms. Oh doesn't like crowded places.

395
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,430
No, I'm fine. I'll join you.

396
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,780
- Thank you.
- No problem.

397
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,540
Please excuse me then.

398
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,200
Ms. Oh and I will have americano,

399
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,160
and you'll have a coffee mix, right?

400
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,160
Your taste is still like a kid.
You only drink sweet coffee.

401
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,050
I don't understand people
who like bitter coffee.

402
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,960
The taste of a kid?

403
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,530
You didn't know?

404
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,290
He can't drink anything else
besides sweet instant coffee.

405
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,390
Not only that, his taste for food...

406
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,570
That's enough.

407
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,800
Okay, then.

408
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,080
I'm sorry for bringing you
to a place like this.

409
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,890
This is the only place I know
where we won't stand out...

410
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,310
and can talk quietly.

411
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,860
Don't worry about it. I'm okay.

412
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,260
Any location is okay for me.

413
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,060
Actually, I know who you are.

414
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,290
You're Oh Yun Seo, right?

415
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,580
- No way.
- I didn't tell her.

416
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,620
Mr. Choi Yun Hyuk told me.
We bumped into each other recently.

417
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,270
I see.

418
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,580
How is your work as a secretary?

419
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,440
Jung Rok is a bit cranky,
and he'll give you a hard time.

420
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,770
- Well...
- Why am I cranky?

421
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,070
Why?

422
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,110
You don't know how blunt you are.

423
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,500
Sometimes, you really tire people out.

424
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,860
- I do?
- Yes.

425
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,150
You two must be really close.

426
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,510
We hung out together since college.

427
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,160
Just the two of you?

428
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,200
There's one more.

429
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,100
A guy named Kim Se Won was
in the group as well.

430
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,930
Kim Se Won?

431
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,370
We should all meet up one day.
You can't avoid him forever.

432
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,940
We're both really busy.

433
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,320
You and I should meet
up for a meal one day.

434
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,120
It's been a while since
we last ate together.

435
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,390
Sure, I'd love to.

436
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,150
Am I going to get moved by you again?

437
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,160
- We keep leaving her out.
- Why is he smiling?

438
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,010
You should join us the
next time we eat together.

439
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,560
Well... Sure. We'll see.

440
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,300
Why aren't you wearing a scarf today?
Aren't you cold?

441
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,380
No, it's not that cold today.

442
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,020
I guess you're not very
sensitive to cold temperatures.

443
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,380
No, I'm not. That's why I like winter.

444
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,900
Are you sure you don't like summer?

445
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,980
What?

446
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,110
Never mind.

447
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,760
By the way, please check the
document I asked you to by 5pm.

448
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,720
No, I'm going to finish it by 5:10pm.

449
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,020
I'm a little tired.

450
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,430
By the way, Mr. Kwon.

451
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,690
Why do you smile so much?

452
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,650
No one's ever said that to me before.

453
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,900
Plus, a few days ago, you told me
that I look better when I smile.

454
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,560
There's always an adequate
amount to everything.

455
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,250
And now that I look at you,
it doesn't look nice when you smile.

456
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,760
I just told you to stop smiling.

457
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,510
Gosh, what's wrong with her?

458
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,580
The pasta restaurant you
recommended was really nice.

459
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,680
I should go there again
with other colleagues.

460
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,930
If you tell everyone,
it'll no longer be special.

461
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,270
Is that how it works?

462
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,460
By the way, how are things
with Prosecutor Kim?

463
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,770
What do you mean?

464
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,100
He's like an idol star around here.

465
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,770
So many female employees
ended up in tears...

466
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,070
when he got appointed to the
Chuncheon office two years ago.

467
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,040
By the way, do you think Prosecutor Kim...

468
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,350
has a girlfriend?

469
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,940
No, he broke up two years ago.

470
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,160
How do you know that?

471
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,890
He dated Prosecutor Yoo.
Everyone knew about them.

472
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,500
He dated Prosecutor Yoo?

473
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,450
Yes, they dated for about seven years.

474
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,960
But they broke up two years go.
They broke up for good.

475
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,600
Why?

476
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,270
I'm not sure.

477
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,460
I heard Prosecutor Yoo
has a nasty personality.

478
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,680
Maybe that's why they broke up.

479
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,250
Prosecutor Yoo.

480
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,070
Why are you so tense?

481
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,490
Are you scared I might do something
to you because of my nasty temper?

482
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,160
I'm sorry.

483
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,830
But it's true.

484
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,720
- Jeong Mi.
- Yes?

485
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,160
You should take me to
that pasta restaurant.

486
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,500
If something's good, you should share it.

487
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,710
She startled me so much.

488
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,320
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

489
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,170
- I'm fine.
- I heard...

490
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,070
you and Prosecutor Yoo graduated
from the same college.

491
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,040
Yes.

492
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,070
I heard you two used to
be friends in the past.

493
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,260
Yes. But I'm planning on becoming
friends with her again...

494
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,780
in the present.

495
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:45,190
Why? You know that a broken dish
becomes useless even if you try...

496
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,490
to put it back together.

497
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,520
It's just how I am.

498
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,210
I can't stand seeing things...

499
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,060
that are broken.

500
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,850
Then I guess I should get broken too.

501
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,940
What?

502
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,270
No, it's nothing.

503
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,150
Thank you.

504
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,900
Gosh, who am I going to
choose for the show?

505
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,560
I don't know whom I should
choose between the two of you.

506
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,020
What do you all think?
Who do you think I should choose?

507
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,560
I think Ms. Dan would be better.

508
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,790
You're a man, so it'd be nice
to have a female partner.

509
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,660
I'm not sure. It's not
a family variety show.

510
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,280
Why would we need to choose
1 male and 1 female?

511
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,930
I think Mr. Choi would be a better choice.

512
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,190
He talks eloquently,

513
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,330
and I think he'll feel
less nervous than Ms. Dan.

514
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,930
I...

515
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,120
wholeheartedly agree with Secretary Yang.

516
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,860
I respect the two of you for
having such great taste.

517
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,290
Wait a minute.

518
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,930
So you two think Mr. Choi would
be a better choice, right?

519
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,480
But I think Ms. Dan would be
better since she's really calm.

520
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,590
So that means you and
I think Ms. Dan would be better.

521
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,250
Then it's 2 against 2. It's a tie.

522
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,410
My gosh.

523
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,070
I personally think...

524
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,180
Ms. Dan...

525
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,050
Just a second. I'm getting a call.

526
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,590
Hell, Prosecutor Park.

527
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,530
I was going to call you soon.

528
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,010
Why can't you just let me do it?

529
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,930
I'm sorry, but I really
want to do this as well.

530
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,700
You must really want to appear on TV.

531
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,430
You're so introverted, so I thought
you wouldn't like stuff like that.

532
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,540
I haven't had a lot of clients lately,

533
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,210
so I'm hoping the TV show will
help me make a breakthrough.

534
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
- A breakthrough?
- Everything does well...

535
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,090
once they air on TV including
restaurants and tourist attractions.

536
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,710
I also want to become a popular
attorney and the ace of this firm.

537
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,070
Mr. Yeon always nags at
me about my performance,

538
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,030
and it's really suffocating.

539
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,930
He's right there.

540
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,140
I personally think you
should yield this chance...

541
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,560
to Mr. Choi.

542
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,480
I don't want to suffocate
you during the show.

543
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,680
Ms. Dan, I'm disappointed in you.

544
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,510
I didn't think you'd be the type
to talk behind people's backs.

545
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,840
Mr. Yeon, you've got it all wrong.

546
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,460
Remember how I voted for you earlier?

547
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,600
I'm going to take that back.
I can do that, right?

548
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,430
Then that means Mr. Choi got three votes...

549
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,290
- and Ms. Dan got 1 vote.
- 1 vote.

550
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,150
Let's have fun on the show tomorrow.

551
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,810
I respect you for making a
rational decision, sir.

552
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,330
Mom, don't get shocked. The thing is,

553
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,830
I'll be appearing on TV!
It's a debate show!

554
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,650
I'm so happy!

555
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,150
Mom, why aren't you saying anything?

556
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,670
Mom, are you crying?

557
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,970
Don't cry.

558
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,250
You're making me tear up as well.

559
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,650
Yes, Mother.

560
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,650
I'll talk to you at home.

561
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,790
You seem very happy.

562
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,090
What do you mean?

563
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,660
A colleague's grief is as good as mine.

564
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,890
How am I supposed to convert
this into a pdf file?

565
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,980
He told me I'll be able to find
everything in this notebook.

566
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,640
(Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum)

567
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,140
Five stars?

568
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,770
Is she a stone bed or what?

569
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,220
She must be someone really important.

570
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,770
Shouldn't you go home?
It's way past working hours.

571
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,580
Going home at the right time must
be really important for you.

572
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,960
There are so many things
that are important to you.

573
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,930
You have so many important issues...

574
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,870
and so many important people.

575
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,390
- What do you mean?
- I'm going to go home now.

576
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,810
All I did was tell her to go home
because it was past working hours.

577
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,110
Isn't it absurd?

578
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,660
Why would they talk to themselves...

579
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,740
when I'm sitting right there?
It's just so rude.

580
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,830
Mr. Kwon's weird as well.

581
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,370
He's always so strict and
cold when he's at the office,

582
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,700
but he couldn't stop smiling
when he was with Yoo Yeo Reum.

583
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,790
The way he kept smiling at
her made me get so annoyed.

584
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,830
Hey, Yun Seo.

585
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,100
Right? Isn't it so annoying?
You totally agree with me, right?

586
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,400
No, that's not what I meant.

587
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,420
I'm just asking you this out of curiosity.

588
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,240
Do you like him?

589
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,530
That's absurd. What are you talking about?

590
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,960
I mean, to be honest,
I didn't think much of it...

591
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,250
when you told me...

592
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,060
that you were planning to study
with him on the weekend.

593
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,980
But when I thought about it again,
I thought something was weird.

594
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,030
I just brushed it off,

595
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,430
but the way you're acting right now...

596
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,900
Yes? What about it?

597
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,740
It looks like you're jealous.

598
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,560
What? Jealous?

599
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,090
I like him? I'm jealous?

600
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,430
Why would he think of something so absurd?

601
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,440
I should be careful before anyone
starts getting the wrong idea.

602
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,350
Unbelievable.

603
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,600
("Morning Debate")

604
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,960
Is the show starting?

605
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,810
- Who cares what he does?
- Good morning!

606
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,960
Good morning.

607
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,970
Why are you all gathered here?

608
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,350
Mr. Yeon and Mr. Choi are on
a live debate show today.

609
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,970
We're waiting to watch it live.

610
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,670
Is Mr. Kwon not at work yet?

611
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,530
He's normally at the office before hours.

612
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,880
Is something up?

613
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,530
I'm not sure.

614
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,210
I don't know why he's not here yet.

615
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,440
It's not like I'm interested
in Mr. Kwon or anything.

616
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,490
You should be though. You're his secretary.

617
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,900
Oh, right.

618
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,370
He said that he was meeting
with a client first.

619
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,670
It's on!

620
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,350
Hello, viewers.

621
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,030
I am Han Seok Gyu of "Morning Debate".

622
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,830
- Today...
- I don't see Mr. Choi though.

623
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,910
You're right. Where is he?

624
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,610
- I'm right here.
- They are here with us today.

625
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,000
Hello.

626
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,190
What happened?

627
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,440
Are you skipping the show?

628
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,730
The call came in this morning...

629
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,370
that having 4 on the panel with 2
of them being lawyers is overkill.

630
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,530
They just asked for Mr. Yeon
as originally planned.

631
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,220
Enjoy the show then.

632
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,210
Although, I doubt it'd
be fun without me in it.

633
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,410
He was excited to be on the show.

634
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,870
It's too bad.

635
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,930
I'm sure that Mr. Yeon will
make up for his absence.

636
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,170
Let's hear from Mr. Yeon Joon Gyu
of Always Law Firm.

637
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,630
Mr. Yeon.

638
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,740
The legal community can't
just sit on its hands though.

639
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,710
It's well known that AI attorneys are...

640
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,000
already trending in America.

641
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,140
From what I hear, Korea's first...

642
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,910
AI attorney was introduced last year.

643
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,440
What do you think?

644
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,890
I'm guessing it'll prompt some
changes in the community.

645
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,720
Of course.

646
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,750
- I see.
- Right.

647
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,560
That's right.

648
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,540
Klaus Schwab, the advocate of the
fourth industrial revolution,

649
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,650
said that the merging of
technology such as...

650
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:15,790
bio, digital industry, physics,
and others which are...

651
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,630
based on the third industrial
revolution will drastically...

652
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,970
alter society and economic structure.

653
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,670
That was his definition of the revolution.

654
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,310
Please comment on that.

655
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,290
Of course. That's right.

656
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,550
That's true.

657
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,120
- Should we hear from others?
- That we should.

658
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,000
All right then. We'll hear from...

659
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,490
"Of course. That's right. That's true."

660
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,000
Is that all he said?

661
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,690
He's a disgrace to this firm.

662
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,530
This is all because of you, Mom.

663
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,350
I said I didn't want the seaweed soup.

664
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,750
Because of it, my stint
on the show was canceled!

665
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,520
You know nothing, Mom.

666
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,620
Yes, Mother. I'll call you later.

667
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,280
What is it?

668
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,330
I came to give this back.

669
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,780
Thank you.

670
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,960
You must be delighted...

671
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,990
that I was cut from the show.

672
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,090
Of course I'm not.

673
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,640
A colleague's grief is as good as mine.

674
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,390
Then, hang in there.

675
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,590
Hello.

676
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,000
Is Attorney Kwon Jung Rok here?

677
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,940
Do you have an appointment?

678
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,210
What's your name?

679
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,350
I'm just here for a consult.

680
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,090
I thought he could help me out.

681
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,240
You see,

682
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,250
I read this article.

683
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,960
("The Violation of One's Right
to a Peaceful Private Life")

684
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,020
This was written by Mr. Kwon,

685
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,270
- but you need an appointment...
- I'm Kwon Jung Rok.

686
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,690
How can I help you?

687
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,880
I...

688
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,290
I'm... I'm here because...

689
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,980
Thank you.

690
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,100
I'm sorry,

691
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,260
but can your secretary sit with us as well?

692
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,470
- Me?
- Yes.

693
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,730
I'm not in a stable state,

694
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,500
so it'll be better if a female was present.

695
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,730
- Sure. have a seat.
- All right then.

696
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,830
I don't know if I'll be of help but...

697
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:13,880
Thank you.

698
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,040
Please relax and tell me your story.

699
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,870
I think...

700
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,870
my ex-boyfriend is stalking me.

701
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,680
I'm suffering, but I don't know what to do.

702
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,850
Then I read the article you wrote...

703
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,140
and thought that you could have a solution.

704
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,480
Could you tell me more in detail?

705
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,650
I dated him for about a year.

706
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,120
I wonder what'll be better.

707
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,450
This one's cute.

708
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,450
(Character-themed humidifier)

709
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,350
I wasn't expecting any gifts.

710
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,560
- The first few months were great.
- A humidifier?

711
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,690
I really needed this. My gosh!

712
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,560
- Really?
- He was sweet.

713
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,100
- I'm glad.
- He was attentive...

714
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,530
- and very good to me.
- I'd love some pasta.

715
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,250
I can't believe you booked this place.

716
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,710
I was craving pasta since last night.

717
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,190
Really?

718
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,380
The telepathy between us must be strong.

719
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,700
- Right?
- Right.

720
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,780
- Dig in then.
- It looks delicious.

721
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,430
At first, I thought we
had a lot in common...

722
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,240
and that I had met my soulmate.

723
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,920
However, it turns out that...

724
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,450
Would you like a glass of wine?

725
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,090
Will you pass out after
just one glass again?

726
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,940
You're great except for the fact
that you can't hold your alcohol.

727
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,970
Maybe you tolerate it too well.

728
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:03,590
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

729
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,790
Whenever I got drunk,

730
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,350
he browsed through my phone
without permission.

731
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,220
My search history,

732
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,460
my frequently visited sites,

733
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,440
and even the texts between
me and my friends.

734
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,400
So I broke up with him and called it quits.

735
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,700
You're home.

736
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,310
I was cooking dinner for you.

737
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,810
Have you forgotten? We broke up.

738
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,040
This again?

739
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,170
Come on in. Dinner will be good.

740
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,990
You should've changed the
combination code of your door.

741
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,000
I did,

742
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:18,540
but he figured out the new one every time.

743
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,010
That's why...

744
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,890
I'd like to ask for a restraining order.

745
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,320
Is that possible?

746
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,910
Of course it's possible. Right, Mr. Kwon?

747
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,710
I'm not sure.

748
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,430
What you told me might not be enough for...

749
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,960
an injunction of a restraining order.

750
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,570
The opposing side will argue...

751
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,740
that there were no
physical or verbal abuse.

752
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,870
They'll just try to regard
it as an ex-boyfriend who...

753
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,060
still misses his girlfriend.

754
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,030
That's insane!

755
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:50,420
There are other forms of abuse, you know.

756
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,410
He watches her every move...

757
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,450
and enters her house without permission.

758
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,690
How can there be no law to prevent that?

759
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,980
Still, it's true you need
more circumstantial evidence.

760
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,470
Seung Hee, didn't you say you
have a high alcohol tolerance?

761
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,690
Why do you get drunk first
whenever you drink with him?

762
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:16,930
He put...

763
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,880
a drug in my drink when I wasn't looking.

764
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,230
What?

765
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:26,440
A drug?

766
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,880
I didn't understand why I fainted
whenever I drank with him.

767
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,260
So the next day, I went to
the hospital for a checkup.

768
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,550
They found substances from a
sleeping pill inside my drink.

769
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,340
He mixed a drug in my drink every time...

770
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,520
I was with him.

771
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,550
Ms. Oh Jin Sim?

772
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:19,990
Ms. Oh Jin Sim?

773
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,890
Yes?

774
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,020
What's wrong, Ms. Yang?

775
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,170
What is the matter with you?

776
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,660
You tried to strangle me.

777
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,280
No. I just wanted to walk with you.

778
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,720
You scared me.

779
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,160
I'm sorry.

780
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:42,300
Ms. Yang, you should walk
along the main road.

781
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,450
Don't go into tunnels like that.

782
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,540
That's a shortcut.

783
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,610
That's grass.

784
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,960
Gosh, it really is.

785
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,490
It must be so cold in winter.
It's amazing it still survived.

786
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,300
Like us waiting for the bus, that grass...

787
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,550
may be waiting for a bus named Spring.

788
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,770
Hey, the bus is coming.

789
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,530
Are you getting on too?

790
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,560
Sure.

791
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,770
This stop is Seoul University.

792
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,930
- Ms. Yang? Ms. Yang.
- The next stop is...

793
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:13,400
- We're all here.
- Oh, my.

794
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,010
I'm always grateful.

795
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,490
If it weren't for you, I would've
got off at the last station again.

796
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,640
I hope you go home safely.

797
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,380
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

798
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,480
The CEO of Giant Foods,
Mr. Jung Ji Ho, who has been...

799
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,180
indicted on charges of
illegal gambling abroad,

800
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,300
announced he will appear for
questioning tomorrow morning.

801
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,950
Giant Foods is about to be
listed in the KOSPI market soon,

802
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,020
- and claimed that...
- You came home early.

803
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,460
- Hey, you're home.
- this incident...

804
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,020
- is the CEO's personal issue,
- What are you watching?

805
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,960
and irrelevant to the
management of the company.

806
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,630
- Jung Ji Ho?
- They are drawing lines.

807
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,340
However, if Giant Foods is
listed in the stock market...

808
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:14,310
Do you know how much Choi Yoon Su
gets for defending Jung Ji Ho?

809
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,900
Including a contingency
fee, five million dollars.

810
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,330
Mr. Choi must be happy, being paid
that much for an attorney fee.

811
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,230
He's famous for doing the
dirty work for conglomerates.

812
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,770
He received a huge attorney fee
for the Lee Gang Joon case too.

813
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,140
Lee Gang Joon?

814
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,010
You don't know him?

815
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,690
He's the vice president of Jeguk Group.

816
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,620
A few years ago, he got caught up
in a drug scandal with an actress.

817
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,620
Oh Yun Seo, was it?

818
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,740
You don't know him?

819
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,390
He's the vice president of Jeguk Group.

820
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,480
A few years ago, he got caught up
in a drug scandal with an actress.

821
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,280
Oh Yun Seo, was it?

822
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,120
- Oh Yun Seo?
- Yes.

823
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,440
But I heard about that
scandal from a co-worker.

824
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,930
Lee Gang Joon stalked Oh Yun Seo,

825
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,960
and when she rejected him,

826
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:10,330
he called her out to a drug party
to frame her and get revenge.

827
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,590
But since he's such a
rich and influential guy,

828
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,570
everyone tried to cover it up or something.

829
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:20,770
Right. You're not interested
in stories like this, are you?

830
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,800
Hey, Jung Rok.

831
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:29,370
Yes.

832
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,150
What are you thinking about?

833
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,310
It's nothing.

839

I'm curious of her relationship
with the son of a conglomerate CEO.

840
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:07,430
It's a fact that she was at the scene.

He mixed a drug in my drink every time...

842
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:12,490
I was with him.

843

What? You want me to stop
investigating Seung Hee's case?

844
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,410
What do you mean?

845
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,360
The car accident case I mentioned
last time seems more urgent.

846
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,650
I think it would be better if
you look up precedent cases.

847
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,640
You told me to do that by next week.

848
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,830
Wait a minute. Is this
because you don't trust me?

849
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,660
Because I won't be helpful?

850
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,670
- It's not that.
- But she...

851
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,580
trusted me and told us her story.

852
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,920
I want to do whatever it takes to help her.

853
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,610
She called me earlier,
saying she'll give me...

854

the CCTV footage of him
coming inside the building.

855
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,100
So I told her I'd go near her
home to get it from her.

856
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,440
Trust me...

857
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,390
and leave it up to me. Okay?

858
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,580
I'll take that as a yes then.

859
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,390
I should've went to the law firm instead.

860
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,910
It's okay.

861
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:38,000
I know you have a lot on your mind.

862
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:39,910

Then, I'll wait for you here.

868
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:58,690
You should come with me. It's cold outside.

869
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,870
- Should I?
- Yes.

870
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:10,600
Just a second. I'll bring the USB.

I really don't think I
can break up with you.

- Stay still. I just want to talk.
- Hey!

You should stop.

00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,920
I love you way too much.
I can't break up with you.

880
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,120
- Will you please talk to me?
- Please stop!

881
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,350
My gosh, get off!

882
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,280
Didn't I tell you to stay still?
You little...

883
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,050
Who are you?

884
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,240
(Trustworthy Police, Police for the People)

885
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,830
How did it go?

886
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,770
Are you sure I don't need to testify?

887
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:40,420
Yes, I'm sure. I got investigated
as her substitute and witness.

888
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,600
By the way, it turns out the
CCTV in front of her house...

889
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,450
was installed by her ex-boyfriend.

890
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,990
That's how he was able to
find out her new passcode...

891
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,510
every time she changed it.

892
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:55,120
The police arrested him for
illegal video filming...

893
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,240
and breaking and entering.

894
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:00,110
So I think he'll be given
a restraining order.

895
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,750
That's a relief.

896
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:09,360
By the way, how did you suddenly show up?

897
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,880
I went there to check her place...

898
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,710
and hear more about the evidence she had,

899
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,920
but I suddenly heard you scream.

900
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,700
- Are you okay?
- Pardon?

901
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,640
You seemed pretty shocked earlier.

902
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,620
I'm okay now.

903
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,840
Does that mean everything's okay now?

904
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,360
Once we file a restraining
order against him,

905
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,550
he won't be able to show up again, right?

906
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,170
That's right. You don't need to worry.

907
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,800
Stealing someone's privacy...

908
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,320
and forcing one's feelings
on someone else...

909
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,840
is clearly a wrong thing to do.

910
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,360
So the person who did that
should be the one to suffer.

911
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,830
The victim shouldn't be the
one having a hard time.

912
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:08,470
So stop suffering,
forget about all the bad memories,

913
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,430
and live a happy life...

914
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,310
for your own sake. Do you understand?

915
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,320
Why are you saying that to me?

916
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,220
No, it's nothing.

917
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,440
Mr. Kwon, you have a scar on your neck.

918
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,780
My gosh.

919
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,200
I'm really okay.

920
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,340
I'm not.

921
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,290
In a way, you got hurt because of me.

922
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,480
It'll make me feel uneasy...

923
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,810
if you don't get that
scar treated properly.

924
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,920
Then I'll do it myself.

925
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,880
I even took on a lead role
of a medical drama once.

926
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,180
Did you watch it by any chance?

927
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,980
It was called "The Sensitive Doctor".

928
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,350
No, I didn't.

929
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:11,920
Of course, you didn't.

930
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:16,450
Anyway, I was the best surgeon
in the nation in that drama.

931
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:19,830
Does that have anything to do...

932
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,080
with how you're going to disinfect
my scar and apply ointment on it?

933
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,260
Of course.

934
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:27,220
I'll show you how good I
am at disinfecting scars.

935
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,590
If you feel uncomfortable, you
can apply the ointment yourself.

936
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:59,630
No.

937
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,300
You can do it for me.

938
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,830
You said you were
a surgeon in a drama once.

939
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,770
Okay.

951
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:44,110
You don't want it to get disinfected,

952
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,550
so make sure you apply ointment
on it tomorrow morning.

953

And don't forget to do the same
in the afternoon and evening.

It's just that you got hurt because of me,

956

so I feel responsible for that scar.

957
