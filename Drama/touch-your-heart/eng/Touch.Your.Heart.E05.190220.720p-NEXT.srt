00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,190
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,830
Who is it this early in the morning?

3
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,100
I'm meeting a client,
so I'll be an hour late today.

4
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,050
Okay, noted.

5
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,280
It's chilly today, so bundle up.

6
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,990
Did I go too far?

7
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,420
(You should bundle up too.)

8
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,570
You should bundle up too.

9
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,130
He emphasized that I
should bundle up today,

10
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,600
so that is what I'll do.

11
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,220
Pink is always right.

12
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,000
It's so pretty.

13
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,060
The doors are closing.

14
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,160
Wait a second! Gosh, thank you.

15
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,170
Oh, it's you, Mr. Kwon.

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,140
The doors are closing.

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,410
Like always, I meet you in the elevator...

18
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,060
even though I'm coming in an hour
late after meeting a client.

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,180
Anyone who hears you might assume that...

20
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,980
I wait for you at the
elevator every morning.

21
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,340
I'm coming in late
because of a meeting too.

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,260
- By the way, I have good news.
- I don't want to know.

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,820
I've never been delighted by
your so-called good news before.

24
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,100
It's for real this time.

25
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,540
I have two incredibly exciting news.

26
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,700
Which would you like to hear first?

27
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,940
One's only slightly good while
the other is a true delight.

28
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,520
Okay, we men should play on a large scale,

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,330
so I'll start with the big news.

30
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,780
Always Law Firm...

31
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,710
might take on a big case.

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,830
I'm 99 percent certain. Once we take it on,

33
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,250
we'll be at the center of attention.

34
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,630
What's the case?

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,530
That's a secret.

36
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,840
I'll move onto the small news now.

37
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,050
The firm's going out to dinner today.

38
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,010
Mr. Kwon! Why aren't you answering me?

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,150
We're all going out for dinner.

40
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,550
I will not be attending.

41
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,510
You never do.

42
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,510
Why can't you enjoy the fun
when it's brought to your lap?

43
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,930
Sorry for being late.

44
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,050
Good morning.

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,270
What's all this?

46
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,700
Aren't they pretty?

47
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,640
Spring is right around the corner,

48
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,370
so I decorated my desk
in the shade of pink.

49
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,470
It may be spring soon,
but a law firm office...

50
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,880
shouldn't be pink.

51
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,830
Are you saying that this isn't allowed?

52
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,380
Are you aware that you're
in violation of...

53
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,220
one's right to pursue happiness
and the right to free will?

54
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,690
How did you know that?

55
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,980
You said so at the drive-in theater.

56
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,320
I have a good memory,
so I recall everything.

57
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,790
All right then. Do as you wish.

58
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,810
What's all this?

59
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,940
I thought it was rude
to only revamp my desk.

60
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,320
Still, I prefer black to pink.

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,810
Even though you're fond of black,

62
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,230
a splash of pink here and there...

63
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,760
will elevate your mood.

64
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,070
My right to pursue happiness
and the right to free will...

65
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,280
should be assured too.

66
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,480
All right. I'll get rid of them.

67
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,830
A strawberry?

68
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,070
Wait.

69
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,990
- Take these too.
- Keep those at least.

70
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,160
When I'm not in my seat, you can write...

71
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,330
notes for me and stick them on my desk.

72
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,560
That way, we won't forget.

73
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,320
Then...

74
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,990
Right.

75
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,930
What?

76
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,670
Yes.

77
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,240
I'll send the content
certification right away.

78
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,680

Hi, is this Thunder Express?

118
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,350
This is Dan Moon Hee of Always Law Firm.

119
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,170
That's right.

120
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,450
I need a parcel delivered by courier.

121
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,340
Sure, I'll be waiting.

122
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,390
I wonder what he thinks of me.

123
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,900
Does he like me?

124
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,690
Does he not?

125
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,060
Does he like me or does he not?
Likes me or not.

126
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,180
- He...
- He likes you!

127
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,130
I'm sure that he likes you too.

128
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,660
I've seen people tell
fortunes with petals before,

129
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,470
but not with tangerines.

130
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,890
It's a first for me too.

131
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,210
I just don't know what he thinks of me.

132
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,500
What is he like?

133
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,120
Is it still just a one-sided love?

134
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,900
I'm not sure.

135
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,700
I do think that he's interested in me too.

136
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,250
Would you like to hear me out?

137
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,020
Sure, I'm curious to know.

138
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,980
He works at the courier service
our law firm often calls.

139
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,620
His tone changes when only addressing me.

140
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,590
He keeps his voice low with others,

141
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,700
but takes on a higher tone with me.

142
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,260
He must be thrilled to see me, right?

143
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,830
That's not all though.
The company gives out a key ring...

144
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,470
after five deliveries,

145
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,360
but even though I only called
the service four times,

146
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,720
I was given this key ring for free.

147
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,430
We all wish to go all out
for the ones we love.

148
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,080
It's pretty.

149
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,450
He must truly be into you.

150
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,870
Really?

151
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,450
You're a woman with a lot
of relationship experience,

152
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,360
so your words seem trustworthy.

153
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,430
I actually haven't dated much.

154
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,740
Oh, right. I read it in an interview.

155
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,020
You've never had a boyfriend before.

156
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,340
I may not be experienced
with romantic relationships,

157
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,960
but I give out great advice.

158
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,370
Don't you remember?
I hosted that TV dating show.

159
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,600
From what I can tell,

160
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,680
this is for sure.

161
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,030
My gosh! Nice!

162
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,710
- It's a secret though.
- Sure.

163
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,630
My gosh. She must really like him.

164
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,800
Do tangerines actually work though?

165
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,620
Maybe I should try it too.

166
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,970
He likes me.

167
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,780
He likes me not.

168
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,580
He likes me,

169
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,390
he likes me not...

170
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,710
(He likes me, he likes me not,
he likes me, he likes me not...)

171
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,880
He likes me!

172
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,610
Ms. Oh, it's time to go to the trial.

173
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,950
Okay. I'm on my way.

174
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,330
After questioning the witness,
the defendant's alibi...

175
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,510
and the fact that he was not at the
scene has been proved clearly.

176
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,110
Therefore, I request you to...

177
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,930
sentence him as not guilty.

178
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,550
Mr. Kwon, it seems like
we'll win the trial, right?

179
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,870
Yes, maybe we will.

180
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,980
Come on, stop being so modest.

181
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,590
From the smile on your face,
it seems like you're confident.

182
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,500
You get so happy whenever you win.
You're a natural-born attorney.

183
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,120
By the way, why did you become an attorney?

184
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,930
I heard that your friends from
college all became prosecutors.

185
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,070
Attorneys make more money.

186
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,420
What? He became an attorney
because of money?

187
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,100
He's even a sincere guy.

188
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,380
The more I get to know him,
the more charming he seems.

189
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,610
It's almost time for lunch.
Why don't we go eat something?

190
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,440
Sure.

191
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,210
Wait. Oh, right.

192
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,130
What if she wants to drink coffee again?

193
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,250
No. Since it's lunch time,
she might want to have lunch together.

194
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,490
Aren't you coming?

195
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,300
I'm coming. Come on, let's go! Hurry!

196
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,030
Jung Rok.

197
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,520
- A UFO!
- What?

198
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,420
It went that way!

199
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,550
Hurry up. Come on, let's go already.

200
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,720
- Hurry!
- Jung Rok.

201
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,110
Hey.

202
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,130
- Were you here for a trial?
- Yes.

203
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,410
I see you often lately.

204
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,780
So? You don't like it?

205
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,560
You came too, Ms. Oh.

206
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,550
Yes, I did.

207
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,320
If you have time, how about lunch?
Does pasta sound good?

208
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,220
Pasta?

209
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,160
Actually, I have something to tell you.

210
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,660
- Is it important?
- Yes. It's extremely important.

211
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,820
It's also kind of a secret.

212
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,330
I'm sorry, but can you go
back to the office first?

213
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,710
What?

214
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,200
Go back first?

215
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,800
He promised to eat with me first
and just broke it.

216
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,330
Do you know how much I like...

217
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,860
pasta?

218
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,470
So, what is this important
and secret thing about?

219
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,420
- Do you know the Im Yun Hee Case?
- Yes.

220
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,960
I'm in charge of that case.

221
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,780
She was assaulted by her
husband for years...

222
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,950
and while she was being beaten,
she killed her husband with a knife.

223
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,070
Is this murder or self-defense?

224
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,560
What do you think?

225
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,730
But once self-defense
is accepted at a trial,

226
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,350
it becomes a difficult matter
for the prosecutor in charge,

227
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,070
and all the other suspects will
start to claim self-defense.

228
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,980
The attorneys will mention previous cases
and claim self-defense too.

229
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,940
It's a sensitive matter for us.

230
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,340
It's hard to make a clear decision
for situations like this.

231
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,550
I know.

232
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,460
I didn't expect you to give me an answer.

233
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,850
At first, I said I'd take
this case confidently,

234
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,680
but I'm sort of in a pickle.

235
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,300
Do you want to go for some coffee?

236
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,400
No, I have to go back now.

237
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,060
Why? Don't you still have some time left?

238
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,870
I have work to do. I'll see you next time.

239
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,150
What's keeping him so busy?

240
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,520
- Why are you standing there?
- I'm taking these away.

241
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,230
You're not qualified to have these notes.

242
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,940
Do I need to be qualified to have notes?

243
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,540
Why? Didn't you say you
didn't want them before?

244
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,100
Are you having second thoughts?

245
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,070
No, but I'm just wondering
why you'd take them back.

246
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,710
I can do whatever I want.

247
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,620
If you're offended, you can sue me.

248
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,080
There's no need for that.

249
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,750
We still have 20 minutes left.
Let's go out and have lunch.

250
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,280
I don't want to eat anything!

251
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,190
Why do you keep glaring at me like that?

252
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,870
I'm not. I often hear
that I have blazing eyes.

253
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,400
An actress must have eyes that
can mesmerize the camera.

254
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,060
- Okay. Have a good day.
- Excuse me.

255
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,930
Yes? Is there something you want to say?

256
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,170
This may sound random, but do you
want to have dinner with me someday?

257
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,890
- Sorry?
- How about tomorrow?

258
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,030
Do you want to go eat
something tasty tomorrow?

259
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,030
I don't think I'll be hungry tomorrow.

260
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,350
Then let's watch a movie.
Do you like romance?

261
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,400
How about "Love in Titicaca"?

262
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,540
- I saw it yesterday.
- It opens in theaters tomorrow.

263
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,690
I see.

264
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,450
Well... I'll just be
straightforward with you.

265
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,270
I like you too, Chan Sung.

266
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,900
Too?

267
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,810
So I want to watch a movie with you...

268
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,650
and have dinner and get to know you more.

269
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,070
I'm sorry, but this is so out of the blue.

270
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,300
Can you give me some time to think it over?

271
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,790
Of course I can.

272
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,140
- For how long?
- About... 10 years?

273
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
Have a good day.

274
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,790
I'll meet with a client
and go straight home.

275
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,070
Okay.

276
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,960
Are you upset with me over something?

277
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,750
If it's because I didn't keep my promise...

278
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,500
to have lunch with you...

279
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,730
No way, it's not because of that.

280
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,030
Then what is it?

281
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,210
Do I have to explain
everything to you in detail?

282
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,740
Don't you know the constitution
states freedom to one's privacy?

283
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,800
Did I teach you that too?

284
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
No, I learned about that myself.

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,680
It's article 17 of the constitution.

286
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,680
That's not what's important right now.

287
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,640
Okay. I will respect
your freedom to your privacy.

288
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,670
But...

289
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,020
Let me ask you something.

290
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,080
Between "Avatar" that you saw in 2009,

291
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,810
and "What's Wrong With That Lawyer"
we saw last week,

292
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,480
which one did you like better?

293
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,920
What?

294
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,980
Which one was better, and which
remains more in your memory?

295
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,280
"Avatar" was interesting
because of the unique content,

296
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,430
and I enjoyed relating to
"What's Wrong With That Lawyer".

297
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,110
Does that mean you liked both of them?

298
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,750
You can't give up both?

299
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,710
You're so mean, Mr. Kwon!

300
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,500
I'll see you on the day of the trial.

301
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,670
Okay. Contact me if there are
any other documents you need.

302
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,470
- Good day, sir.
- Okay.

303
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,950
Contact the witness who will
come to the hearing next week,

304
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,780
confirm whether he will come or not,
and send him the location.

305
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,700
She sent two O's?

306
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,600
What is wrong with her?

307
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,240
Welcome.

308
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,430
Maybe I should've reserved
someplace with a private room.

309
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,860
Yun Seo, is it okay to eat
at an open place like this?

310
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,520
No problem. I'll just sit
in a corner like this.

311
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,510
Mr. Kwon isn't coming again tonight?

312
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,840
Did you ever see him coming
voluntarily to a team dinner?

313
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,760
Over there.
He has participated voluntarily.

314
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,810
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

315
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,580
It's been a while since we all gathered.

316
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,910
Ms. Dan, why are you drinking so hurriedly?

317
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,220
She was rejected again.

318
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,400
You know, that guy
from the Thunder Express.

319
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Really?

320
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,200
Gosh, you fell for him
quick as a lightning bolt,

321
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,110
and got rejected even more quickly.

322
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,770
You must be so busy, Ms. Dan.

323
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,210
Since you get dumped regularly once a week.

324
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,560
What did you say?

325
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,950
By the way, what happened?

326
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,150
This morning, you said
you weren't going to come.

327
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,380
What changed your mind?

328
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,810
Well...

329
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,430
Why are you looking at Yun Seo?

330
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,980
Is she the reason why you're here?

331
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,630
Yes, I came to see Ms. Oh.

332
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,960
Gosh, that was so straightforward.

333
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,670
Do you guys have feelings for each other?

334
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,310
We don't have feelings for each other.
That's absurd.

335
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,220
- You're totally mistaken.
- Then...

336
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,380
why did he just make such
a suspicious comment?

337
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,540
There's nothing to be suspicious of.
I'm really just here to see Ms. Oh.

338
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,150
I wanted to ask her something.

339
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,240
What do you need to ask?

340
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,980
Lately, she's been working hard and
studying law in her spare time.

341
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,360
She was very enthusiastic.
But today, for some reason,

342
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,630
she was very insincere with her work
and kept being frustrated with me.

343
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,840
I figured she'd have a good reason,

344
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,460
so I came to resolve whatever
misunderstanding she might have.

345
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,560
Ms. Oh, can you tell me why
you're so angry at me?

346
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,170
You're asking me that in front of everyone?

347
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,870
Yes, I'd like to hear everyone's opinion.

348
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,950
If a majority of people
think I'm the one at fault,

349
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,480
I'm willing to fix what I did wrong.

350
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,440
So don't feel pressured,
and tell me what's bothering you.

351
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,870
You said it wasn't because
I didn't eat lunch with you.

352
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,430
Then by any chance, are you angry
because I didn't let you...

353
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,640
decorate my office in pink?

354
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,250
- Stop it.
- What's he saying?

355
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,950
Well, the thing is, I like pink.

356
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,440
Yes, I like pink.

357
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,580
And I decorated Mr. Kwon's office...

358
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,650
with some pink ornaments,
but he didn't like them.

359
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,340
So I just... But that's not why I'm angry.

360
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,600
Then are you angry because I
gave you a lot of work today?

361
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,280
Was it because I kept giving you
memo pads written with stuff to do?

362
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,410
You're so inhumane.

363
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,300
You should've gone up to her and
asked her politely face to face.

364
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,940
Even I'd feel upset if you just
wrote something on a memo pad...

365
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,650
and threw it on my desk.

366
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,310
- Right?
- No.

367
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,420
That's not why I'm angry. It's not...

368
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,210
To be honest, I didn't really
have a reasonable reason.

369
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,550
I think I ended up reacting sensitively...

370
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,360
because I was hungry.

371
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,690
Yes, that's right.

372
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,910
I'm sorry for causing a misunderstanding,

373
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,160
Mr. Kwon.

374
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,870
No, it's okay. I'm glad we
resolved our misunderstanding.

375
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,460
Gosh, it was nothing serious.

376
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,800
Now that you've reconciled,
you guys should clink glasses.

377
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,220
No, that's not necessary.

378
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,490
He must feel at ease now that you
guys resolved your misunderstanding.

379
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,510
Go on.

380
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,350
Cheers.

381
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,700
Goodness, this is nice.

382
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,330
Eat up.

383
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,230
Okay.

384
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,420
Mr. Kwon.

385
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,960
I'd like to have a word with you.

386
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,220
Sure.

387
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,710
I thought we were all good.

388
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,370
What more is there to talk about?

389
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,840
Why did you do that?

390
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,860
Why did you have to do that?

391
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,410
- What do you mean?
- It was our personal issue.

392
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,720
It should've stayed between the two of us.

393
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,510
Why did you have to blab
about it to everyone?

394
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,950
"Blab"?

395
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,620
As I told you earlier, I wanted to hear...

396
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,240
everyone's opinion.
And if a majority of people...

397
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,860
Do you think this is a trial?

398
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,270
The act of checking who's right and
who's wrong in front of everyone...

399
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,660
is no different from a trial.

400
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,050
I'm sorry if it offended you.

401
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,440
But we managed to resolve
our misunderstandings...

402
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,050
Do you really think we resolved
our misunderstandings?

403
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,700
Nothing's resolved between us.

404
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,070
Do you know why?

405
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,710
It's because there's another reason why...

406
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,790
I'm angry at you.

407
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,150
What do you mean?

408
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,180
Why did you eat pasta without me?

409
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,640
Why didn't you take me with you?

410
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,710
I wanted to have pasta as well!

411
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,580
Are you saying you were upset all day...

412
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,860
because I didn't take you
with me to eat pasta?

413
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,310
Let's eat pasta tomorrow.

414
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,090
- Pasta...
- Why did you do that?

415
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,750
Why did you have pasta...

416
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,780
with someone else?

417
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,290
I'm so annoyed.

418
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,560
It's so annoying.

419
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,770
Gosh, I'm so upset.

420
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,070
I wanted to eat pasta too.

421
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,440
Hey, you're home.

422
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,970
Hey.

423
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,370
By the way, Joo Won told me
that he saw you earlier.

424
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,130
I heard you ate pasta with Yeo Reum today.

425
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,100
- Is pasta the problem again?
- What do you mean "again"?

426
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,780
It's my first time mentioning it.

427
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,800
So what about it? What about pasta?

428
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,000
What's so wrong about eating pasta?

429
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,490
I'm jealous.

430
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,530
What? You're jealous?

431
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,900
Of course. I may have
broken up with Yeo Reum,

432
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,670
but that doesn't mean I'm over her.

433
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,570
So it's very natural to get angry
at the fact that the girl I like...

434
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,830
had pasta with someone else.

435
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,230
If someone gets angry at you for
eating pasta with someone else,

436
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,650
does that mean that person likes you?

437
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,310
What?

438
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,220
She likes me?

439
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,410
Hyuk Joon.

440
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,770
Should we go to the beach?

441
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,270
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

442
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,820
You need to go to work.

443
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,990
Yes, I need to go to work.

444
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,420
Did you get drunk yesterday
and make a mistake again?

445
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,170
I wonder who invented alcohol.

446
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,600
I guess you did make a mistake.

447
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,770
I'm the one who's curious.
Who in the world...

448
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,010
is responsible for making you
get in trouble all the time?

449
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,280
What did you do this time?

450
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,050
- I don't know.
- Just tell me what happened.

451
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,820
I need to know in order to help
you get out of whatever you did.

452
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,650
I don't know, okay?
I just want to be alone!

453
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,690
Here?

454
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,460
We're almost there.

455
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,670
Already? We're here already?

456
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,310
What am I going to do?

457
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,130
What am I going to say to him?

458
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,680
What am I going to do?

459
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,860
Hello.

460
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,400
Yes, good morning.

461
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,950
Ms. Oh.

462
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,870
- Yes?
- Please check if the sentencing...

463
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,910
of yesterday's trial got delivered to us.

464
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,080
And please check if the court filed...

465
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,820
the petition of appeal for
case number 2018G-327.

466
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,930
Okay.

467
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,460
Hey, Mr. Kwon.

468
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,440
Well...

469
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,900
About what I said to you yesterday...

470
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,620
Yes? Which part?

471
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,320
Well...

472
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,390
I asked you why you ate
pasta with someone else...

473
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,320
instead of eating it with me.

474
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,120
I only said that as a friend.

475
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,850
- A friend?
- Yes.

476
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,610
Women tend to be like that.

477
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,380
For example, when your best friend
at school leaves you out...

478
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,610
and eats tteokbokki with another friend,

479
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,100
it makes you feel really
left out and upset.

480
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,530
It makes you feel as if you
lost your best friend.

481
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,440
And to be frank, the two of us...

482
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,550
are like best friends at the firm.

483
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,950
- Best friends?
- Yes.

484
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,800
We're totally best friends.

485
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,590
We work so close to each other,
we eat together,

486
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,570
and we handle cases together.

487
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,960
I mean, how much closer can we get?

488
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,560
But I felt a bit upset...

489
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,830
when it seemed as though...

490
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,370
you were closer with someone else.

491
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,610
It's childish, isn't it?

492
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,020
Not only do I look young on the outside,

493
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,570
but I also have a very young mindset.

494
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,250
So please forget about
what happened yesterday.

495
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,560
- Okay?
- Yes, okay.

496
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,740
Mr. Kwon, Mr. Yeon wishes to see you.

497
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,760
Okay.

498
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,410
I'll be right back.

499
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,770
Okay.

500
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,070
What on earth is wrong with you?

501
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,890
- So what do you want to say?
- Didn't I mention it yesterday?

502
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,040
I did, didn't I?

503
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,080
I said that we had some good news.

504
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,290
Our law firm will take
on a high-profile case.

505
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,140
Has it been decided then?

506
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,760
Well, you know...

507
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,550
Give this a read.

508
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,760
This too.

509
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,770
Isn't this the Im Yun Hee Case?

510
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,730
It's the hottest case right now.

511
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,660
Take the case and have it
declared self-defense.

512
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,530
- I can't.
- What? Why not?

513
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,640
You should be grateful for such a big case,

514
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,840
not refuse it.

515
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,970
It's not that. I just don't have the time.

516
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,210
I'm currently working on a total 32 cases.

517
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,470
Still.

518
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,350
You can't pass up on an
opportunity like this.

519
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,600
If that's the case, take it yourself.

520
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,680
You're not exactly busy these days.

521
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,580
You won't be asked on more TV shows anyway.

522
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,920
Please don't bring that up.

523
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,790
I'll be declining them anyway.

524
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,690
I now have PTSD.

525
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,870
I was only under the weather,
but I got some mean comments.

526
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,900
"Did he really pass the bar?"

527
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,000
"Did you see him tremble?"
"Maybe he's not really a lawyer."

528
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,170
I couldn't be more humiliated,

529
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,220
so don't mention TV shows to me ever again.

530
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,910
Mr. Yeon, the...

531
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,360
Don't ever mention it again.

532
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,380
- The...
- Stop it!

533
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,900
The sitting cushion.

534
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,480
This isn't what you sit on.

535
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,040
It's a blanket.

536
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,490
Anyway, you're taking the case.

537
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,520
It must be because you
advocate public interest.

538
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,780
The women's organization
specifically wants you on the case.

539
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,680
("From Victim of Domestic Violence
to Murder Suspect")

540
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,690
("Former Husband Died
in a Fire 5 Years Ago")

541
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,350
Read these and find any
articles related to the case.

542
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,000
Sure.

543
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,120
I saw this on the news.

544
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,160
Are you the lead attorney on this?

545
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,840
Yes, so it seems.

546
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,560
That's great.

547
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,460
If someone as talented as you defends her,

548
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,150
her claims of self-defense will be proved.

549
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,850
Do you think that this was self-defense?

550
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,200
Yes.

551
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,120
Her husband beat her badly,

552
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,050
so she reacted in the spur of the moment.

553
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,620
It's not simple though.

554
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:11,550
Also, there are preconditions needed
for this to have been self-defense.

555
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,150
Preconditions?

556
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,010
(Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum)

557
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,260
Ms. Yoo, Ms. Im Yun Hee will be here soon.

558
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,880
All right. We're keeping it simple today.

559
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,450
She's here!

560
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,580
In order for it to have been self-defense,

561
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,030
an attack must've been made
against her or a third-party.

562
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:38,790
Also, that attack must have
happened in front of her.

563
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:43,160
Lastly, even if it were to protect herself,

564
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,660
she shouldn't have used excessive force.

565
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,930
Simply speaking, she can't
have crossed the line...

566
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,930
even if it were to save herself.

567
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,030
For instance, let's say
someone slapped you.

568
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,000
You can't retaliate with a weapon.

569
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,260
The force used wasn't reasonable,
so it isn't self-defense.

570
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,220
There were many cases like this before,

571
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,960
but the Supreme Court ruled
against self-defense.

572
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,000
The prosecution will use
that as precedence.

573
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,980
Then you can set a new precedent...

574
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,350
by having it ruled as self-defense.

575
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,270
She could've intentionally
killed her husband.

576
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,910
Anyway, please search for more articles.

577
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,350
Sure.

578
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,420
Ms. Im.

579
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,030
I will now call you a suspect.

580
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,730
You have the right to remain silent...

581
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,570
and refuse to answer any questions.

582
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,590
Choosing to keep silent
won't be used against you,

583
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,340
and you may have a lawyer
present at these interviews.

584
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,710
Do you understand these rights?

585
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,730
Will you have a lawyer present...

586
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,610
or shall we begin the questioning?

587
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,600
Why did you want to see me again?

588
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,400
Are you busy?

589
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,130
I was studying up on Ms. Im's case.

590
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,260
- Do you see any holes?
- I'm not sure.

591
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,740
I think I should meet her
and talk to her first.

592
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,870
Once a case becomes yours,
you always do your best.

593
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,570
Did you call me here to check on...

594
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,280
whether I was doing my best?

595
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,780
Oh, please.

596
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,990
Why would that have been my intention?

597
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,900
Can you pick out a tie for me?

598
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,190
This makes me look sexy...

599
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,070
while this makes me look young and dandy.

600
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,790
Which is better?

601
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,370
What on earth are you doing?

602
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,170
I've been asked on a TV show.

603
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,310
I'm having an interview here at the firm.

604
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,100
Didn't you just tell me that
you were too traumatized...

605
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,940
to be on TV anymore?

606
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,090
Confucius said...

607
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,680
that our greatest glory
is not in never failing,

608
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,970
but in rising every time we fail.

609
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,960
I failed my first TV show
because of the nerves,

610
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,890
but I will rise despite that failure.

611
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,820
Even if I fail again, I will rise again.

612
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,730
I'll get going then.

613
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,940
I'm too exhausted and in need of caffeine.

614
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,240
I'll take mine strong. Hold on.
What about Ms. Oh?

615
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,810
What do we do?

616
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,000
The interview crew has a busy schedule...

617
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,140
and doesn't know
when exactly it'll be here.

618
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,300
Being spotted by the crew will
only put her on the spot.

619
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,220
We can't ask her to spend all
day at a coffee shop though.

620
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,560
I guess it'll all work out, right?

621
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,780
I'm sure there's a place for
her to hide in this firm.

622
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,900
Mr. Sexy?

623
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,570
Mr. Fresh?

624
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,100
Is this better?

625
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,780
- Go with sexy.
- Mr. Sexy it is.

626
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,410
This is much better.

627
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,860
Would you like a cup of coffee too?

628
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,410
No, I'll get my own.

629
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,790
Ms. Oh Jin Sim,

630
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,850
I'm going to the detention center
to meet Ms. Im tomorrow.

631
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,040
Would you like to come too?

632
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,240
- Me too?
- Yes.

633
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,410
Only lawyers are allowed to talk to her,

634
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,150
but being there...

635
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,950
will help you with your career in law.

636
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,690
Of course. It'll be better
than never visiting it.

637
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,600
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

638
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,060
We should drink our coffee.

639
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,640
The detention center? Doesn't that mean...

640
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,320
a decently long car ride?

641
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,690
Then, the two of us...

642
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,280
It'll be a fairly long ride,
so I had better be prepared.

643
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,230
I'm going there to work.

644
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,430
What should I wear tomorrow?

645
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,410
Hold on. A bad outfit
will lower my spirits.

646
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,130
I won't be able to focus on work properly.

647
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,650
I won't be able to focus on work...

648
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,280
if my skin is too dry either.

649
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,250
I must be such a workaholic.

650
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,080
♫ <i>Yes, everything is so new for me</i> ♫

651
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,760
♫ <i>Something that has a feeling, you know?</i> ♫

652

♫ <i>Whatever it is, make it hip and elegant</i> ♫

655

656

662
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,010
Good morning, Mr. Kwon.

663
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,290
That neck-tie...

664
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,040
looks good on you.

665
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,130
Your necklace is pretty too.

666
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,520
♫ <i>Don't act like you don't know</i> ♫

667
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,880
It's cold, so let's get in.

668
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,740
♫ <i>So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Woo hoo!</i> ♫

669
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,190
It feels nice to be out on a drive.

670
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,230
It's not a drive. We're going
to the detention center.

671
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,240
We're in the car, so it's a drive.

672
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,780
Yes, this is Kwon Jung Rok.

673
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,180
Yes, I understand.

674
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,620
That was a call from the detention center.

675
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,530
Visiting hours has been
postponed for two hours.

676
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,350
Really?

677
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,110
It's almost time for lunch,
so let's drop by somewhere and eat.

678
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,430
Actually, I...

679
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,080
made some lunch boxes.

680
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,620
Lunch boxes?

681
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,950
It's a waste of time looking
for restaurants anyway.

682
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,330
We can save time and focus more on work.

683
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,400
It's also my dream to eat
a lunch box outside...

684
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,220
while enjoying a beautiful view.

685
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,800
Well, since we have a lot
of time, let's go then.

686
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,560
I have it.

687
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,200
Shall we just go inside and eat?

688
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,760
I'll just eat here.

689
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,660
Why? It's so cold out here.

690
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,870
You said it's your dream.

691
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,930
Your cooking is better than I thought.

692
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,800
How bad did you think I was?

693
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,200
I once shot a drama as
a chef of Korean food.

694
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,210
I learned from an expert back then...

695
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,460
and I can make Korean food like
this even with my eyes closed.

696
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,420
As an actress, you must experience
living as various types of people.

697
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,910
It sounds very interesting.

698
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,640
Back then, I was really happy.

699
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:11,000
When do you feel that you're happy?

700
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,710
When I get my paycheck?

701
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:19,060
Goodness. You said you became
an attorney because of the money.

702
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,170
You really love money, don't you?

703
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,650
It's too cold. Let's go inside.

704
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,780
If you catch a cold
or something, it's my loss.

705
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,630
What?

706
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,940
Why is it your loss?

707
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,370
What?

708
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,480
You're the star of our law firm.

709
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:44,130
If you catch a cold from this
picnic and don't come to work,

710
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:47,500
can you imagine how sorry I would feel?

711
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,970
I'm saying, it's an extremely
huge loss for our law firm.

712
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,960
- Can you hand me that?
- Okay.

713
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,070
If you're cold, there are
always pockets to keep you warm.

714
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,410
Really?

715
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,600
- Thank you.
- No, wait.

716
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:39,190
I meant, put your hands
inside your pockets.

717
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,350
I'm sorry.

718
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,570
Where are my pockets again?

719
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,800
Se Won, isn't it uncomfortable
staying at your friend's home?

720
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,840
It is. He's a total cranky guy.

721
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,750
It must be uncomfortable staying
with him over the weekend.

722
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,640
How about watching a movie with me?

723
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,170
That sounds more uncomfortable.

724
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,180
It's Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum.

725
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,160
Ms. Yoo must be pretty frustrated lately...

726
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,820
because of the Im Yun Hee Case.

727
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,570
Why? Is something not going well?

728
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:45,410
I heard Mr. Im really wanted to
take on the Im Yun Hee Case,

729
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,000
but it went to Ms. Yoo.

730
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:50,760
I heard Mr. Im has a huge grudge
and is giving her a hard time.

731
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,030
Is she the newbie who is
working with Se Won now?

732
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,720
Why do they look so close?

733
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,900
Are they dating?

734
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,020
I heard her dad is a high-ranking
official at the Blue House.

735
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,730
The son of a hospital owner and
a daughter of a Blue House official.

736
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,160
They sound like the perfect match.

737
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,820
Don't you think?

738
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,490
I guess.

739
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,970
Doesn't Se Won and that newbie
look good together?

740
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,410
They're both from rich families.

741
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,550
It's better than...

742
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,050
the son of a hospital owner and
a daughter of a suspect for fraud.

743
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,490
That's just absurd.

744
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,640
Come to think of it,
you're truly something.

745
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,710
Your dad was suspected of committing fraud,

746
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,880
but your ex-boyfriend didn't indict him...

747
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,510
and ended up being kicked
out to the countryside.

748
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,340
But how could you be so brazen about this?

749
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,510
If I were you, I won't last a second here.

750
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,050
What's your point?

751
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,750
We all have our own place in this world.

752
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:21,790
No matter how hard you try,

753
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,770
you won't become more than
an ordinary prosecutor.

754
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,540
I know you're trying so desperately
because you know that too.

755
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,460
You want to do whatever it
takes to be successful.

756
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,170
- That's enough.
- Do you think...

757
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,560
the chief prosecutor gave
you the Im Yun Hee Case...

758
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,240
because you're competent?

759
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,730
It's because you're a woman...

760
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,450
and he knows there's a way he can use you.

761
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,290
If you understand, stop acting up so much.

762
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:06,960
Do you want to wait in the car?

763
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:09,760
No. I'll take a look around too.

764
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,820
As I told you, you can't come
with me to the meeting room.

765
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,200
I told you, I already know that.

766
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,200
Are people detained in here
all waiting for trials...

767
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,800
like Im Yun Hee?

768
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,000
That's not always the case.
Some have already been sentenced...

769
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,750
and some are in the process
of a trial or waiting for it.

770
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,530
Oh, my. It's two o'clock.
You should get going.

771
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,710
It's cold. You should just wait in the car.

772
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,820
Why? Are you worried?

773
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,950
Yes. I'm worried.

774
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:57,040
If you catch a cold,
it's a loss for me as well.

775
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,320
What? Why?

776
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,830
If you catch a cold, there
will be a delay in work,

777
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:05,350
and I'll eventually have
more work on my shoulders.

778
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,170
And if you happen to pass
on your cold to me...

779
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,160
Gosh. Seriously, you're so mean.

780
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,030
Satisfied?

781
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,500
It's very cold outside.

782
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:29,880
Stop being stubborn. Take a quick
look around, and wait in the car.

783
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,580
What was that?
Was he just worried about me?

784
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,780
What was that? What?

785
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,430
Ms. Im.

786
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,630
Can you tell me...

787
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:57,100
what happened that day in detail?

788
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,960
I know it's hard to bring back that memory,

789
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,760
but you must tell me
everything that happened...

790
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:06,160
that day without leaving anything out.

791
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,610
Do you admit to the charges...

792
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,550
of you murdering your husband?

793
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,200
Do you have regrets for...

794
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,360
what you did?.

795
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:28,880
I'm very well aware that you've been
a victim of domestic violence...

796
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,370
for so many years.

797
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,990
However, that alone is not enough...

798
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,690
to justify your murder.

799
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,740
Then...

800
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,330
what do you think I should've done?

801
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,630
Should I have died instead?

802
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,170
(Prosecutor: Yoon Yeo Reum)

803
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,650
(Im Yun Hee, Murder)

804
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,820
I really think she was only
trying to defend herself.

805
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:16,010
What do you think? It was an
act of self-defense, right?

806
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,970
I don't think I should
jump to conclusions yet.

807
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,810
I guess you feel more confused now
that you've met her in person.

808
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,530
Then how about this? While you drive,

809
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:36,310
I'll read this more meticulously.

810
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,030
If I read it thoroughly enough,
I might find a breakthrough.

811
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,770
Trust me.

812
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,710
Okay.

813
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:48,790
♫ <i>Left home, out on my own</i> ♫

814
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:53,370
♫ <i>Had to leave 'cause I had no choice</i> ♫

815
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,030
I thought she was going
to find a breakthrough.

816
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,990
♫ <i>To find what I've lost through the years</i> ♫

817
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:05,970
♫ <i>Through all the noise, yeah</i> ♫

818
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,430
♫ <i>I see it clear</i> ♫

819
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,760
♫ <i>Naming lights is the life I live</i> ♫

820
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,367
♫ <i>Sing my song for a thousand loud</i> ♫

821
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:29,350
My goodness.

822
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,880
I just wanted to think for a little while,

823
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,830
but I guess I ended up dozing off.

824
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,710
You should've woken me up when we got here.

825
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,950
I felt sorry to wake you up
because you were so sound asleep.

826
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,890
- Did you wait a long time?
- No.

827
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,660
Did I make any mistakes while I was asleep?

828
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,710
I'm not really sure
if I can call this a mistake.

829
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,690
But you did snore a lot.

830
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,470
I snored? Me?

831
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,590
Goodness, there's no way. I don't snore.

832
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,290
I was joking.

833
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,470
Why would you make a
joke looking so serious?

834
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:13,110
But is snoring that big of a deal?

835
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,310
Of course.

836
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,000
I only want you to think I'm pretty and...

837
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,570
You want me to think that?

838
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,790
Yes, because...

839
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,060
It's because you're so strict.

840
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,150
I feel like you'll criticize
me if I loosen up too much.

841
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,770
I'll be off now.

842
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,270
Go home safely.

843
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,290
I must've been crazy. Why would
I say something like that?

844
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:14,490
Hey, Mr. Lee. Yes.

845
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,240
I urgently need you to look
into something for me.

846
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,240
Im Yun Hee lived with her
dad ever since her mom...

847
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,340
ran away from home because
her dad was very abusive.

848
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,810
But her dad disappeared 10 years
ago and has been MIA ever since.

849
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,500
It's been 10 years since
her dad disappeared?

850
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,590
Then he must already be registered as dead.

851
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:35,010
Yes.

852
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,560
Her mom ran away from home.

853
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,380
Her dad disappeared and
is assumed to be dead.

854
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,150
Her ex-husband died in a fire.

855
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:45,060
And the husband she remarried...

856
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,750
What a terrible life.

857
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,260
Yes.

858
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,510
After she graduated high
school, she made a living...

859
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:00,250
by working as a cashier,
a saleswoman at a mall, and so on.

860
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,040
She also worked in insurance.

861
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,580
Did you just say "insurance"?

862
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,460
Do you think she'll be
able to get acquitted?

863
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,220
I'm not sure. The main issue will be
whether the murder was accidental...

864
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,660
or planned with a means
to get insurance money.

865
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,870
Ms. Im used to work in insurance,
so they'll be suspicious of that.

866
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,920
But about Ms. Im...

867
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:30,220
The report said her ex-husband had
a record of having committed violence.

868
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,820
So why do you think she ended
up remarrying a guy...

869
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,930
who was also very violent?

870
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,960
One would think she'd avoid men like that.

871
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,860
I once appeared on a drama
as a psychotherapist.

872
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,320
And there was a woman who habitually...

873
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,890
forgave her violent husband every
time he begged and apologized.

874
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:51,770
I heard that's also a
psychological problem.

875
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:52,900
I already requested a doctor...

876
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,540
to conduct a psychiatric evaluation on her.

877
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,070
(Yoo Yeo Reum)

878
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,590
I'm quite taken aback.

879
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:08,460
You already know how important
this case is to me.

880
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:10,580
Do you really have to stand
on the opposite side?

881
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,150
It's against the ethics of
an attorney to turn down...

882
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,770
a client's request.

883
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,010
If I start being picky
about every single case,

884
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,150
I won't be able to defend anyone.

885
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:23,110
Yes, I know that. But there's
something you should know.

886
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,210
The court has never acknowledged
any form of murder...

887
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:27,550
as self-defense.

888
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,550
That's not important.

889
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:34,010
I'm going to do my best to
reveal what really happened.

890
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,830
I'll make sure she only gets
punished for what she deserves.

891
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,660
And if she's innocent, I'm going
to make sure she gets acquitted.

892
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,180
That's my job.

893
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,830
She'll never be able to get acquitted.

894
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,040
Because that's my job.

895
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:52,010
- The prosecution is wrong!
- Today is Im Yun Hee's first trial.

896
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,400
It is known that she accidentally
ended up murdering him...

897
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,480
while she was trying to
stop her husband's assault.

898
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,890
However, the prosecution indicted her...

899
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,360
for murder instead of
involuntary manslaughter.

900
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,030
The defendant, Im Yun Hee,

901
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:05,030
was legally married to
the victim, Kim Yeong Tae.

902
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,560
And on January 21, 2019,
while she was getting assaulted...

903
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,120
by the victim in her house,

904
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,100
she used a kitchen knife to
threaten Kim Yeong Tae...

905
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,910
and murdered him by stabbing him
in the stomach and chest.

906
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,780
The late victim habitually
committed domestic violence,

907
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,220
so this might seem as an
act of self-defense...

908
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,660
assuming that the victim could no
longer put up with the assault.

909
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,540
However, if you take a look
at the autopsy result,

910
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:33,700
you'll be able to realize that
this was a planned murder.

911
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,570
How much of a possibility
is there for her...

912
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,970
to coincidentally stab her
husband right in the vital spot?

913
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:45,940
This is why the prosecution wishes
to indict the defendant for murder.

914
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:54,590
Attorney, please state your opinion
regarding the charges.

915
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,540
According to the paramedic
that was at the scene,

916
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,050
the defendant had broken two of her ribs...

917
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,880
and was injured enough to be
hospitalized for nine weeks.

918
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,890
Even if she did intend on murdering him,

919
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,180
how much of a possibility is there
for a small woman like her...

920
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:15,750
to stab him right in his vital
spot considering the fact...

921
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:18,030
that she was also severely injured?

922
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,190
Thus, I request that the
defendant gets acquitted...

923
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,570
by claiming that it was
an act of self-defense.

924
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,480
The only will that existed
at the crime scene...

925
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,350
was the defendant's will to survive.

926
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,380
She had no other will or
intention behind what happened.

927
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,970
From what I heard, your mother
ran away from home when you were 10.

928
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,720
May I ask you why?

929
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,200
She was getting beaten up by my drunk dad,

930
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,770
and she ended up hitting
her head on the floor.

931
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:52,900
She bled a lot,

932
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,990
and while my dad started looking
for something to hit my mom with,

933
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,230
she ran away.

934
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,570
She probably just wanted to stay alive.

935
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:12,810
After that incident,

936
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,050
I heard your dad started
beating you up as well.

937
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,720
Is that correct?

938
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,980
Yes. That's right.

939
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,050
Her father and her deceased husband...

940
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,900
were both violent men.

941
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:30,820
Your father must've been
tough for you to endure,

942
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,080
so why meet and marry men...

943
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,220
that were as violent as him?

944
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,260
Your Honor,

945
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,260
I bring a psychiatrist to the stand...

946
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,800
to better explain my client's situation.

947
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,780
At a glance, it may be hard to understand.

948
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,330
However, we become
accustomed to situations...

949
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,600
if we're in them long enough.

950
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,880
Could you explain that in detail?

951
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,410
Children who were abused at a young age...

952
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,670
can't properly tell that
it's not acceptable.

953
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,520
Naturally, they end up
picking up the habit too.

954
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,790
Also, if children aren't
in same situations,

955
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,650
they experience anxiety and stress.

956
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,830
And so the vicious cycle continues.

957
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,180
Here is the assessment you made
of Ms. Im's mental state.

958
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:19,600
"The subject, from a young age,"

959
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,350
"was exposed to a life
of physical violence."

960
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:25,990
"Therefore, it can't be said
that she is of sound mind."

961
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,580
That is what you wrote. Is this right?

962
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,760
Yes, that's my assessment.

963
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,200
So in your professional opinion,

964
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,200
Ms. Im might have not
been in her right mind...

965
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,740
at the time of this incident.

966
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,450
Am I safe to say that?

967
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,700
Yes.

968
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,410
That is all, Your Honor.

969
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,880
Prosecution, will you redirect?

970
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,250
Yes, Your Honor.

971
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,050
Ms. Im,

972
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,530
these are the bills...

973
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,790
of your first husband's
life insurance policy...

974
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,470
as well as the one of your father's
who disappeared 10 years ago.

975
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,350
Did you apply for them yourself?

976
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,400
Yes, that's right.

977
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,540
Your deceased husband Kim Yeong Tae...

978
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:15,350
also had a life insurance policy.

979
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:16,600
You knew that, right?

980
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,400
- Yes.
- Do you know for how much?

981
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:21,140
I don't.

982
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,520
Kim Yeong Tae has
a life insurance policy...

983
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,560
of 4.94 million dollars.

984
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:37,660
It's a large amount of money
for you to not have known.

985
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:43,830
That is all.

986
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,680
You're arguing insanity?

987
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:56,760
I get it. Even though she's
charged with murder,

988
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,380
she could get a reduced
sentence with an insanity plea.

989
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:01,620
That's a win for an attorney, isn't it?

990
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:02,680
Don't say that.

991
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,410
Both self-defense and
an insanity plea are...

992
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,940
written in the book of criminal law.

993
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:13,020
I won't let you win with an insanity plea,

994
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,940
so don't even bother trying.

995
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,240
This isn't a case that you can win.

996
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:37,330
Why are you obsessed with this case?

997
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:40,700
Because this is the only way.

998
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,070
You were born with a silver spoon,

999
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,210
so you'll never understand it.

1000
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,530
- You're back.
- Welcome back.

1001
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,660
Hello, everyone.

1002
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,240
Ms. Oh, where's Mr. Kwon?

1003
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,950
He stayed to talk to the
lead prosecutor on the case.

1004
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,760
I was asked to head back alone.

1005
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,990
How did the trial go?
Articles have been exploding online.

1006
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:17,810
You don't look so happy.
Did it go badly for our side?

1007
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,120
Yes, although...

1008
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,930
we were doing all right when Mr. Kwon...

1009
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,610
argued the insanity defense.

1010
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,240
However, the life insurance
policy of the deceased husband...

1011
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,970
swayed a lot of the votes.

1012
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,330
Just how much would she receive?

1013
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,820
4.9 million dollars.

1014
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:40,010
4.9 million dollars?

1015
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,290
No wonder everyone stirred.

1016
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,160
Tell me about it. Even I'm wondering...

1017
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:46,860
if she did it for the money.

1018
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,330
Poor Mr. Kwon.

1019
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:52,620
The news is all over this case.

1020
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:55,660
Losing it will put a big
dent in his career.

1021
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,380
Don't say that when
the verdict is still out.

1022
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:00,900
Mr. Kwon.

1023
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,170
I'm back.

1024
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:22,320
Excuse me, Mr. Kwon.

1025
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:29,470
Don't take what the others
said too seriously.

1026
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:30,930
I don't.

1027
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:34,780
Anyone would think so
after today's outcome.

1028
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:36,970
Right.

1029
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,110
Still,

1030
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,460
I think that you'll win this case.

1031
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,120
To be honest, I thought that...

1032
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,030
people who are stiff and logical...

1033
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,930
were the type to become lawyers.

1034
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,260
I now think it's more for the warm-hearted.

1035
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,400
For someone like you.

1036
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:01,900
Despite what many think,
you have a warm heart...

1037
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,040
and you're very thoughtful.

1038
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,310
There was a time when I felt like...

1039
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,360
I was alone in this world.

1040
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:16,360
I had no one taking my side back then.

1041
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,160
Life seemed impossible.

1042
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,030
Back then,

1043
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,720
if I had someone like you in my life,

1044
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,300
it would've been better.

1045
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,570
That's what I've been thinking.

1046
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,380
That's how great of a lawyer you are,

1047
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,340
so I trust that you'll find
a solution for this case.

1048
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,060
Look at the time.

1049
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,240
Why are you still here?

1050
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:17,080
I was looking up precedents
regarding self-defense.

1051
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,560
I wanted to be of help somehow.

1052
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,490
Would you like to have dinner with me?

1053
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,610
Sure. I was actually starving.

1054
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,850
Then let's head out.

1055
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,060
You know,

1056
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,210
I became a lawyer...

1057
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,680
because I wanted to...

1058
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,420
take people's sides instead
of punishing them.

1059
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,450
Then why did you say before...

1060
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,030
that it was to earn a lot of money?

1061
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:03,260
I felt too embarrassed
to tell you the truth...

1062
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,380
back then.

1063
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:10,270
Then why are you being honest with me now?

1064
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,300
Because...

1065
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,600
what you said made me want to be honest.

1066
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,030
Thank you for saying
that you believe in me.

1067
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,000
Also, if there comes a time...

1068
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:35,520
when you feel like you're
alone in this world...

1069
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,960
and that there's no one
to take your side again,

1070
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,780
I'll be there for you.

1071
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,440
♫ <i>So much that I don't know</i> ♫

1072
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,610
Mr. Kwon.

1073
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:06,750
♫ <i>Honestly, it's hard</i> ♫

1074
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:10,200
♫ <i>I don't know the right timing</i> ♫

1075
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,250
♫ <i>Why do things keep messing up?</i> ♫

1076
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:16,360
There's something I want to say to you.

1077
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,050
♫ <i>My heart has slow footsteps</i> ♫

1078
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:20,360
But...

1079
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,020
♫ <i>So with all my strength, I chased after you</i> ♫

1080
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,460
I won't say it right now.

1081
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:26,130
However,

1082
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,470
I will someday tell you...

1083
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,220
the exact emotions...

1084
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,160
that I'm feeling right this moment.

1085
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:45,850
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

1086
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,160
Do you...

1087
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:57,900
like me?

1088
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,700
What?

1089
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,500
♫ <i>You're probably my</i> ♫

1090
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,120
♫ <i>One, one, one, my one</i> ♫

1091
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:13,640
♫ <i>The only one, one, one, you are</i> ♫

1092
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:18,440
♫ <i>If this is love, love, love, if love</i> ♫

1093
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:24,600
♫ <i>What should I do, what should I do?
What if this is the love</i> ♫

1094
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,000
♫ <i>I'm looking at you for a while</i> ♫

1095
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,890
♫ <i>Wondering if you feel the same way</i> ♫

1096
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:37,370

1097
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:40,890
♫ <i>It's still so hard</i> ♫

1098
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,690
(Touch Your Heart)

1099
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,140
A modern woman who works.

1100
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:47,080
I look like a workaholic,
and it's really sexy.

1101
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,390
Don't you think you're making
my Yun Seo work too hard?

1102
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,650
Your Yun Seo?

1103
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,870
- Stop it.
- It's because I care.

1104
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:52,890
He cares?

1105
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,390
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1106
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,950
He told me not to make you work too hard.

1107
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,460
Your boyfriend.

1108
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,760
You've never dated anyone, have you?

1109
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,090
You don't seem to bright
when it comes to women.

1110
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:06,250
Someone told me that I'm
going to win no matter what.

1111
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,320
So believe in me and wait until I win.

1112
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,050
It's going to take a new turn.

1113
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,330
He could be the only witness of this case.

1114
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,830
But he could also be another suspect.

1115
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:17,750
♫ <i>What do I do? What if love?</i> ♫

1116
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,030

1117
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,810
♫ <i>One, one, one, my one</i> ♫
