1
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,700
Are you all right?

2
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,720
Please stay in the car.

3
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,230
What is this?

4
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,310
I just asked you a question.

5
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,730
I guess I mistook her for someone else.

6
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,920
I thought it was someone I knew,
but I guess I was wrong.

7
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,060
Mr. Kwon.

8
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,360
Are you all right?

9
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,310
What did he say?

10
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,180
Why did he follow me?

11
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,560
He said he mistook you for someone else.

12
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,020
He didn't.

13
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,560
He was obviously following me.

14
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,630
- He is...
- I know.

15
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,610
He's the one who made your life difficult.

16
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,450
That's why I didn't want
to just let him leave.

17
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,390
(Text Message)

18
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,930
I felt betrayed to see you happy.

19
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,800
Until next time, Ms. Oh.

20
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,810
Don't, Mr. Kwon.

21
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,550
I don't want to provoke him in any way.

22
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,560
I don't want to be associated with him.

23
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,470
Thank you for driving me home.

24
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,150
Sure.

25
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,400
I'm too worried to let
you be alone tonight.

26
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,460
Would it be okay if I kept you company?

27
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,280
At first,

28
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,340
he approached me as a fan.

29
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,090
Mr. Lee, thank you so much.

30
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,630
I hear that you want Yun Seo
to be the female lead...

31
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,650
in Director Han Sang Cheol's
upcoming blockbuster movie.

32
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,220
That's right.

33
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,370
I'm a fan of Yun Seo,

34
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,150
but that's not the only reason.

35
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,010
I just feel like this movie will suit her.

36
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,920
I'd be a fool not to celebrate then.

37
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,610
Let me pour you a glass.

38
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,710
- Let me pour you one too.
- Sure. It's an honor.

39
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,530
Ms. Oh,

40
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,600
have a glass.

41
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,610
I'm not much of a drinker.

42
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,800
Go on.

43
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,910
Ms. Oh,

44
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,290
are you all right?

45
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,040
Have a drink.

46
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,960
Where am I?

47
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,460
You're awake.

48
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,190
Why the glum face?

49
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,250
For me, it's been a blast.

50
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,290
All night,

51
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,360
I was able to watch my woman.

52
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,590
I should get going.

53
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,880
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers!

54
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,450
- Good job.
- Good job, guys.

55
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,150
I've never seen a team work
this well together before.

56
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,770
Ms. Oh, the director is asking for you.

57
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,620
- Really?
- Right now?

58
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,240
- Get going then.
- Sure.

59
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,510
I shouldn't have followed him there.

60
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,160
Director?

61
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,980
What are you doing?

62
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,210
Yun Seo.

63
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,280
I love you.

64
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,690
What are you saying?

65
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,870
What must I do...

66
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,430
to make you realize that?

67
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,480
Why do you seem so startled?

68
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,040
I said I love you.

69
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,610
I love you, darn it!

70
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,310
This is the narcotics division
of Gangnam Police Department.

71
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,910
Lee Gang Joon, you are under arrest...

72
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,960
for the violation of...

73
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,280
the Narcotic Control Act.

74
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,460
What? Yun Seo!

75
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,350
Hey!

76
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,130
- Let go of me!
- Get him out of here.

77
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,250
Yun Seo!

78
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,470
And just like that,
I was also accused of...

79
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,730
taking drugs.

80
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,570
I was let go...

81
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,700
after the drug test came back negative,

82
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,000
but just being there with him...

83
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,160
brought about all kinds of rumors.

84
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,680
I told people my story...

85
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,530
and said he was a stalker.

86
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,360
No matter how hard I tried,

87
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,370
no one would believe me.

88
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,400
Malicious and damaging articles...

89
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,480
continued to be published,

90
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,990
and it was too hard to endure.

91
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,100
I felt like I was going to crumble,

92
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,070
and that's why...

93
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,120
I took some time off.

94
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,790
Back then,

95
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,480
I was scared of him who let this happen,

96
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,740
of the people who turned their backs on me,

97
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,760
and of those who kept making up rumors.

98
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,090
I was scared of and disgusted by them all.

99
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,710
You don't have to say anymore.

100
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,420
It's all right.

101
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,050
I actually...

102
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,290
wanted to...

103
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,070
tell you about it someday.

104
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,530
I didn't want you...

105
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,910
to get the wrong idea of me.

106
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,700
Sure.

107
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,350
I don't think that at all.

108
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,990
Please stop worrying now.

109
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,790
You should go to sleep too.

110
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,930
Sure.

111
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,930
I will after I see you fall asleep.

112
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,840
All this time...

113
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,850
I haven't been able to tell
anyone my side of the story.

114
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,820
But now that I've told you everything,

115
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,610
I feel more comfortable.

116
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,840
Do you remember what I told you before?

117
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,150
People who commit crimes should suffer.

118
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,820
The victims shouldn't suffer instead.

119
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,340
You should forget all your bad memories...

120
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,610
and become happier than anyone else.

121
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,600
Right.

122
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,800
I remember.

123
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,850
I will make that happen.

124
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,750
I'll make you happier than anyone.

125
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,480
So, don't be afraid,

126
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,270
and let's overcome it together.

127
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,980
- You're up, Mr. Kwon.
- Yes.

128
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,670
What are you doing?

129
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,400
What do you think? I'm making breakfast.

130
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,140
You should have breakfast
before you go to work.

131
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,540
Let's see.

132
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,540
I'm making doenjang stew.

133
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,560
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

134
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,230
Do you want to taste it?

135
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,730
Isn't it good?

136
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,810
This place is great at
making doenjang stew, right?

137
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,130
Yes. This place must be
famous for its doenjang stew.

138
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,730
I won't spread any rumors though.

139
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,810
Okay. We should hurry up and eat.

140
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,100
Then we'll drop by your house
so you can change...

141
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,150
and we can go to work together.

142
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,780
Okay.

143
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,380
Now, all I have to do is add tofu.

144
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,020
I will...overcome it.

145
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,710
With you, Mr. Kwon.

146
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,130
As you can see, I'm certain
Jung Ji Ho embezzled funds.

147
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,420
He's pocketing millions of dollars.

148
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,650
If you need more proof...

149
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,260
What about the Bujin Steel Bribe
Case I asked you to look into?

150
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,720
Sir, I can't just let
Jung Ji Ho slide like this.

151
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,460
Didn't you expect this
when you put me on this case?

152
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,810
That I wouldn't give up?

153
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,410
Don't you know who Choi Yoon Su is?

154
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,780
He was the ace of the special
prosecution department.

155
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,620
And he's defending Jung Ji Ho right now.

156
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,600
He probably already bribed
the testifiers or witnesses.

157
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,980
Do you think you'll stand a chance?

158
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,730
Are you afraid of Choi Yoon Su...

159
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,020
or the person who's behind him?

160
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,680
What did you say?

161
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,850
(Evidence Record, Jung Ji Ho,
Embezzlement of funds)

162
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,130
Sir, are we really going
to end it like this?

163
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,390
I don't know when, but we
will reopen this box one day.

164
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,110
Let's make sure we catch him then.

165
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,790
What an unfortunate situation.

166
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,820
You still love your husband,
but you're thinking of divorce.

167
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,650
What's the reason?

168
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,290
Because my husband changed.

169
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,460
He used to tell me...

170
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,550
that he loved me a dozen times a day.

171
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,550
But recently, he makes up
excuses that he's busy...

172
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,340
and only says it twice.

173
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,350
He's saying it 10 times less.

174
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,420
- Sorry?
- That's not it.

175
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,890
My husband knew me better than anyone else.

176
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,030
But a few days ago, he said he
wanted to watch a drama with me...

177
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,430
and bought a chicken on his way home.

178
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,920
Why is that a problem?

179
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,500
We should eat one chicken per person.

180
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,100
When I looked at him tearing
the chicken with his teeth,

181
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,350
it felt like my heart was
being torn apart too.

182
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,870
How could I keep living with him?

183
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,070
We should part ways.

184
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,360
I'm sorry to tell you this,

185
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,960
but the reason for your divorce
isn't as serious as I thought.

186
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,320
And there's not enough proof that
your husband really changed.

187
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,010
My husband changed!

188
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,270
He's a mean man who broke my heart.

189
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,520
Of course, a decent man
shouldn't make a woman cry.

190
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,970
Here. Wipe your tears and calm down.

191
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,510
- Thank you.
- You can keep it.

192
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,540
All right, then. Have a good day.

193
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,990
Hi, Mom.

194
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,430
What? Tomorrow is my birthday?

195
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,480
What do I want as a gift?

196
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,940
It's okay.

197
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,050
You gave birth to a perfect son like me,

198
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,090
so I should be the one buying you a gift.

199
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,380
Okay. I'll see you later, Mom. Bye.

200
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,720
Tomorrow is his birthday?

201
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,970
Ms. Dan. Is something bothering you?

202
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,010
Well...

203
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,220
Actually, there is someone
who I've fallen for lately.

204
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,300
Again?

205
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,510
So?

206
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,220
Well, tomorrow is a happy
day for that person...

207
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,860
and I want to congratulate him.
What should I get him as a gift?

208
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
If it's a crush,

209
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,000
you should give him something simple
so he doesn't feel pressured.

210
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,980
If you like each other, do something
that can progress your relationship.

211
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,660
- For instance, you can buy dinner.
- The thing is...

212
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,810
It seems like a crush in a way,

213
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,160
but maybe he likes me too.
Do you want to hear about it?

214
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,420
First, he appeared like a prince
when I was in a crisis...

215
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,710
and helped me.

216
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,920
Second, I said I needed something,
and he gave it to me as a gift.

217
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,940
It's okay.

218
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,920
Buy me a drink someday.

219
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,250
A gift?

220
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,690
Maybe you're not mistaken this time.
He seems to like you too.

221
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,920
Really?

222
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,240
He seems genuinely attracted,
so just make the first move.

223
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,500
Ask him out to dinner tomorrow.

224
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,210
- How about a drink?
- Drink?

225
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,480
He told me to buy him
a drink someday first.

226
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,510
That's great. You should dress
up prettier than usual...

227
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,720
and make him fall for you.

228
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,170
But in order to look pretty,

229
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,650
what do I have to wear?

230
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,590
I've never dressed up properly.

231
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,560
Do you know what his
ideal type of woman is?

232
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,180
You should try to look as similar
as possible to his ideal type.

233
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,480
His ideal type of woman?

234
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,130
An ideal type of woman?

235
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,580
- Ms. Dan?
- Yes?

236
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,650
Do you have something to say?

237
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,180
- No. Why do you ask?
- You just looked at me.

238
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,900
That was delicious.

239
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,270
Since we all had a nice lunch,
today's coffee is on me.

240
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,290
I'll take your orders.

241
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,070
I'll have an espresso.

242
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,020
- I'll have a cafe mocha.
- I'll have a latte.

243
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,650
- I'll have a latte too.
- I'm sorry to say this,

244
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,110
but I'll have a latte with an extra shot.

245
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,120
I'll have a strawberry cream frappe...

246
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,150
with extra whipping cream.

247
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,390
Ms. Oh, can you memorize all this?

248
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,440
Don't you have to write it down?

249
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,190
Mr. Yeon will have an espresso,

250
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,960
Ms. Yang will have cafe mocha,

251
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,090
Hae Yeong and Jong Hwa will have lattes.

252
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,170
Pil Gi will have a latte
with an extra shot.

253
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,140
Mr. Lee will have a strawberry cream
frappe with extra whipping cream.

254
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,700
Mr. Kwon, since you like instant coffee,

255
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,270
I'll go inside and make you one.

256
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,140
How did you remember all that?

257
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,750
I have an amazing memory.

258
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,710
I'll go and get your coffee then.

259
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,580
- I'll be back.
- I'll help you. Let's go.

260
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,940
- Me too.
- I'll help you too.

261
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,300
It's an honor to drink coffee bought
by the universe's goddess, Ms. Oh.

262
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,350
Doesn't Ms. Oh seem...

263
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,320
very enthusiastic and bright today?

264
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,350
I love it.

265
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,370

269
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,120
I guess he's back for good.

270
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,540
Ms. Oh, it's time to go home.

271
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,710
Ms. Oh.

272
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,310
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

273
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,690
It's time to go home now.

274
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,890
Oh, okay. I need to make
a few photocopies first.

275

(Lee Gang Joon, Former CEO
of Jeguk Entertainment,)

276

(Returns as Vice President

277
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,320
Ms. Oh.

278
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,300
The Supreme Court unanimously
changed a court precedent recently.

279
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,240
I'll give you the number of the precedent.

280
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,540
Can you print that out for me?

281
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,830
Let's go on a date tonight.

282
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,410
Okay, I'll look for it right now.

283
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,360
Why did you suddenly bring
me to an amusement park?

284
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,620
I watched a few of your dramas
whenever I had time.

285
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,160
And whenever the female
character was having a bad day,

286
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,860
the male character always
tried to cheer her up...

287
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,150
by taking her to either
a beach or an amusement park.

288
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,650
I wondered where I should take you
out of the two places.

289
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,840
And I figured it'd be twice
as fun if I brought you...

290
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,980
to an amusement park that's
located near the beach.

291
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,370
More importantly,
the amusement park is small,

292
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,580
so it's not visited by a lot of people.

293
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,380
So I also thought it'd be
a very reasonable choice.

294
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,040
Thank you for caring about me so much.

295
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,840
You don't need to try so hard.

296
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,290
- What?
- It'll be hard...

297
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,770
to overcome everything overnight.

298
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,210
So let's just take one step at a time.

299
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,160
I'll always stay by your side to support...

300
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,470
and protect you.

301
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,720
I feel so reassured.

302
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,690
- Ms. Oh!
- Goodness, it's okay.

303
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,530
Ms. Oh! Ms. Oh!

304
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,450
Hold on tight.

305
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,570
Ms. Oh.

306
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,710
Don't worry!

307
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,230
Are you okay, Mr. Kwon?

308
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,050
I'll protect you.
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

309
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,200
Try raising your hands.

310
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,160
Ms. Oh!

311
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,740
Please stop!

312
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,840
- Stop!
- Put your hands up.

313
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,090
Mr. Kwon. Mr. Kwon, wake up.

314
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,130
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'll protect you.

315
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,610
Stop the ride!

316
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,680
Please! Stop the ride!

317
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,130
I'm okay, Ms. Oh.

318
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,950
Mr. Kwon, I didn't know you were
scared of amusement park rides.

319
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,580
I'm not scared. I just haven't been
on a ride since elementary school,

320
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,640
so it's more adequate to
say that I was nervous...

321
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,010
due to the unfamiliar environment.

322
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,400
And keep in mind that I'm getting
used to it very quickly.

323
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,720
Then how about we ride it one more time?

324
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,200
It'll help you get used to it more quickly.

325
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,130
No, that's... That's okay.

326
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,470
I think I've had enough for today.

327
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,000
Be honest with me.
You were scared, weren't you?

328
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,000
- No.
- Come on.

329
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,370
I know you were scared.

330
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,660
I wasn't scared.

331
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,620
My goodness.

332
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,820
Are you angry? You sound really sensitive.

333
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,250
You just sounded sensitive which
is how you normally talk.

334
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,310
How I normally talk?

335
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,620
No one's ever told me that I'm sensitive.

336
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,620
They all probably say it behind your back.

337
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,720
You're really sensitive.

338
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,860
You really startled me when we first met.

339
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,240
You were the most sensitive
person I had ever met.

340
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,840
But of course,
you're sweet as ever right now.

341
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,490
Come to think of it, you actually...

342
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,830
do look similar.

343
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,930
Look similar?

344
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,180
I sometimes tend to hear that
I look similar to actors.

345
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,220
You're like a hedgehog, Mr. Kwon.

346
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,180
- A hedgehog?
- Yes.

347
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,290
Hedgehogs are known to be...

348
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,250
very sensitive and sharp on the outside.

349
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,330
But once you get to know them,
they're cute.

350
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,590
That's what you're like.

351
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,280
You're a hedgehog.

352
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,750
A hedgehog.

353
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,090
That cotton candy looks really cute.

354
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,230
Did you see it?

355
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,000
Yes, I did.

356
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,610
I'll get one for you.

357
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,820
Sir, I'd like one teddy bear cotton candy.

358
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,240
I'm sorry. I'm done for the day.

359
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,040
What?

360
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,390
Sir, I'm sorry to ask you this,
but can you please make me one?

361
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,790
Your cotton candy might console
and brighten someone's life.

362
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,980
It might also act as a driving
force to overcome their fear.

363
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,630
My cotton candy?

364
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,830
Yes. So please do me a favor.

365
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,930
Okay.

366
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,090
♫ <i>Times when the wind blew</i> ♫

367
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,650
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

368
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,480
Ms. Oh.

369
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:52,100
♫ <i>On that starry night</i> ♫

370
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,750
- I'm sorry.
- My goodness.

371
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,870
♫ <i>I just wanna be your star for you</i> ♫

372
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,490
Gosh.

373
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,080
It was a polar bear earlier.

374
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,510
But now, it's a black bear.

375
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,580
♫ <i>I'll embrace your day</i> ♫

376
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,640
I'm sorry.

377
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,390
I should've been careful of
every single step I took.

378
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,620
Or when I bumped into that guy,

379
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,880
I should've saved the bear
by holding it above my head.

380
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,290
It's okay.

381
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,070
The back is still clean.

382
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,340
Let's eat the back part.

383
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,958
♫ <i>I'll fill up your dark night

384
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,840
You should try some as well. Here.

385
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,830
Try it.

386
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,000
Ms. Oh.

387
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,510
What's that?

388
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,990
- Firecrackers?
- Yes.

389
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,250
I also learned about this from one
of the dramas you appeared in.

390
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,240
People always play with firecrackers
every time they come to the beach.

391
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,050
Wait there for a second.

392
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,890
There. You can look forward to it.

393
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,880
I heard there are times
when they don't work.

394
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,140
I... I wonder what's wrong.

395
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,590
I think this one's going to work, right?

396
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,690
Why would they sell something
that doesn't work?

397
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,200
I should file a complaint as
a consumer immediately...

398
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,960
and also put in a claim for damages.

399
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,840
Gosh, it's beautiful.

400
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,280
Mr. Kwon, let's put in a claim
for damages a little later...

401
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,940
and enjoy the fireworks.

402
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,460
But that's not for us.

403
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,520
It will be if we watch it together.

404
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,250
Hurry. Come on.

405
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,520
Gosh, it's so pretty.

406
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,870
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

407
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,200
What? For what?

408
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,730
I brought you all the way
here to make you happy.

409
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,580
But I was scared of all the rides,

410
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,840
I ruined the cotton candy
that you wanted to eat,

411
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,360
and the firecrackers didn't even work.

412
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,210
I feel like I ruined everything.

413
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,520
All the male characters in the
dramas you appeared in...

414
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,940
didn't seem to have a
problem making you happy.

415
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,800
I had more fun today than any
of the scenes I appeared in.

416
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,290
It's because...

417
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,100
I'm here this time with someone...

418
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,010
I truly love.

419
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,080
You're my real boyfriend,

420
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,430
and your feelings for me are real.

421
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,080
That's why I've had the best time today.

422
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,100
I swear.

423
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,430
When I'm with you, I feel certain...

424
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,650
that I'll be able to overcome
just about anything.

425
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,770
Will you be able to sleep alone today?

426
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,510
Of course.

427
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,910
Call me if anything happens.

428
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,200
I'll call even if nothing does.

429
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,670
I can't sleep without hearing your voice.

430
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,980
- Drive home safely then.
- Sure.

431
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,790
You didn't have to pick me up.

432
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,520
I hope I didn't cause you
any inconvenience today.

433
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,150
It's all right.

434
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,400
Nothing more will happen now,
so you don't need to worry.

435
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,390
Right.

436
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,280
Mr. Kwon, why are you suddenly speeding up?

437
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,110
No reason.

438
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,310
You should head upstairs first.

439
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,840
I need to make a phone call.

440
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,410
- I'll get going then.
- Sure.

441
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,280
What the...

442
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,390
Who do you think you are?

443
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,430
Taking photos without permission...

444
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,810
can be a violation of
one's portrait rights.

445
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,570
In the case of sexual humiliation,

446
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,310
you may be charged with violation of
the special act on sexual assault.

447
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,500
I wasn't taking photos of you.

448
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,500
No, they were of me.

449
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,960
I'd rather you never do
anything like this again.

450
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,310
Actually, I should tell him that myself.

451
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,950
(Call number)

452
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,290
This is Oh Yun Seo.

453
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,690
Things were too hectic last
night to properly greet you.

454
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,940
I didn't think I'd have
to speak to you again,

455
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,170
but if you keep having people tail me,

456
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,210
we might have to meet...

457
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,600
in court.

458
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,400
You've gotten bolder...

459
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,610
since the last time I saw you.

460
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,200
That's right.
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

461
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,430
I'm taking this with me.

462
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,390
I'll need evidence
if I'm to take him to court.

463
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,660
Darn it.

464
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,250
How did you know?

465
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,010
You kept glancing at the
mirror while driving.

466
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,010
I saw that a car was following us.

467
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,660
You then told me to head upstairs first,

468
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,340
so I knew you were going
to approach the car.

469
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,730
I stayed to call the police
if things got out of hand.

470
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,690
Clever, aren't I?

471
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,390
Are you sure you're all right?

472
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,800
Yes, of course. It's like I said.

473
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,400
We'll get through this together.

474
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,250
Are you actually thinking
about pressing charges?

475
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,750
I don't know.

476
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,190
I gave him a warning,
so we'll wait and see.

477
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,880
To be honest, I don't want...

478
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,880
to be associated with him again.

479
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,150
Aren't Mr. Kwon and Ms. Oh
joining us for coffee?

480
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,950
They seem to be busy.

481
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,650
I don't think I've seen Ms. Dan either.

482
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,730
She said she was stopping
by the court today.

483
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,040
- Everyone, good morning.
- There she is.

484
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,570
I see that you're all here.

485
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,670
Ms. Dan, what's wrong?

486
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,130
Are you protesting because I
told you to up your performance?

487
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,590
If you thought this would
scare me, you were right.

488
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,610
I'm terrified.

489
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,710
Mr. Yeon,

490
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,940
you and your jokes.

491
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,480
I'm sorry for my low-performance level.

492
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,720
Starting today, I,
Dan Moon Hee, will live up...

493
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,240
to your expectations.

494
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,490
I'll do my best.

495
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,890
Did you hear that?

496
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,510
Am I the only one who's scared?

497
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,140
Doesn't this terrify anyone else?

498
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,110
Mr. Yeon, why are you being this way?

499
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,820
I quite like Ms. Dan's new look.

500
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,500
You know what they say.

501
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,730
"There's no fault with
a woman's transformation."

502
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,570
All right then. I'll get...

503
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,220
to work.

504
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,650
Honestly, I'm petrified.

505
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,420
It's not like you to
take her side like that.

506
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,270
It reminded me of the old times.

507
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,260
When I went on a trip to Spain,

508
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,660
I grew sick and tired of my perfect image,

509
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,150
so I dressed like a gypsy
throughout my vacation.

510
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,020
Are you saying her look is
equivalent of your gypsy style?

511
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,300
Not exactly.

512
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,430
However, when you want
to let go of yourself...

513
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,550
but others try to stop you,

514
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,130
it makes you want to act out more.

515
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,030
What are you doing in my office?

516
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,130
Well, there's something I'd like to ask.

517
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,660
Do you have any plans for tonight?

518
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,420
No, I don't have anything special.

519
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,040
Then would you like to have dinner with me?

520
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,660
What?

521
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,580
I'm to thank you for the
ukulele with drinks, remember?

522
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,900
I thought I'd buy some today.

523
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,230
I came across the fact that
it's your birthday today.

524
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,970
So how about a meal and a few drinks?

525
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,880
Is this really a gift?

526
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,250
Sorry?

527
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,420
Why would I have drinks
with you on my birthday?

528
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,480
I have dinner plans with my mother tonight.

529
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,450
Since I'm without a girlfriend this year,

530
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,830
and there's no one I particularly like,

531
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,860
I booked a French restaurant
for me and my mother.

532
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,330
That means I'll have to
take a rain check...

533
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,970
on those drinks.

534
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,200
Please leave now.

535
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,510
Sure.

536
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,250
You little punk.

537
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,120
Is that all you can do?

538
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,690
Tell me!

539
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,820
Mr. Lee.

540
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,140
What is it?

541
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,680
What's that serious face?
You're scaring me.

542
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,430
The thing is... Mr. Yeon.

543
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,290
I'm afraid we won't be able to...

544
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,130
cast Yun Seo for this drama.

545
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,360
What are you talking about?

546
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,430
I'm sorry, Mr. Yeon.

547
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,860
There was a company that
promised to invest in us,

548
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,710
but I guess they heard rumors
that Yun Seo was a candidate...

549
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,410
for the female lead of the drama.

550
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,550
And the president of that company said...

551
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,840
he doesn't want Yun Seo to be in the drama.

552
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,620
Why? Because of the scandal?

553
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,090
We're not sure why either.

554
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,610
This is so unfair.

555
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,600
You all know Yun Seo is working
at a law firm as a secretary...

556
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,880
in order to shoot this drama.

557
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,330
We also know that and want to...

558
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,860
go with Yun Seo if possible.

559
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,670
But what choice do we have?
We have to receive the investment...

560
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,370
and make this drama work.

561
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,840
It's been months since an
investor contacted us,

562
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,730
so there is nothing we can do either.

563
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,720
Sir, I'm really sorry...

564
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,660
but can you give me the
number of that investor?

565
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,780
I'll meet him in person
and try to persuade him.

566
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,350
What?

567
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,460
The CEO of an investment company?

568
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,700
So when did you plan on meeting him?

569
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,460
I'll go too then.

570
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,340
I'll go with you and persuade him.

571
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,550
Yes. I'll see you after work.

572
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,280
Is something wrong?

573
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,010
It's nothing.

574
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,730
I was mistaken again.

575
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,470
Tell me the truth!

576
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,850
It's a misunderstanding.

577
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,010
A misunderstanding?

578
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,290
My wife told me that you said...

579
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,610
men who make women cry are scumbags...

580
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,870
and told her to split up
with me and get a divorce!

581
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,310
Wait a second. That wasn't
what I meant at all!

582
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,220
On top of that, you gave her
this handkerchief...

583
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,730
and told her to keep it as a gift!

584
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,720
If that's not hitting on someone, what is?

585
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,260
That's just because she blew her nose,

586
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,760
and snot was all over my handkerchief...

587
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,830
Forget it. You're lucky that we made up.

588
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,530
If we didn't, what did you intend to do?

589
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,450
We're you really thinking
of dating my wife?

590
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,100
I thought you were an expert
in handling divorces.

591
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,600
You're just an expert at seducing women!

592
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,940
Watch your mouth.

593
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,310
If you keep this up,
I won't tolerate it any longer.

594
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,810
If you won't, what will you do?

595
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,390
What will you do, you jerk!

596
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,400
- Who are you?
- I'm Attorney Dan Moon Hee.

597
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:35,960
You seem to be mistaken.
Mr. Choi isn't that kind of person.

598
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,830
He's a very warmhearted and kind man.

599
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,320
He's not someone who hits
on his clients so cheaply.

600
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,430
What do you know to butt in?

601
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,000
I know well enough.

602
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,870
So you should leave now.

603
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,680
If you don't want to be sued for
obstruction of business, slandering,

604
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,840
and even assault.

605
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,110
You didn't forget that this place
is a law firm, did you?

606
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,390
Honey, let's just go.

607
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,490
You shouldn't be seduced by men like him.

608
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,580
All right.

609
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,870
- I'm afraid.
- Don't be.

610
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,480
I'm scared.

611
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,630
Are you okay, Ms. Dan?

612
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,490
Yes, I'm fine.

613
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,420
I'm sorry.

614
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,860
- Why did you get involved...
- Today is your birthday.

615
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,320
I couldn't let you be assaulted
on your own birthday.

616
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,440
Just consider it as your birthday gift.

617
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,610
What is this?

618
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,410
The only person who protects
me in case I get hurt...

619
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,350
is my mom.

620
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,760
Let's go home.

621
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,490
I'll give you a ride.

622
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,940
It's okay. I have dinner plans tonight.

623
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,600
With whom?

624
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,420
I'm not sure. Do I have to
report to you every time?

625
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:08,230
Actually, I'm having dinner
with the CEO of my agency.

626
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,060
He wants to have a talk.

627
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,090
I'll call you after dinner.

628
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,750
- Mr. Yeon.
- Yes?

629
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,780
Don't worry too much.

630
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,510
We can solve any misunderstandings
as we talk tonight.

631
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,330
Yes, Yun Seo. You're right.

632
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:46,760
You've been working hard lately,
and you even know how to console me.

633
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,950
You're all grown up now.

634
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:53,190
By the way, look at the time.
What's taking him so long?

635
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,890
He's here.

636
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,680
Wait. How could you...

637
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:26,530
It's been a while, Mr. Yeon.

638
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,480
And Ms. Oh.

639
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,310
Did I make you wait too long?

640
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,570
Let's see.

641
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,090
What did Ms. Oh use to like?

642
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,650
What do you think you're doing?

643
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,660
Get up, Yun Seo. Let's go.

644
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:52,780
Are you giving up...

645
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,560
on the drama like this?

646
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,380
Yes. We won't shoot this drama.

647
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,760
What are you doing? Let's go.

648
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,140
Ms. Oh seems to have a different opinion.

649
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,330
Sit down, Mr. Yeon.

650
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,230
I have something to say.

651
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,470
Yun Seo.

652
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,510
I thought I made it clear earlier.

653
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,490
That I don't want to see you ever again.

654
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,750
I also told you earlier.
You've gotten bolder...

655
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,220
since the last time I saw you.

656
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,760
Back then, I had a lot to lose...

657
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,830
but now, I have nothing left.

658
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:33,790
You have nothing to lose?

659
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:37,210
You even work at a law firm in order
to make your comeback in a drama.

660
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,760
You seem to be seriously
mistaken about something.

661
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,810
I don't have to shoot that drama.

662
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,030
Like you said,
I'm more than happy right now.

663
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,970
Don't get off.

664
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:29,070
- Go home safely.
- Okay. Good night.

665
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,470
What on earth is happening?

666
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:46,220
Then will her drama appearance
really be canceled?

667
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,440
But Yun Seo seems better than I expected.

668
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,540
I know, right?

669
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,340
Aren't we going?

670
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,590
Why are you resting your head too?

671
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,650
I'm sorry.

672
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:28,500
("Love Hurts")

673
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,780
The caller you have dialed is
not answering the phone...

674
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,800
I got home safely.

675
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,320
I'll see you tomorrow.

676
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,470
Is there something wrong?

677
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,620
(I got home safely. I'll see you tomorrow.)

678
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,120
Have a good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

679
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,400
Jung Ji Ho, the CEO of Giant Foods,

680
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,580
who got indicted for having gambled abroad,

681
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,300
got sentenced to two years in jail...

682
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,800
with a stay of execution for three years.

683
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,230
People are criticizing that the
punishment is way too weak.

684
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,410
However, the justice department
claimed that Mr. Jung...

685
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:36,460
admitted to all the charges...

686
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,380
and showed signs of deep regret.

687
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,600
Are you okay?

688
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,740
Of course not.

689
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,310
How about we go out for some soju?

690
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,330
Jung Ji Ho did more than
just gamble abroad.

691
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,600
He also embezzled more
than 20 million dollars.

692
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,580
The thought of having a jerk like
that back in society is just...

693
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,230
Do you think you'll be able to give up?

694
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,860
I have no other choice.

695
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,260
At least for now.

696
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,570
For now?

697
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,650
By the way, why do you look so down?

698
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,850
Can you tell me everything you
know about Lee Gang Joon?

699
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,930
Did he show up in front of Yun Seo?

700
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:41,850
He even made someone tail her.

701
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,160
What?

702
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,710
He secretly took photos of her,

703
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:47,960
and I have the memory card
from the camera as proof. But...

704
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,340
But?

705
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,790
But I don't think she wants
to cause a fuss about it yet.

706
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,750
Gosh, of course.

707
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:58,520
It took so long for the
huge scandal to die away.

708
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,530
I feel so frustrated...

709
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,050
because there's nothing I can do.

710
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,260
I'll try to look into him.

711
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,960
You're a hedgehog.

712
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,310
Why aren't you coming?

713
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,650
Oh, right.

714
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,140
You can go home first.
I need to go somewhere.

715
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,390
- Who is it?
- I'm a hedgehog.

716
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,360
What?

717
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,250
Do you like it?

718
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,230
I can't always be by your side.

719
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:18,570
I thought it could keep you company
when I'm not there.

720
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,390
Yes, I really like it.

721
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:32,310
But you don't look so happy.

722
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,260
Mr. Kwon.

723
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,140
I might not be able to
go to the law firm...

724
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,190
for a while.

725
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:47,150
I'll try to keep my promise and
work there for three months.

726
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,350
And I'll also do my best...

727
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,630
to complete all the work...

728
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,260
that I was given.

729
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,250
But...

730
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,050
I don't think I can go to work...

731
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:04,030
for the time being.

732
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,500
I can't seem to do it.

733
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,000
Is there something wrong?

734
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,940
Why all of a sudden?

735
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,580
I'm sorry.

736
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,970
I can't tell you anything right now.

737
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,440
Yun Seo won't be starring in the drama?

738
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,700
Gosh, why don't you just
broadcast it to everyone?

739
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,620
I'm sorry.

740
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,020
I was so shocked that I
talked without thinking.

741
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,630
It must feel so devastating.
What are we going to do?

742
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,110
Yes, I know.

743
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,720
Yun Seo...

744
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,570
The members of her fan site are
going to be so devastated.

745
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,960
They're waiting so desperately
for her to make a comeback...

746
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,690
through Lee Se Jin's drama.

747
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,690
And they're barely enduring the wait...

748
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:04,300
by making memes of her smiling and winking.

749
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,070
So imagine how devastated they'll
be once they hear this news.

750
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,120
Gosh, Joon Gyu.

751
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,720
Do you still create memes and
upload them on her fan site?

752
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,970
Why don't you just
broadcast it to everyone?

753
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:17,240
You're the only one that knows I'm
the founder of her fan site...

754
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,440
and that I'm also the
anonymous vice president.

755
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:24,520
You don't know how happy it
feels to support someone...

756
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,320
behind their back without them knowing.

757
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,330
Joon Gyu. Joon Gyu.

758
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:31,660
You really do have a way
of upsetting people.

759
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,190
That's not the problem right now.

760
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,060
What I'm trying to say is that
there are a lot of people...

761
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,550
waiting for Yun Seo to make a comeback.

762
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,270
I feel so sorry for Yun Seo.

763
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,820
I could see that she was
getting used to the work here.

764
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,980
But now, all her effort
would've been for nothing.

765
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:50,390
That's why I came to tell you that
Yun Seo won't be coming to work...

766
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,750
- starting from today.
- Okay.

767
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:57,310
But people will be really curious
because they don't know the story.

768
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,350
What should I tell them?

769
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,580
Just tell them that she's sick.

770
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,370
I'll try to think of how we
should deal with the rest.

771
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,450
- Did you eat garlic?
- Yes.

772
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,530
My gosh, no wonder.

773
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:22,410
What is that you need to tell us?

774
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,990
Is it a big announcement?

775
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,770
Well, not exactly. It's just a notice.

776
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:30,780
The thing is, Yun Seo is sick,

777
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,180
so she'll be taking a few days off.

778
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,600
My goodness, how bad is it?

779
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:39,020
For how long is she going to be absent?

780
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,140
I'm not sure.

781
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,460
We'll have to see.
Anyway, just keep that in mind.

782
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,990
And since Yun Seo won't be around,
Ms. Yang and the interns...

783
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,330
should help Jung Rok out...

784
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:51,080
- whenever you guys have time.
- Okay.

785
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,270
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

786
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,500
Okay, let's get back to work.

787
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:11,570
Mr. Kwon, your client I told
you about yesterday is here.

788
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,030
I'm talking about the case
that Ms. Dan was in charge of...

789
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,350
but got declined because
she didn't seem fit for the job.

790
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,700
- The overseas gambling case.
- Right.

791
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,150
He's here right now,
so I'll send him to your office.

792
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,460
Okay.

793
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,880
First, you need to write
a letter of apology...

794
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,660
to hand in to the justice department.

795
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,050
You need to say that you
regret what you did...

796
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,890
and that you'll never gamble again.

797
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:47,530
You also need to receive
counseling from a psychiatrist...

798
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:50,920
and hand in the counseling records
or diagnosis for assessment.

799
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,540
Will that help me not
get sentenced to jail?

800
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,930
I can't be sure, but you have
no similar previous convictions.

801
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:01,280
So if you receive counseling and
prove that it's not habitual,

802
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:02,670
you can avoid going to prison.

803
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,270
This is only possible because
you only gambled a small amount.

804
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:10,680
I'm sure you heard the news.

805
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,720
If the amount were
millions like Jung Ji Ho,

806
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,620
you'd have to be in custody.

807
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,670
Jung Ji Ho?

808
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:18,340
His case is still a mystery to me.

809
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,150
What do you mean?

810
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:24,190
There's a rumor going around
our particular circle.

811
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,750
Jung Ji Ho...

812
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,350
isn't a gambler.

813
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,510
Sorry? What do you mean?

814
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,020
The NCT Hotel in Macao...

815
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,250
that Jung Ji Ho gambled at...

816
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,600
is where I'm a regular at.

817
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,250
Someone I know there...

818
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,830
works on the security team.

819
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:50,190
He says that he only saw Jung Ji Ho once...

820
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,000
on the day that he was
arrested for gambling.

821
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,440
It's odd because news reports say...

822
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:58,100
that he repeatedly came to gamble there.

823
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,770
It's like saying that someone drove...

824
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,400
while intoxicated...

825
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,210
when they didn't even
have a drop of alcohol.

826
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:31,450
Did you call?

827
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,880
Well, you see...

828
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,500
I'd like the bank account transactions...

829
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,130
of Attorney Choi Yoon Su.

830
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,910
Attorney Choi Yoon Su? Isn't he...

831
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,020
He's Jung Ji Ho's attorney,

832
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,940
and I have some questions.

833
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,350
But Mr. Kim...

834
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:51,400
I can't let this case slide like this.

835
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,620
I'll take full responsibility.

836
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,360
All right then.

837
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,620
Jung Rok?

838
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:12,840
Lee Gang Joon's got into a
lot of trouble abroad too.

839
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,550
Each time, he solved it with money though.

840
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:17,470
It's about Jung Ji Ho.

841
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,910
I'm not 100 percent sure,

842
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:23,950
but I hear that he
actually wasn't a gambler.

843
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,500
That's absurd.

844
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,070
It's certain that he gambled overseas.

845
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:31,830
He went in and out of Macao,

846
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,230
and photos put him at the casino.

847
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:37,530
Here. I have it on screen.

848
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,170
Who do you think you are?

849
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,540
- What is it?
- That man.

850
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,710
He was tailing Ms. Oh Jin Sim
per Lee Gang Joon's request.

851
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:02,370
Which overseas branch was
Lee Gang Joon placed at?

852
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,470
Macao.

853
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,390
Come to think of it,
these two have the same attorney.

854
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,600
Choi Yoon Su.

855
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,230
He argued for Lee Gang Joon on
his drug charge two years ago,

856
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,800
and now he's Jung Ji Ho's attorney.

857
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:37,980
I heard you were sick. How are you feeling?

858
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,120
(Ms. Yang Eun Ji)

859
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,560
Ms. Oh!

860
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:22,370
I thought you called in sick today.

861
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,350
I'm not here to work today.

862
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,470
Today, I'm here as a client.

863
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:36,350
Is Mr. Kwon inside?

864
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,330
Lee Gang Joon...

865
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,900
I'd like to press charges against him.

866
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:18,460
These are the photos and
threatening texts...

867
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,790
that he sent me.

868
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,700
I held onto them.

869
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,360
Will that be enough for evidence?

870
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,020
Of course.

871
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:29,850
This time,

872
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,730
make him pay for what he did.

873
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,110
Of course. I'll make sure of it.

874
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,290
Thank you for driving me home.

875
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,710
Are you sure you're all right?

876
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:03,080
Yes, I'm fine.

877
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,400
Actually,

878
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,510
I was so scared and terrified...

879
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:11,250
that I couldn't get
myself to think about it.

880
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:15,250
Trying to forget it and
pretending to be all right...

881
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:18,630
didn't make the pain go away.

882
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:24,940
That's why I'm mustering up the courage...

883
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,120
and putting my faith in you.

884
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,920
Of course. From now on, you can trust me.

885
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:48,130
You're home.

886
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,580
I missed you.

887
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:32,190
I love you, Yun Seo.

888
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,360
I know you still love me too.

889
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,380
You pretend to be angry
just to get my attention.

890
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:46,090
That's why you're pretending
to like that man.

891
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:48,760
You're trying to provoke me.

892
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,260
Don't come closer.

893
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:53,040
If you do,

894
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,680
I'll call the police.

895
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,300
The police?

896
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:09,740
I see you still have no idea
what I'm capable of.

897
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:27,470
Be honest with yourself now
and say that you love me.

898
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,240
Say that you need me
and that you'll never betray me!

899
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,330
Stay away from my girl.

905
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,710
(Touch Your Heart)

906
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:41,800
I want you to be the leading lady
of my drama series.

907
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,570
Will she go back to acting?

908
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:46,090
She came to work here
because it's what she wants.

909
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,530
I'm sure she'll stay in this field.

910
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:50,050
The people at your law firm
will be shocked.

911
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,990
- Is she playing an attorney?
- Especially Kwon Jung Rok.

912
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:56,160
I need nothing else but to be by your side.

913
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:00,120
I'm like a rose, and you're a vase
that can embrace me.

914
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:01,620
What will I do with you?

915
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,010
There's no way they're dating.

916
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,790
- My gosh.
- You know something, don't you?

917
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:07,080
I probably don't.

918
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:08,660
I know it's a cliche,

919
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,850
Can you break up for Yun Seo's sake?

920
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,000
Are my feelings for Ms. Oh...

921
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,860
putting her in trouble?

922
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,140
