00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:41,061
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,549
I'm more scared about losing you than losing an opportunity...

3
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,906
in this industry because of a scandal.

4
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,952
So...

5
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,865
let's start over again.

6
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:02,710
Are you still not going to hold onto me?

7
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,443
If you let go now,

8
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,560
we'll never get to see each other again.

9
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,531
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

10
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:48,511
I love you.

11
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,359
(Episode 15)

12
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:29,252
We're here already.

13
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,825
Why is my place so nearby?

14
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:39,779
I don't want to go home today.

15
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,923
I want to be with you.

16
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,185
To be honest, I feel the same way.

17
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:53,150
Can I go home after I see you fall asleep?

18
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:11,268
It takes quite a while for me to fall asleep.

19
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,162
That's better.

20
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,311
That means I'll get to see you for a long time.

21
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,926
My insomnia never really bothered me.

22
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,335
But after we broke up, my insomnia started...

23
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,511
giving me a hard time.

24
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:32,409
I had to stay up all night thinking about you.

25
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,537
When was the hardest for you?

26
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,250
Never mind. You were probably fine because you were so busy.

27
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,213
Who says I didn't have a hard time?

28
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,588
I had a hard time every night and every morning.

29
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,510
I had a hard time working and going to trials.

30
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:57,478
Every minute of the day was difficult for me.

31
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,645
Really?

32
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:01,739
Did you really have that much of a hard time?

33
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,002
Are you that happy to hear that I had a hard time?

34
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:09,276
Of course. That shows how much you really liked me.

35
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,975
Oddly enough, I feel very relieved now.

36
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:26,522
Let's never break up again.

37
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,014
Let's promise each other...

38
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,189
that we'll never let go of each other's hands.

39
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:37,225
Okay, I promise.

40
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:41,525
I won't ever let go.

41
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:45,813
And I'll protect you.

42
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,583
The reason I left you was...

43
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,287
because I didn't want to bother you...

44
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:58,207
since it was such an important time in your career.

45
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,211
And I still feel the same way.

46
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,589
So for the sake of protecting you,

47
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:08,233
we should do a better job in keeping our relationship a secret.

48
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,669
We should do a better job in keeping our relationship a secret?

49
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,913
Yes, we can't have anyone take photos of us like last time.

50
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:17,463
So we should refrain from meeting outside.

51
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:20,103
We should meet up in confined areas...

52
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:23,378
such as your place or mine from now on.

53
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,350
Confined areas?

54
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,441
Yes.

55
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,529
A secret and quiet place where there's no one else...

56
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,910
but the two of us.

57
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,720
Is it okay...

58
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,425
if I spend the night here?

59
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,009
I won't ever cross this line.

60
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,126
I promised you earlier that I'll protect you.

61
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,584
Oh, okay.

62
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,897
Thank you so much for protecting me.

63
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,117
- Good morning, Mr. Kwon. - Good morning.

64
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,330
It must've been uncomfortable for you to sleep in that.

65
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:20,441
It's okay.

66
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,500
What's your schedule for today?

67
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:24,157
I'm not that busy today.

68
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:26,995
My shoot starts at 1pm,

69
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,757
and it'll probably end at about 7pm.

70
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,631
Then we can have dinner together.

71
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,631
- I'll call as soon as I'm done. - Okay.

72
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,361
Who's here so early in the morning?

73
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,190
It's my manager. What are we going to do?

74
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:46,009
- Yun Seo. - He'll be suspicious of us...

75
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:47,444
if he sees us together at this hour.

76
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:51,158
- Let's pretend like we're not here. - Yun Seo.

77
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,029
No, we can't do that. He knows the passcode.

78
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,269
If I don't answer, he'll probably just come in.

79
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,018
- What should I do? - Why does he know your passcode?

80
00:07:58,201 --> 00:07:59,269
I get that he's your manager, but he should...

81
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,655
- respect your privacy. - I'm going in.

82
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:05,620
What...

83
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,736
You should hide here for now.

84
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:11,163
What? Ms. Oh.

85
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,961
My gosh.

86
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,311
Hey, you're up.

87
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,355
I thought you were sleeping because you didn't open the door.

88
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,479
Oh, well...

89
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:26,323
I was using the blender.

90
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,113
That's why I didn't hear you ring the bell.

91
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:32,927
What brings you here so early in the morning?

92
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:34,969
Doesn't the shoot start at 1pm?

93
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,080
I got a call saying they changed the time.

94
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:39,404
Your shoot starts at 11am, so we need to get going.

95
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,491
I see. Okay.

96
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,407
I'll get ready really quickly and meet you downstairs.

97
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:46,419
You can wait for me in the car.

98
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,050
- I'll be right there. - Okay, don't take too long.

99
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,100
Okay.

100
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,256
Oh, I almost forgot. Yun Seo, let me use your bathroom.

101
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,980
Hyuk Joon!

102
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,359
- What? - I'm sorry.

103
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,553
Can you not go to the bathroom?

104
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:06,022
- Why not? - What?

105
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,539
- Well, the thing is... - Yun Seo.

106
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,349
I'm really sorry, but my bladder is about to burst.

107
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,150
- Please let me in. - No, wait.

108
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,550
- No, I really need to go. - Hyuk Joon!

109
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:17,935
I really need to go.

110
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:20,000
My gosh.

111
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:30,359
Yun Seo, how long are you going to stand there?

112
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:33,830
- Oh, right. I'm... I'm sorry. - Yes, you should be.

113
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,888
You should feel sorry for my bladder. Please leave.

114
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,452
- Go. - Okay.

115
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,581
Hurry.

116
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,761
Got you!

117
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,490
Mr. Kwon?

118
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,620
Yes, this is he. An investigation by the prosecution?

119
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,770
Gosh.

120
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,841
You see...

121
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:36,649
My gosh. It wasn't me!

122
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:39,091
Goodness...

123
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:40,983
My gosh,

124
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,281
Mr. Kwon.

125
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,637
It's all right. I was going to shower anyway.

126
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,410
(Singil 3-dong Morning Soccer Club)

127
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,795
Oh, dear.

128
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,987
I'm glad that he had something like this in his car.

129
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:05,759
I'll wash this and get it back to you.

130
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,044
So what's going on?

131
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,131
Why are you here this morning?

132
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,144
No way. Hold on.

133
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,454
Did you sleep here?

134
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:17,670
- No! - Yes.

135
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:19,660
No and yes. Yes and no!

136
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,889
That says it all. Mr. Kwon,

137
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:24,637
it's true that I approve of you two dating,

138
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,979
but this is completely inappropriate.

139
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,020
Hyuk Joon!

140
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,667
Mr. Kwon, you should get going.

141
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:33,343
You barely have time to go home and get changed.

142
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,562
Come on.

143
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,958
Mr. Kwon, I'm not finished, you know.

144
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:45,350
Does she not know how messed up this is?

145
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,380
Here.

146
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:58,162
- Bye. - I'll get going then.

147
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:16,160
Hyuk Joon, how could you say that to him...

148
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:18,629
when he got hosed down because of you?

149
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,681
Yun Seo.

150
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,137
He may have gotten hosed down, but I was struck by a lightning.

151
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,510
How can you bring him home when you've barely been dating?

152
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,879
What should I do then? Be with him on the streets...

153
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,950
and get photographed?

154
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:36,119
If you at least get photographed outside,

155
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,697
I can make up a cover story.

156
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,020
If he's photographed on his way out of here,

157
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:41,520
that's a done deal.

158
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:45,219
We're aware of that, so we take necessary precautions.

159
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,322
You approved our relationship, so just let us be.

160
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:49,470
Pretend you didn't see anything.

161
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,925
That's what I want to do,

162
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:01,387
but I'm worried that you'd get caught.

163
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,399
I approved, but my brain still doesn't allow it.

164
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:05,193
It's driving me insane too.

165
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,862
What are you looking at?

166
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:24,865
What's this? I was wondering where you were.

167
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:26,612
Were you out playing soccer?

168
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,370
Hold on. Singil 3-dong Morning Soccer Club?

169
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,153
Why go that far to play soccer?

170
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,221
They must be good.

171
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,192
Let me join you next time.

172
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,810
You'll never be able to join me there.

173
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:44,274
What? Why not?

174
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,768
Are they picky with the members they accept?

175
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,363
I'm quite good, you know.

176
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:51,786
Just know that it's not a place for you.

177
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,811
Seriously?

178
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,997
Just how good is he at soccer to shut me out?

179
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:16,901
Who knew that I'd end up doing this?

180
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:31,374
You finish around 7pm,

181
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:32,845
but I'm texting in advance because I miss you.

182
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,583
Are you done filming?

183
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:39,671
I think it'll be over soon. How about some dinner?

184
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:41,821
That'd be great.

185
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,462
Then I'll see you at my place.

186
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,402
Will I be hosed down again?

187
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,346
Of course not. I'm changing my lock combination...

188
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,865
as soon as I get home today.

189
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,962
Then I'll bring you sushi, your favorite.

190
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,570
Yes, I'm just about to...

191
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:18,176
I'm sorry, but I'll have to stay for some additional scenes.

192
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:20,802
I'm afraid I'll have to take a rain check.

193
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,574
I see. Well, it can't be helped.

194
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,080
Please don't tell me you already bought the sushi.

195
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,039
No, not yet.

196
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,910
Please don't worry about me and focus on your work.

197
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,071
Sure. I'll see you.

198
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,235
I'm home.

199
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,386
Wait. Why are you eating two portions alone?

200
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,549
One must be for me.

201
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:09,044
Not exactly.

202
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,383
Then who is it for?

203
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,599
I bought them both for me.

204
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,115
Boy, you're selfish.

205
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,699
You joined a good soccer club all by yourself...

206
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,791
and now you're eating two plates of the same sushi.

207
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,404
- You've changed. You know that? - That's not it.

208
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:28,465
Starting now,

209
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,971
I'll teach you the virtue of sharing.

210
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,292
Watch and learn. This is how a society works.

211
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,943
See?

212
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,881
Eat up then.

213
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:50,565
What do you mean you have something to say?

214
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,609
It's nothing big. The actors signed with my agency...

215
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,226
are getting more jobs overseas...

216
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,430
which means a variety of global contracts.

217
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,276
I was thinking about hiring a law firm...

218
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,764
as our legal adviser.

219
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,140
So you want our firm on retainer.

220
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:10,959
I'm not sure. I get what you're saying,

221
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,587
- but it might not be up to you. - What?

222
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:17,400
I'm sure you're aware of the hottest case in Korea.

223
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:18,430
It's the Im Yun Hee Case.

224
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:19,683
Who solved it?

225
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,360
Always Law Firm did.

226
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:27,170
If you're going to say something, at least say the truth.

227
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,210
It was Attorney Kwon's doing, not your firm's.

228
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:31,310
He may be a jerk, but he's talented.

229
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,421
Anyway,

230
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:36,852
because of it, my law firm has been in demand.

231
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,929
The same goes for me as well since I'm its owner and leader.

232
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,389
TV shows and magazines...

233
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,430
are all dying to get an interview with me.

234
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:48,349
I'm being contacted left and right.

235
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,830
Does that mean you won't take us on as a client?

236
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:52,830
That's not what I'm saying.

237
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,608
I'm just saying that we might not always be available.

238
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,335
That's too bad. Not available, you say?

239
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,676
If you take us on as a client, you'll enjoy a year-end party...

240
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:06,361
with the actors and artists.

241
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:10,949
Also, in the summer at Waikiki Beach,

242
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,767
we'll go camping and play beach volleyball.

243
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,602
Toss!

244
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,273
My ball!

245
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,089
You could enjoy it too, so I'm sad to hear that.

246
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,171
You should get going then.

247
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,037
Jun Seok, my little brother Jun Seok.

248
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,997
Don't you know a joke when you hear one?

249
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,734
Did you think I'd ignore my brother's request?

250
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,413
How do you get by in life being this naive?

251
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,379
Bring me the contract, and I'll sign it instantly.

252
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,300
My big brother!

253
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,920
Gosh.

254
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,887
Also, the team working on Yun Seo's TV series...

255
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,907
is looking for an advisory counsel.

256
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,060
An advisory counsel?

257
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,290
You know, an expert...

258
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,694
who advises the staff and writers on legal jargon.

259
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:58,460
They're looking for someone who Yun Seo knows well.

260
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:00,450
I can be that expert. There's me.

261
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,665
- You're an attorney too, right? - Of course I am.

262
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,150
It's too bad though.

263
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,458
You said you're not available.

264
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:11,427
Can you ask someone else to do it?

265
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,480
My cute little brother, just let me do it.

266
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:16,167
No, you make me nervous.

267
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:19,219
You'll probably annoy the actors on set...

268
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:21,714
and make animated photos.

269
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,638
Have someone else do it.

270
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:25,949
I doubt anyone would be willing to do it.

271
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:27,503
An advisory counsel?

272
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:30,426
Yes, I'm sure no one would like to do it.

273
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:33,070
It's exhausting, it's a hassle, and it'll waste your time.

274
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,199
I doubt anyone would want to do it.

275
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,756
No, I don't.

276
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,540
I have enough cases on my plate right now,

277
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,268
and I don't want entertainment agencies...

278
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:44,511
handing out there business cards trying to scout me.

279
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:45,861
I'll pass too.

280
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,009
Okay, then I'll take the job.

281
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,349
I bet you're delighted.

282
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,846
You'll see Ms. Oh often when you're on set.

283
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,212
Well, I guess that's highly possible.

284
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,678
I heard they need an advisory counsel starting today,

285
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:01,054
so I'll be the one to do it.

286
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,400
No.

287
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,471
I'll do it.

288
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:12,909
Am I hearing things right now?

289
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,295
Mr. Kwon, can you say that one more time?

290
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:19,508
I said, "I will do it." The advisory counsel.

291
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,017
Mr. Kwon, don't you hate those kinds of things?

292
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,231
Yes, well...

293
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,844
It sounds like a good idea to gain more experience.

294
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:39,102
Mr. Kwon, if someone does something that he usually never does, he dies.

295
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,360
So don't mind stuff like this as per usual,

296
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,399
and keep up the fight for justice.

297
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,662
No. I will be the advisory counsel.

298
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,792
What's your problem? You're so annoying.

299
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:51,439
Is it because of the interview from the Park Su Myeong Case...

300
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,810
a few days ago? Are you enjoying all the attention or what?

301
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:55,449
Why are you trying to show off?

302
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,491
I'm not showing off.

303
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:58,480
Why did you ask for volunteers in the first place then?

304
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:00,238
Forget it. Let's vote then.

305
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,301
Vote?

306
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:04,490
Yes. If he makes a mistake at the filming site,

307
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:06,230
he'll ruin the reputation of our law firm.

308
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,462
So let's vote on who will represent Always Law Firm.

309
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:13,129
Let's see who is more fit for this position.

310
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,705
Just like democratic citizens, let's decide by voting on it.

311
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:24,771
(Yeon Joon Gyu, 1 vote Kwon Jung Rok, 4 votes)

312
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:30,195
I'll get going then.

313
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,989
Ms. Oh Jin Sim. I have good news.

314
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,318
We have a chance to finally meet.

315
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,270
I will visit your filming site...

316
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:56,926
as an advisory counsel...

317
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:03,646
No, I'll surprise her.

318
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,247
(Filming Team)

319
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,713
Is it because I didn't see Mr. Kwon last night?

320
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:19,839
I have no energy, and no appetite either.

321
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:22,981
I see.

322
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:26,268
I see you've left two radishes because you have no appetite.

323
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,131
It's so squeaky clean people might think you licked everything off.

324
00:22:30,241 --> 00:22:32,361
I said I don't have an appetite. I didn't say I don't like rice.

325
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,655
Yun Seo, I'm happy that you eat so well.

326
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:40,376
I'm very happy, but you have to watch your figure.

327
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,751
What if your face is all swollen up on TV?

328
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,265
By the way, you know you have a photo shoot next week, right?

329
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:50,389
Yes, I know. Don't worry. I have a conscience too, you know.

330
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:55,750
I heard this is helpful, so I'm drinking it constantly.

331
00:22:55,751 --> 00:23:00,003
Good. Gosh, you look like you're shooting a commercial right now.

332
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:01,706
Drink some more.

333
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,056
- Mr. Gong, can we talk? - Sure.

334
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,692
I miss Mr. Kwon.

335
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:19,309
I never expected Mr. Kwon doing something like that.

336
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,609
Tell me about it.

337
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,882
It's unbelievable, like seeing a mirage in a desert.

338
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,349
Hey, you're all gathered here. Is it tea time?

339
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,966
Oh, boy. That looks tasty.

340
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:36,589
Oh, right. From now on, during our meetings,

341
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:38,479
I wish someone will take some meeting minutes.

342
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,082
The typing sound from the laptop is too loud,

343
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,959
so I think someone should handwrite some meeting minutes.

344
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:45,946
Okay. I'll do it.

345
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:47,940
Oh, Hae Yeong? Do you have good handwriting?

346
00:23:47,941 --> 00:23:48,940
Yes.

347
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:52,718
But I think it should be someone who has some neat handwriting.

348
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,809
To find out, why don't we all write down some letters?

349
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,450
Write, "Minutes of Meeting" on this.

350
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:00,632
"Minutes of Meeting".

351
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:03,642
We should make sure, just in case.

352
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,383
(Minutes of Meeting)

353
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,949
(Minutes of Meeting)

354
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,360
I found it. It's this.

355
00:24:22,471 --> 00:24:24,693
This letter looks the same.

356
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,567
Mr. Choi, Ms. Dan, Hae Yeong, and Ms. Yang.

357
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:32,201
I'm very disappointed in you. I never expected this.

358
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,454
I was always so nice to you, yet you betrayed me and chose Mr. Kwon?

359
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:39,306
What are you talking about?

360
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,260
I chose you.

361
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:44,289
You received one vote, right? That was me.

362
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,300
Liar.

363
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,143
Look at this.

364
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:50,000
I compared your handwritings when you wrote Kwon Jung Rok's name...

365
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:52,496
to the handwritings that you wrote just now.

366
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:54,899
This handwriting is the only one that I don't have.

367
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,627
This is the only one.

368
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:59,233
Ms. Yang, it seems like you thought a lot about this.

369
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:03,250
You said it was an anonymous vote. How could you do this?

370
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,480
I didn't say anything. I was simply curious.

371
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:07,703
Don't worry, I won't discriminate anyone over something like this.

372
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,120
But why is there so much dust suddenly in this place?

373
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:13,341
We should all gather this weekend...

374
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:15,520
and clean this place up thoroughly.

375
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:16,945
Except for you, Mr. Lee.

376
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:19,682
I'll give you a movie ticket, so go watch a movie.

377
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,339
- Hello. - Hello.

378
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,339
Hello.

379
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,432
The advisory counsel for our drama has arrived.

380
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:50,856
Mr. Kwon, can you go over this script with me?

381
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,712
(Waiting Room, Oh Yun Seo)

382
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:57,690
Why on earth are you here?

383
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,369
How did you come?

384
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,319
You're the advisory counsel for our drama?

385
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,402
It wasn't easy to be elected as an advisory counsel.

386
00:26:05,411 --> 00:26:06,854
- Elected? - Yes.

387
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:10,011
Mr. Yeon, who enjoys being exposed to the public, outright revealed...

388
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,757
his ambition that he wanted to be your advisory counsel.

389
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,477
However, out of my determination to see you,

390
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:18,743
and despite Mr. Yeon's persuasion and criticism,

391
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,942
we eventually decided to vote on it democratically.

392
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:24,730
And I won by an overwhelming score of 4 to 1. I have been...

393
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:28,195
proudly elected as the advisory counsel of your drama!

394
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:33,971
If I think about it now, it was a really thrilling and close fight.

395
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,640
It does indeed sound thrilling.

396
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:42,074
Yes. Once I came here and saw your face,

397
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:44,402
I realized it was a great choice to participate in the vote.

398
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:48,506
But do you feel uncomfortable or pressured...

399
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:51,518
- because of my sudden visit? - No way.

400
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,145
Do you know how happy I feel right now?

401
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:57,116
I missed you so much too.

402
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,913
Yun Seo, are you in here?

403
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,845
I'm sorry. No.

404
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:07,611
How have you been? No.

405
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:10,133
- Yun Seo. Oh Yun Seo! - What?

406
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,489
We're starting the shoot. You have to come out now.

407
00:27:12,741 --> 00:27:14,740
Okay, I'm on my way.

408
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:17,205
- Mr. Kwon, you should come too. - Okay.

409
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,261
What's wrong?

410
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,053
Mr. Kwon, I understand how you feel,

411
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:29,990
but coming here as an advisory counsel seems a bit...

412
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:31,374
That's my free will.

413
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:33,754
Interfering with our relationship all the time like this...

414
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,629
is an invasion of one's freedom to pursue happiness...

415
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,752
and freedom of action, which is guaranteed by the constitution.

416
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,962
- Then... - Okay.

417
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,165
Yun Seo, don't go. Don't go with him. Wait for me.

418
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,547
Witness, you said you were at home at the day of the incident.

419
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:52,621
Is that correct?

420
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,663
Your Honor.

421
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,613
Wait, I have a question.

422
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:03,701
Mr. Kwon?

423
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,027
When I say, "Your Honor",

424
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:10,024
what is the proper hand gesture?

425
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,310
Oh, that.

426
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:13,960
Okay. Thanks.

427
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:20,539
Instead of pointing at the judge directly,

428
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,980
you should stand straight or gather your hands together.

429
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:26,333
This looks good.

430
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:28,762
Instead of this?

431
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:30,907
Using both hands is too weird.

432
00:28:31,191 --> 00:28:32,331
You should stand straight...

433
00:28:39,491 --> 00:28:40,843
Your Honor.

434
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,562
Mr. Kwon, have some coffee.

435
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,880
Thank you.

436
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:54,234
Excuse me, Mr. Kwon Jung Rok?

437
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:59,011
This part in the script is bothering me. Is this...

438
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,939
legally a correct expression?

439
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,964
(Kwon Jung Rok)

440
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:11,521
Yes. It's a very precise expression with no errors at all.

441
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:14,971
Yes.

442
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,785
Of course there aren't.

443
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,527
I can see this script has no errors at all.

444
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,217
So can we please move on to the next scene?

445
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,681
Come here. Follow me.

446
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,241
Ms. Dan.

447
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,999
Although our contract dating is over, we're still colleagues.

448
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,493
Why don't you ever talk to me and keep ignoring me?

449
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,580
Did I?

450
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:02,205
If I did, I'm sorry.

451
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,191
Wait.

452
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:08,209
Are things going well with the delivery guy you fell for...

453
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,635
- and chased after? - No.

454
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,359
I only did that out of habit because I was drunk.

455
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,735
But it was nothing sincere.

456
00:30:14,961 --> 00:30:18,059
Anyway, I wasn't supposed to flirt with anyone else,

457
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,160
but I failed to stick to it until our contract ended...

458
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:21,545
and broke the contract by doing so.

459
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,350
I'm sorry about that.

460
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,813
You should be sorry.

461
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,880
I'm not quite sure about that.

462
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:30,971
It's not like you did everything right either.

463
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:34,269
You told me that your heart feels numb when you're with me.

464
00:30:34,411 --> 00:30:37,481
There was no point in continuing our dating contract...

465
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:38,721
with someone who had no feelings for me.

466
00:30:39,411 --> 00:30:42,410
I was practically making a fool out of myself.

467
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,449
Well, then. I'll be off now.

468
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,587
What was that? She used to look at me...

469
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:57,770
with hearts in her eyes.

470
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,720
But now, she's so cold toward me.

471
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:02,091
How can someone change so drastically?

472
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:05,461
Gosh, my heart. It hurts.

473
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,692
Was I too mean?

474
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:19,578
No, there's no point in apologizing to a guy...

475
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:21,372
who has no feelings for me.

476
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,942
Let's get over him.

477
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:30,282
For some reason,

478
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,487
it feels as if my heart is empty.

479
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:37,024
Why do I feel this way?

480
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,750
(Short-term Dating Contract)

481
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:52,518
Whatever the case, our contract has come to end.

482
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:55,374
So let's forget about her now.

483
00:31:58,431 --> 00:31:59,441
Goodbye.

484
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,513
It's time to say goodbye...

485
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,042
to this chapter in my life...

486
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,557
that was full of clumsiness and innocence.

487
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:21,520
Gosh, that's hot! That's so hot!

488
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:23,308
Goodness, that's so hot!

490
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:59,361
Do you need anything?

491
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:03,771
No, I'm just here for no reason.

492
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,523
Working as an advisory counsel must've worn you out...

493
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,295
seeing that you're starting the day with a cup of coffee.

494
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,240
I can imagine why. You're already in charge of so many cases.

495
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:18,159
But you're even working as an advisory counsel now.

496
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:19,725
So it's only natural that you're tired.

497
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:24,281
It seems like you really regret having taken the job.

498
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:28,884
Okay, I'll sacrifice myself on your behalf.

499
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:31,289
Although it may be bothersome and tiring,

500
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,745
I'll take your place and become Yun Seo's advisory counsel.

501
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:34,920
That's okay.

502
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:36,779
Really? I see.

503
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:38,841
I guess it's not that bad.

504
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:40,512
By the way,

505
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:43,557
how was the filming location? Did you have fun?

506
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,027
How does Yun Seo get along with the male lead?

507
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,801
I didn't get to see him yesterday. But why do you ask?

508
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:56,142
I got really curious yesterday, so I watched a few...

509
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:57,968
behind-the-scenes clips of the drama.

510
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:01,281
And I noticed that they have great chemistry together.

511
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,549
A few people even left comments...

512
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,570
saying it looks like they're dating each other.

513
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,990
- What? - You know I'm an expert at this.

514
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:10,101
I personally think...

515
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:12,549
there's something going on between the two.

516
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:16,700
I think the two might start dating because of this drama.

517
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,186
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

518
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:27,560
- Aren't you going to leave? - This is really uncomfortable.

519

"Kiss master"?

524
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:10,473
Ms. Dan, here's your schedule for next week.

525
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,770
- Okay, I'll take a look. - Okay.

526
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,583
Ms. Dan, do you know how to play the ukulele?

527
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,218
I started playing it as a hobby.

528
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:25,769
Someone even taught me how to play it for a while.

529
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,899
I've always wanted to learn how to play it. If you don't mind,

530
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,284
can I take a closer look at it?

531
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:32,222
Sure, go ahead.

532
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,214
I learned the basic techniques by watching online videos.

533
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:44,232
Is this how you do it?

534
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,017
You need to use...

535
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,353
your second finger like this.

536
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:57,393
- Like this? - Your stance...

537
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,842
I'll show you.

538
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,097
You need to hold it like you're holding a baby.

539
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,025
Would you like to try playing the C chord?

540
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,944
- Is it this one? - You're good.

541
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,273
I gave that ukulele to her.

542
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,193
How could she use our ukulele that holds our precious memory...

543
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:33,390
to play harmony with another guy?

544
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:36,910
- I really don't understand... - I noticed...

545
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:39,092
- She's right there. - that there's a concert.

546
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,010
But I felt a little awkward to go there alone.

547
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:42,193
Why are they together?

548
00:36:42,311 --> 00:36:44,269
It's nice that we're getting to go there together.

549
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:48,515
It's not a bad deal for me since I get to watch a concert.

550
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,413
Ms. Dan, we need to talk.

551
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,753
I have to go somewhere with Jong Hwa.

552
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,589
We agreed to go to a ukulele concert.

553
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,581
No, you can't go there.

554
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:05,666
I'm sorry, but can you go to that concert by yourself?

555
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,770
There's something very important I need to say...

556
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,188
to Ms. Dan right now.

557
00:37:15,311 --> 00:37:18,614
What's the important thing that you need to tell me?

558
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,691
Ms. Dan.

559
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,401
I want you to return the ukulele I gave you.

560
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:24,569
What? Why...

561
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,019
Why are you taking back what you already gave me?

562
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,182
You're the one who took back what you gave me.

563
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:30,571
What do you mean?

564
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,553
You gave me your heart, but you took it away.

565
00:37:34,061 --> 00:37:36,151
If you were going to be like this, why were you so nice to me?

566
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,111
On my birthday,

567
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:40,117
why did you get your hair pulled on my behalf?

568
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:42,269
Why did you debone the roasted mackerel for me?

569
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,785
And why did you get me vitamins?

570
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,053
Why did you do all that?

571
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:47,731
Why are you suddenly being like this?

572
00:37:48,011 --> 00:37:51,546
You're the one who told me that your heart feels numb...

573
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:52,963
when you're with me.

574
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:54,461
Yes.

575
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:57,905
I thought it was going to stay that way.

576
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,260
But...

577
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,611
What's this?

578
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:18,721
It's beating so fast.

579
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,692
Foolishly enough,

580
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,657
my heart started beating after you left me.

581
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:31,131
And...

582
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:35,993
when I saw you smile with another man,

583
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:38,208
my heart even started hurting.

584
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:40,611
My heart...

585
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,490
had to feel all sorts of things because of you.

586
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,570
- So... - Yes?

587
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,122
Let's start dating each other.

588
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:55,659
I'm not talking about a contract. Let's become a real couple.

589
00:38:59,811 --> 00:39:01,700
I'll give you three seconds to give me an answer.

590
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,430
Three.

591
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:06,760
Two.

592
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:08,171
One.

593
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,680
0.5.

594
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,052
0.25.

595
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,721
0.125.

596
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,811
Okay, let's date. I would love that.

597
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,956
- Those are the good times. - They must be dating.

598
00:39:46,491 --> 00:39:47,641
Those are the good times.

599
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,453
Is she still filming?

600
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,929
- Mr. Kwon. - Ms. Oh Jin Sim!

601
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,660
What brings you here?

602
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,930
- Get in. - Sure.

603
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:17,974
You said you were on set.

604
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:19,600
Where's your manager?

605
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:21,980
Today's filming was canceled,

606
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,194
and I sent Hyuk Joon home.

607
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,158
I thought about calling ahead,

608
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,570
but I wanted to surprise you for once.

609
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,155
So surprise!

610
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,990
I'm glad you did.

611
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,605
It sure is nice to see you this way.

612
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,801
Right? Isn't it great?

613
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,110
I still don't know how we managed to stay apart.

614
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:45,030
Tell me about it.

615
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:48,475
I'm glad that today's filming was canceled.

616
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,032
You were probably exhausted.

617
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:52,248
It's all right. I'm hardly tired.

618
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:53,711
Still.

619
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,328
From what I experienced from being on set yesterday,

620
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,769
it takes a lot of stamina to be an actor.

621
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,698
So don't eat less to keep the weight off...

622
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:07,869
and stay healthy by eating what your body needs.

623
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:13,542
You should be the one watching out for your health.

624
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,343
You work the most out of all the attorneys at your firm.

625
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,522
You know what? Let's enjoy a healthy dessert then.

626
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,351
It's red ginseng.

627
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,640
Go ahead.

628
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:32,410
Sure.

629
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:41,540
You have something to use that energy on.

630
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:42,791
Sorry?

631
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,103
Can you help me with my lines?

632
00:41:45,781 --> 00:41:47,537
- Your lines? - Yes.

633
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,387
It's easier when I have someone to practice the scene with.

634
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,620
I'd like to work on the scenes for tomorrow.

635
00:41:55,621 --> 00:41:56,671
Will you help me?

636
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,001
Sure.

637
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,579
Who knew I'd be doing something like this?

638
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,448
Where's the script?

639
00:42:09,241 --> 00:42:10,452
Here it is.

640
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:20,311
(The two reunite with a kiss outside the court.)

641
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,091
That's right.

642
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,011
There's a kiss scene in the fourth episode.

643
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:29,376
My gosh, Jung Do.

644
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,360
Shouldn't you be in Asrael?

645
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,148
I came so that I wouldn't regret.

646
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:39,805
I knew I'd regret it all my life if I just let you go.

647
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,618
It says here that Jung Do pulls Joo Ha in for a kiss.

648
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:53,128
We can just skip that part.

649
00:42:55,681 --> 00:42:56,993
Why should we?

650
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,421
I agreed to help you practice, so I'll stay in character.

651
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:13,904
Oh, dear. My gosh.

652
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,428
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

653
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,110
No, I need to practice this.

654
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,792
It's just practice.

655
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:31,919
Mr. Kwon, here's the script.

656
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:35,102
This is fascinating.

657
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:43,948
So this is what a script looks like.

658
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:49,578
What on earth is this?

659
00:43:49,702 --> 00:43:50,558
Sorry?

660
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:56,849
Mr. Kwon, here's the script.

661
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,872
This is fascinating.

662
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:08,715
So this is what a script looks like.

663
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:14,376
What on earth is this?

664
00:44:14,462 --> 00:44:16,400
Sorry?

665
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,552
Look here.

666
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:21,709
"Your Honor, the defendant..."

667
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,912
"is in deep remorse regarding his actions."

668
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:25,990
And?

669
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,146
Isn't this supposed to be a criminal case?

670
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,106
"The accused" is for criminal cases...

671
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:34,544
while "the defendant" is for civil cases.

672
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:38,567
So the attorney should've referred to him as the accused.

673
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:42,971
I see, but I'm not the one who writes the script.

674
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,593
This is basic research for crime series.

675
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,187
Mr. Kwon, are you angry?

676
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:53,644
Well, I'll make sure to let...

677
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:55,408
the write know.

678
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:57,339
Right, please do so.

679
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:03,011
Let's try this scene then.

680
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:04,972
Which scene?

681
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:07,208
Scene number 27. The trial.

682
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,016
- The trial scene? - Yes.

683
00:45:11,499 --> 00:45:14,129
Why not stand in the center and do it properly.

684
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,129
- What? You want me to stand? - Yes, go ahead.

685
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,328
- I'll see how you do. - Right.

686
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,448
The plaintiff hired Bujin Constructions...

687
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:29,178
and completed the demolition.

688
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:30,189
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

689
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:33,475
The plaintiff normally sits...

690
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:35,333
on your left.

691
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:38,029
This way?

692
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:45,029
The plaintiff hired Bujin Constructions...

693
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,629
and completed the demolition.

694
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,822
However, you failed to supply the funds and...

695
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,331
"Therefore, you failed to make the payments."

696
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,134
Therefore, you failed to make the payments.

697
00:46:01,909 --> 00:46:03,395
- Ms. Oh Jin Sim. - Yes?

698
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:06,243
I'm afraid that tone isn't appropriate.

699
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:10,583
In court, attorneys and prosecutors rarely raise their voices.

700
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:14,291
It's best to end your argument in a charismatic but refrained tone.

701
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:17,498
"The plaintiff hired Bujin Constructions..."

702
00:46:17,499 --> 00:46:18,975
"and completed the demolition."

703
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:21,089
"However, you failed to supply the funds."

704
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,390
"Therefore, you failed to make the payments."

705
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,020
- Like that. - I get it.

706
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:28,583
- Let me try that again. - Sure.

707
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,748
The plaintiff hired "Mujin" Constructions...

708
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:37,981
Ms. Oh Jin Sim. It's Bujin, not Mujin.

709
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:41,482
Yes, of course. Mujin... No, Bujin Constructions.

710
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,788
Can I get a glass of water?

711
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:46,507
- Yes, of course. - Okay.

712
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,014
"The plaintiff hired Bujin Constructions..."

713
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,618
I thought it'd be romantic,

714
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:03,063
but he's working me harder than the staff on set.

715
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,353
I'm glad I can be of help to you this way.

716
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,430
Sure.

717
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:19,270
"Outside the court."

718
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,859
"After Joo Ha walks out, she's shocked at what she sees."

719
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,858
"Jung Do is there in his military uniform."

720
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,270
Okay, got it.

721
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:29,349
"Jung Do pulls Joo Ha in for..."

722
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:34,422
"a kiss?"

723
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:39,938
"The two reunite with a kiss outside the court."

724
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,316
(Kiss master)

725
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:58,114
A kiss master?

726
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,564
I have an announcement to make. I booked us a table...

727
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,720
at the nearby Korean beef restaurant for dinner.

728
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:08,129
That's a good choice.

729
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,654
The raw beef there is amazing.

730
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:12,808
The chef is known as the Beef Master.

731
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,020
As if.

732
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,226
There's no such thing as a kiss master.

733
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,665
Did I say that he kissed well?

734
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,782
It's nothing. May I be excused?

735
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,274
Aren't you finishing your meal?

736
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,209
I have business to attend in court.

737
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,170
A kiss master?

738
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,710
A ski master?

739
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,317
I'm sure he said, "kiss".

740
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,725
Maybe Mr. Kwon wants to find love.

741
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:43,038
I get it. Since it's spring,

742
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:45,059
he must be getting all sorts of feels.

743
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:47,058
Even he'd like some romance in his life too.

744
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,844
Come to think of it, we're all single.

745
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,320
Shouldn't someone in this group be in a relationship?

746
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:58,407
If you don't have time to find someone outside,

747
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,782
you should look for someone in here.

748
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,956
There are so many secret couples in other companies.

749
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,986
It's like our firm is the only place with nothing going on.

750
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,399
Don't CEOs usually dislike office romances?

751
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,498
Since it interferes with their work?

752
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:14,772
I'm not such an old-fashioned CEO.

753
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:17,368
Furthermore, if there is a couple...

754
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:18,652
within our law firm,

755
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:22,009
I will buy each of them a spring outfit they can wear on their date.

756
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,677
So, the moment you become a couple,

757
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:27,294
I hope you hold your hands up and report to me.

758
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:32,077
- What are you two doing? - You said to report to you.

759
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,877
Me and Ms. Dan are a couple.

760
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,136
Yes. We're a new couple that's been going out since yesterday.

761
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:42,833
Seriously. What do you think you're doing?

762
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:45,739
How desperate were you for some new clothes? Does that make sense?

763
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,760
My goodness. This is so silly.

764
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:58,398
Ms. Dan, Mr. Choi, are you two really a couple?

765
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:03,506
It feels like someone smacked me on the back of my head.

766
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:15,559
If that's the filming team, she must be somewhere over there.

767
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:23,180
Yun Seo,

768
00:50:23,269 --> 00:50:25,532
how do you want to do this part?

769
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,848
If you have any suggestions, I'll follow it.

770
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:29,768
- Really? Okay. - Yes.

771
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:37,669
Mr. Kwon.

772
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,930
Hi.

773
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:42,842
What brings you here?

774
00:50:43,429 --> 00:50:45,319
I had some business at court.

775
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:48,398
I heard you're shooting and came in case you need any help.

776
00:50:50,999 --> 00:50:52,919
I'm so glad I'm shooting in front of the court.

777
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,887
We got to bump into each other like this.

778
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:57,463
- Yes. - Yun Seo, it's time to shoot.

779
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,060
What?

780
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,737
I have to go, Mr. Kwon.

781
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,129
Okay.

782
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:18,939
Jung Do.

783
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:22,912
How did you come here?

784
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,959
Shouldn't you be in Israel? Why are you here?

785
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:26,754
I came in order to leave no regrets.

786
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:29,796
In order not to regret letting you go for the rest of my life.

787
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,945
Cut. What was that?

788
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:51,145
Was that a car horn?

789
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:53,545
Make sure there aren't any unnecessary sounds.

790
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:56,618
All right, stand by. Let's try it again.

791
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:59,294
Hold on... Wait a minute.

792
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:04,764
May I say something as the advisory counsel?

793
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,253
Yes, of course.

794
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,678
I know it's a drama, but a man and woman kissing...

795
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:12,407
in front of the court like this seems so unrealistic.

796
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,718
On top of that, how could an attorney and a judicial officer...

797
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,709
kiss in front of a sacred court?

798
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:20,848
From my perspective, as a man who works in this industry,

799
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:23,989
I'm afraid this scene is a bit inappropriate.

800
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,778
This is a very conservative place.

801
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:32,032
Still, if there needs to be some sort of emotional exchange,

802
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,759
I believe a hug will be appropriate.

803
00:52:35,909 --> 00:52:38,038
- A hug? - No, forget that.

804
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:39,999
Not even a hug.

805
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:42,319
A handshake.

806
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:44,718
A handshake sounds perfect.

807
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:47,042
Mr. Kwon, let's go get some coffee.

808
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,819
I don't want coffee.

809
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,809
No, you and I should get some coffee.

810
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:55,860
You told me not to interfere, mentioning something about...

811
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:58,788
one's right to pursue happiness.

812
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:01,391
What do you think you're doing right now?

813
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:05,299
I just did my job as an advisory counsel.

814
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,138
If you came as an advisory counsel, you should give advice.

815
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:10,159
Why are you being jealous?

816
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:13,368
- It's not jealousy. - It is jealousy.

817
00:53:14,849 --> 00:53:17,334
Look at that. Mr. Kwon, look over there.

818
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:20,478
You said judicial officers are conservative or something.

819
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:23,689
But look at how they're holding hands. Conservative my foot.

820
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,689
Oh, well... That's ridiculous.

821
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:29,720
This industry is very conservative. There's no way...

822
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,270
Kim Se Won?

823
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,680
Jung Rok.

824
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:39,412
Jung Rok?

825
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:41,886
You even know them?

826
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:44,879
I don't.

827
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,061
Kim Se Won. Jung Rok.

828
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,709
I have my right to take the Fifth.

829
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,225
Goodness, you're just full of jealousy.

830
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:58,154
Can you hold hands like that in court in those robes?

831
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,729
Who cares? It's not like we're not working because we're dating.

832
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:04,386
I just got tired of dating secretly all the time.

833
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,938
I just decided to open about it without worrying about others.

834
00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:12,903
Me too. I usually would never have imagined doing this,

835
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,026
but Se Won was right.

836
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:18,409
It was hard at first, but once I got used to it, it's nothing.

837
00:54:20,139 --> 00:54:22,472
Jung Rok, what should I do?

838
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:24,768
I think I'm taking after Se Won.

839
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:28,862
Fine, whatever.

840
00:54:56,011 --> 00:55:00,353
- Cheers to Always Law Firm! - Cheers!

841
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:09,224
So, how did you two start to get attracted to each other?

842
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:12,226
I know. You used to be enemies before.

843
00:55:13,136 --> 00:55:15,264
I'm not saying this because he's my boyfriend.

844
00:55:15,265 --> 00:55:17,962
But Mr. Choi was a man born to be loved.

845
00:55:18,236 --> 00:55:21,605
He's handsome, competent, gentle, and on top of that,

846
00:55:21,606 --> 00:55:23,464
he's a great son. He's really...

847
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:24,986
the best guy ever.

848
00:55:25,276 --> 00:55:26,559
That goes for you too.

849
00:55:27,015 --> 00:55:29,035
At times, you're cute, and at times, you're chic.

850
00:55:29,816 --> 00:55:31,836
You're such an unpredictable woman.

851
00:55:33,216 --> 00:55:35,477
I see. Although I don't...

852
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:38,182
agree with what you said, a promise is a promise.

853
00:55:40,426 --> 00:55:42,920
You can each go buy some spring outfits.

854
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:44,778
Thank you, Mr. Yeon.

855
00:55:44,836 --> 00:55:46,856
Why don't we buy a couple outfit?

856
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:49,560
Something that will look perfect for your cute style.

857
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:51,874
It's okay.

858
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:53,934
Let's get something that will...

859
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:56,633
look perfect on you, something luxurious and chic.

860
00:55:57,475 --> 00:55:58,525
Let's eat.

861
00:55:59,676 --> 00:56:03,251
Why do I have to use my own money and watch something like that?

862
00:56:04,145 --> 00:56:06,985
Anyway, if there are any more hidden couples, tell me now.

863
00:56:06,986 --> 00:56:10,054
We should all go get a group outfit while we're at it.

864
00:56:10,055 --> 00:56:12,655
I'm already struggling with my loan. Another 7,000 dollars...

865
00:56:12,656 --> 00:56:14,342
added to my 700,000 won't make a difference.

866
00:56:15,526 --> 00:56:18,899
Hae Yeong, if it's okay with you,

867
00:56:18,995 --> 00:56:20,835
would you like to go get a new spring dress with me...

868
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,047
I have many dresses.

869
00:56:34,546 --> 00:56:36,101
Mr. Kwon.

870
00:56:36,616 --> 00:56:38,404
Is something wrong?

871
00:56:39,986 --> 00:56:41,066
I know.

872
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,645
Your face looks so grim today.

873
00:56:45,426 --> 00:56:48,065
Is it because you had a crush on Ms. Dan...

874
00:56:48,066 --> 00:56:50,691
and you feel heartbroken since she's going out with Mr. Choi?

875
00:56:50,725 --> 00:56:52,048
Is that why you're drinking so much?

876
00:56:52,995 --> 00:56:54,147
Is that true?

877
00:56:54,906 --> 00:56:57,056
A crush is love too. I'll root for you.

878
00:56:57,636 --> 00:56:58,747
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

879
00:57:06,915 --> 00:57:08,603
Mr. Kwon, are you still at your company dinner?

880
00:57:11,015 --> 00:57:12,065
I see.

881
00:57:12,285 --> 00:57:14,477
I'm on my way home after today's shoot.

882
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:18,949
Call me after dinner then.

883
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:21,235
Okay.

884
00:57:22,926 --> 00:57:24,410
Did he say anything in particular?

885
00:57:24,526 --> 00:57:27,364
In particular? Like what?

886
00:57:27,466 --> 00:57:28,546
Well, it's just...

887
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:31,621
It just seemed...

888
00:57:32,636 --> 00:57:35,604
he was jealous because of your kiss scene.

889
00:57:36,705 --> 00:57:39,746
I was just curious if he gave you a hard time about it.

890
00:57:40,145 --> 00:57:41,186
What?

891
00:57:43,845 --> 00:57:45,936
That's the fate of the boyfriend of a celebrity.

892
00:57:46,185 --> 00:57:48,782
He has to pretend he's okay watching love scenes like that,

893
00:57:48,986 --> 00:57:50,774
but he feels jealous inside.

894
00:57:51,495 --> 00:57:54,195
He can't proudly tell anyone that he's dating you either.

895
00:57:54,196 --> 00:57:56,922
And you can't even go to places where there are a lot of people.

896
00:57:58,765 --> 00:57:59,806
Yun Seo.

897
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,128
That's why I'm so worried...

898
00:58:03,736 --> 00:58:05,655
about the two of you dating.

899
00:58:06,305 --> 00:58:07,992
You can't help but get exhausted...

900
00:58:08,345 --> 00:58:10,325
when you're in a secret relationship.

901
00:58:18,816 --> 00:58:20,300
Here you go, honey.

902
00:58:23,886 --> 00:58:25,238
You too, honey.

903
00:58:27,926 --> 00:58:30,117
You guys are bringing so much love to our firm.

904
00:58:31,566 --> 00:58:35,040
I'm not sure about that. I'm starting to feel angry.

905
00:58:36,205 --> 00:58:38,831
Those two are slowly helping me understand...

906
00:58:39,035 --> 00:58:41,732
why CEOs don't want their employees to date each other.

907
00:58:42,006 --> 00:58:43,675
I mean, why would the CEO...

908
00:58:43,676 --> 00:58:45,766
want to pay people and see them dating at the same time?

909
00:58:46,716 --> 00:58:49,009
I feel like I'll become furious if I stay here.

910
00:58:49,086 --> 00:58:50,744
It seems like you're all done, so let's go now.

911
00:58:50,745 --> 00:58:52,573
- Let's go. - But I don't want to go.

912
00:58:53,356 --> 00:58:55,324
- Yun Seo! - Hello.

913
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:56,538
- Yun Seo. - Yun Seo.

914
00:58:57,055 --> 00:58:58,509
What brings you here?

915
00:58:59,325 --> 00:59:03,133
I heard you guys are having a team dinner here, so I dropped by.

916
00:59:03,466 --> 00:59:05,594
I'm glad you're here. We were just getting started.

917
00:59:05,595 --> 00:59:06,777
Come this way.

918
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:09,516
Sit here.

919
00:59:13,435 --> 00:59:14,618
Jong Hwa, where's your seat?

920
00:59:14,906 --> 00:59:16,895
- Over there, sir. - Oh, I see. Okay.

921
00:59:20,216 --> 00:59:23,275
Yun Seo, we have big news.

922
00:59:23,386 --> 00:59:26,618
Apparently, Ms. Dan and Mr. Choi are a couple now.

923
00:59:28,285 --> 00:59:30,447
- Really? - Yes.

924
00:59:30,725 --> 00:59:33,685
I was actually going to tell you tomorrow.

925
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,711
Congratulations.

926
00:59:36,796 --> 00:59:39,321
Jung Rok, aren't you glad to see Yun Seo?

927
00:59:39,466 --> 00:59:41,314
- Why aren't you saying anything? - Pardon?

928
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:45,008
Jung Rok, what's with you today? Why do you look so down?

929
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:47,446
Is it because it's spring?

930
00:59:47,736 --> 00:59:48,987
It must be because you feel lonely.

931
00:59:49,745 --> 00:59:50,987
- That must be it. - That's nonsense.

932
00:59:51,475 --> 00:59:53,062
Don't lie to me.

933
00:59:53,116 --> 00:59:55,771
You know what? We should set him up on a blind date.

934
00:59:57,685 --> 00:59:58,784
That's not necessary.

935
00:59:58,785 --> 01:00:01,155
Stop refusing the offer. You're obviously single right now.

936
01:00:01,156 --> 01:00:03,306
You should do as I say and go on a blind date.

937
01:00:04,086 --> 01:00:07,328
Ms. Kim, Ms. Dan, do you guys know anyone?

938
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:08,776
- Do you know any single women? - Anyone?

939
01:00:10,495 --> 01:00:11,505
Wait.

940
01:00:12,366 --> 01:00:15,265
Mr. Kwon actually has...

941
01:00:16,236 --> 01:00:17,275
a girlfriend.

942
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:22,264
- What do you mean? - Are... Are you serious?

943
01:00:23,046 --> 01:00:24,622
Mr. Kwon has a girlfriend?

944
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:26,996
Yes, well...

945
01:00:28,785 --> 01:00:30,431
Well, it's...

946
01:00:34,185 --> 01:00:35,235
It's me.

947
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:44,089
- You are so funny. - Come on.

948
01:00:44,866 --> 01:00:46,934
- Seriously. - That was great acting.

949
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,934
She didn't even blink when she made that joke.

950
01:00:48,935 --> 01:00:50,754
"It's me." Gosh, I don't think I can do it.

951
01:00:51,305 --> 01:00:52,386
I'm serious.

952
01:00:58,776 --> 01:01:01,037
I was quite hesitant to tell you at first.

953
01:01:02,345 --> 01:01:05,454
But I really like and trust everyone here.

954
01:01:05,455 --> 01:01:06,930
So I want to be honest with you.

955
01:01:09,256 --> 01:01:12,892
Mr. Kwon and I...

956
01:01:13,555 --> 01:01:16,757
are really dating.

957
01:01:27,906 --> 01:01:30,675
I like Mr. Kwon...

958
01:01:30,676 --> 01:01:32,665
very much.

959
01:01:35,716 --> 01:01:36,898
Oh, I see.

960
01:01:43,756 --> 01:01:45,877
Sir, isn't that hot?

961
01:01:47,725 --> 01:01:48,775
Gosh, that's hot!

962
01:01:51,995 --> 01:01:53,045
Water...

963
01:01:55,305 --> 01:01:56,951
I'm crying because it's hot.

964
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:58,775
- Are you sure? - Yes, it's because it's hot.

965
01:01:58,776 --> 01:02:00,335
Are you sure it's not because you're heartbroken?

966
01:02:00,336 --> 01:02:01,719
No, it's because my hand's burning.

967
01:02:02,475 --> 01:02:05,505
My hand is burning. That's why I'm crying. My gosh.

968
01:02:07,075 --> 01:02:09,611
I sincerely congratulate you. My gosh, that was hot.

969
01:02:10,446 --> 01:02:11,566
I need to go to the bathroom.

970
01:02:11,955 --> 01:02:13,197
Gosh, I'm so happy.

971
01:02:13,415 --> 01:02:14,941
Goodness, I need to go to the bathroom.

972
01:02:15,926 --> 01:02:18,076
You guys should congratulate them. My goodness, seriously.

973
01:02:21,426 --> 01:02:22,476
Thank you.

974
01:02:23,765 --> 01:02:25,150
Congratulations, Yun Seo.

975
01:02:27,836 --> 01:02:29,886
I never knew that so many people...

976
01:02:30,106 --> 01:02:32,197
were dating in our firm.

977
01:02:32,705 --> 01:02:33,746
I know, right?

978
01:02:34,075 --> 01:02:37,610
I really didn't expect Mr. Kwon and Yun Seo to date each other.

979
01:02:38,106 --> 01:02:40,469
They seem really different.

980
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:43,413
But at the same time, they look really good together.

981
01:02:43,486 --> 01:02:44,728
I think they make a great couple.

982
01:02:45,955 --> 01:02:47,975
My goodness, they're forsythia flowers.

983
01:02:49,156 --> 01:02:50,267
You're right.

984
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:52,676
Forsythia flowers are my favorite.

985
01:02:52,995 --> 01:02:56,197
By any chance, do you know the meaning of forsythia flowers?

986
01:02:56,526 --> 01:02:58,314
No, what is it?

987
01:03:04,035 --> 01:03:07,712
"My love is deeper than yours."

988
01:03:10,475 --> 01:03:11,516
I see.

989
01:03:17,386 --> 01:03:19,103
Hey, Ms. Yang.

990
01:03:20,856 --> 01:03:24,824
If you don't mind, would you like to eat with me someday?

991
01:03:27,296 --> 01:03:28,406
Sure, let's do that.

992
01:03:42,506 --> 01:03:44,161
Why are we drinking all of a sudden?

993
01:03:45,176 --> 01:03:47,872
Because I want to celebrate this day.

994
01:03:48,486 --> 01:03:50,808
Today was the first time we ever told anyone...

995
01:03:50,845 --> 01:03:52,431
about our relationship.

996
01:03:54,856 --> 01:03:57,007
But are you really okay?

997
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,767
I'm worried that you're doing this for me.

998
01:04:00,196 --> 01:04:03,195
Mr. Kwon, do you know...

999
01:04:03,895 --> 01:04:06,360
what you say to me the most?

1000
01:04:08,035 --> 01:04:09,176
"Are you okay?"

1001
01:04:09,935 --> 01:04:11,955
"Are you really okay?"

1002
01:04:12,435 --> 01:04:14,153
You always ask me that.

1003
01:04:15,475 --> 01:04:18,031
But today, this is what suddenly came to my mind.

1004
01:04:19,515 --> 01:04:21,939
"He always asks me if I'm okay."

1005
01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:25,533
"But I wonder if he's okay."

1006
01:04:27,086 --> 01:04:28,640
"He's always so worried about me."

1007
01:04:29,526 --> 01:04:32,525
"And I'm worried he might not be taking care of himself."

1008
01:04:34,756 --> 01:04:38,503
If you're not okay, I'm not okay either.

1009
01:04:40,296 --> 01:04:41,649
Because how you feel...

1010
01:04:42,636 --> 01:04:44,525
directly affects how I feel.

1011
01:04:47,475 --> 01:04:48,657
And there's one more.

1012
01:04:49,205 --> 01:04:52,548
I had to meet you today because I wanted to tell you this.

1013
01:04:53,345 --> 01:04:54,355
What is it?

1014
01:04:57,116 --> 01:05:00,752
About that kissing scene earlier... We didn't actually kiss.

1015
01:05:01,285 --> 01:05:04,054
Okay, let's not talk about that anymore.

1016
01:05:04,055 --> 01:05:06,115
Don't try to avoid the subject and listen to me.

1017
01:05:06,225 --> 01:05:09,025
That was just acting.

1018
01:05:09,026 --> 01:05:11,046
We didn't actually kiss.

1019
01:05:12,066 --> 01:05:14,359
I'll show you. We held each other like this.

1020
01:05:15,106 --> 01:05:17,591
And then, we did this.

1021
01:05:17,636 --> 01:05:18,775
They shot us from an angle...

1022
01:05:18,776 --> 01:05:20,219
so that it would seem like we're really kissing.

1023
01:05:23,705 --> 01:05:26,947
Anyway, I just didn't want you to misunderstand.

1024
01:05:28,845 --> 01:05:31,208
Actors and actresses are good at doing stuff like that.

1025
01:05:31,515 --> 01:05:34,748
They know how to make fake stuff look real.

1026
01:05:35,055 --> 01:05:38,015
Then what if you really want to kiss someone?

1027
01:05:44,265 --> 01:05:45,679
Is this how you do it?

1028
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:18,775
Is it okay...

1029
01:06:19,696 --> 01:06:21,452
if I cross the line today?

1030
01:07:22,066 --> 01:07:24,115
(Touch Your Heart)

1031
01:07:24,366 --> 01:07:26,294
- Ta-da. - Why did she choose Jung Rok...

1032
01:07:26,295 --> 01:07:27,594
instead of me?

1033
01:07:27,595 --> 01:07:28,605
You're so handsome.

1034
01:07:28,606 --> 01:07:30,787
You're so unnecessarily good-looking.

1035
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,127
How could you be so sly?

1036
01:07:33,376 --> 01:07:34,434
You're seriously unbelievable.

1037
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:36,192
I get that you fall in love very easily,

1038
01:07:36,376 --> 01:07:37,745
but how could you do that in front of your boyfriend?

1039
01:07:37,746 --> 01:07:41,078
You didn't forget about our dinner appointment tomorrow, right?

1040
01:07:41,215 --> 01:07:43,669
- Can I really go to your house? - Sure.

1041
01:07:44,015 --> 01:07:46,915
Your one-day secretary is waiting for you in your office.

1042
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:47,915
Ms. Oh.

1043
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:49,138
Your flight leaves tomorrow morning.

1044
01:07:49,185 --> 01:07:50,684
- What? - Now that you're dating an actress,

1045
01:07:50,685 --> 01:07:52,125
- you're starting to change. - Hello.

1046
01:07:52,126 --> 01:07:53,625
You're like a male lead in a romantic comedy.

1047
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:55,746
I'll always be waiting for you here.

1048
01:07:55,866 --> 01:07:57,279
That's what I wanted to say.
