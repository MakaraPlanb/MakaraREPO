1
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,830
- Hey, what's up?
- Well...

2
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,230
I thought I should tell
you this beforehand.

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,060
I think the court is going to issue
an arrest warrant tomorrow...

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,930
for Jung Ji Ho and Lee Gang Joon.

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,650
You were right. It turns out
Jung Ji Ho didn't actually gamble.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,160
What do you mean?

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,020
I traced the five million dollars...

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,880
that Attorney Choi received
as his contingent fee.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,510
That led me to find a paper
company that's based in Macao.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,580
And the owner of that company
turned out to be Lee Gang Joon.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,870
They were using that company to
launder Jung Ji Ho's slush fund.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,320
Is that why they both met up in Macao?

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,470
Yes, and when they found out the
prosecution was aware of that,

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,270
Jung Ji Ho pretended like he gambled
to make us focus on something else.

15
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,700
The penalty for gambling is weaker
than the penalty for embezzlement.

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,670
Let's talk about the details at home.
I'll be there soon.

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,440
Okay, I'll see you later. Bye.

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,450
You're home.

19
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,500
The receiver cannot be reached.
Please leave a message...

20
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,980
Be honest with yourself now...

21
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,720
and say that you love me.

22
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,610
Say that you need me and
that you'll never betray me!

23
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,640
Stay away from my girl.

24
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,570
- What happened?
- Goodness.

25
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,020
You are unbelievable.

26
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,870
- What's going on?
- Isn't that Lee Gang Joon?

27
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,820
Collect his blood as soon as you
get to the police station...

28
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,860
and send that over to the NISI.

29
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,070
- I think he took drugs.
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,900
Is Yun Seo okay?

31
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,380
Her cousin's going to arrive soon.

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm going to stay with her until then.

33
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,460
I'll testify on behalf
of her as her attorney.

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,090
Okay, I'll be at the police station.

35
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,510
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

36
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,360
Let's go.

37
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,750
You can really be at ease now.

38
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,070
He'll never show up in
front of you ever again.

39
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,000
We bring you breaking news.

40
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,720
A judge of the Seoul
Central District Court...

41
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,320
issued a warrant for Vice President Lee...

42
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,050
of Jeguk Group this morning.

43
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,500
To finance his slush fund,
Vice President Lee...

44
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,480
embezzled from his own company.

45
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,560
He is also being accused
of six-digit tax evasion.

46
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,020
President Jung of Giant Foods
was also charged...

47
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,300
as an accomplice for the
embezzlement and tax evasion.

48
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,630
He will also soon be brought
in for questioning.

49
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,380
Last night, Vice President
Lee of Jeguk Group,

50
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,750
broke into actress Oh Yun Seo's
residence high on drugs.

51
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,120
He is being questioned for...

52
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,410
threatening her and vandalism.

53
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,540
From what we can gather, Lee Gang Joon...

54
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,830
What a relief.

55
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,500
I can't believe it!

56
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,460
Drugs, stalking, embezzlement,
and tax evasion.

57
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,560
He's a piece of trash, isn't he?

58
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,600
He's like a nuclear waste!

59
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,210
Just thinking that Yun Seo had
to suffer at his hands...

60
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,590
makes me feel...

61
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,500
Without knowing the truth,

62
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,380
people spoke ill about him and our Yun Seo.

63
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,630
They'll know now...

64
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,670
since the truth has finally come out.

65
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,220
- That's right.
- It's over now, sir.

66
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,260
Sir...

67
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,900
Haven't you washed your hair?

68
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,450
I'm sorry. I didn't have the time.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,170
So what about Yun Seo?

70
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,470
Is it all right for her to be alone?

71
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,690
She's braver than you think.

72
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,180
I feel like she's gotten strong.
She even said she'd go back to work.

73
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,420
Work?

74
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,510
Why would she when she
won't be in the TV series?

75
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,740
There's only a week left, so she
wants to end it on a good note.

76
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,800
Hello.

77
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,750
Ms. Oh, it must've been terrible for you.

78
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,300
We saw on the news that
you were being stalked.

79
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,550
Why didn't you tell us about it sooner?

80
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,220
With the law and with my fist,

81
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,440
I would've taken care of
the situation for you.

82
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,710
You were always so bright and energetic,

83
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,070
so we never imagined anything
like this happening.

84
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,450
Thank you for worrying about me.

85
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,710
Of course we worry about you.

86
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,370
You're like family now.

87
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,540
So why did you come to work today?

88
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,430
I heard that you won't be
back for quite some time.

89
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,370
That's absurd.

90
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,350
My contract with the
firm will soon be over,

91
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,900
so I should work hard until my last day.

92
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,930
Still, you should've
at least taken the day off.

93
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,230
No, it's all right. I'm fine.

94
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,750
Please don't worry about me.

95
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,260
Here you go.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,260
What's this?

97
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,500
Out of the comments written
below the article,

98
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,990
I put together a list of the nice ones.

99
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,170
The ones that are especially nice...

100
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,550
have been highlighted.

101
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,210
In the past, most of the
comments were so disgusting...

102
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,050
that I wanted to press charges.

103
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,050
However, a lot of them this time...

104
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,170
genuinely show you support,

105
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,080
so I hope that they can cheer you up.

106
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,130
Oh, right.

107
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,050
Have you read this article?

108
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,110
It's about how terrible
your life must've been,

109
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,640
and the comments here are also...

110
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,640
Hold on a second.

111
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,870
(Yun Seo, make a comeback
and sue all the haters!)

112
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,870
Did you press "like" on
all of these comments?

113
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,320
Yes.

114
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,480
Thank you, Mr. Kwon.

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,900
I'm the one who's grateful.

116
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,040
Thank you for hanging in there.

117
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,250
("Fans Start a Petition Asking
for Oh Yun Seo's Return")

118
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,910
(Now, many wish to see Oh Yun Seo
back in the industry.)

119
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,580
The weather's much warmer now, isn't it?

120
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,870
So it seems.

121
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,750
Why are you looking at me like that?

122
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,550
I know.

123
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,730
"Are you really all right?"

124
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,260
You want to ask that, right?

125
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,770
Honestly, I'm fine.

126
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,610
It's all over now,

127
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,360
and I have you who worries about me...

128
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,830
even more than I do.

129
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,500
So what worries would I...

130
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,480
Actually, I am worried about something.

131
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,750
Really? What's that?

132
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm hungry. What should we eat?

133
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,060
I'm really starving.

134
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,340
- Isn't that Oh Yun Seo?
- What would you like to have?

135
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,360
I think it is.

136
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,570
Excuse me, aren't you Oh Yun Seo?

137
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,130
I'm not.

138
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,350
You totally are.
Your voice is a dead giveaway.

139
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,550
Yun Seo, I'm a huge fan.
Can I get an autograph?

140
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,980
Ms. Oh, I saw the news. Hang in there.

141
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,460
I always believed you.
Gosh, you're so pretty.

142
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,730
Yun Seo, I'm a fan.
Can I take a photo with you?

143
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,700
- Me first!
- Not so fast.

144
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,420
Photos aren't allowed.

145
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,020
I understand your excitement,
but Oh Jin Sim...

146
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,610
Since Ms. Oh Yun Seo is a public figure,

147
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,670
photos posted on social media
can lead to legal issues.

148
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,840
I understand how you feel
but please refrain from taking photos.

149
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,670
Taking photos without consent...

150
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,100
- is a violation of one's...
- Who are you?

151
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,260
Sorry?

152
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,310
I'm an MF of Yun Seo.

153
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,730
Honestly, I thought you were her boyfriend.

154
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,970
I thought that he was her attorney.

155
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,710
- Move!
- What's your name?

156
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,590
It's Kim Min Ho.

157
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,380
Please wait for your turn.

158
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,190
- I can't believe it.
- Be careful.

159
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,940
You're legally responsible
if anyone you push gets injured.

160
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,880
1 shrimp sandwich, 1 chicken sandwich,

161
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,120
and two Americanos, please.

162
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,150
It's been so long since
I signed autographs...

163
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,090
while surrounded by so many people.

164
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,050
The public is opening up
to me online and offline.

165
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,310
I feel like I'm back to my old self again.

166
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,450
Was I wrong to intervene then?

167
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,090
No, I quite liked it.

168
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,100
Taking photos like that is quite a burden.

169
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,030
Also, having you take my side...

170
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,650
was reassuring.

171
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,800
Why are you suddenly laughing like that?

172
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,100
I just remembered that you...

173
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,440
referred to yourself as an MF.

174
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,380
Where did you learn that abbreviation?

175
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,600
Oh, please.

176
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,850
I'm trendy enough to know that.

177
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,770
Is that so?

178
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,910
Then...

179
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,500
do you know what KTV is?

180
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,590
KTV?

181
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,280
When two parties get into a dispute,

182
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,200
it leads to an argument.

183
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,850
What about a KH then?

184
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,140
- Sorry?
- A KH.

185
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,520
Listen to core lecture online...

186
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,900
at a low price.

187
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,150
I see that Ms. Dan is
still at the office too.

188
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,450
What will you do, you jerk!

189
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,610
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,100
Why did you get involved...

191
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,020
Today is your birthday.

192
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,190
I couldn't let you be assaulted
on your own birthday.

193
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,380
I, Choi Yun Hyuk, am like a rose.

194
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,460
I'm colorful and beautiful,
but I also have prickly thorns.

195
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,340
That's why I have been...

196
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,450
searching everywhere...

197
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,130
for a woman who can embrace me.

198
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,630
She let herself be assaulted
just so that I wouldn't be.

199
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,620
You're like a vase that I can depend on.

200
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,950
What should I do with you?

201
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,320
What's up with him?

202
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,630
What was that? I think he was spying on me.

203
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,980
Spy on me? For what?

204
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,570
Don't be mistaken.

205
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,020
You promised not to humiliate
yourself ever again.

206
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,090
Ms. Dan.

207
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,430
Well...

208
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,550
So... I mean...

209
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,020
Let's either have a drink tonight or not.

210
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,140
What do you mean?

211
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,080
Are you asking me to have
a drink with you or not?

212
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,840
Let's go for a drink.

213
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,100
Immediately. Right now.

214
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,870
Why is this thing so big?

215
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,950
It's just that I don't like
people digging up fish.

216
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,230
I've met many women who applied
foundation on their faces...

217
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,670
in order to impress me.

218
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,100
But she's the first one picking
through a fish for me.

219
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,520
What should I do with you?

220
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,520
Ms. Dan. Is there anyone
on your mind lately?

221
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,120
- What?
- I mean, your heart falls for...

222
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,520
another man 365 days a year,
and it never tends to stop.

223
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,350
But it seems things have been quiet lately.

224
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,880
Honestly, there is someone...

225
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,890
who has come into my heart recently.

226
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,480
But I decided to give up.

227
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,190
He doesn't like me at all,

228
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,790
so what use is it if I keep
having a crush on him?

229
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,880
May I ask who that man is?

230
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,960
Well...

231
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,510
He is...

232
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,360
- Yes. Tell me who...
- You seem drunk. Let's go.

233
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,500
I've seen women receive skin care
and cut their hair to impress me,

234
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,690
but she's the first to cut me off.

235
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,070
You thrill me just like the
taste of this soju and beer.

236
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,470
What should I do with you?

237
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,030
Ms. Dan, wait for me.

238
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,470
I was going to pay.

239
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,230
- We're all here.
- Yes.

240
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,530
By the way, there's only one week left now.

241
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,210
For me to drive you home like this.

242
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,850
I know.

243
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,120
Even if I stop working,
nothing will change between us.

244
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,160
But still,

245
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,010
we won't get to spend as
much time together as now,

246
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,460
and it makes me sad.

247
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,960
For the time remaining,
let's make it worthwhile.

248
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,950
Oh, gosh.

249
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,600
That was... What are you...

250
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,020
doing here at this hour?

251
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,130
Yun Seo.

252
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,100
Are you dating that attorney?

253
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes... I am.

254
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,620
Wait.

255
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,940
Yun Seo, you and I should have a talk.

256
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,630
Mr. Kwon, drive safely then.

257
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,480
Call me before you go to bed. Okay?

258
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,760
Okay.

259
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,200
Hurry up.

260
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,270
What on earth happened?

261
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,890
I thought you hated Mr. Kwon.

262
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,650
But why are you...

263
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,020
dating him right now?

264
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,910
I can do whatever I want.

265
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,460
I'm old enough to date.
Why are you being so nosy?

266
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,540
Yun Seo. Being nosy is my job.

267
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,850
I have to be nosy about whatever you do,

268
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,010
and caring for you to become
more famous is my job and duty.

269
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,820
Yun Seo, the attention of the public...

270
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,480
is focused on you right
now more than you think.

271
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,700
- You have to maintain your image...
- Hyuk Joon, I like Mr. Kwon a lot.

272
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,550
I really like him. Very much.

273
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,190
So just don't say anything.

274
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,720
- Yun Seo.
- Please.

275
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,260
Don't get caught.

276
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,660
Don't get caught and be careful then.

277
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,090
Okay.

278
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,630
Stop acting cute.

279
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,890
Anyway, what brings you here
in the middle of the night?

280
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,270
It would've been better if you hadn't come.

281
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,450
I was worried about how you were doing...

282
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,480
and came over because there was
something I had to tell you.

283
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,250
But you seem extremely fine.

284
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,420
What? What is it you have to tell me?

285
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,820
Ms. Lee Se Jin wants to meet with you.

286
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,180
Ms. Lee?

287
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,430
- With me? For what?
- I don't know why either.

288
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,290
It's been a long time, Yun Seo.

289
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,930
Yes.

290
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,730
What is this about?

291
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,250
You rejected casting her.
Is there anything left to say?

292
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,690
We feel sincerely sorry about last time.

293
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,320
We were so stressed since
no investors showed up,

294
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,310
and once we received that kind of offer,

295
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,220
I'm afraid we briefly lost our minds.

296
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,920
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.

297
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,890
Do you think this is a joke?

298
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,130
You made her work at a law firm
to become familiar with her role,

299
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,610
and suddenly rejected her.

300
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,020
I was very upset.

301
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,590
Please forgive us, Yun Seo.

302
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,040
To tell you the truth,
I was touched by you.

303
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,150
Who would imagine the
universe's goddess, Oh Yun Seo,

304
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,640
really working at a law firm
for three whole months?

305
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,660
I never imagined it.

306
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,280
It made me think you really
had affection for our drama,

307
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,350
and you truly surprised me.

308
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,360
Well, I did have affection
towards your work.

309
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,220
Right? I thought so.

310
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,190
I know this may sound a bit cliche,

311
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,280
but I want you to be...

312
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,930
the female lead of our drama.

313
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,320
Actually, the rumor somehow got out...

314
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,100
that Yun Seo will be
starring in this drama,

315
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,880
and we're receiving so many offers
from investors here and there.

316
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,730
- Is that true?
- Yes.

317
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,460
The rumors about Yun Seo have
been cleared, and people like her now.

318
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,110
Further, after hearing she's
about to make a comeback,

319
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,120
the investment offers are flowing in.

320
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,700
Goodness, you seem awfully
enthusiastic about this.

321
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,910
Anyway, we don't work with
anyone after losing their trust.

322
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,310
Mr. Yeon, don't flat out
reject us like that.

323
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,110
Whether it's flat out or not,
we're not interested in this drama.

324
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,110
Right, Yun Seo?
You're not interested, right?

325
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,480
No, I want to shoot this drama.

326
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,220
Did you hear her?
She wants to shoot this drama.

327
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,660
- You don't want to shoot it?
- I want to shoot it.

328
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,030
- You want to?
- Yes.

329
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,250
Why? Don't you have any pride?

330
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,140
Did I raise you like that?

331
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,030
Honestly, I was a bit disappointed,

332
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,170
but now I understand they had
no choice but to act that way.

333
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,500
While I was working at the law firm,

334
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,760
my affection for this drama became bigger.

335
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,810
Yun Seo, why don't we just sign
the contract while we're at it?

336
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,940
Yun Seo, did you read
the script for episode one?

337
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,450
I haven't shown the scripts for
episode 2 and 3 to anyone,

338
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,410
but I'll get it ready for you
as soon as I get to my office.

339
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,460
Don't you think you're agreeing
to this a bit too easily?

340
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,660
Right, Yun Seo. Why don't we
think about it a little more?

341
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,080
No. I'm going to shoot this drama.

342
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,220
I'm confident that I will play the
role of an attorney perfectly.

343
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,070
You really have no knack
for business, do you?

344
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,010
Even if you wanted to, you should've
played a bit of hard to get.

345
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,450
For what? I was going to
agree in the end anyway.

346
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,220
And if I refused, what if they
really took it seriously?

347
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,360
Gosh, what are you saying?

348
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,920
Yun Seo, you are not...

349
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,190
that pitiful Oh Yun Seo
from before anymore.

350
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,120
You had no work and slacked off
every day, and earned no money.

351
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,900
You went to every single director...

352
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,700
to beg pathetically for a
role in any kind of drama.

353
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,210
You're not that person anymore.

354
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,210
So just forget about those
pitiful times from before.

355
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,230
You're making it hard for
me to forget about them.

356
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,590
Oh, right.

357
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,140
By the way, the people at the firm
will get really startled.

358
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,520
They think you got a job
as a secretary there...

359
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,890
because you couldn't earn a living.

360
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,390
So imagine how startled they'll be
once they suddenly see you on TV.

361
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,900
Hey, Hyuk Joon.

362
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,580
Do you think Mr. Kwon will
be really disappointed...

363
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,310
if he finds out about this?

364
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,650
Do you think he'll feel betrayed...

365
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,500
thinking that I deceived him all this time?

366
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,780
Of course.

367
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,170
He might also dump you saying
he can no longer date...

368
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,750
a woman who lies to him so much.

369
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,840
So how about you dump him
first before he dumps you?

370
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,360
Gosh, I didn't really mean it.
Why are you being so serious?

371
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,860
Because it's a serious issue.

372
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,940
Wouldn't you react the same
way if you were in my shoes?

373
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,800
Mr. Kwon, can we meet tonight?

374
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,200
I need to tell you something
before it's too late.

375
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,700
What should we eat?

376
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,730
Pasta? Or something spicy?

377
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,420
Okay, sure.

378
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,380
Where's Yun Seo? She's been
missing since a while ago.

379
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,650
She had some business to
take care of at her agency.

380
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,750
Is she still affiliated with that agency?

381
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,180
Of course. There's still a lot of
time before her contract ends.

382
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,940
Do you think she'll start acting
again now that she cleared her name?

383
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,750
I'm not sure. She didn't really
seem interested in acting again.

384
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,320
She got a job here because
she was interested in this field,

385
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,460
so I'm guessing she'll continue
to pursue a career in law.

386
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,370
- Let's go eat.
- Yes.

387
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,580
Let's go. Let's go.

388
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,440
Can we please just wait
in front of the elevator?

389
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,050
- Please let us go inside.
- We can't do that.

390
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,840
We know Always Law Firm is
located in this building.

391
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,370
What's going on?
I'm the CEO of Always Law Firm.

392
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,590
Is it true that Oh Yun Seo
secretly got a job at your firm?

393
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,880
Will she be making a comeback
with the role of an attorney?

394
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,290
Did you know that she practiced
her role as she worked here?

395
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,480
Did you not know that she'll
be making a comeback on TV?

396
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,160
- Please tell us something.
- Can you please...

397
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,850
- tell us anything you know?
- What's your opinion on this?

398
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,250
- Can you answer our questions?
- Is it all true?

399
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,610
- Did you know any of this?
- Aren't you her boss?

400
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,140
- Please say something.
- Can you please give us an answer?

401
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,630
- Is it all true?
- Please tell us.

402
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,200
Prosecutor Kim.

403
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,610
You seem to be in a good mood.

404
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,610
Really? Well, I am in a good mood.

405
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,990
I'm finally able to put
those bad guys in jail.

406
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,560
I didn't tell you this back then,
but to be honest,

407
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,130
when you told me to trace Jung Ji Ho
and Choi Yoon Su's bank account,

408
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,240
I got really nervous thinking
that I should get ready...

409
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,880
to get fired soon.

410
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,370
Anyway, your ambition, sense of justice,

411
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,100
and the ability to foresee the future...

412
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,730
are really remarkable.

413
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,890
Gosh, you're flattering me.

414
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,130
I'll be in the office.

415
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,200
Okay.

416
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,830
I knew you'd succeed.

417
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,390
- It's all thanks to you.
- What did I do?

418
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,830
Your hug really cheered me up that night.

419
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,970
Thanks.

420
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,900
Let's eat. I know you're busy,
but spare me some time.

421
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,800
That's the most exciting thing I've
heard in a while. How about lunch?

422
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,960
- When
- Right now.

423
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,510
You needed to be away from the press,

424
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,600
and this was the only
place I could think of.

425
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,940
Oh, okay.

426
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,010
Mr. Kwon.

427
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,490
I'm sorry I couldn't tell
you anything beforehand.

428
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,960
It's been a while since I
wanted to tell you but...

429
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,900
Congratulations.

430
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,180
I can't say I wasn't surprised,

431
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,360
but I know how much you love acting.

432
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,040
So I'm really happy for you.

433
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,710
I'm really glad.

434
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,360
What's with that face?

435
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm just really relieved.

436
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,700
Well, I thought you might...

437
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,450
get disappointed and say you
never want to see me again.

438
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,850
I was worried that you might dump me.

439
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,980
Why would you think such nonsense?

440
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,690
I already told you that
it doesn't matter...

441
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,730
what you're hiding from me
as long as it's something...

442
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,980
that's good for you.

443
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,910
Mr. Kwon.

444
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,350
I keep getting calls from the press.

445
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,140
Yes, Mr. Yeon.

446
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,040
Well, I'm...

447
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,780
I'd like to take the rest of the day off.

448
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,720
I don't need to take care of
anything urgent, so it'll be fine.

449
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,180
Okay, bye.

450
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,240
Why did you take the day off?

451
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,720
Because I didn't want to be disturbed.

452
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,430
Let's skip work today.

453
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,890
Skip work?

454
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,070
Jung Rok's taking the rest of the day off.

455
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,180
My gosh, is he going to spend the
rest of the day with Yun Seo?

456
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,560
I wonder what's going on between them.

457
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,080
He held her hand as they left.
Do you think they're dating?

458
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,190
What kind of nonsense is that?
That's not possible.

459
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,230
Why would Yun Seo date Jung Rok?

460
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,590
Why? What's wrong with Mr. Kwon?

461
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,230
Tell me what you guys think.

462
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,170
Do you think they're dating or not?

463
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,170
Raise your hand if you
think they're dating.

464
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,310
What should we do now?

465
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,290
I'm not sure.

466
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,250
Oh, right. You must be hungry.

467
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,640
I'll cook you something.

468
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,280
You're going to cook something yourself?

469
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,370
Yes.

470
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,810
Why do you look so startled?

471
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,080
I lived by myself in Seoul
ever since college,

472
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,680
so I can cook pretty much everything.

473
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm thinking about kimchi stew
since it's fairly easy to cook.

474
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,460
Do you prefer tuna or
pork in your kimchi stew?

475
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,930
I like both.

476
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,360
- Pork.
- Okay.

477
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,110
I can't believe you're
cooking kimchi stew for me.

478
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,200
I can't wait to taste it.

479
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,790
I wonder where it is.

480
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,500
Se Won.

481
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,550
Where's the pork that was
inside the refrigerator?

482
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,600
Oh, that?

483
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,600
I grilled it and ate it two days ago...

484
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,950
because I got hungry while
going through a case.

485
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,000
Why would you eat that?

486
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,390
You should've told me beforehand.

487
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,930
I don't see the canned tuna either.

488
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,290
I had it for breakfast yesterday.

489
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,750
I didn't know you ate all three meals.

490
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,320
By the way, I think I'll be late tonight.

491
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,650
Since you're going to be late,
why don't you just never return?

492
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,160
Gosh, I guess Prosecutor
Kim ate everything.

493
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,800
Yes. But there's no need to worry.

494
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,340
I can quickly go outside
and get the ingredients.

495
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,550
Let me go with you.

496
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,640
A lot of people are
interested in you these days,

497
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,520
so I feel like you'll get recognized.

498
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,370
Then we could go to a market instead.

499
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,010
People there are older,
so no one will recognize me.

500
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,800
It's pretty obvious that
you're a celebrity.

501
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,880
Do you think so?

502
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,780
Can you lend me your clothes?

503
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,970
You have a lot of pretty clothes.

504
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,640
Let me borrow this and a cap.

505
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,110
I think I'll be fine if I wear this
and disguise myself as someone else.

506
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,330
Okay.

507
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,410
- Lipstick?
- No.

508
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,970
It's lip balm.

509
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,860
My lips are always dry,
so I apply it like this.

510
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,760
- My lips are dry too.
- You should apply some.

511
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,140
You're right. It does moisturize the lips.

512
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,720
♫ <i>I always felt distant from you</i> ♫

513
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,540
♫ <i>But the day we walked together,
your warm laugh</i> ♫

514
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,830
Here you go.

515
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,980
Thank you so much.

516
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,340
Thanks.

517
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,810
It's really good.

518
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:37,830
♫ <i>Times when the wind blew</i> ♫

519
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,840
Gosh, it's good.

520
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,090
Let me see.

521
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,850
We'll take these.

522
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,110
Strawberries!

523
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:50,110
♫ <i>On that starry night</i> ♫

524
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,440
♫ <i>When I thought of you</i> ♫

525
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,590
They smell incredible.

526
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,130
They smell like an air freshener.

527
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Right.

528
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,730
Should we buy this?

529
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:02,800
♫ <i>With my heart that I hid</i> ♫

530
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,410
You bought quite a lot.

531
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,850
Aren't I like the Paris Hilton
of traditional markets?

532
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,520
It's been so long, and I'm having a blast.

533
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,440
Are we going home now?

534
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,300
No, we haven't bought
any ingredients for dinner.

535
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,670
We had sweet and sour chicken,
fish cakes, and even a doughnut.

536
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,070
Must we eat more?

537
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,940
These are just snacks.
We still need a proper dinner.

538
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,580
- Do you like braised spicy chicken?
- Yes.

539
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,200
Then let's buy a raw chicken.

540
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,030
Hello.

541
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,380
Can we get one?
It's for braised spicy chicken.

542
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,430
Sure thing.

543
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,740
Hold on a second.
You seem awfully familiar.

544
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,410
That's absurd.

545
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,740
I'm not kidding.

546
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,450
I'm sure I've seen you before.

547
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,910
You must be talking about me.

548
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,660
Many say that I resemble a few actors.

549
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,510
Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt...

550
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,900
I don't know a Tom or a Brad.

551
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,280
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere.

552
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,950
That's right!

553
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,540
You bought four chickens from me,

554
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,810
but didn't pay me and disappeared.

555
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,310
- Of course not.
- Mr. Park!

556
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,650
- It's not me!
- Mr. Park, get over here!

557
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,160
- Look.
- Yes?

558
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,000
Haven't you seen this young lady before?

559
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,930
You're right. She seems familiar.

560
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,790
- I'll take that.
- Come over here.

561
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,100
Here you go.

562
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,350
Thanks. See you around.

563
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,700
Where do I recognize her from?

564
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,490
This place hasn't changed a bit.

565
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,900
The same goes for its lack of customers.

566
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,590
I had my hopes up since you said
you'd choose the restaurant.

567
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,430
Is this really the best you can do?

568
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,930
What? I've missed all of it.

569
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,880
This place and...

570
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,950
Stop. Don't say it.

571
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,200
Don't say what? What was I going to say?

572
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,460
I was going to say that I
missed its stir-fried pork.

573
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,020
Eat up then.

574
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,240
Thank you for a great meal.

575
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,710
- How much is it?
- 23 dollars.

576
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,390
I see now that it's you two.

577
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,560
No wonder I thought I remembered you.

578
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,900
Do you remember us?

579
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,320
We haven't been here in a while.

580
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,220
Of course I remember.

581
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,220
You went to the nearby law school.

582
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,290
You two were both good looking.

583
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,080
Out of all my customers,
you were the prettiest couple.

584
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,620
Just like your delicious food,
you also have good taste.

585
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,100
Then may I take another guess?

586
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,870
You're not dating anymore, right?

587
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,350
- How did you know that?
- How can I not?

588
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,960
Back then, he'd place...

589
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,630
side dishes in front of
you and feed you wraps.

590
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,360
It seemed like...

591
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,690
he only came here to see you eat.

592
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,750
That wasn't the case today.

593
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,200
Well...

594
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,510
It happens to everyone.

595
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,760
Men change when they marry the girl,

596
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,380
so be understanding of that.

597
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,820
Actually, we're...

598
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,720
It's my fault,

599
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,210
so I'll do better from now on.

600
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,620
I'm delighted to hear that.

601
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,900
The soda is on me today.

602
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,610
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

603
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,230
What was that?

604
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,490
Take care!

605
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,990
- Thanks again.
- Goodbye.

606
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,900
(Chuncheon Restaurant)

607
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,910
Se Won.

608
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,460
What? We got a free soda.

609
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:31,800
How nice is that?

610
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,500
- Thank you for the meal, Yeo Reum.
- Likewise.

611
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,230
The trip here brought back old memories.

612
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,700
We should come again
sometime with Jung Rok.

613
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,560
I don't want to.

614
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,710
I see him enough at home.
Must I see him outside too?

615
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,890
By the way, until when will
you stay at Jung Rok's?

616
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,360
You have a residence of your own,
so why are you staying there?

617
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,420
If you're talking about my parents' place,

618
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,010
I'm not going back there anytime soon.

619
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,280
You see,

620
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,790
I almost died when I found
out what he had said to you.

621
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,230
I couldn't believe...

622
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,670
that the father I admired
said such vicious things...

623
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,660
to the woman his son loves.

624
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,970
That's why I can't go back there.

625
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,810
- Se Won, that's...
- That's why...

626
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,010
you should feel a little bit responsible.

627
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,530
I need...

628
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:28,020
nothing else but to be by your side.

629
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,230
So take responsibility and
rethink our situation...

630
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,330
and relationship in earnest.

631
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,030
I want to be with you again.

632
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,020
Since you cooked, I'll do the dishes.

633
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,470
Nonsense.

634
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,760
You chopped the potatoes
and sliced the carrots.

635
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,240
You helped with the preparation.

636
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,830
For it to be fair,

637
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,190
we'll play a game and have
the loser do the dishes.

638
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,410
A game?

639
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,820
We bought a Jenga at the market today.

640
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,660
- We'll play that.
- Sure.

641
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,040
Just so you know, this is really delicious.

642
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,490
You're a great cook.

643
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,360
- Dig in then.
- Sure.

644
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,750
So we pull out a block...

645
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,880
and do what is written on it.

646
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,080
Whoever knocks down the pile loses.

647
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,780
- You go first.
- Sure.

648
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,520
What is it? Let me see.

649
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,220
"Show how cute you can be."

650
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,780
Let's just say that I lost.

651
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,730
I won't allow it.

652
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,820
Come on!

653
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,370
Seriously? Is that it?

654
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,230
That's so outdated.

655
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,380
I'm not one to watch a lot of TV shows.

656
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,040
- It's your turn now.
- Sure.

657
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,060
(Take a couple selfie.)

658
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,340
"Take a couple selfie."

659
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,490
This is great since we don't have one yet.

660
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,080
Hold on a second.

661
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,820
- Let's try and look cute in it.
- Sure.

662
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,720
- Come closer.
- Right.

663
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,870
(We're a couple!)

664
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,440
I'll send it to you,

665
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,380
so look at it at least 20 times a day.

666
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,700
All right.

667
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,790
"Save your phone number
under a different name."

668
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,600
What name do you have my number under?

669
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,290
Secretary Oh Jin Sim.

670
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,570
That's not decent at all.

671
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:51,570
- What should I change it to?
- Princess?

672
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,850
How about Princess Oh?

673
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,650
People might think "Oh" means "five".

674
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,880
I'll change it to Princess Oh Jin Sim then.

675
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,670
"Can people of the
opposite sex be friends?"

676
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,380
What's your take on it?

677
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,250
Come on. It's rude to ask that.

678
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,510
"What's a dish that you ate
even though you hated it?"

679
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,490
There's never been one.

680
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,330
I was told from a young age that men
should be able to eat anything.

681
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,450
- All right. I get it.
- Good.

682
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,010
Sure.

683
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,610
(Say a wish.)

684
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,170
"Say a wish."

685
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,090
It can be anything you want.

686
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,350
Your wish will be granted.

687
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,390
What should it be?

688
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,750
Gosh, I can't think of anything right now.

689
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,740
I'll save this for later.

690
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,920
You still have to grant my wish though.

691
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,120
Of course.

692
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,400
- Promise?
- Promise.

693
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,540
Good.

694
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,260
How may I help you?

695
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,600
I'm here to see Mr. Yeon.

696
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,070
Why are the halls so dim?

697
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,530
So you're saying, after Mr. Kwon
grabbed Yun Seo's hand and left,

698
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,870
you can't reach her?

699
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,440
That's what I'm saying.

700
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,330
Yun Seo's cellphone is turned off too.
I don't know what's going on.

701
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,780
Aren't those two dating?

702
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,860
I doubt that. No, they're not.

703
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,810
We had a vote among our
employees to see if...

704
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,080
they were dating or not,

705
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,330
and there was one more vote
that they weren't dating.

706
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,750
Of course they're not dating.

707
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,710
Then why did he grab her hand and leave?

708
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,540
I asked that to our employees as well.

709
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,490
Mr. Kwon may be a bit cranky,

710
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,140
but he has a sense of justice.

711
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,440
So there were opinions that
he grabbed her hand...

712
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,490
in order to help her in case she
was in a difficult situation.

713
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:55,390
He grabbed her hand because
he was in a hurry...

714
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,360
and just grabbed anything.
Yes, that must be right.

715
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,490
There's no way they are dating.

716
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,680
Is that so?

717
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,040
But why do you look so desperate?

718
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,570
Are you desperately hoping
that they're not dating?

719
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,400
I feel sorry to look at you right now.

720
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,480
You trusted me and
sent Yun Seo to this firm.

721
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,200
So if she's caught in a scandal,
would I feel sorry to you or not?

722
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,080
Yes, you would feel sorry.

723
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:31,830
Anyway, as you said,
I hope they're not dating.

724
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,600
If words get out that
Yun Seo might be dating,

725
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:37,770
the situation will turn
into a total disaster.

726
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,210
Is it that bad?

727
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,610
Didn't you see the comments
in the articles about her?

728
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,080
After they found out
Yun Seo started working at...

729
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,230
a law firm in order to play a role
as an attorney, people said...

730
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,480
"My gosh, she has so much
passion for acting."

731
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,280
"It's nice to see her
having a modest attitude."

732
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,390
"She doesn't want to be
treated as a top star now."

733
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,370
There were so many nice comments about her.

734
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,120
What if they find out she's
dating here instead of working?

735
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,430
Who would like that?

736
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,860
Yun Seo went through so much...

737
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,590
in order to recover her image.
If things go haywire again,

738
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,110
I can't live with that.

739
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,820
Did you just sigh?

740
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,270
You know something, don't you?

741
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,960
I probably don't.

742
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:19,750
Mr. Yeon, if I knew,
I'd have already told you.

743
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,000
There seems to be nothing going
on between them to me too.

744
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,870
You don't have to worry so much.

745
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,290
Goodness, I wonder what
those two are up to.

746
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,320
Why did you stop here?

747
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:48,380
If you get off near your house,
the reporters might take pictures.

748
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:52,080
From now on, I'll let you off
here and watch you go home.

749
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,490
Okay.

750
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,240
Drive safely then, Mr. Kwon.

751
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,640
I had a great time skipping work today.

752
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,940
Me too. I had a great time.

753
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,340
Bye.

754
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,090
Yes, this is Kwon Jung Rok.

755
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,710
Oh, yes.

756
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,770
Now?

757
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,790
So, you weren't her cousin,

758
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,340
but her manager?

759
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,260
I'm really sorry for having to lie to you.

760
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,850
Yun Seo quit her job...

761
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,040
as an actress and decided
to work at a law firm.

762
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,910
But if she had a manager
tagging along all the time,

763
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,400
people might've taken it the wrong way.

764
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,570
Yes, I understand.

765
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,040
But why did you want to see me?

766
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:07,660
Do you like...

767
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,610
Yun Seo a lot?

768
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:16,850
Yes. Of course.

769
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:26,020
Is there something wrong with me liking...

770
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,720
Ms. Oh Jin Sim?

771
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,050
Mr. Kwon.

772
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,130
After I was discharged from the army,

773
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,270
I first met Yun Seo when I was 25,

774
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,640
and I've been her manager for 10 years.

775
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:46,730
You can say Yun Seo is all I
have to remember from my youth.

776
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,690
If things went well for her,
I felt even happier.

777
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,580
And if things went wrong,

778
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,020
it was really tough for me.

779
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,590
After Yun Seo's scandal broke out,

780
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,940
I had no one to talk to and drank
soju alone at Han River...

781
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,050
and cried my heart out.

782
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:07,540
I prayed every day, wishing
she could make a comeback.

783
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,440
You must know Yun Seo well by now.

784
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,720
She was just an innocent girl
when she started working in this field,

785
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,910
and besides acting, there's
nothing else she knows how to do.

786
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,890
But the reason she was able to
endure these three months...

787
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,220
is because of her hope of
returning to dramas...

788
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,400
and going back to the times
that she was loved by everyone.

789
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:29,780
That's the only reason.

790
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,140
You may have read the articles,
but word got out that Yun Seo...

791
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:38,270
was working hard at a law
firm to shoot a drama.

792
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,770
Her reputation has been
recovered a lot since then.

793
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,520
But if the fact that she is...

794
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,510
dating you is revealed,

795
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,690
people might start doubting her sincerity.

796
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,340
Mr. Kwon.

797
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,320
Right now is a very critical
moment for Yun Seo.

798
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,760
What is it you want to say?

799
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:07,990
I know it's a cliche, but...

800
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,500
Can you break up for Yun Seo's sake?

801
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,700
As cliche as this may sound,

802
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:31,090
I like Ms. Oh Jin Sim very much.

803
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,890
Telling her that we
should break up first...

804
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,480
will never happen.

805
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,240
I thought he'd get upset since
I didn't tell him beforehand.

806
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,400
But he sincerely congratulated me.

807
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:51,020
I really don't deserve such a
great person like Mr. Kwon.

808
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,530
♫ <i>They say it all</i> ♫

809
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,730
♫ <i>So how can I hold onto you?</i> ♫

810
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:12,470
♫ <i>Your pillow that was always wet</i> ♫

811
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,470
Mr. Kwon, I had such a great time today.

812
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,860
I'm happy to be cast on the drama,

813
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,470
but what makes me the
happiest is being cast...

814
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,760
as your girlfriend.

815
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,900
♫ <i>We fought so much</i> ♫

816
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:35,100
♫ <i>We made up so many times</i> ♫

817
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:42,000
♫ <i>Now we don't have to stay up
at night worrying anymore</i> ♫

818
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:47,500
♫ <i>Now have a peaceful, good night</i> ♫

819
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,030
My gosh. I can't believe it.

820
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,620
They're really dating, right?

821
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,730
- Look at the comments.
- Good morning.

822
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,190
Why are you glaring at me?

823
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,040
Who knows? I wonder why.

824
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:11,500
I'm not sure. Why?

825
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,360
After you grabbed Yun Seo's
hand and left yesterday,

826
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,080
I couldn't reach you all day.

827
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,870
And...

828
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,420
What is this picture?

829
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,270
It was posted on an online blog
that Hae Yeong enjoys watching.

830
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,440
Someone saw you, and it seemed
obvious that you were lovers.

831
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,610
Please explain what this
picture is about, please.

832
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,290
I don't want to explain.

833
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,130
What? Does that mean...

834
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,920
you and Yun Seo are
really in a relationship?

835
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360
No way.

836
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,790
I just helped her to escape from
all those reporters yesterday,

837
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,260
and we're just having a meal
and chatting in this picture.

838
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,220
So I hope all of you don't
think strangely of it.

839
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:06,870
They were just having a meal. A meal.

840
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,560
Yes.

841
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,460
I'm sorry about yesterday.

842
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:16,680
Okay, Mr. Yeon. Yes, I understand.

843
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,930
Bye.

844
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,550
Was that the CEO of your agency?

845
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,380
Yes.

846
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,610
Did he call regarding the photo
that got uploaded online?

847
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:39,230
You also saw that photo?

848
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,190
Yes.

849
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:45,540
I guess it really did go viral.

850
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,750
If an article gets released
along with the photo,

851
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,180
Mr. Yeon says he's going to release
an article saying it's not true.

852
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,970
He's going to tell the press...

853
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,290
that you're just an attorney I
work for at the law firm...

854
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,530
and that our relationship
is strictly formal.

855
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,800
Don't you think you'll feel upset?

856
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:09,640
Pardon?

857
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,680
I don't like it when false
and nonsensical articles...

858
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,700
get published about me.

859
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,070
But the fact that we're
dating is actually true.

860
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,670
So I don't care if an article
gets released about us.

861
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,440
So if, by any chance,

862
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,320
you think you might feel upset...

863
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,960
I'll be okay. You should do
what your agency CEO suggests.

864
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,630
But still... Mr. Kwon...

865
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,800
From what I've seen,
it seems like celebrities...

866
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:40,070
can't help but have their personal
lives exposed to the public.

867
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,960
It could lead to people criticizing you...

868
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,130
and putting you on the spot.

869
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,630
So I think it'd be best
for you to be careful.

870
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,980
There you are, Jung Rok.

871
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,950
I have something on my mind.

872
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,280
Do you think you can help me out?

873
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:16,920
Sure.

874
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,630
What's this?

875
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,440
You know this is Yun Seo's
last week at the firm, right?

876
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,200
So I was thinking about...

877
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,980
creating a meme with one
of her legendary videos...

878
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,730
as a goodbye gift.

879
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,910
But I can't seem to choose one.
Which one should I pick?

880
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,480
Is this what was on your mind?

881
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,810
Yes.

882
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,090
By the way, doesn't Yun Seo...

883
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,460
looks so beautiful?

884
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,630
She looks totally different
from how she looks here.

885
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:54,640
She really does shine when she acts.

886
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,590
Look her smiling at me.

887
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,360
We really don't have much
time left to spend with her.

888
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,030
In a few days,

889
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,290
we'll have to say goodbye to Yun Seo...

890
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:09,480
who's just like Princess Ann
in "Roman Holiday".

891
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:13,220
- I have a question.
- What is it?

892
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,750
What happens to Princess Ann...

893
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,710
in "Roman Holiday"?

894
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:24,140
She's a princess,
so she goes back to her old life.

895
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,170
If you think about it,
it's such a natural ending.

896
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:49,730
As an actress, you must experience
living as various types of people.

897
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,010
It sounds very interesting.

898
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,670
Back then, I was really happy.

899
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,600
I had more fun moments though.

900
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,540
An exciting script would
make my heart thump.

901
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:05,210
Being on a busy set made
me feel like I'm alive.

902
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,380
When my work is received well,

903
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,730
I feel gratified.

904
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,640
Most of my memories are of fun incidents.

905
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:42,630
We congratulate the new beginning
of Yun Seo, the universe's goddess!

906
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,060
Thank you so much for preparing
a goodbye party for me.

907
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,470
Gosh, don't mention it.

908
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:54,200
I thank you even more for completing
your three-month journey...

909
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,280
with Always Law Firm.

910
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:56,810
I feel really sad...

911
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,720
that we won't be able to see you anymore.

912
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,320
What are you talking about?

913
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:04,480
I'm going to visit really often.

914
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,130
- Really? You promised, okay?
- Yes.

915
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,330
Then with all due respect,

916
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:13,260
let's make a pinky promise.

917
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,470
- Okay. Here.
- Goodness.

918
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,710
Take a photo. We should
take a photo for proof.

919
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,920
1, 2, 3.

920
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:28,600
Maybe we should've had her
promise notarized instead.

921
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,840
Let's eat. Yun Seo, sit here.

922
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,850
Okay.

923
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,700
By the way, we're the only ones here.

924
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,300
Did you rent the entire place?

925
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,820
Of course.

926
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:44,010
I heard Yun Seo likes meat,
so I made a reservation here.

927
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,850
I can guarantee the taste,
so I hope all of you enjoy.

928
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,600
I'm so touched.

929
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,780
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

930
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,440
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

931
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,530
Why isn't Mr. Kwon here?

932
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:05,400
He said he needed to meet a client.

933
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,010
Gosh, he could've postponed it.

934
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,830
After all, it's your goodbye party.

935
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,560
I guess he couldn't postpone it
because it's an important client.

936
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,850
Judging by the fact that Jung Rok
didn't show up to the goodbye party,

937
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,810
I guess they really aren't dating.

938
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:22,970
Will you please stop already?

939
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:28,060
- Goodness.
- It's good.

940
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:31,460
- Mr. Kwon, aren't you done yet?
- It's good, right?

941
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,360
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

942
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,370
Can we have more meat?

943
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,220
- Five more servings, please.
- Okay.

944
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:40,270
- Cheers to Yun Seo!
- Cheers to Yun Seo!

945
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,220
The meat here is really good.

946
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:51,930
- It really is delicious.
- Eat up.

947
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:55,690
An article already got published
saying they're looking forward...

948
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,050
to Ms. Oh's drama.

949
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:58,100
- Look.
- Gosh.

950
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,710
I guess everyone feels the same way.

951
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:02,500
I'm also looking forward to it.

952
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:07,440
I'll watch it when it airs. My goodness.

953
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,460
Gosh, you really need to stop.

954
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,890
I'm really happy, but I keep tearing up.

955
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,430
Yun Seo, promise you won't forget us.

956
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,800
You're making her want to forget us.

957
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,760
It's my first time crying.

958
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,770
What's the drama about?

959
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,060
Is it a legal drama?

960
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,340
It's not just a legal drama.

961
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:30,580
It's a romantic comedy between two
people who work in the legal field.

962
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,210
It realistically deals with
the lives of attorneys.

963
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,790
But at the same time, the storyline
is also about a man and a woman...

964
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,400
who start dating by contract...

965
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,870
because they're not sure about
their feelings for each other.

966
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,580
- That sounds like fun.
- How interesting.

967
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,140
They start dating by contract?

968
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,760
- Do you want more meat?
- How childish.

969
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,880
Dating someone by contract?

970
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:18,120
- You can go.
- Okay.

971
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:25,210
Mr. Choi, how about we date
each other by contract?

972
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,450
What?

973
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:31,680
To be honest, I have feelings for you.

974
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,950
So how about we date each other...

975
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,510
for no more than a month?

976
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,270
What do you say?

977
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,920
It's not even a contract regarding
my yearly pay or my house.

978
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,490
But she just made my heart skip
a beat with the word "contract".

979
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,210
What a provocative woman.

980
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,810
What should I do with you?

981
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,600
You're not even replying to my texts.

982
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,430
Can you not make it today?

983
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,230
(Mr. Kwon Jung Rok)

984
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,690
- I'm sorry for coming late.
- Mr. Kwon.

985
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,420
You weren't contacting me,

986
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,000
so I thought you were too busy to make it.

987
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,920
You worked really hard
for me as my secretary,

988
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,610
so I wanted to give you a
special goodbye party.

989
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:48,400
I prepared a separate goodbye party.
That's why I was late.

990
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,120
A separate goodbye party?

991
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:53,670
Yes.

992
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,690
Why did you bring me to a movie theater?

993
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,500
You said you couldn't go to a
theater because of the crowd.

994
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,700
So in order to help you watch
the movie comfortably,

995
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,220
I borrowed the entire place.

996
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:12,470
What? Really?

997
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,170
I asked for a movie you like.

998
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,930
I hope you enjoy it.

999
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,850
- Let's go.
- Sure.

1000
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,010
"Roman Holiday"?

1001
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,010
I had a great time today.

1002
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:59,420
I wanted to watch that movie with you,

1003
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,090
so I'm glad that we got this chance.

1004
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:06,060
I'm glad you think that way.

1005
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,760
It was perfect.

1006
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,870
It was the kind of goodbye
that I expected from you.

1007
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,730
"Goodbye" seems a bit harsh, right?

1008
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:18,040
It seems like we're parting,

1009
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,320
but we only won't be seeing
each other at the law firm.

1010
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,470
Although, that's quite sad too.

1011
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,810
Ms. Oh Yun Seo.

1012
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,800
Why are you suddenly
calling me by that name?

1013
01:03:42,636 --> 01:03:49,280
♫ <i>Your warmth still remains</i> ♫

1014
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,420
Thanks to you,

1015
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,730
I was happy.

1016
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,100
Why are you saying that?

1017
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:03,323
♫ <i>It's wrapping around
the left side of my heart</i> ♫

1018
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:04,870
Just like that movie,

1019
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,400
you'll go back to your world,

1020
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,100
and I'll go back to mine.

1021
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,420
That's what I want.

1022
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:21,375
♫ <i>When I couldn't let go of your right hand</i> ♫

1023
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,000
What are you saying, Mr. Kwon?

1024
01:04:25,212 --> 01:04:30,083
♫ <i>That was hanging by my left pinky</i> ♫

1025
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:37,870
♫ <i>So I held onto your trembling hand</i> ♫

1026
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,270
We...

1027
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:45,710
should break up.

1028
01:04:53,473 --> 01:05:00,180
♫ <i>Don't leave yet, don't let go</i> ♫

1029
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:07,754
♫ <i>That song is playing in my ears</i> ♫

1030
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:14,761
♫ <i>Don't stop, there's still so much</i> ♫

1031
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,640
♫ <i>I haven't told you yet</i> ♫

1032
01:05:21,802 --> 01:05:25,005
♫ <i>I can't let go</i> ♫

1033
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:27,360
(Touch Your Heart)

1034
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:30,740
She looks happier than
she did at our law firm.

1035
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:34,520
You've been working like
a madman these days. I love it.

1036
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,610
- We're ready to shoot.
- I'm ready too.

1037
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,680
Honey, how do I look?

1038
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:42,450
Wait, are you two...
You can't fool my eyes.

1039
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,590
Where's Kwon Jung Rok?

1040
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:47,530
You'll represent
Park Su Myeong at his appeal?

1041
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,730
- You're the one who claimed...
- I'm scared.

1042
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:50,830
Why are you going back on your word?

1043
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:53,470
I feel like I won't be
