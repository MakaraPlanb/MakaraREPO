00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,390
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,610
Hey, Jung Rok.

3
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,890
It's been a while, but here you are
in front of the elevator again.

4
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,490
Do you think I've been waiting for you?

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,240
You're right. I did wait for you.
I waited for about four hours.

6
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,600
What kind of nonsense is that?

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,150
I'd wait for Yun Seo, but not you.

8
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,690
My goodness. Hi, Yun Seo...

9
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,500
Hi, Yoon Sook.

10
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,140
They're a couple working
at the same company.

11
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,570
I saw them secretly holding hands
on the rooftop a couple of times.

12
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,980
I see. No wonder.

13
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,340
Those are the good days.
Showing their affection in secret...

14
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,710
and going on short dates on the rooftop.
It must be so fun.

15
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,380
If you're so jealous, you should
also date someone in our firm.

16
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,030
My goodness. Mr. Yeon, aren't you married?

17
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,120
Jung Rok, it's been a while
since I saw you laugh.

18
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,930
Yes.

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,630
It's true that I'm handsome
enough to be married by now.

20
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,640
But unfortunately, I'm still single.

21
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,530
In my 30s, I was busy pleading justice...

22
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,720
for the weak.

23
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,240
And in my 40s, I was busy
working day and night...

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,680
to manage the firm.
That's why I'm still single.

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,330
I see.

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,220
You're really attractive and kind.
You should start dating someone.

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,450
You should really date someone in the firm.

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,990
Like you mentioned, it'd be so thrilling...

29
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,780
and romantic.

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,380
Date someone in the firm?

31
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,040
Who?

32
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,690
Good morning.

33
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,100
- Hello.
- Good morning.

34
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,630
- Hi.
- Come and have some waffles.

35
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,100
Mr. Choi bought them for us.

36
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,670
That's great. I didn't have breakfast.

37
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,390
They look so delicious. I love waffles.

38
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,070
You should sit down and eat.

39
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,090
Take a seat.

40
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,600
Goodness.

41
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,760
Why did you suddenly get waffles?

42
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,050
I just suddenly remembered...

43
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,090
the winter I spent in Canada.

44
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,620
Her heart was frozen like a snowy field,

45
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,710
and what could only warm up
my body and soul...

46
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,020
was a plate of waffles
covered in maple syrup.

47
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,850
- How are they?
- They're delicious.

48
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,200
- Right?
- Yes.

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,370
- The syrup?
- Yes.

50
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,730
It's delicious.

51
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,530
Ms. Oh, what's wrong?

52
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,850
Your eye...

53
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,200
Did something get in it?

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,160
- Yes.
- Something's in her eye.

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,730
- What?
- Bring some saline.

56
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,800
- Something's in it.
- Get out of my way.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,240
I have some in my office.

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,440
- Do you want me to check?
- No, it's fine.

59
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,120
You're unbelievable!

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,150
How could you suddenly wink
at me in front of everyone?

61
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,920
In the elevator,

62
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,090
you said that showing
affection in secret...

63
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,160
was both thrilling and romantic.
That's why.

64
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,430
Seriously though.

65
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,080
You can't come at me without any warning.

66
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,310
I was surprised, that's all.

67
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,190
- Right.
- Gosh.

68
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,140
You know what? I'll make the
most of the time I have left.

69
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,640
I won't let any of it go to waste.

70
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,510
I'll do my best to help you.

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,570
It's good.

72
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,960
Come to think of it, we haven't
had lunch with Ms. Oh before.

73
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,980
That had to be the case...

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,040
since restaurants are
usually fully packed...

75
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,040
during lunch.

76
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,890
That's right. It's uncomfortable for you.

77
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,040
Was I wrong to ask you to lunch then?

78
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,410
No, it's all right.

79
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,930
I'm fine if we can book a room.

80
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,780
There aren't many side dishes to eat today.

81
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,680
- Let's enjoy though.
- They're still delicious.

82
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,940
Right, dig in.

83
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,250
I pushed braised beef
in front of you, Ms. Oh.

84
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,460
I know you're fond of meat.

85
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,260
(I know you're fond of meat.)

86
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,200
Would you like some water?

87
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,630
Sure. Thank you.

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,180
I placed the stir-fried ham
in front of you.

89
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,060
I know you have a childish palate.

90
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,710
Right, I immediately ate one.

91
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,240
Enjoy your lunch then.

92
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,180
- Mr. Kwon.
- Yes?

93
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,840
Who are you texting in the middle of lunch?

94
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,170
A client's been texting me.

95
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,830
Even during meals, you can't let go...

96
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,200
of your passion for this job.

97
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,440
You have become my role model.

98
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,190
I have nothing but respect for you.

99
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,290
Don't you agree?

100
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,660
Yes, I admire you too.

101
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,610
Now you're just kissing his butt.

102
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,770
It's all about the balance.
During meals, you should just eat.

103
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,780
From what I can see, he's a workaholic.

104
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,820
I know. Sometimes, I worry
because he works too much.

105
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,030
What's wrong if he enjoys it?

106
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,120
You truly like your job, don't you?

107
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,390
Yes, oh, I truly like to work.

108
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,540
What did you have to say to me?

109
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,870
The braised beef earlier.

110
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,790
- It was delicious.
- What?

111
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,400
Is that what you called me here to say?

112
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,320
In TV shows, couples that secretly date...

113
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,860
get together in the stairwell.

114
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,070
I've always wanted to do that.

115
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,360
If you're free later, would you
like to join me for dinner?

116
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,510
As in a date? I'd love that.

117
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,780
Then I'll book us a nice restaurant.

118
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,190
Sure.

119
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,980
Print out the customs
application immediately.

120
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,470
Yes, Mr. Kwon. I'll get right on it.

121
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,260
Get on it then. What are you waiting for?

122
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,420
Sure.

123
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,640
You were cutting it close.

124
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,400
You know very well that
you shouldn't gamble,

125
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,060
but you even went abroad to do so.

126
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,830
This can sound too brutal,

127
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,320
but this isn't your first offense.

128
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,740
It won't end with a slap on the wrist.

129
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,710
Even I hate the person...

130
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,690
that I've become.

131
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,320
I know very well that
what I'm doing is wrong,

132
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,500
but I just can't help myself.

133
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,230
You're right.

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,990
Why can't you help yourself?

135
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,190
You must be crazy.

136
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,860
What?

137
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,180
You think I'm crazy?

138
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,690
How could you say such a thing?

139
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,710
I wasn't talking about you, sir.

140
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,900
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,560
Ms. Kim.

142
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,340
What are you smiling at?

143
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,680
I've been enjoying scuba diving lately...

144
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,140
with friends I met on an app.

145
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,110
I'm looking at the photos I took with them.

146
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,150
You met friends on an app?

147
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,200
Yes.

148
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,920
On this app, you can meet friends...

149
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,370
who share the same interests.

150
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,030
Hold on. Are you interested?

151
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,230
I've been distracted lately,

152
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,640
so I'd like to focus
my mind on something else.

153
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,660
Are there people who enjoy the ukulele?
I'd love to join them.

154
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,400
Do you even have one?

155
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,110
I have one that I don't use,

156
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,060
so you can buy it from me.

157
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,570
- Sorry?
- I'll give you a good deal.

158
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,980
I'll bring it to the office soon.

159
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,130
No, it's all right.

160
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,290
I need to stop getting tangled up with him.

161
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,650
Is it a special day today?

162
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,640
This isn't just any restaurant.

163
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,630
You can't go to crowded restaurants,

164
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,210
so we only ate bad food or from the car.

165
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,100
I wanted to take you out
to a decent restaurant.

166
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,170
I see.

167
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,280
You really surprised me earlier though.

168
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,610
As you know, you can be...

169
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,390
quite dry.

170
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,760
I didn't think you'd ever try anything...

171
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,430
so risky in front of people.

172
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,910
You were bolder than I expected you to be.

173
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,060
I didn't know that I had it in me either.

174
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,660
I only did it because you like it.

175
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,360
Also, it's just like you said.

176
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,810
I don't want to waste the
little time we have together.

177
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,060
We only have about a month...

178
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,510
to enjoy our secret dating life.

179
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,620
There's nothing there.

180
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,430
When did I eat it all?

181
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,040
I truly have a problem with steaks.

182
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,320
On an enormous plate,
they give you a small lump of meat.

183
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,960
Shouldn't the piece be about half its size?

184
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,380
Can't we make a law out of it?

185
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,270
That will probably never happen,

186
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,920
so take this instead.

187
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,410
It's not why I mentioned it.

188
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,050
Honestly, it's fine.

189
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,730
I'm good too.

190
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,030
- Then...
- Please stop.

191
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,170
Just have it.

192
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,680
Every day has been a joy for me lately.

193
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,500
Having you by my side
is the biggest reason.

194
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,910
When I first started off at the law firm,

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,650
I told myself to suck it up
and hang in there...

196
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,560
for three months.

197
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,120
But I'm enjoying my work now,

198
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,970
and I even like the company dinners.

199
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,380
The workshop was fun too.

200
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,420
Everything about it is fun and exciting.

201
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,150
Mr. Yeon was right.

202
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,940
You're like Princess Ann
in "Roman Holiday".

203
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,380
You leave your frustrating life...

204
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,430
and find joy in what others view as normal.

205
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,210
Have you watched "Roman Holiday"?

206
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,590
I think I saw it on TV
when it was aired as a classic.

207
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,030
Are you kidding me?

208
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,680
"Roman Holiday" should be watched properly.

209
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,740
It's my favorite movie.

210
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,210
I have the DVD at home.
Would you like to watch it together?

211
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,440
It's Saturday tomorrow.
You should come to my house.

212
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,160
Sure.

213
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,730
Wait a second.

214
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,230
What did I just say?

215
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,300
Wait a second.

216
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,840
Does that mean I'll go over
to Ms. Oh's house tomorrow?

217
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,070
Oh my goodness.

218
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,910
I really just wanted to
watch a movie with him.

219
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,810
She asked me to come over to
watch a movie, so I said yes.

220
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,420
What if she thinks I'm
after something else?

221
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,650
I hope he doesn't think that.

222
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,340
In situations like this,
I have to act casually.

223
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,350
If not, it might become more awkward.

224
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,980
Then let's watch that movie tomorrow.

225
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,070
- It sounds fun.
- Yes.

226
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,110
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Me too.

227
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,730
I never imagined watching "Roman Holiday".

228
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,620
You're home. Did you have dinner?

229
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,670
AI robots might replace...

230
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,690
What's up with him?

231
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,870
Does he have some urgent work to do?

232
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,090
On TV...

233
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,410
I can't go empty-handed.

234
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,400
What should I bring?

235
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,360
(Going over to your girlfriend's house)

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,830
(Erotic fantasies men have when
they visit their girlfriend's house)

237
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,630
That's not true.

238
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,260
I'm just going to watch a movie.

239
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,300
It's just that...

240
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,270
the location is Ms. Oh's house,
instead of a movie theater.

241
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,280
My goodness.

242
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,330
♫ <i>I always felt distant from you</i> ♫

243
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,850
♫ <i>But the day we walked together,
your warm laugh</i> ♫

244
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,060
♫ <i>Changed things</i> ♫

245
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,250
♫ <i>It made me curious</i> ♫

246
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,750
♫ <i>It's very complicated in my head</i> ♫

247
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,380
♫ <i>Times when the wind blew</i> ♫

248
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,800
♫ <i>Now have changed into
a different memory</i> ♫

249
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,170
Now it's clean enough to make him
think that I'm a neat person.

250
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,720
I've never had a boyfriend
come to my house before.

251
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,420
I feel so nervous.

252
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,070
♫ <i>I just wanna be your star for you</i> ♫

253
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:22,080
♫ <i>With my heart that I hid</i> ♫

254
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,040
♫ <i>I'll shine on you
when things get dark and tiring</i> ♫

255
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,660
♫ <i>I'll embrace your day</i> ♫

256
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,790
♫ <i>I just wanna be your star with my heart</i> ♫

257
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,190
♫ <i>With twinkling starlight</i> ♫

258
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,990
Oh, gosh. He must be here.

259
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,500
♫ <i>I'll shine on you when you feel alone</i> ♫

260
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,820
Who is it?

261
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,390
Hello, it's Jung Rok.

262
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,020
Oh, right.

263
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,310
Well, then... Come on in.

264
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,350
Okay.

265
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,530
Oh, right. This is for you.

266
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,060
- What is it?
- It's a gift.

267
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,760
You said you have insomnia.

268
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,020
I heard a glass of wine is
helpful for getting good sleep.

269
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,320
Thank you.

270
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,650
I'm looking forward to tonight...

271
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,080
What did you just say?

272
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,740
You look forward to tonight?

273
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,160
I meant, I'm looking forward to
getting a good night's sleep.

274
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,520
What if he misunderstood me?

275
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,650
Right. I hope you get a
good night's sleep tonight.

276
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,480
Can I take it off?

277
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,320
Why did you leave out the object?

278
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,730
I meant, "Can I take off my jacket"?

279
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,270
You're an attorney. How could you
be so horrible at grammar?

280
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,640
What if she takes it the wrong way?

281
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,700
I meant my jacket. This jacket.

282
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,810
- Yes, sure.
- Okay.

283
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,870
Can I put this here?

284
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,030
Okay.

285
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,220
You have a lovely home.

286
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,100
Do you want to take a look around?

287
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,250
- Shall we?
- Okay.

288
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,920
This is the study.

289
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,400
This is the space I spend most
of my time in at my house.

290
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,080
You have so many books.

291
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,280
Yes, I really enjoy reading.

292
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,440
Someone might think...

293
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,880
this dust piled up because I never
read a book, but that's not true.

294
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,260
I read a lot, but I don't clean often.

295
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,650
I clean a lot, but I don't read...

296
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,380
No...

297
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,860
Why don't we take a look
around somewhere else?

298
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,700
- This is my bedroom.
- I see.

299
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,210
Isn't the dressing table gorgeous?

300
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,350
I really love this bed too.

301
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,380
This type of design seems ordinary,
but it's very rare.

302
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,520
The headboard is set just right,

303
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,360
and the mattress is really bouncy too.

304
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,380
Hold on. Why am I explaining
my bed in detail to him right now?

305
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,410
What do you mean by saying the
mattress is really bouncy?

306
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,700
Are you asking him to lie
down next to you or what?

307
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,150
I hope he doesn't interpret it like that.

308
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,040
Wait. Why did you turn off the lights?

309
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,560
Turning off the lights in the bedroom?
Get a grip, Jung Rok.

310
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,630
It was a mistake.

311
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,110
Of course, I know.

312
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,060
Then shall we go see the kitchen?

313
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,970
I'll send you a written opinion via email.

314
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,110
If you have an opinion,
please send a reply.

315
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,650
Okay.

316
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,410
- Ms. Dan.
- Mr. Choi.

317
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,540
What brings you here on the weekend?

318
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,420
I had some work left regarding a case.

319
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,730
What about you?

320
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,550
I had some work left too.

321
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,470
I'm glad. I brought a ukulele
I wanted to give you.

322
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,270
I'll bring it to your office later on.

323
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,650
What on earth? Just the two of us
in the office on the weekend?

324
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,760
Is this what they call...

325
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,560
fate?

326
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,540
Fate, my foot.

327
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,110
Snap back into it, Moon Hee.

328
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,660
You promised yourself not to be tempted.

329
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,080
Ms. Dan, I brought the ukulele for you.

330
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,490
- Oh, how much is it?
- It's fine.

331
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,550
Just buy me a drink sometime.

332
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,900
- A drink?
- Yes.

333
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,310
Okay, then. Here you go.

334
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,040
Thank you for everything.

335
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,500
You were a part of me,

336
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,400
and I was a part of you.

337
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,300
You and I became one and made...

338
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,480
all those emotional harmonies.

339
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,140
I'll never forget it.

340
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,240
As a farewell, I will play this song...

341
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,990
that we used to enjoy.

342
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,470
This is the end of my farewell song.

343
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,040
Well then, here you go.

344
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,630
Thank you.

345
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,440
Handle it with great care.

346
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,660
Do you know how to play the ukulele?

347
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,060
I learned briefly a long time ago.

348
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,140
I know how to play basic chords.

349
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,570
C chord.

350
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,320
F... F chord...

351
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,200
Your posture is all wrong.

352
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,730
Here.

353
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,030
Let's see.

354
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,480
Loosen your shoulders.

355
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,920
Then you must hold the
ukulele very preciously...

356
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,690
like it's a little baby.

357
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,210
Just like this.

358
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:14,340
The feelings I started developing for him

359
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,280
I wished that those
feelings wouldn't be love

360
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:28,390
And the pitiful look in your eyes
when you looked at me

361
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,310
I wished that I was just mistaken

362
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,380
Our love was only blessed by the skies

363
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,810
And no one else

364
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,010
Please!

365
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,320
Let my love come true!

366
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,820
I just want to love him!

367
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,490
Mr. Choi!

368
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,540
You must watch a lot of movies at home.

369
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,530
Yes, I really like watching movies.

370
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,550
I see.

371
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,470
- Just a second.
- Okay.

372
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,190
Yes, Prosecutor.

373
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,530
Yes.

374
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,900
No, next Wednesday isn't a good day for me.

375
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,070
No, that's not it.

376
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,720
Where did it go? I'm sure it was here.

377
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,010
Hey, Hyuk Joon.

378
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,530
I can't find the Blu-ray player.
Where did it go?

379
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,710
What? You took it to get it repaired?

380
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,570
You should've told me before you took it.

381
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,180
What? Every time anything
broke in your house,

382
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,820
I always took it to get it repaired.

383
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,450
Why are you being so sensitive
about it all of a sudden?

384
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,450
My goodness.

385
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,750
Okay, bye.

386
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,160
Are we going to start watching the movie?

387
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,420
Well...

388
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,940
- I can't play it.
- What do you mean?

389
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,800
Is it because you're worried
that it might not be fun?

390
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,940
It's okay. I don't normally
enjoy watching movies,

391
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,260
but since it's your favorite movie,
I'm open to watching it.

392
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,050
No, that's not it.

393
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,120
I meant I don't have the Blu-ray player...

394
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,790
to play the movie.

395
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,580
It's getting repaired right now.
I must've forgotten about it.

396
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,520
I see.

397
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,450
We'll just have to make do...

398
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,480
We'll just have to make do with a laptop.

399
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,290
I'll quickly download the movie.

400
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,360
I'm fine with that. You can take your time.

401
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,140
Go ahead.

402
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,320
I've been wanting to see your trophies.

403
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,860
Is it okay if I go take a close look?

404
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,390
Sure.

405
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,580
KBC Popularity Award.

406
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,710
MBU Hot Issue Celebrity Award.

407
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,350
TBM Teen Choice Award.

408
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,880
SBC Netizens' Award.

409
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,140
Gosh, you received so many awards.

410
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,590
Yes, I did.

411
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,000
The problem is that they're
all popularity awards.

412
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,790
Why is that a problem?

413
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,540
I never got an award for acting.
They're all popularity awards,

414
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,660
so it's a little embarrassing.

415
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,440
Why is that embarrassing?

416
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,670
The fact that you're popular
means a lot of people like you.

417
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,550
I personally think it's very
hard to make people like you.

418
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,600
I'm very impressed.

419
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,770
Really?

420
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,070
But if I get another chance to act,

421
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,360
I feel like I'll be able
to do a really good job.

422
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,260
Back then, I didn't really know
how it felt to like someone...

423
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,160
or how it felt to have my heart flutter.

424
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,860
So I didn't really know how
to express those feelings.

425
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,320
But now...

426
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,810
Now, I think I kind of know.

427
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,900
Which drama is that photo from?

428
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,240
You look really pretty.

429
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,400
This photo isn't from a drama.

430
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,450
This chocolate bar advertisement
is how I made my debut.

431
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,580
All the chocolate bars got sold out
because of this advertisement,

432
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,400
and people even started
calling me "the chocolate fairy".

433
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,800
- You didn't see this advertisement?
- No.

434
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,480
My goodness, we shouldn't
watch "Roman Holiday".

435
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,930
Come here.

436
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,910
- Hurry. Hurry.
- Okay.

437
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:28,030
♫ <i>I love everything,
even the sorrow of this world</i> ♫

438
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,010
Look at this. Don't I look
really pretty and cute?

439
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,660
I look pretty here as well, don't I?
I also look very innocent and pure.

440
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,170
How pretty.

441
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,840
Don't I look really elegant?

442
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,540
Do you also want to see
my photoshoot collection?

443
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,650
- That? Sure.
- Would you like to see?

444
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,520
Back then I didn't know,
but I really was pretty.

445
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,520
Don't you agree?

446
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,920
Come to think of it,
why aren't you responding?

447
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,780
- Don't I look pretty?
- You do look pretty.

448
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,580
But you look even prettier now.

449
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,310
Right now, sitting in front of me.

450
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,390
Can I have this?

451
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,070
- This?
- Yes.

452
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,650
To be honest, I want all of them,
but that doesn't sound right.

453
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,410
But I really want to take this one.

454
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,800
Sure, go ahead.

455
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,630
You know what? I'll give you one more.

456
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,000
- Okay.
- There are a lot of nice ones,

457
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,770
so you must choose carefully.

458
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,110
- Is this from that advertisement?
- Yes.

459
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,240
I like the smell.

460
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,740
I'm glad you like it.

461
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,630
I feel so bad.

462
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,830
I invited you over so
we could watch a movie,

463
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,730
but we didn't get to watch anything.

464
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,790
I'm sorry.

465
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,790
I'm actually relieved that we
didn't get to watch a movie.

466
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,890
What?

467
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,290
To be honest, I couldn't sleep a wink...

468
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,580
last night.

469
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,070
I got really nervous.

470
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,520
The thought of coming to
your house made me feel unfamiliar,

471
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,240
awkward,

472
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,650
and excited at the same time.

473
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,130
I felt the same way.

474
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,420
The thought of having you
over at my house...

475
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,470
made my heart flutter so much.

476
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,550
I already have trouble sleeping
because of insomnia.

477
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,660
But last night, I literally
stayed up all night.

478
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,080
I thought I was the only
one who felt that way.

479
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,080
I also felt the same way.

480
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,520
Anyway, I was really nervous.
But I feel a lot better...

481
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,140
after having chatted with
you a lot as we looked...

482
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,490
at your photoshoot collection.

483
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,990
Me too.

484
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,740
I also loosened up as we
started looking at my photos.

485
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,800
Before that, I couldn't stop
thinking about the fact...

486
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,870
that you and I were at
my place all by ourselves.

487
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,290
And that made me imagine so many things.

488
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,400
But that doesn't necessarily mean...

489
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,650
that I imagined anything bad.

490
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,180
By bad, do you mean...

491
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,660
Well...

492
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,830
Something like this?

493
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,220
Or...

494
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,060
this?

495
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,590
Hey, Hyuk Joon.

496
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,110
What? You're going to be late? How late?

497
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,420
Oh, okay. Call me when you get here.

498
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,030
Okay, bye.

499
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,230
I had fun with Mr. Kwon last night.

500
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,760
Is this why people get married?

501
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,580
Being with that person is just fun...

502
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,830
no matter what you do.

503
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,830
Lee Gang Joon, the former director...

504
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,800
of Jeguk Entertainment who was
arrested on drug charges,

505
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,140
returns as vice president
of Jeguk Holdings,

506
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,870
the holding company of Jeguk Group.

507
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,150
The entire group will be reorganized...

508
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,700
as he will supervise various subsidiaries.

509
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,220
Some are criticizing that...

510
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,260
his comeback is premature.

511
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,020
Vice President Lee Gang Joon
of Jeguk Group.

512
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,020
He was famously involved in a
drug case with an actress.

513
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,470
- Was it Oh Yun Seo?
- Oh Yun Seo?

514
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,930
He stalked Oh Yun Seo, but she
wouldn't accept his advances.

515
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,980
So he called narcotics to
frame her on drug charges.

516
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,840
At the time, Jeguk Group promised...

517
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,380
to take all criticism heavily
and Vice President Lee...

518
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,600
Are you off to work?

519
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,940
Where else would I go at this hour?

520
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,200
See you.

521
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,130
Hold on.

522
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,720
Is anything up with Ms. Oh?

523
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,760
I'm just curious, that's all.

524
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,520
How is the universe's goddess doing?

525
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,790
She's fine.

526
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,270
- You should get to work too.
- Right.

527
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,490
Yes, Mr. Yeon. I saw the news too.

528
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,210
Lee Gang Joon is back in Korea.

529
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,750
Nothing's out of the ordinary yet.

530
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,840
I doubt Yun Seo knows since
she never watches the news.

531
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,720
Yun Seo's on her way out.

532
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,550
I'll call you later. Sure.

533
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,650
All right. What is it?

534
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,010
Whose call did you abruptly end?

535
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,350
What? I did nothing of the sort.

536
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,720
There.

537
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,500
- Yun Seo.
- Yes?

538
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,260
What is it?

539
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,970
How are things these days?

540
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,620
Has anyone been lurking around you...

541
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,610
or following you around?

542
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,360
Hold on. Why are you asking me that?

543
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,220
Isn't it obvious?

544
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,560
You're Oh Yun Seo!

545
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,330
You're so beautiful that
I'm constantly worried.

546
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,060
Do I look good today as well?

547
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,420
Yes, like always.

548
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,690
- I'll get going then.
- Sure.

549
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,630
Bye, Hyuk Joon.

550
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,510
- Have a good day.
- You too.

551
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,710
Yes, Mr. Kwon. Good morning.

552
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,670
The ruling? Hold on a second.

553
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,620
Let me see.

554
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,440
Sure. Where should I send it?

555
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,740
I'm in the parking lot, so I'll
send it once I get up there.

556
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,760
Don't worry.

557
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,000
I'll see you soon.

558
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,620
How are things these days?

559
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,140
Has anyone been lurking around you...

560
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,100
or following you around?

561
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,260
How are things these days?

562
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,870
Has anyone been lurking around you...

563
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,800
or following you around?

564
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,730
Excuse me.

565
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,850
Who are you...

566
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,550
and why are you following me?

567
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,570
- Well, your pen...
- You're a fan?

568
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,320
You're mistaken, sir. I'm not a celebrity.

569
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,880
I'm just a normal girl who's
exceptionally pretty.

570
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,560
Hold on a second.

571
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,770
Why do you keep following me?

572
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,070
I already told you that
I'm not a celebrity!

573
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,750
Wait. That's not it!

574
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,980
Unbelievable.

575
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,890
Hi, honey. Yes, I'm at Jung Rok's law firm.

576
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,910
Jung Rok?

577
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,560
He's not answering his phone.

578
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,180
I'm almost at the office,
so I'll tell him face to face.

579
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,030
Sure.

580
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,770
How can I help you?

581
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,590
I'm here to see Attorney Kwon Jung Rok.

582
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,650
Tell him that Kwon Jae Bok is here.

583
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,710
You must be Mr. Kwon's father.

584
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,440
How did you know that instantly?

585
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,010
I just got a vibe.

586
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,390
Anyway, his office is right down the hall.

587
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,740
- Let me show you...
- No, it's all right.

588
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,990
I can find my own way.

589
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,210
The ruling is now sent.

590
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,250
I can't believe you followed me in here!

591
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,900
I'm not Oh Yun Seo...

592
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,280
All right, fine. I am Oh Yun Seo.

593
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,780
Are you happy now?

594
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,990
- What?
- You said you were a fan.

595
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,050
Are you happy now that
you caused me trouble?

596
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,380
How did you know that I work here?

597
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,560
Just how much about me do you know?

598
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,980
Look here, miss. I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

599
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,550
I'm not a fan of yours.

600
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,250
I just wanted to return
the pen that you dropped.

601
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,920
- Sorry?
- Also,

602
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,220
I didn't follow you here.
I'm here to see my son.

603
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,350
What do you mean you're
here to see your son?

604
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,410
Isn't this Kwon Jung Rok's office?

605
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,840
- It is.
- See?

606
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,200
I'm here to see Jung Rok, my son.

607
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,270
So Mr. Kwon is your...

608
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,630
Sir!

609
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,680
Hello, sir!

610
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:47,810
Father?

611
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,150
Unbelievable.

612
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,860
How could I treat his father that way?

613
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,480
What brings you by?

614
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,650
Why not wear something warmer?

615
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,140
Your neck's all exposed.

616
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,430
You'll catch a cold at that rate.

617
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,080
I'm making sure that I
stay healthy just fine.

618
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,420
Call your mom often as well.

619
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,810
That's something I've been working on.

620
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,980
Seriously?

621
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,230
Can't you just say "yes" for once?

622
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,850
You always need to have the final say.

623
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,680
The more I think of it,
the more annoyed I am.

624
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,610
How can she think that I
followed her up here?

625
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,290
I'm worried to see that you have such...

626
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,730
an irresponsible secretary.

627
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,890
All people make mistakes.

628
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,080
Was this done by that secretary of yours?

629
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,820
Is this a coloring book?

630
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,830
Instead of coloring the boxes,

631
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,310
she should spend that time doing more work.

632
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,190
She does what needs to be done around here.

633
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,510
Her attitude says otherwise.

634
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,630
Someone serious about their
work wouldn't dress like that.

635
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,370
You're being biased if that's
what you're judging her on.

636
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,920
- Still, I can already tell how...
- Dad.

637
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,550
Tell me why you're here.

638
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,850
Does there have to be a reason for
a dad to come to see his son?

639
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,840
This is my workplace.

640
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,230
You came all the way here to
see me during working hours,

641
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,540
so I thought it was because
of something urgent.

642
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,650
Fine then.

643
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,950
I'm sorry to disturb you
during your working hour.

644
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,630
I'll go take care of my work too then.

645
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,270
Sir, I prepared coffee... Have a good day.

646
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,420
Why did your dad just leave?

647
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,850
He didn't even drink coffee.

648
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,540
Did you two have a fight?

649
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,920
Is it because of me?

650
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,980
It's not that. Don't mind it.

651
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,370
It doesn't seem so to me.

652
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,350
He got upset because of me, right?

653
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,850
My dad and I aren't compatible,
so we clash every time we meet.

654
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,310
It's nothing to be proud of.

655
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,840
So there's no need for you
to be worried about it.

656
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,840
We have all the documentary evidence,
so let's indict him.

657
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,860
It's finally time to indict him.

658
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,250
Shall we go out for lunch now?

659
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,070
That sounds good.
Let's go eat something tasty.

660
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,700
Since you all worked hard,
let's go and eat something nice.

661
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,910
- How about beef?
- Beef?

662
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,790
- Sure.
- This is Mr. Kim's office.

663
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,460
Yes, sir.

664
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,030
What?

665
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,650
What's making you hesitate so much?

666
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,070
I wonder what kind of shocking story it is.

667
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,850
Alright, I'll be honest with you
and cut to the chase.

668
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,930
The Jung Ji Ho case. Wrap it up quickly.

669
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,860
I want to wrap it up more than anyone else.

670
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,220
So I'm starting to make
progress bit by bit.

671
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,360
I looked over the case too,

672
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,590
and all Jung Ji Ho did was
gamble abroad illegally.

673
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,310
There isn't enough evidence to prove...

674
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,620
he embezzled the slush funds.

675
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,600
The circumstances point out this was
the vice president's own doing.

676
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,070
Is what you're saying the truth...

677
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,470
or do we have to make it look that way?

678
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:28,630
Is...

679
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,040
the district attorney behind this?

680
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
What?

681
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,320
Attorney Choi Yoon Su who is
in charge of this case...

682
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,410
is the district attorney's brother-in-law.

683
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:39,190
What does that have to do with this?

684
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,750
Just conclude that the embezzlement
was due to the vice president's...

685
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,810
Sir!

686
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,080
Sir.

687
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,540
Don't you remember what you told me
when you brought me back?

688
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,990
You said Jung Ji Ho's embezzlement
case would be difficult...

689
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,040
to investigate if it weren't
for a nutcase like me.

690
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,360
I know what you mean.

691
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,580
I have no excuse whatsoever. But...

692
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,480
this seems more complicated
than I expected.

693
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,380
You went through a lot of
trouble to return to work.

694
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,690
I'm just afraid this might
threaten your position too.

695
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,600
Okay?

696
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,740
Mr. Kwon.

697
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,620
Did you call your dad?

698
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,210
Did he go home safely?

699
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,250
I'm just worried he didn't get to
say what he came here to say...

700
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,440
because of me.

701
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,250
I don't think so. There was
no particular reason he came here.

702
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,970
You're wrong. I remember...

703
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,880
him saying that he came
to say something to you.

704
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,290
What?

705
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,050
- I have to take this call.
- Okay, then.

706
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,160
Yes, Mom. I was about to...

707
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,850
What? What happened to Dad?

708
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,840
Your dad...

709
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,900
revealed that the deputy mayor
embezzled 2.7 million dollars,

710
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,750
and he was suspended for three months...

711
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,900
for violating the Government Officials Act.

712
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,740
He didn't tell you anything?

713
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,830
He said he'd visit you
to discuss that matter.

714
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,870
(Deputy Mayor Kim Jun Cheol should
withdraw his unfair suspension!)

715
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,650
I'm here.

716
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,170
What are you here for? How did you know?

717
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,090
Mom told me.

718
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,210
Your mom got nosy again.

719
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,820
You must be busy, so get going.

720
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,840
Let's go somewhere for a cup of coffee.

721
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,010
Do you think I'm in a state to have coffee?

722
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,900
You should at least protest
after warming up your body.

723
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,510
That punk.

724
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,200
There's no need to sigh.

725
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,360
I'm actually glad that I was suspended.

726
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,700
- What do you mean?
- Even though I exposed the truth,

727
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,930
nothing changed.

728
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,310
Everyone was trying to cover this issue up.

729
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,430
But I was eventually
suspended for three months,

730
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,370
and thanks to that, I have a
reason to justify my protest.

731
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,530
Perhaps...

732
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,970
this may be a chance to let the
world know about this matter.

733
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,060
Did you request an appeal?

734
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,380
When is the hearing?

735
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,640
Tomorrow.

736
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,390
What if your suspension is finalized?

737
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:14,070
I'll file a lawsuit in order
to withdraw it.

738
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,810
Is that why you came by to
the law firm earlier today?

739
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:22,470
To ask me to defend you
in case you go to trial?

740
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,680
Why didn't you tell me
that from the beginning?

741
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,950
Did you even give me a chance to ask you?

742
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,830
Still, you shouldn't have left like that.

743
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,990
You always have a knack
for making me a bad son.

744
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,570
So that's what happened.

745
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,110
He must've been so upset,

746
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,760
and I can't believe
I made a mistake like that.

747
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,530
Don't worry about it.
It won't be a problem.

748
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,020
Even if he gets suspended,
we can just file a lawsuit.

749
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,570
I'll try my best to set things straight,

750
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,560
so you don't have to be worried.

751
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,320
I'm telling you, it's fine.

752
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,270
It's not just that.

753
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,430
I'm just worried that I might have...

754
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,930
offended your father.

755
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,010
If he finds out you're dating a
celebrity with a complicated past,

756
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,270
he'll be worried sick.

757
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,590
I totally ruined making a
good first impression.

758
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,860
There's no reason to be upset.

759
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,770
Once people know what
kind of person you are,

760
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,760
there's no reason why
anyone wouldn't like you.

761
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,410
There's a good reason you won
all those broadcasting awards.

762
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,630
Then will your father go to
the hearing alone tomorrow?

763
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,070
Yes.

764
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,480
He'll make a personal statement...

765
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,700
and listen to the details
regarding his suspension.

766
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,100
There's no reason for me
to tag along tomorrow.

767
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,150
I see.

768
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,070
Your father might feel
nervous if he goes alone.

769
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,100
What? You want me to go
to the hearing with him?

770
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,390
No matter how much I think about it,

771
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,680
your father will be too
nervous if he goes alone.

772
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,870
So, as his son and
his attorney, you should...

773
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:36,200
accompany him.

774
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,420
I canceled all your morning appointments,

775
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,630
so you should go.

776
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:45,460
I appreciate the gesture,
but you don't seem to know him well.

777
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,130
He's not someone to get nervous
over something like this.

778
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,770
He's much stronger than me, mentally.

779
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,130
That's what you think.

780
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,930
No matter how strong he is,
everything must be new to him now.

781
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,580
He might feel more nervous than usual,

782
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,690
and he might need someone he can depend on.

783
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,810
Please just go for me.

784
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:11,940
Come on.

785
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:14,340
It just makes me so uneasy...

786
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,270
thinking that you two might
have been hurt because of me.

787
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,690
So please just go, for my sake.

788
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,680
Okay, well...

789
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,010
Alright then, shall we?

790
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,070
Here. Take this with you.

791
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,660
It's a sedative.

792
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,330
I know it's a bit old-fashioned
and doesn't suit my image,

793
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,990
but there's nothing better than this
when you need to calm your nerves.

794
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,890
Okay, then. I'll see you later.

795
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,480
It's time for you to go. Go on.

796
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:19,830
Hey, Dad.

797
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,000
Why did you come?

798
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,090
My schedule got canceled,
so I thought I'd drop by.

799
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,920
You must have a lot more
free time than I thought.

800
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,840
The written opinion and materials
for explanation are all ready.

801
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,610
So I'm sure there won't be a problem.

802
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,550
If you get disciplined,
and this ends up turning into a lawsuit,

803
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,780
I'll make sure we win the
case no matter what.

804
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,470
So don't worry too much.

805
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,600
I'm not worried.

806
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,710
I know you'll do well.

807
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,850
I have a sedative. Do you want it?

808
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,690
I'll take it if you have it.

The hearing should be over by now.

815
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,870
Hey, Mr. Kwon. How did it go?

816
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,410
He got suspended for three months.

817
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,020
I think we'll have to start
getting ready to file a lawsuit.

818
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,290
And you were right.

819
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,090
I think it was a good idea
to stay with my dad today.

820
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,310
The sedative you gave me also helped a lot.

821
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,690
Thank you for being so considerate.

822
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,410
No, don't mention it.

823
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,180
You should console your dad.

824
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,730
Don't be so grumpy to him.

825
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:53,880
Buy him something delicious for
lunch so he can feel better.

826
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,150
Oh, by the way,

827
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:58,830
it'd be nice if you could
lightly mention...

828
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:02,600
that I was the one who
gave him the sedative.

829
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,810
Okay, I'll do that.

830

(Background investigation on suspect)

832
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:31,000
I just met the chief prosecutor.

833
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,170
Did he tell you to convince me to stop?

834
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:38,370
Let me save your time.
Don't try to convince me.

835
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,010
What if you get on his bad side?

836
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,200
You only recently came back.
If you do this, you might...

837
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,990
I just told you not to convince me.

838
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,680
Don't try to call it even with this.

839
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,820
You should repay me properly.

840
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,540
Don't worry. I'm not that unconscientious.

841
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,920
But what's with the long face?

842
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,250
Is there something wrong?

843
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,260
Yeo Reum.

844
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,470
Can you give me a hug?

845
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,530
What are you saying?

846
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:01,770
I mean...

847
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,310
I would appreciate it...

848
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:06,680
if you...

849
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,190
consoled me right now.

852
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,700
Thank you.

853
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,420
Is everything going well with
preparing for the lawsuit?

854
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,070
Yes.

855
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,850
At first, I thought my dad was
causing too much of a fuss.

856
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:11,830
But as I did my research,
I could start to understand him.

857
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,190
It might be a hassle, and people
might think you're overreacting,

858
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,100
but it's only right to fix what's wrong.

859
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,170
You're right. I also think
your dad is amazing.

860
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,310
It wouldn't have been easy for
him to disclose everything.

861
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,890
I really respect his sense of justice.

862
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,280
That's why you should be nicer...

863
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,140
to your amazing dad.

864
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:40,080
And you could also let him
know that I told you...

865
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,520
to be nicer to your dad...

866
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,860
if you ever get the chance to tell him.

867
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:47,430
Are you that worried...

868
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,400
that my dad might not like you?

869
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,860
Yes, of course. It's only
natural that I'm worried.

870
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,550
Okay, I'll make sure I tell him.

871
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:12,600
This public official is not only
my father but also my client.

872
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,220
For over 30 years,

873
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,140
he has never once been disciplined.

874
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,830
However, right before
he was about to retire,

875
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:24,330
he got suspended for three months...

876
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,270
just because he accused his boss...

877
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,010
for illegally having received
2.7 million dollars.

878
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,890
Your Honor.

879
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:33,320
The charter of government officials
state that government officials...

880
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,500
should put the public interest
as their top priority,

881
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:39,110
and that they should do their best
to keep things fair and transparent.

882
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,080
Article 15 of the Act on the Protection...

883
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,270
of Public Interest Whistleblowers states...

884
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,910
that no person shall implement
any disadvantageous measures...

885
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,900
against the whistleblower for
having disclosed the truth.

886
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:52,160
I hope you, Your Honor, will make...

887
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,650
a wise judgment...

888
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,710
and show us what true justice really means.

889
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,680
That is all.

890
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,930
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

891
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,080
Just a second.

892
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,540
Mr. Kwon, you were really amazing today.

893
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:37,730
I'm sure your dad was
also very proud of you.

894
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:40,170
I'll head back to the office.

895
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,310
Take your father out to a decent meal.

896
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,070
We should grab a bite to eat.

897
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,800
Sure thing.

898
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,800
My secretary will come with us.

899
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,510
Is that all right?

900
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:06,240
What is this? Why did he
invite me to lunch too?

901
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,400
Anyway, this is my last chance
to get on his good side.

902
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,460
Right?

903
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,230
I made a good choice by
wearing black today.

904
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,720
Should my lips be less pink?

905
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,970
Today, you must be careful and cautious.

906
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,420
Be careful and cautious.

907
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,090
No, that's not it.

908
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,710
I learned this time that...

909
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,970
we must get to the root of
problems with public officials.

910
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:01,210
Nothing can be solved by
only punishing subordinates.

911
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,750
The current system...

912
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,910
is just like an empty shell.

913
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,880
You're right.

914
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,510
Just like this meaningless garnish,

915
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:17,320
the current punishment
system has no substance.

916
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:21,200
It goes round and round
in a vicious circle...

917
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,880
and comes to hurt me as well.

918
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:31,230
I'm sorry for talking about
such a boring subject.

919
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,360
No, it's all right. I find it entertaining.

920
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,690
You can be honest and say it's boring.

921
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,610
I am, and I'm having fun.

922
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,330
There's something that...

923
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:48,330
Ms. Oh wanted me to tell you in secret.

924
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,560
She wanted me to be by your side,

925
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:58,170
so she canceled all of my morning meetings.

926
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:02,540
She handed me a sedative to give to you.

927
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,660
She said she respected
your sense of justice...

928
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,810
and advised me to be a better son to you.

929
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,640
Ms. Oh did all of that.

930
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,780
Mr. Kwon...

931
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,450
That's how sweet and considerate she is.

932
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:20,490
It's why I like her a lot.

933
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:22,990
I hope you like her too...

934
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,390
since she's my girlfriend.

935
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,470
Is it that shocking?

936
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:40,870
Of course.

937
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,920
It's not like you to confess
your love in front of me.

938
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,500
How do you expect me to react?

939
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,590
You're right.

940
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,460
- Even I'm flustered.
- Right?

941
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,400
It's not just me, is it?

942
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,670
Of course not. You know...

943
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:58,440
how your son is. He's never like this.

944
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,100
That's exactly what I mean.

945
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,850
Was it Ms. Oh Jin Sim?

946
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:07,870
Yes, sir.

947
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:12,300
He must really like you...

948
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,920
to act in a way that he never has.

949
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:21,020
My son will lack in a lot of areas,

950
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,720
so please be patient with him.

951
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:24,920
Oh, please.

952
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,920
He's closer to being perfect.

953
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:29,560
He's your darling son.

954
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,020
I'll do my best to make him happy,

955
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,520
so don't worry.

956
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:46,400
Father, let's eat.

957
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:47,910
Yes, let's.

958
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:53,510
You truly startled me.

959
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,510
I had no idea you'd tell your father that.

960
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,760
Were you embarrassed?

961
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,440
Embarrassed? Actually, I was touched.

962
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:04,030
I'm the one who was touched.

963
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,680
Thank you for caring
about me and my father.

964
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,540
We're two people who have a lot of pride.

965
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,510
After a disagreement, we don't
call each other for months.

966
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:17,870
My mom had to suffer because of it.

967
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,090
Thanks to you though, we were
able to bury the hatchet easily.

968
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:24,760
I'm sure my dad was grateful too.

969
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,780
Really?

970
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,390
You know, I'm super glad that...

971
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:31,680
we're co-workers who date.

972
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:33,940
I felt that even more this time.

973
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,740
I ran into your father
because we work together...

974
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,820
and was able to patch
things up between you two.

975
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:44,090
I was also able to get his approval too.

976
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,220
I love everything about it.

977
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:54,940
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

978
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:04,560
♫ <i>Your eyes and lips</i> ♫

979
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,230

♫ <i>They say it all</i> ♫

981
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:10,500
They're gorgeous!

982
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,780
- Why though...
- It's a gift.

983
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,460
A gift?

984
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:21,330
Is it because I helped you and your dad?

985
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,550
Not exactly. I just wanted
to buy you something.

986
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:32,290

987

It's pretty.

990
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,790
The necklace?

991
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,670
No, both.

992
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,910
You and the necklace.

996
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,190
I do. They're absolutely stunning.

997
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,010
Thank you so much.

998
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:33,850
I'm glad that you like them
so much, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

999
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,520
I've been curious about something though.

1000
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:42,790
Why do you keep calling me Oh Jin Sim?

1001
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,340
I told you many times that it's Oh Yun Seo.

1002
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:48,050
At first, I figured that Oh Yun Seo...

1003
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,440
was only a stage name.

1004
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,700
You were here to work,

1005
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,530
so I thought you should use your real name.

1006
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:58,440
I think I was right to
call you that though.

1007
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,100
- What?
- I'm the only one who...

1008
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,370
calls you Oh Jin Sim.

1009
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,280
Okay. If that's the reason, then I approve.

1010
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:12,880
You're the only one who
calls me by that name.

1011
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:16,600
Whenever I hear anyone call me Oh Jin Sim,

1012
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,640
I'll know instantly that it's you.

1013
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,840
I think that black car behind us...

1014
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,190
has been following us around.

1015
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,640
Could I be wrong?

1016
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,370
What's going on?

1017
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:10,280
Is it really following us?

1018
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,070
Are you all right?

1019
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:09,840
Please stay in the car.

1020
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,410
What is this?

1021
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,450
(We'd like to thank Park Ji Il
for making a special appearance.)
