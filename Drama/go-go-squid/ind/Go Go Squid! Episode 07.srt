- You're the one who's dating! 
 - Are you dating?

170
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,550
- Don't make stuff up! 
 - You are dating! You are dating! 
 - That's not it!

171
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,060
She's dating! She's dating!

172
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,100
- Okay! Okay! Okay! 
 - Go away!

173
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,550
- I won't say anymore! Sis, Sis! 
 - So annoying!

174
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,370
Sis, I was wrong. I was wrong.

175
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,070
Is it here?

176
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,400
This should be it.

177
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,860
The GPS says that this is the place.

178
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,550
Take it slowly.

179
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,360
Wait a second!

180
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,780
Why are you wearing all black?

181
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,200
My wardrobe is filled with the same clothes.

182
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,750
Today, I'm matchmaking for you. Couldn't you have worn something more formal?

183
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,930
How could I have known you were taking me out to a matchmaking date?

184
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,210
I thought you were coming to see an old friend.

185
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:35,310
I'm telling you. Today's matchmaking must be a success, it cannot be a failure.

186
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,810
You're so autocratic. Just give me an arranged marriage then. Why do you even bother with matchmaking?

187
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,660
I...

188
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,000
You go on, I'm going to leave first. Give me a call later!

189
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,830
What now?

190
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,860
My... My chest hurts.

191
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,710
That's enough.

192
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,740
Stop with the idle talk. Let's go!

193
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,400
They're here.

194
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,750
- Uncle Han! 
 - You are here. 
 - Little Tong. Little Lin. I am bothering you.

195
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,750
What are you saying? We're so happy that you're here, right?

196
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,830
Right! Uncle Han, we haven't seen you in a few years but you're still so high-spirited!

197
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,180
- Yes, yes! 
 - In the few years we haven't seen each other, you've gotten taller again!

198
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,540
- How could I have gotten taller? At this age? I'm already old! 
 - Greet them!

199
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,840
Uncle. Auntie.

200
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,930
- Uncle Han! 
 - Hello, Little Chubby Sis. Where's your daughter?

201
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,830
My daughter is in the house making tea for you!

202
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,280
- Hurry in! 
 - Come in, Uncle Han!

203
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,990
Take your time!

204
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,560
- A-jiao. 
 - Be careful, Uncle! 
 - Uncle Han, come.

205
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,550
- Hello! 
 - Hello. 
 - Call him "Grandpa Han!"

206
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,470
Hello, Grandpa Han!

207
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,590
Good, good! Is this her?

208
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,540
This is her! This is my daughter.

209
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,980
Grandpa Han, China's weather is rather dry. I especially prepared some fruits for you.

210
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,200
I'm not sure if it will be to your liking.

211
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,170
Come in!

212
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,420
- Say hi! 
 - Hello, I am Hu Yuejiao.

213
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,760
Han Shangyan.

214
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,570
- Grandpa Han, quickly come sit! 
 - Uncle Han, sit.

215
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,420
You just came back from Norway. I thought that you might not be used to our domestic teas.

216
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,540
I specially prepared a floral tea for you.

217
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,270
- I'm not sure if it will be to your taste. 
 - Okay.

218
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,970
- Your trip must have been tiring. 
 - It was all right.

219
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,940
- Please have some tea! 
 - Yes, yes.

220
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,570
Try it!

221
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,440
- It is quite fragrant! 
 - This was specially prepared by A-jiao.

222
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,710
Hurry up, Nian Nian!

223
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,720
I know.

224
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:14,160
 Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki 

225
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,680
Sis!

226
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,750
Nian Nian, what are you doing? There are so many guests here!

227
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,260
Why are you dressed like that? Hurry up and go change. Hurry.

228
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,210
Wait a minute.

229
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,580
This... is your home?

230
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,040
Yes... what a coincidence?

231
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,750
Nian Nian, what are you doing? Where are your manners?

232
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,010
May I ask where the restroom is?

233
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,330
That way. It's over there.

234
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,720
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

235
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,810
Nian Nian, hurry and go change!

236
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,440
Have some fruit!

237
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,530
No thanks.

238
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,610
Have some tea.

239
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,550
- I have juice. 
 - You...

240
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,320
Nian Nian. Hurry.

241
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,040
- Hurry and greet Grandpa Han. 
 - Hello, Grandpa Han.

242
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,560
- My daughter, she's currently majoring in computers at university. 
 - Why is he here?

243
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,980
- I don't know!! 
 - I can tell she is a good child.

244
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,360
Oh, right! I have a grandson from my daughter who is very handsome.

245
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,060
He is also studying computers in school.

246
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,600
Later on, you two can get to know each other!

247
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,900
I believe you guys will have a lot of common topics to talk about!

248
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,610
- He is going there later as well? 
 - Yes, yes!

249
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,040
You hear that?

250
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,880
Say, do you think her and Little Bai are a good match?

251
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,320
I don't know. If you think they are a good match, then it is a good match.

252
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,180
Psh. Hey, give him a call!

253
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,270
He can't be late for the New Year's Eve dinner.

254
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,640
Got it!

255
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,800
[Happiness]

256
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,510
- Uncle Han, slowly. 
 - Okay.

257
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,050
Uncle Han, let's take this car. It is comfortable!

258
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,410
- This one? 
 - Yeah, let's get in this one!

259
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,240
Okay, okay!

260
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:43,670
Later on, find an opportunity to ask that girl about her height, weight, what she likes.

261
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,620
Do you hear me?

262
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,510
- Grandpa Han, let's get in the car! 
 - Okay.

263
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,380
I'll help you.

264
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,290
- Be careful. 
 - Okay.

265
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,970
Oh my God. Sis, what should we do?

266
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,460
I'm going to go over first.

267
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,670
Nian Nian, I'm giving you a task.

268
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,040
We are trying to matchmake your cousin with that big brother over there.

269
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,280
Later on, you sit in their car and listen to what they are saying and act accordingly, got it?

270
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,870
Matchmaking?

271
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,640
What is it?

272
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,640
- Dounan, you go in the other car in the back. 
 - Okay.

273
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,360
Tong Nian, hurry up!

274
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,490
I... I won't sit in that car.

275
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:42,150
I'm sorry. They told me to sit in this car.

276
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,820
I don't want to sit in that car.

277
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,360
- Why? Then what? You're going to take a taxi there? 
 - I'll just take a taxi.

278
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,350
Why are you taking a taxi? This is also my first time meeting him.

279
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,360
Later on, if there is an awkward silence, we can still chat with each other. Otherwise, it'll be so awkward!

280
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,280
Yeah! Be good, go on!

281
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,120
- We're family, no need to be scared! 
 - Go!

282
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,060
Didn't he say that he didn't have any plans to get a girlfriend?

283
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,460
You sit in the back, I'll sit in the front!

284
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,620
Fool. How is he not planning to have a girlfriend?

285
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,450
It's obvious he just doesn't want to deal with you.

286
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,910
Excuse me, your jacket...

287
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,960
Move over!

288
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,850
Understand?

289
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,640
I've gone to matchmaking so many times, met so many men,

290
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,490
but this is the one with the least amount of manners.

291
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,040
Sit tight.

292
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,800
I think we are all adults. It would be better if we were more frank.

293
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,150
Then, I'll introduce myself first.

294
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,860
I am in marketing. Mainly in charge of brand management.

295
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,220
What do you do?

296
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,280
I don't have any decent work.

297
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,650
But you must have a profession.

298
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,520
I heard Aunt say that you are starting your own business.

299
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,220
Profession? Does playing on the computer count?

300
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,770
Playing on the computer?

301
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,160
So, you're someone with no real job who lives off his parents.

302
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,420
I see.

303
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,940
Actually... Actually, his work is a respectable profession.

304
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,760
Playing on the computer can count as a respectable profession?

305
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,310
They are cybersecurity talents. They even win medals at competitions.

306
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,740
It is a new area that is encouraged by the government.

307
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,180
And if they win, they can earn prize money. A lot of prize money.

308
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,980
But they don't do it just for the money, they do it for the honor.

309
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,640
Actually in China, a lot of the internet technologies are at the forefront.

310
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,600
They've received many medals.

311
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,710
Well, there can't be people who spend their whole life playing on the computer!

312
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,800
Are we here? Why are we parking on the side of the road?

313
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,040
I think it will be better if we make things clear.

314
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,700
I don't have any interest in you.

315
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,920
In the future, I, for sure, will have no interest in you either.

316
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,000
Of course, you have no interest in people like me as well.

317
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,520
We are all grown adults.

318
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,710
Let's cooperate with our elders and finish this meal. What do you think?

319
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,370
Also, you don't need to act like you don't know me.

320
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,390
Are you not tired from acting?

321
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,960
What's happening here?

322
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,380
Nian Nian, you two know each other?

323
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,180
- We just met, not long ago. 
 - Didn't he just come back from overseas?

324
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,410
You are always at school and not yet working.

325
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,300
How did you two meet each other?

326
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,040
It's... at the internet cafe.

327
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,970
Online friend?

328
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,740
No. I met him at your family's internet cafe.

329
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,030
Yes. Yes.

330
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,200
Yes, about what?

331
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,060
Something fishy is going on here.

332
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,120
We've finally arrived. That was too stuffy.

333
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,860
- This place doesn't look bad. 
 - Yuejiao.

334
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,120
- How was it? 
 - Don't even mention it. He is so arrogant.

335
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,080
I just don't get it. He doesn't have a real job.

336
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,130
But yet, he has a sense of superiority.

337
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,140
How would it be like this?

338
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,440
Let me tell you. When we are eating later, just go through the motions.

339
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,470
It's New Year's. Please, don't make the elderly upset.

340
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,250
- I understand, Mom. 
 - In a bit when we're about done, bring these two things...

341
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,760
- I think they know each other. 
 - They?

342
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,980
Do you know?

343
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,310
- If there is anything, contact me anytime. 
 - I've troubled you.

344
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,610
I think they do.

345
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,960
Let's go in first. Everyone is waiting.

346
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,980
 [South Wu Grand Feast]

347
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,690
Why aren't you going in?

348
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,150
I saw that they already went in.

349
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,570
I wanted to wait for you. This way is more courteous.

350
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,320
I am not interested in your cousin.

351
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,320
It would be best if she doesn't develop an interest in me.

352
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,630
So, what you said in the car,

353
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,650
is actually helping me in the wrong way.

354
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,530
I do not need an outsider to understand what my profession is like.

355
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,030
Especially someone who I will not have contact with in the future.

356
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,280
Therefore, there is no need to explain anything to her.

357
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,080
Do you understand?

358
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,080
Also, the reason why I exposed the fact that we knew each other is not to make you look bad.

359
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,210
It's because this is a lie that cannot continue on.

360
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,450
My cousin is coming soon. He knows you.

361
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,060
Plus, he would definitely be honest.

362
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,320
So, there is no reason for us to pretend we are strangers.

363
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,910
Do you understand?

364
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,200
I understand. We are not strangers.

365
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,050
Are you feeling better inside?

366
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,060
Let's go in.

367
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,940
Come, come. Come here.

368
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,030
What is it, Aunt?

369
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,310
Let me ask you. You know Han Shangyan?

370
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,220
What kind of person is he?

371
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,410
I've only known him for a week.

372
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,390
I only know that he is very good at the computer.

373
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,870
I just want to know about his character. Does he really not engage in proper work?

374
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,750
Or is he pretending?

375
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,850
Being good at computers doesn't mean improper work, right?

376
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,550
Then, do you think that he and your sister...

377
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,240
Aunt, my phone is vibrating.

378
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,890
A phone call. My classmate called, I'm going to pick it up.

379
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,080
Yaya! Yes. I'm having dinner with my family.

380
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,780
Today, sure. After I finished...

381
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,190
Yes, yes. You can speak...

382
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,160
Oh, so that's the situation. Is it okay if I give it to you after I go home?

383
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,720
It is not very convenient right now.

384
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,480
Little Bai, come here. Come here.

385
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,210
- Little Bai. This is my grandson from my daughter. 
 - Oh, so this is who you were just talking about.

386
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,050
- Yes, yes, yes. Wu Bai. 
 - Wow, he's grown so much.

387
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,730
So attractive. Do you have a girlfriend?

388
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,850
Not yet. We were waiting for you to introduce you to someone.

389
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,010
This is the present that he got for you.

390
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,800
Thank you.

391
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,480
- I will put them here for you. There's space here. 
 - Okay, thanks! 
 - Come over.

392
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,720
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you! You are too polite.

393
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,360
Sit.

394
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,140
What's happening?

395
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,880
- Her? 
 - You're already a grown woman.

396
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,490
What is the girl that likes you doing here?

397
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,400
- We are family friends, 
 - ...his temper is not good.

398
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,330
Grandpa wants to match you up with her.

399
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,750
Are you joking?

400
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,750
I already said. When Grandpa comes back, nothing good will come of it.

401
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,450
Well, even if there was a match to be made, it's for you. What does this have to do with me?

402
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,940
I did get matched. It was quickly taken care of.

403
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,100
Your problem... Take care of it on your own.

404
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,250
I can't help you.

405
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,910
Nian Nian, come here.

406
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,310
Come here. I will introduce you.

407
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,720
I forgot to introduce you earlier.

408
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,630
This is my grandson, Wu Bai. This is Nian Nian.

409
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,110
Your parents saw him when he was still little.

410
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,050
Go, go! You two go sit over there!

411
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,300
Go over there!

412
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,460
You two, talk more.

413
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,340
My grandson is also studying computers.

414
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,710
Yeah, Nian Nian, you two are in the same major.

415
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,720
You guys must have a lot to talk about.

416
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,110
Say hello to her.

417
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,680
I know her.

418
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,950
You two know each other?

419
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,140
I think she is...

420
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,950
my brother's girlfriend.

421
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,670
Little Bai, what nonsense are you saying?

422
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,390
Wait, no, no. Stop, stop.

423
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,910
I will not listen to him. I want to hear from you. Little Bai, you tell us.

424
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,930
I don't know the details,

425
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,640
but all our club members call her "Sister-in-Law."

426
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,170
Sister-in-Law?

427
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,010
No, no.

428
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,770
Nian Nian, aren't you going to explain what's going on?

429
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,000
Nian Nian, come here.

430
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,730
Come here.

431
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,810
What's going on? Why do you suddenly have a boyfriend that we don't even know of?

432
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,680
- I don't know either. He really isn't. That is not the situation. 
 - Explain it clearly.

433
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,350
Auntie, you might as well listen to me explain.

434
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,410
Don't talk. You shut up.

435
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,040
If you say more, I'll break your leg!

436
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,830
Grandpa, please don't be mad. Nian Nian also feels wronged.

437
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,810
Do you know what is going on in the middle of all this?

438
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,760
Dounan, when did your sis get a boyfriend?

439
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,550
I don't know the specifics... but my sis does like him.

440
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,500
You're saying nonsense!

441
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,200
I'm speaking the truth. Didn't you fall in love at first sight with him?

442
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,330
Stop talking about it, can you?

443
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,870
Dounan!

444
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:29,810
However, I really don't know when they got so close.

445
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,180
I suppose it was when they were in Guangzhou.

446
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,720
You, shut up!

447
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,020
That's enough. Why don't you sit down?

448
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,330
Our family is open-minded. Dating is not a bad thing.

449
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,180
Little Han, isn't it better to be open?

450
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,170
- Am I right, Brother? 
 - Aunt, you guys really all misunderstood.

451
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,610
- He and I really aren't... 
 - Please do not interrupt when grown-ups are speaking.

452
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,140
Okay, okay, okay.

453
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,010
Grandpa Han, it's fine.

454
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,650
We are all grown adults, not kids.

455
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,410
Little Han, let's just consider this our formal meeting.

456
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,580
If you have time, come visit us often. All right?

457
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,570
Let me tell you. Mr. Han is very busy.

458
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,380
So don't trouble him, okay?

459
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,020
Actually, this should have been made clear early on.

460
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,090
Explain everything so that we all aren't wasting our efforts.

461
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,720
Isn't that so, Uncle Han?

462
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,650
Right.

463
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,680
Go give greetings to Uncle and Auntie.

464
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,450
Let's just say that this is the first official introduction.

465
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,840
Go over and give your greetings!

466
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,740
Old people are old.

467
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,380
If I do defy him, who knows what's going to happen?

468
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,450
And it's New Year's.

469
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,290
 The elders here all think that I've taken advantage of a young lady

470
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,480
 and not admitting to it. 

471
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,380
Go!

472
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,920
Uncle. Auntie. Hello.

473
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,830
I am Han Shangyan.

474
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,190
Tong Nian and I have been together for only a short period of time.

475
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,540
I didn't get her permission,

476
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,730
so I didn't dare pay a visit rashly.

477
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,020
I hope Uncle and Auntie can forgive me.

478
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,920
Okay. We forgive you. It's fine.

479
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,150
Come on. Go sit.

480
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,750
- Grandpa Han. 
 - Okay, okay. Come here.

481
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,280
Today is New Year's Eve, let's all just be happy and merry, all right?

482
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,900
Right! Right!

483
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,130
If there is anything else, let's save it and talk about them next year. Okay?

484
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,630
Okay? Here.

485
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,080
Here, here, here.

486
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,650
Oh right. Let's all be happy today. Here!

487
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,750
Everyone, let's raise our glasses. Okay?

488
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,790
Raise your glasses! Here!

489
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,180
I hope your career goes smoothly. Okay?

490
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,180
Great! Cheers! Cheers!

492
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,420
Waitress!

493
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,590
- Waitress, bring the food! 
 - Yes, got it.

494
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:15,650
Let me tell you. If he wasn't from the Han family, I would've already...

495
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:19,150
- How much older is he than Nian Nian? 
 - Yeah.

496
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,740
- He really is quite a lot older than Nian Nian. 
 - Don't copy me!

497
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,850
Little Bai.

498
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,860
The headquarters called saying that they need to speak to you.

499
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,900
Why don't you reply to them? Come outside with me.

500
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,630
Stop eating. Come out.

501
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,500
Do you not want to live anymore?

502
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,940
Who told you to only sit and watch the show?

503
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,910
If the room weren't filled with outsiders, I'd have started a row with you.

504
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,540
- Didn't you accept it? 
 - Bull, how could I not?

505
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,810
It's New Year's Eve! Grandpa is getting old.

506
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,400
If something had happened, would you've taken responsibility then?

507
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,680
Well, it's Grandpa, too. He refused to believe anyone but a big tailed wolf like you. (T/N: liar)

508
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,040
Just this once. I won't let it go next time, you hear that.

509
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,960
Brother-in-Law.

510
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,800
I really did not think that you were still my brother-in-law in the end. We must be fated.

511
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,580
Do you have something to say?

512
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,080
Grandpa told you guys to go in and eat.

513
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,680
That temper...

514
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,400
It's really too much for Little Squid.

515
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,240
Time to eat.

516
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,580
Right now, those who are older tend to spoil their wives more.

517
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,180
You see, our Little Han, although he's always got a sour face,

518
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,480
he actually is very responsible.

519
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,780
And also, you see... Little Han's birthday is on February 14.

520
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,720
Nian Nian is March 20. Look how close they are.

521
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,130
Isn't that good? Right?

522
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,870
Uncle, here, have a drumstick.

523
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,080
Okay. Here.

524
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,550
Here, here. Little Bai.

525
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,410
Right, you. Come here.

526
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,670
Sit here. Quickly.

527
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,910
- Sit. Take something to eat. 
 - Okay.

528
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:35,480
Han Shangyan! Just sit there.

529
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,460
Sit there!

530
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,330
Go over there.

531
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,860
Okay, eat.

532
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,910
It's New Year's. Let's be happier.

533
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,610
Why did you tell a lie?

534
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,870
My cousin has a girl that he likes.

535
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,500
So, he asked me to help him avoid this matchmaking at all costs.

536
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,680
It was a sticky situation. We had no other choice but to use this method.

537
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,880
After tonight, we can randomly find a reason to break up.

538
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,330
Not considerate, not gentle.

539
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,940
Not sharing a similar language to understand each other, too old.

540
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,300
Those are all valid reasons.

541
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,480
You can choose the reason for the breakup.

542
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,700
Sorry.

543
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,880
It's fine. It's for helping him, isn't it?

544
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,870
Han Shangyan, serve your girlfriend some food.

545
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,640
It's fine, Grandpa Han. It's okay.

546
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,810
Hurry up.

547
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,980
Thank you.

548
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,860
- Eat. 
 - Thank you.

549
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,150
It's... It's enough.

550
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,150
I can't eat that much.

551
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,600
Eat it slowly; you will eventually finish it.

552
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Here, here, here. Give your girlfriend a drink. A drink.

553
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,260
Hurry!

554
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,560
Enough, enough. Enough, enough.

555
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,390
Drink it slowly.

556
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,470
Little Bai, after we finish eating, remember to pack up the rest to-go.

557
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,080
Little Han, you are not young anymore. Right?

558
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,510
- You sure have a large appetite. 
 - There's a young one at home.

559
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:09,360
You've divorced, and have a child?

560
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,780
No, no, that's not it.

561
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,580
It's his club's kid.

562
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,390
It's New Year's and he didn't go home. So, he's temporarily staying at our house.

563
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,450
Here. Eat.

564
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,540
[A Path Among the Clouds]

565
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,350
Take it slow, Grandpa. There is a step here.

566
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,570
Okay, good child.

567
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,630
Nian Nian, hurry and get in the car.

568
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,880
Oh right!

569
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,610
Let Nian Nian ride in my grandson's car.

570
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,290
Your car?

571
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,790
Her parents drove here.

572
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,600
You... say something.

573
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,980
Uncle. Auntie. Let Tong Nian ride my car.

574
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,140
Don't worry. I'll follow behind your car.

575
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,150
Right, allow it for my sake.

576
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,460
- Go, go. 
 - Get in the car.

577
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,400
Grandpa Han, let me help you. Be careful, the step is here.

578
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,980
Let's go.

579
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,560
Get in the car.

580
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,580
♫ I start to portray an unfamiliar me ♫

581
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,930
♫ Fathoming the untrue distance behind the words ♫

582
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,680
I want to ask you a question.

583
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:47,430
♫ I thought I possessed the acting skills to deceive everything ♫

584
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,230
Say what you have to say.

585
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,080
When are we breaking up?

586
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,970
Because we should set a time frame, right?

587
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,770
So that I can tell my parents.

588
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,980
When do you want to break up?

589
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,420
You haven't finished thinking about it?

590
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,200
How about... How about next month?

591
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,560
Breaking up during New Year's is too fast.

592
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
It's not really good.

593
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,390
How about this? You can decide.

594
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:32,240
Whenever you decide to break up, just notify me in advance.

595
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,970
Before we break up, you are still my girlfriend.

596
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,120
Whatever you want, just say it. I will do my best to make it happen.

597
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,290
I'll keep my word.

598
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,390
Go back. Your mom is waiting for you.

599
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,840
Then... I'll go now.

600
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,200
- See you. 
 - See you.

601
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,090
- What were you guys talking about for such a long– 
 - Nothing.

602
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,370
Let's go. Let's go inside. Let's go.

603
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,510
Nian Nian is dating for the first time.

604
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,300
I don't want to denigrate her.

605
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,030
You're worrying for nothing. It's not like the final word.

606
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,280
I already told you before.

607
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,680
Girls being too pretty is dangerous.

608
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,180
If I knew it earlier, I should have her eat more and get fatter.

609
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,000
There's a sense of security if she's fatter.

610
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,410
There would still be time to lose weight before dating, too.

611
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:10,090
I'm telling you, that's during middle and high school. Now, Nian Nian is an adult.

612
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,520
If you make her fatter, she may have low self-esteem.

613
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,740
I mean, I dress her up so prettily every day.

614
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,190
Who knew she would find such a boyfriend.

615
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,320
You, let me tell you.

616
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,580
You are being biased, you know that?

617
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,560
Except for his age, there are no other bad things.

618
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:35,270
I see Nian Nian being so happy.

619
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,300
I don't know what I should say.

620
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,820
It's ready!

621
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,850
You, it's best you don't say anything.

622
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,620
Figure out what kind of person he is first.

623
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,370
Smell this. How's my cooking skill?

624
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,870
Okay, okay. Don't burn yourself.

625
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,980
- Do you want to have a taste? 
 - Hurry and go. Go.

626
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,800
- Go, go. 
 - I'll go do some work first.

627
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,290
Okay. Go.

628
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:09,540
Nian Nian, look what Dad made for you.
