You see, in this competition, the main problem was with you two.

23
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,260
You must be better coordinated. And you two, do the binary problems properly.

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,700
Then, do you know the one bringing K&K to the competition is Han Shangyan?

Last time, in Singapore, you didn't know so whatever.

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,600
But this time, you clearly did it on purpose.

And you want me to bring Little Mi and Ou Qiang–

One day of being brothers is being brothers for life.

Then, why don't you go face this kind of awkward scene yourself?

Ten years ago, you cowered; are you still going to be like this ten years later?

I also wouldn't know how to deal with it.

He not only hurt every team member,

64
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,410
 but even more he hurt the feelings you guys had for each other. 

65

 Weren't you guys mutually in love? 

66
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,660
 You being able to forgive his cowardly withdrawal, that is true stupidity.

174
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,000
I need to follow first, right?

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,280
Followed.

176
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Did I see wrong?

177
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,990
Little Squid followed a new account!

178
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,680
An account with no profile picture?

179
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,780
Little Squid, when can you follow me?

180
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,590
Why? Why would Little Squid follow him?

181
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,690
I also want to be followed by Little Squid!

182
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,450
Little Squid, I've followed you for a long time now. Could you follow me back?

183
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,290
Little Squid, be careful of bad guys!

184
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,070
Your Highness Squid, they have no profile picture. Be careful!

185
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,940
Little Squid followed an account with no profile picture?

186
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,350
This can't do. I have to follow them, too.

187
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,350
I will definitely be able to determine their relationship.

188

You're already his girlfriend!

189
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,690
Just following and leaving a phone number, are you really that happy?

190
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,170
Hey, don't say that. I already told you I'm not his real girlfriend.

191
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,830
Won't you slowly become a real one?

192
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,390

194
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,330

 - Yes!

- We now follow each other, right? 
 - Great!

Don't play around! I have to go to the bathroom to make a call.

If we win first place at the national competition,

336
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,570
will there will be a cash prize?

337
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,220
Is there?

338
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,920
Right, we will get some nice reward money.

339
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,840
What? Why do you ask?

340
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,570
I love this roof too much.

341
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,350
If I have money in the future, I will buy this building.

342
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,910
And then each time we win,

343
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:43,340
we'll drink and sing without having to worry about the landlord.

344
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,880
That is the future me.

345
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,080
Little Mi, are you dumb?

346
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,490
Even if you can buy this roof,

347
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,390
with your loud yelling and calling, the landlord would surely drive you out.

348
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,540
Yeah, Little Mi. You can stop dreaming.

349
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,390
Even if we get the national championship,

350
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,720
that money still isn't enough to buy this house.

351
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,470
Then, we have to keep fighting and fighting all the way until we're world champions!

352
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,040
Right!

353
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,860
 When we are world champions,

354
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,200
we'll buy this whole patch.

355
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,870
At the time, let's see who thinks we're loud.

356
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,380
Right, we have to be like this! World championship, we're coming!

357
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,740
World champions!

358
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,960
Hey, are you done? Could you be quieter?

359
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,730
If you keep screaming, I'll call the cops!

360
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,270
Old Han, I'm asking you guys.

361
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,600
Say, if we really become world champions one day,

362
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,240
do you still have any other dreams to fulfill?

363
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,860
I'll go first, is that okay?

364
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,200
I want to help my grandma open a large store

365
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,440
and recruit many people to help her maintain the store and work for her.

366
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,100
She just needs to sit and collect the money, that's all.

367
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,160
I just want to be with you all

368
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,680
and travel around the world!

369
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,210
Are you dumb?

370
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:12,570
You just have to practice so that you don't mess up when competing so you can compete in the world competition. Right?

371
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,510
Each time we compete somewhere, just stay for a few extra days, wouldn't that be traveling the world?

372
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,910
Well, I don't care.

373
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,240
With all of you, I'm satisfied.

374
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,020
Ai Qing, how about you?

375
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,090
My dream...

376
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,920
My dream is...

377
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,070
The dreams of the people I love can all come true.

378
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,540
The people you love?

379
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,700
Does that include us?

380
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,780
Of course... it does!

381
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,970
No! No! No!

382
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,880
What about you, Old Han?

383
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,020
My dream is very simple.

384
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,080
To become world champion.

385
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,560
Prove to the entire world

386
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,470
that there is nothing that the Chinese cannot do.

387
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,550
That one's amazing, Old Han.

388
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,330
Then, what if you fight till the end but don't find a girlfriend or get a wife?

389
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,530
Don't you think you're losing?

390
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,940
 Ou Qiang, you're worried about him? You better take a rest.

391
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,970
His female fans total up to way more than yours, and you're worried about this?

392
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,200
- Right. 
 - Hey, who're you looking down on, Ai Qing? 
 - You!

393
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,240
- Say one more line! 
 - You!

394
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,440
- Say that again! 
 - Solo, he's bullying me! 
 - Stop, stop, stop!

395
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,540
- Fight him! 
 - Stop, stop, stop.

396
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,070
Captain.

397
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,840
Your dream...

398
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,190
As your team captain,

399
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,740
my dream is

400
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,810
to help you all fulfill your dreams, how's that? Is it good?

401
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,380
- Great! Amazing! 
 - Good Captain!

402
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,990
Cheers to our world championship!

403
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,640
- World champions! 
 - Cheers!

404
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,300
Quiet!

405
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,990
Bottoms up!

406
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,020
 Bottoms up.

407
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,450
Drink it all, all of it!

408
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,450
Look at that star.

409
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,310
It's probably a plane.

410
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,280
That's not a plane, it's a star.

411
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,150
When we become world champions,

412
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,880
we'll become the brightest stars in the sky!

413
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,850
- Right? 
 - Yeah! 
 - That's right!  We'll be the

414
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,410
brightest stars in the sky!

415
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,730
I'm that one, see?

416
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,760
Little Mi star.

417
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,700
Ai Qing star.

418
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,600
 This star.

419
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,510
What's Han Shangyan called? What star?

420
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,670
Han Shangyan is called "sour-face star."

421
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,740
Really, he's always got that face on every day.

422
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,790
 Right, he yells at me so harshly.

423
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,840
Our Solo is still the best.

424
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,870
 Taken by surprise!

425
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,810
A serving... of dog feed. 
(T/N: Slang for public display of affection. The single dog is forced to eat it.)

426
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,330
No! No!

427
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:41,360
 Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki 

428
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,180
- Hello, Anna, Oliver, long time no see. 
 - Hello, Gun, welcome back.

429
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,780
Hello!

430
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,220
Hello, nice to meet you.

431
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,140
Nice to meet you.

432
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,750
My name is All.

433
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,420
Hello.

434
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,380
Let's get down to business.

435
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,900
Not bad, Old Han. Had I known earlier, I would've gone to K&K.

436
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,400
Ou Qiang!

437
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,730
Hello, everybody.

438
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,680
- Long time no see! 
 - Long time no see.

439
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,980
Long time no see.

440
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,320
- Hello! Hello! 
 - Hi.

441
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,880
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

442
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,390
Nan Wei!

443
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,220
Hey!

444
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,310
You haven't died?

445
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,420
- Long time no see. 
 - Hello, hello.

446
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,170
- Hey, nice to meet you. 
 - Old Han is pretty amazing.

447
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,100
He founded K&K Club from scratch.

448
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,500
You probably suffered a lot, Old Han?

449
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,290
Let me introduce you to my partner, Nan Wei.

450
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,140
Hello, everyone. My name is Nan Wei and welcome to Norway.

451
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,570
Lincoln. Katie.

452
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:04,680
You look like you're China's most talented lady geek, right?

453
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,000
Nice to meet you.

454
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,440
Honor to meet you! Honor to meet you!

455
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,850
I used to compete, too. But now I'm retired.

456
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,360
He's our team manager Su Cheng's husband.

457
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,050
They've been married for many years now.

458
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,320
It's okay; whatever.

459
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,970
I know my wife used to be with Solo.

460
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,480
But who hasn't dated before, right?

461
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,980
Yes.

462
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,310
Your team manager is married?

463
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,580
I thought Su Cheng was Gun God's girlfriend.

464
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,500
What're you joking about?

465
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,860
Yeah, what're you joking about?

466
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,460
Didn't Old Han bring his girlfriend last time to watch his competition?

467
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,170
You've got a girlfriend?

468
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,580
Which idiot wants to be with you?

469
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,110
She's not. She's just a friend.

470
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,710
Look at him. Don't play with her feelings!

471
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,540
Scram.

472
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,230
Scram? How about if we scram together. Here, have a seat.

473
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,580
Take a seat everyone. Let me introduce to you the details of the Invitational match this time.

474
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,900
Okay? Here.

475
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,190
This is our training room.

476
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,430
- Hello, welcome. 
 - Hi, Boss. 
 - Hi.

477
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,970
- Hello. 
 - Let's have a look.

478
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,060
Thank you! Welcome, everyone.

479
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,480
- Use whichever computer you want. Here, try it out. 
 - Okay.

480
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,880
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

481
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,010
Ou Qiang, study well.

482
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,980
Don't worry.

483
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,600
I really didn't think you'd come here with Han Shangyan.

484
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,540
I thought SP and K&K were like fire and water and couldn't get along.

485
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,650
Of course, it's fire and water.

486
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:46,000
Also, there's only one champion.

487
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,840
Mind your manners for the Invitational match.

488
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,560
No, I think you misunderstood what I said.

489
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,030
What I mean is Han Shangyan and Solo...

490
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,280
I got it, I got it.

491
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,410
I know Han Shangyan; he's not like that.

492
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,370
He wouldn't create a club just because of his own personal grievances,

493
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:14,180
and then put everyone's dreams on top of such a nonsense reason.

494
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,290
Right, he came for the world championship. Right.

495
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:21,260
What? We also came for the world championship.

496
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,300
Okay. You can practice. Call me over if you need anything.

497
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,480
- Thank you. 
 - Okay.

498
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,640
This is only an Invitational match.

499
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,880
You don't have to be so nervous, okay?

500
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,110
Should we go back to the hotel first?

501
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,820
Why? K&K and us are in the same hotel.

502
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,660
We can go back together later.

503
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,280
I think it's so awkward. I...

504
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,440
Little kids sure have a lot of problems.

505
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,120
Is it necessary for you to worry about these matters?

506
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,900
Hurry and go.

507
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,890
- Nan Wei. 
 - Hello.

508
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,830
Thank you for welcoming us today.

509
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,770
We'll go back to the hotel first. See you at the arena.

510
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:18,190
Okay. Forgive me if anything was amiss.

511
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,920
Keep it up.

512
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,490
We'll go back now.

513
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,530
Nice to meet you.

514
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,510
I see that kid is pretty scared of you.

515
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,600
What is there to be scared of?

516
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,070
Boss, your room is so big!

517
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,390
There're flowers and wine!

518
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,440
These flowers smell nice.

519
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,330
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day!

520
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,980
Is it because when Sister Cheng made the room reservation, did someone misunderstand us?

521
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,150
Well, you don't have a girlfriend.

522
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,800
Give this to me, okay?

523
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,630
Oh right! Don't you like candy? The chocolates are for you.

524
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,640
I'm leaving.

525
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,880
Is that all right, Boss?

526
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,070
Get out.

527
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,520
I'm going.

528
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,950
Hello?

529
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,660
Ta Da!

530
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:57,090
I wish you a Happy Valentine's Day tomorrow! Happy birthday!

531
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,680
Did you like the surprise I prepared for you?

532
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,540
I loved it.

533
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,450
I called you, but wishing you a happy birthday isn't the most important point.

534
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:11,550
What's most important is that last week I ordered a necklace from my friend.

535
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,750
If you have time, you must pick it up for me.

536
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,340
I don't have time.

537
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,670
Han Shangyan!

538
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,510
Whenever I ask you to do something, you always say you're busy!

539
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,790
Your attitude towards me is getting worse!

540
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,280
I'm here to lead the team and compete,

541
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,800
not your fashion shopper.

542
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,670
I don't have time to go to Norway.

543
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,490
Just help me.

544
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,800
I've already sent the money to your account and I'll send the address to your phone in a bit.

545
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,030
Tonight, you must go get it, or else! They won't store it!

546
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,130
Do you hear me?

547
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,710
I don't care now. I'm leaving this to you.

548
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,320
I'm hanging up.

549
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,030
We followed each other!

550
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,030
I'm also the only person he follows.

553

Later, I'll search up the flight number.

554
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,560
Today is February 14th.

555
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,980
So, how many more days until March 2nd?

556
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,740
Isn't today Valentine's Day?

557
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,620
Should I prepare a gift for him?

558
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,650
Although he's a fake lover,

559
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,360
I should still give a present.

560
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:44,720
What if... I also get a gift.

561

[Antique Garden since 1973] 
1920, it's an original, all-carved, and was made in Zhejiang province.

562
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,660
Oh, that could be true.

563
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,160
Yeah, yeah exactly.

564
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,870
Welcome.

565
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,800
Wait a moment.

566
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,350
How can I help you, Sir?

567
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,630
I'm here for Han Jiajia's necklace.

568
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,270
- Oh, you must be Mister Han, right? 
 - Yes.

569
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,330
Okay, wait a moment.

570
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,810
This is the one.

571
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,760
You can have a look.

572
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,030
It has been here for a long time.

573
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,940
I'm glad she can get it now.

574
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,160
Thank you very much.

575
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,210
I really want to know what he's doing.

576
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,640
Nian Nian? Nian Nian!

577
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,540
Could you be more focused when eating breakfast? What're you looking at your phone for?

578
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,790
Why're you so busy?

579
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,460
I'm looking at today's weather.

580
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,460
- I'm full. 
 - You're not finished.

581
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,380
She really doesn't care about eating breakfast.

582
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,790
Is he sleeping?

583
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,160
Bye-bye.

584
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,830
Can I call him?

585
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,800
The number you have reached is not in service at this time.

586
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,410
Is he still busy?

587
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,630
I shouldn't bother him.

588
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,190
Hello? I got your necklace.

589
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,730
Thank you. I knew you would get it for me.

590
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,620
Anything else?

591
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,140
Later, take a picture and send it to me so I can see.

592
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,340
Remember, you can't lose it!

593
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,680
If you don't believe me, then you should have Little Bai get it for you.

594
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,140
It's not that I don't believe you!

595
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,490
But, growing up, you've never had an honest line.

596
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:26,420
Listening to your words, shouldn't I...

597
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,290
Stinky kid.

Are you free?

602

I want to treat you to drink something.

Talk business.

611
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,490
Actually, I have no real business.

612

Isn't today your birthday?

613
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,790
So, I wanted to treat you to drink something and celebrate.

614

Did you know?

616
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,570
When I first met you, I thought your birthday was very romantic.

617
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,670
One year, I was celebrating Valentine's Day with Solo.

618
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,120
You were following us like a tail and insisted we had to treat you to a meal.

619
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,310
I was frustrated to the point where I was about to cry. I thought you were messing with us.

620
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:10,070
But, finally, you told us Valentine's Day was your birthday.

621

In the minds of people like you, love is above all.
