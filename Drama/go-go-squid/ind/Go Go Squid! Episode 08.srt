00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,490

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,690

I've done nothing bad, what do I have to be scared of?

178
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,880
Follow me.

179
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,440
Boss, Boss! Going empty-handed on New Year's isn't really good.

180
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,780
Aren't you going to buy something?

181
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,910
Buy what?

182
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,930
New Year's treats, of course! Like peanuts, sunflower seeds, snacks like that.

183
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,170
Does Sister-in-Law's family have any kids? Buy them some snacks, too.

184
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,110
If that doesn't work, you can spare a bit.

185
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,780
Go to the seafood market and buy some fish or shrimp.

186
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,850
At least it's better than going empty-handed.

187
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,520
Anyways, my mom brings gifts like that.

188
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,570
Also, me following you in there isn't the best.

189
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,880
Wait for me in the car.

190
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,670
Okay!

191
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,840
This melon is sweet, want one? The flavor is especially good.

192
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,080
And this mango, want it?

193
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,740
This is imported from Japan, it's very sweet.

194
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,340
Take one.

195
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,720
Gifting tangerines on New Year's, it's good luck.

196
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,620
- Just take whatever, as long as it looks nice. 
 - Okay, okay.

197
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,800
Should I use a gift box and wrap it?

198
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,090
Young man, are you visiting relatives?

199
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:12,050
Is he wishing a Happy New Year or collecting a debt? Dressed all in black...

200
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,680
Coming.

201
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,840
Who is it?

202
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,840
Who is it?

203
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,880
Little Han?

204
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,100
Auntie, I'm... here to wish you a Happy New Year.

205
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,040
Come in.

206
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,550
Who is it?

207
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,740
I'll move here.

208
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,860
Right.

209
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,450
I'll move...

210
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,360
What is it? Who came?

211
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,450
Woah, who's this?

212
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,190
Little Han? Why're you here?

213
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,070
Hello, everyone.

214
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,810
We just ate New Year's Eve dinner last night,

215
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,620
you don't have to specially come and wish a Happy New Year today.

216
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,990
Well, since Grandpa really likes Tong Nian,

217
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,830
he wanted me to invite her to come and have a meal.

218
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,320
Then, does Tong Nian know about this?

219
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,020
No.

220
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,270
Here, here, Little Han.

221
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,280
That must be heavy. Put it down.

222
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,740
Little Han. Come and sit.

223
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,040
Sit. Get Nian Nian, quickly.

224
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,430
You came from so far, why are you gifting fruits? You could just come.

225
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,190
Little Han, sit for a bit.

226
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,800
I'll go upstairs and call Nian Nian down for you.

227
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,870
Doesn't that fruit basket look familiar?

228
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,770
How could it not look familiar?

229
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,650
He bought it from the fruit shop at the head of the street.

230
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,860
Seems that Nian Nian has it very tough with him.

231
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:54,460
Our Nian Nian is so well-behaved, of course, she'll have it tough.

232
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,990
Look how old he is. He's still playing games!

233
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,840
Aren't you two also playing?

234
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,250
What?

235
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,670
How could there be a person like that?

236
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,750
Keep playing! I'll move here.

237
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,970
- Han Shangyan is here? 
 - Yeah.

238
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,380
He said he's taking you out for a meal.

239
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,150
I don't know if his grandpa wants to or if he does.

240
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,380
This hairstyle will not work! It's all flat! I need to go wash my hair!

241
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,030
Didn't you just wash your hair last night?

242
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,080
It's not the same. All the girls are like this.

243
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,180
Okay, okay.

244
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,450
Dad, does this look good on me? The jacket.

245
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,750
- It's okay. 
 - Never mind, you don't understand.

246
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,650
- Dad, go outside. I have to change! 
 - What?

247
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,710
- I've never seen you panic like this for your tests before. 
 - Get out, get out.

248
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,450
Hurry up!

249
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,270
Hi, you're here?

250
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,890
Grandpa said he missed you. If it's convenient, come and have a meal with us.

251
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,680
I'm free!

252
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,280
I'm free, I'm free. Of course, I can.

253
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,130
Uncle, Auntie. Then, I'll take Tong Nian along.

254
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,040
I'll bring her back after dinner.

255
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,030
I'm telling you! You must be back before seven.

256
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,170
Seven? Look what time it is already!

257
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,650
Don't worry about the time. Have fun.

258
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,800
Thanks, Daddy.

259
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,350
We're leaving.

260
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,080
Sister-in-Law!

261
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,410
Why is there another person in the car?

262
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,200
Hi, Sister-in-Law. I'm...

263
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,210
Demo!

264
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,750
I just said my name once and you remembered?

265
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,180
- Yeah... 
 - Your memory is great.

266
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,750
Sister-in-Law, let me tell you,

267
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,480
Boss has never let anyone else sit in the front-passenger seat aside from you.

268
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,740
You can see how important you are to him.

269
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,870
You two, what're you chattering about?

270
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,590
Nothing.

271
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,690
Sister-in-Law, the vegetables are here.

272
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,740
How many fillings will there be?

273
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,710
Cabbage and pork, chives and egg, fennel. Some of each.

274
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,490
I love eating this Chinese cabbage!

275
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,460
Its name is "green cabbage."

276
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,600
Chinese cabbage looks like this.

277
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,960
Really?

278
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,890
I'll pick one.

279
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,490
How about this one? Petite and pretty.

280
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,650
You have a good eye! I think it's the one.

281
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,110
Does it look good?

282
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,810
What good?

283
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,470
There're so many folds. The smaller it is, the less water it contains.

284
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,970
If you are going to choose, pick a big one. There's more water. Got it?

285
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,700
A big one... The big ones have more water.

286
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,160
- Do you like eating that? 
 - Yeah.

287
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,040
- Take it. 
 - Okay.

288
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,470
This one?

289
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,100
Okay.

290
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,820
I saw all the members eating this; it's probably good.

291
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,600
Okay, okay.

292
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,130
Boss!

293
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,880
Why didn't you ask me?

294
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,950
Men don't eat snacks.

295
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,660
Men are people, too.

296
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,450
I want to eat this, is that okay? I want to.

297
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,080
Hurry and take what you want.

298
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,620
Okay.

299
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,830
Sister-in-Law, you're amazing.

300
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,580
Sister-in-Law, has Boss ever yelled at you?

301
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Indeed.

302
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,800
Indeed what?

303
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,580
It is said that men: if they are mean to outsiders, they are gentle to family.

304
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,860
Men who are mean to family, are a wuss to outsiders.

305
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,460
There's such a saying?

306
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,550
- He's really never been mean to you? 
 - No.

307
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:36,430
He's never been mean; he's pretty good to me.

308
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,730
What're you two chattering about?

309
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,700
- Nothing. 
 - Nothing.

310
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,370
Look at this difference in treatment.

311
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,110
He would usually scold me.

312
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,890
Really?

313
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,240
How about I carry some for you?

314
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,140
Keys.

315
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,730
♫ How was my heartbeat rattled by you? ♫

316
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,150

♫ So I can monopolize your embrace? ♫

♫ Can you please be my support forever? ♫

331
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,070
We didn't get the fennel, so we have to make a trip to the market.

332
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,690
Boss, you're going to the market?

333
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,440
Boss, this stand has a lot of vegetables.

334
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,390
Which one is fennel?

335
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,380
Young man, this is fennel.

336
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,710
Boss, how much is it per catty? 
(1 catty is approx. 500g)

337
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,010
¥10 per catty. 
(T/N: $1.45 per catty)

338
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,630
¥10? Didn't it use to be ¥8?

339
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,240
These were picked today; they're fresh.

340
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,650
Not fresh; aren't these wilting?

341
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,400
I'll take one catty. Here.

342
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,480
These bell peppers look fresher than the ones in the store.

343
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,150
They're bigger, too. Boss, do you want to buy some?

344
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,750
Those are withered now, can't you tell?

345
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,910
How much?

346
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,650
- Sister-in-Law, hop in. 
 - Thank you.

347
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,240
How is he so good at buying veggies? So amazing.

348
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,760
What're you looking at me for?

349
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,690

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,480
Today, I want to eat fifty!

352
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,460
Fifty? You're so small but have such a large appetite.

353
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,270
You'll finish all of them before I even finish making them.

354
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,240
This... Do we make the filling first?

355
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,520
Machine-made wrappers don't taste good, didn't you know?

356
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,700
But machine-made wrappers are convenient.

357
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,070
Didn't we buy flour?

358
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,570
This, it's right here.

359
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,960
How do we do this?

360
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Baidu it. 
(T/N: Search it up on Baidu, the "Chinese Google")

361
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,610
- You two, get out. 
 - It's fine, we'll help–

362
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,770
Get out! Go chat with my grandpa. Quickly, quickly.

363
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,910
We really aren't helping him?

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,010
Team Captain.

365
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,870
He's over there.

366
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,590
We're eating dumplings today?

367
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,280
Two children don't know how to make dumplings.

368
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,930
Go and chop up the cabbage.

369
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,270
Why aren't you calling for take-out?

370
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,950
We've already bought everything, it'd be a waste not to make them.

371
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,550
And who'd deliver on New Year's?

372
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,570
Don't blabber; hurry and go.

What're you doing? Assessing the cabbage's physiognomy?

375
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,790
Weren't you the best at meticulous work?

376
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,880
How is this the same? This is harder than I imagined.

377

Next time we extend practice, I really have to teach you all how to cook.

378

Move.

00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,890
- Come, come, come. 
 - Grandpa, have some fruits.

380
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,490
Thank you. Sit.

381
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,260
Thank you.

382
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,150
Sister-in-Law, there are so many ways to make dumplings on the web.

383
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,620
Just how should we wrap them?

384
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,770
People without skill can't wrap them.

385
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,630
Right, right.

386
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:27,640
Nian Nian, what do you like to do when you aren't studying?

387
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,580
I like singing and putting my recordings online.

388
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,220
- Really? 
 - Yes.

389
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,720
I love hearing singing the most!

390
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,910
Then what songs do you like? I can sing them for you.

391
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,090
Do you like listening to Cai Qin, Fei Yu Qing... 
(T/N: 1970s singers)

392
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,550
No, no!

00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:48,260
Grandpa likes to listen to The Legend of the Red Lantern. It's the one that goes like,

This used to be your grandpa's favorite song.

No.

401
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,380
Grandpa, I've never heard of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy,"

402
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,460
but I've heard a small part of "The Legend of the Red Lantern." Do you want to listen to it?

Pour a cup of water.

00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,900
They're almost done; don't be impatient.

417
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,500
In a bit, wrap this in as well.

418
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,240
This is Nian Nian's New Year's present.

419
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,230
I purposely didn't let her see.

420
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,820
Later, it'll be a surprise for her.

421
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,580
Isn't that unsanitary?

422
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,170
It's been sterilized.

423
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,280
Take it.

424
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,800
You're going to throw a tantrum on New Year's?

425
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,520
Don't take this too seriously. What if we break up?

426
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,980
Say that again?

427
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,010
Go watch television, okay?

428
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,990
- Remember to put it in. 
 - I know, I know.

429
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,360
Did you hear anything?

430
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,340
What're you laughing about? Didn't you cause all of this?

431
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,330
Hurry and wrap it inside.

432
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,430
Demo, Demo! Go in and lend a hand.

433
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,840
Go, go help!

434
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,030
- Then I'll go, too! 
 - Oh, no-no-no!

435
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,730
Girls have to enjoy.

436
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,730
Let the boys do the work.

437
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,990
Here, sit, sit.

438
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,100
Eat some fruits with me.

439
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,120
Okay, Grandpa, what would you like to eat?

440
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,950
- The orange. 
 - Okay, I'll peel it.

441
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,850
Here.

442
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,340
This plate is for you.

443
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,330
Does Sister-in-Law avoid some foods or the filling was made especially for her?

444
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,630
I don't avoid any foods.

445
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,200
Then, that's fine. Just eat.

446
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,400
Han Shangyan made them specifically for her,

447
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,220
do you dare eat it?

448
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,200
- I dare not. Sister-in-Law, you eat. 
 - Thank you.

449
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,700
- I didn't make them that well. Just casually eat. 
 - It's no problem.

450
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,970
Good?

451
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,640
It's tasty.

452
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,500
Eat, eat up.

453
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,940
Wait...

454
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,450
Nian Nian,

455
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:19,480
did you taste anything?

456
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,750
- Chives and egg. 
 - No, not that.

457
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:29,060
Like... like did you chew upon something that's a bit different?

458
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,410
What's happening?

459
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,510
This is for you.

460
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,800
For me?

461
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,810
New Year's gift.

462
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:53,010
Oh my... This young one, you didn't learn what I taught you.

463
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:58,490
Originally, I told him to take your present and wrap it inside a dumpling. Hurry and open it.

464
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,220
Thank you, Grandpa. I'll open it.

465
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,040
It's the initial letter of Boss's name!

466
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,390
Do you like it?

467
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,000
I like it, thank you.

468
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,870
I didn't buy it, Grandpa did.

469
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,110
I... I... Look at this punk kid.

470
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,010
Seriously.

471
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,620
- Put it somewhere safe. 
 - Okay.

472
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,830
Give it to me.

473
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,670
I'll wash the dishes. You made all the food.

474
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,850
Have you ever done chores at home?

475
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,650
A bit. But I know how to wash dishes.

476
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,760
Sit and watch television.

477
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,500
If Grandpa knows you're working, he'll yell at me to death.

478
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,690
Then, thanks for your hard work.

479
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,530
How is it?

480
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,350
He doesn't need me to wash dishes.

481
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,020
It's all right. He's like this at the club, too.

482
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,090
He washes his own dishes.

483
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:13,660
Sister-in-Law, during dinner, you talked quite a bit with the Ice King.

484
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,940
Ice King, who's that?

485
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,560
Our team captain, Wu Bai.

486
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,920
In our club, there are three people who cannot be provoked.

487
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,790
Hasn't Boss told you?

488
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,720
One is Grunt. The king of sarcasm.

489
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,290
Another is the one I told you about: Team Captain Wu Bai, Ice King. These two are easy to understand, right?

490
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,060
And the last one?

491
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,440
The last one...

492
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,240
What're you doing?

493
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:48,260
And our boss. He's seriously a Demon King. A great trickster.

494
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,460
Why didn't you go back home for the New Year?

495
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,700
My parents divorced; they've been fighting over the house.

496
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,900
If I go back, I don't know where to stay, so I didn't feel like going home.

497
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,190
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

498
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,370
Don't worry, it's okay. It's really okay.

499
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,800
Actually, Boss is always alone, too.

500
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,430
Probably because of this, he's learned to do everything.

501
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,690
You two... what're you chattering about?

502
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,140
We're cleaning up. Are you done? I'll bring it over.

503
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,090
Thanks, Sister-in-Law.

504
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,630
Put it here.

505
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,580
On the third, I have to go to the club so I won't have time to come see you.

506
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,120
Okay.

507
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,430
It's still early.

508
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,610

Go away!

- What do you mean? Just go. 
 - He's pretty cute.

522
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,300
See you.

523
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,740
♫ Just to run into your embrace ♫

524
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,480
♫ I try my best to avoid it but love is not up to me ♫

525

[K&K E-Sports Battle]

526
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,830
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

527
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,810
Good morning. Happy New Year.

528
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,000
How was your New Year's?

529
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,940
It was pretty good.

530
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,140
Hello, everybody! Happy New Year!

531
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,090
Happy New Year!

532
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,780
You got more handsome.

533
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,910
Hello! Happy New Year!

534
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,890
- G Shuai. 
 - Hello.

535
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,700
- You got fatter. 
 - Who got fatter?

536
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,680
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

537
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,330
Move over a little.

538
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,290
Got it?

539
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,710
That's good.

540
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,780
Everyone! New year, new atmosphere!

541
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,910
How many championships are we going to win this year?

542
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,440
All of them, of course.

543
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,780
In order to win championships,

544
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,280
I prayed to get blessed a keyboard and mouse when I went to my hometown for New Year's.

545
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,060
You have some pretty good ideas.

546
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,240
97, you didn't gain any abilities after the new year,

547
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,840
but you did get more tricks. Even put on a face mask.

548
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,470
What do you know? A new year, a new beginning.

549
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,520
I'm using Jayjun face masks (shui guang) to add luminosity (kai guang). (T/N: Has two meanings - "I'm using the shining (shui guang) mask to bless my face (kai guang).")

550
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,070
I guarantee that I'll win every battle and look radiant doing it.

551
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,560
Let's not even talk about results, finding a girlfriend can happen at any moment.

552
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,020
Here. I'll give you one.

553
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,700
Thank you. Let me see.

554
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,570
Slowly. How is it?

555
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,580
Your skin did become a lot shinier.

556
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,050
But I don't see a girlfriend anywhere!

557
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,730
Who says I don't have any? I'm not bragging.

558
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,210
For New Years, the girls showing up at my door for engagement proposals broke the threshold!

559
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,000
Okay, that's enough! Stop showing off!

560
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,710
Hurry. Call Boss for a meeting.

561
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,520
- Why do I have to go? 
 - What's wrong with that?

562
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,930
Where's Demo?

563
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,510
Demo spent New Year at Boss' house.

564
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,450
My guess is that he was tormented the whole time.

565
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,660
He's hiding in the washroom crying!

566
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,460
He's singing!

567
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,430
Let's go.

568
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,530
(One, two, three.)

569
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,030
Little Demo!

570
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,180
- Oh, he's shy. 
 - What are you doing?

571
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,650
Speak. How were you tormented at Boss's house during New Year's?

572
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,950
What do you mean "torment"?

573
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:37,060
Let me tell you guys, Boss, deep down, is very gentle.

574
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,490
He didn't even let Sister-in-Law do household chores.

575
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:44,110
From buying groceries, to mixing the filling, to wrapping dumplings, and in the end...

576
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,620
And in the end, cleaning the dishes.

577
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,490
He didn't let Sister-in-Law touch a single drop of water.

578
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:55,240
I was thinking, even if I had a girlfriend, it would be hard to reach that level.

579
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,280
But I need to get a girlfriend first.

580
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,920
Boss knows how to cook?

581
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,230
And it's really tasty!

582
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,440
Are you being serious?

583
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,090
You have a big heart. Even if Boss cooked for you, would you have the guts to eat it?

584
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:13,040
I won't hide it from you: I ate a lot, the food was really good.

585
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,630
Are you for real?

586
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,530
I'm not going to talk to you guys anymore! Leave quickly! I'm taking a shower!

587
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,120
Let's go!

588
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,800
Let's go.

589
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,560
Boss, the cleaning is almost done. We can get ready for the meeting.

590
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,110
I got it.

591
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,400
Boss... I heard that Demo stayed at your house for New Year's.

592
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,950
You even made food for him. Is it true?

593
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,510
Do you want to eat as well?

594
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,460
I-I don't want to eat.

595
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,720
This time, CTF's international competition is an individual players competition.

596
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,130
Grunt and 97 are the members of our team who are participating.

597
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,210
Boss will take them, I will stay here and watch you guys.

598
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,310
What about Team Captain?

599
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:08,230
He has his own training strategy.

600
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,240
After we leave, the members who are staying behind cannot slack off.

601
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,650
I will watch all the security footage from beginning to end. You guys got it?

602
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,250
We got it, Boss.

603
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,850
Grunt and 97, you two stay behind. Everyone else can go train.

604
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:36,600
This time in Norway, other than our team, there will also be people from SP.

605
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,010
There are four people from SP. The first person is their team manager, Ai Qing.

606
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,540
The others are Little Mi, All, and Inin.

607
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,720
Because there aren't many people, I arranged for all of us to take the same flight.

608
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,630
Are there any problems?

609
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:54,340
If Boss doesn't have any problem with it, then, of course, we don't either!

610
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,110
This is the itinerary; take a look.

611
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,770
Do you want me to bring anything for your husband?

612
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,110
No need.

613
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,110
Since you and Wu Bai are going to be training,

614
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,980
do you need me to help take care of Grandpa?

615
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,300
He's even busier than me. He's going to visit relatives and friends.

616
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:21,420
Oh right. You're a single bachelor, there is no need to give anyone explanations before leaving.

617
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,860
What are you thinking about?

618
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,000
Nothing.
