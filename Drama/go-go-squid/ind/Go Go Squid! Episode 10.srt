00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,990
Han Shangyan, where are you?

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,370
- Come on! 
 - Hi.

24
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,180
- What are you doing? Let's go with us. 
 - Come here and drink!

25
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,230
- Let go. 
 - Just have a drink.

26
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,730
- Come drink. 
 - What're you doing? Let go! 
 - Sit.

- No! No! 
 - Just have a drink. 
 - Come here and drink.

28
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,640
- Han Shangyan! 
 - Why not?

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,580
- Han Shangyan, save me! Han Shangyan! 
 - Why not?

00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,870
Let go of me! Let go of me!

Han Shangyan! Put that down!

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,700
Do you only know how to solve problems by using violence?

35
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,910
You say that I only know how to solve problems by using violence?

36
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,740
I didn't mean that!

37
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,130
Maybe, they just wanted to get me to have a drink with them but we couldn't communicate with words.

38
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,550
We can try talking to them nicely.

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,740
- Okay? Put that down first.

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,490
Let him calm down first.

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,500

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,170
It's been ten years, and it has never changed.

57
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,270
Let him cool down for a few days. I'll go and talk to him again, okay? Don't worry.

58
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,810
Excuse me, Miss!

59
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,430
You forgot your cake and coffee.

60
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,880
Oh! Thank you.

61
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,640
You're welcome.

62
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,670
I just wanted to celebrate with him earlier,

63
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,380
so I secretly ordered this cake.

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,790
I didn't think, I messed everything up.

65
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,670
It's okay.

66
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,830
Here, I'll give it to him for you.

67

My mood is not good right now. It's best you don't bother me.

70
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,270
I have never understood.

71
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,800
How come between me and Solo,

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
you chose him?

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,410
You want to hear the truth?

74
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,890
Yes.

75
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,640
Of the five, the two of us are most similar.

76
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,780
We've only been on Team Solo.

77
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,640
And we only recognize Solo as the team captain.

78
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,670
We also retired together.

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,940
To me, Solo is not just a person.

80
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,000
He represents a spirit, a symbol.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,860
He is the beginning of my dream.

82
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,610
Han Shangyan, you should understand what I mean the most.

83
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,370
I know that the team disbanded because of Solo and Ai Qing.

84
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:47,680
But Han Shangyan, just because they did one thing wrong doesn't mean you can take the two of them and crucify them,

85
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,680
and have them repent to you forever!

86
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,230
This coffee

87
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,260
and this cake

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,340
are things Ai Qing wanted me to give you.

89
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,030
She bought it earlier.

90
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,480
You're still the same; love playing strong.

91
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,240
Clean your hands.

92
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,260
The three of us all have one thing we want to say to you.

93
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,820
Happy birthday, Han Shangyan.

94
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,780
Are you in a meeting? Or are you training?

95
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,570
I don't dare to call you, so I'll just leave you a voice mail.

96
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,280
Happy Valentine's Day! Happy Birthday!

97
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,750
Aren't I really smart? I remembered your birthday!

98
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,960
I hope that your work in Norway goes smoothly.

99

It's your birthday so be happy!

100
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,160
Oh, right! This is the last one! I wanted to say goodnight.

101
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,250

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,410
This is my buddy. My bro.

Hello, I am Little Mi.

123
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,850
Hello, Judy.

124
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,440
Did you come back to Norway again?

125
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,980
No, I've settled down in China.

126
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,260
Such a pity. It's hard to find men who love cats.

127
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,610
You guys play. I'll go clean up.

128
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,500
I'll let you borrow Alice to play with. I don't let anyone else borrow her.

129
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,110
Thanks.

130
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,920
She likes you.

131
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,520
You haven't changed; you still like cats.

Come, come.

134
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,820
So? After disbanding you came here?

135
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,770
First to study.

136
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,510
Then after I graduated, I started a business and established K&K.

137
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,340
I do admire you.

138
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:15,810
I like CTF, but at best I play in my spare time at the convenience store.

139
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:21,470
But you're not the same. You had the courage to start a business.

140
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,770
You're the one who truly likes CTF.

141
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,800
But from the expression in your eyes, I can see that you are not content.

142
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,080
You want to achieve something big.

143
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,690
That longing expression can't lie.

144
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,720
Are you used to SP?

145
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,490
In that kind of established company, is there competition among personnel? Do they exclude you, Uncle Mi?

146
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,370
Oh, stop making things up. The atmosphere is great at SP.

147
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,700
Just like Team Solo back in the day.

148
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,370
Besides, Solo is the boss.

149
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,560
The club that he leads will not be that bad.

150
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,740
Okay.

151
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,580
Then you keep fighting.

152
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,970
As a newcomer, you have to have some achievements to account for your boss.

153
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,610
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

154
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,970
Tomorrow, I will do well for sure.

155
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,910
Happy Birthday!

156
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,000
What an old tactic.

157
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,780
What do you mean "old tactic"?

158
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,050
No joy in life.

159
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,810
After we are born, we have to deal with these unhappy things every day. Why?

160
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,930
If you don't face these unhappy things in life, how would you know what happiness is?

161
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,980
Listen to me.

162
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,700
After people are born, they need to experience things for themselves, really walk through life, and be happy.

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,940
At the arena, you can lose to our opponents because your skills are inferior to them.

173
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:57,270
But you can not give up before the competition is over. Understand?

174
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,210
Understood, Boss.

175
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,350
Wu Bai, as the team captain, do you have anything to say?

176
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,320
This time we aren't competing for ourselves, it's for China.

177
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,840
We're competing to let the whole world know the reputation of the CTF circle.

178
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,930
Come. Let's cheer. Here.

179
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,560
Go!

180
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,900
Team China. Let's go!

181
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,160
As network security is developing by leaps and bounds at the moment,

182
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,600
the matter of cybersecurity is becoming increasingly serious.

183
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,330
Today, top players in cybersecurity competitions coming from all over the world

184
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,570
representing their own countries,

185
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,580
will contend for the title of National Cyberpower.

186
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:55,900
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the CTF All-Star One-on-One Invitational Live Show in downtown Norway.

187
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:03,540
Today, the 50 best players from 34 countries will compete for the superstar in a CTF World Hall of Fame.

188
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,980
- Good to see you again. 
 - Nice to meet you, Archie.

189
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,550
Welcome everyone to our CTF All-Star Individual Invitational Competition.

190
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,850
I'm your commentator, KK.

191
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,150
At our right side is our English fluent commentator, Archie.

192
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,580
On our left is the beautiful commentator you guys are familiar with. Let's hear her introduction!

193
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,510
Hello, everyone. I am the commentator for today, Grace.

194
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:29,580
Yes. Today, there will be 50 contestants from the top 34 countries in the world.

195
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,660
They're competing in this arena for individual wins.

196
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,090
 The winner will immediately enter our CTF World Hall of Fame. 

197
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:41,550
We will first begin the random selection match. Competitors, please pick up your phones.

198
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,150
 Press the start key to choose your opponent. 

199
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,780
And over here on the screen we can see the competitors are being shuffled.

200
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,980
 This side, I also want to ask one of our co-workers, our English fluent, Archie. 

201
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,920
Which players are you projecting to do well?

202
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,310
It's hard to say. We've got great competitions every year.

203
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,330
We've got DT from China. We've got Naya from Norway.

204
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,310
Two of the best players in the world as well. Let's see what happens.

205
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,860
We see that Archie is watching DT from China.

206
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:16,160
But to DT, today's competition might be very difficult for him.

207
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,880
That's right. Whoever they match up with will not be an easy match.

208
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,680
[All-Star Invitational Match-Up]

209
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,010
[VDMT (Germany) vs DT (China)] 
[Norway All-Star Invitational]

210
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,870
[ICER (Sweden) vs 97 (China)]

211
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,030
[ICER (France) vs ININ (China)]

212
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,570
Little Mi's opponent is pretty strong.

213
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,940
[ALL (China) vs PLAY (Columbia)] 
Little Mi might be in trouble.

214
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,510
[Little Mi (China) vs NAYA (Norway)]

215
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,300
Okay.

216
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,570
Little Mi vs Naya?

217
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,750
- Relax. 
 - Stay calm.

218
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,330
I'm telling you to relax! It hurts!

219
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,170
- What are you two doing? Be quiet. 
 - Be calm.

220
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,020
Look.

221
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,330
Meeting your opponent, you must not take it lightly. Your opponent is quite strong.

222
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,730
Am I not strong? I'll beat him for sure.

223
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,800
What's happening?

224
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,860
Who's up for Team China? Who else?

225
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,550
K&K has completed the first round.

226
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,730
Now, Wu Bai and Grunt have won.

227
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,350
As predicted. What about our guys?

228
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,250
Inin won. Next is Ou Qiang.

229
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,810
[ALL (China) vs PLAY (Columbia)]

230
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:44,910
Okay. So for this match, it will be China's All versus Columbia's Play.

231
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,590
On this side, All force-attacking an eternal defense player is a complete surprise.

232
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,270
Yes. 1-0 and the second round will start.

233
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,810
They immediately found another loophole; on this side, Play noticed that the opponent might've changed attack nodes.

234
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,200
Congrats to All who directly took the win for this round!

235
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,720
Yes! All won!

236
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,410
The old warrior is as strong as ever!

237
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,990
All these years, Ou Qiang's been working as a penetration tester.

238
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,130
He stopped for a few years but he was still able to keep his condition at its peak.

239
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,490
His professional age is even higher than I imagined.

240
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,970
Based on the results from the first round,

241
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,780
China has a very big chance of winning first place in the afternoon's finals!

242
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,720
- Guess: who is the most projected to win? 
 - Of course, it will be...

243
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,560
What? Think I'll blame you if you say KK's players? I won't!

244
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,920
On the world stage, we are all representing China.

245
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,150
As long as Team China wins, we will all be proud!

246
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,950
Then I'll be honest. The most projected (to win) is definitely DT.

247
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,130
In CTF's competitions, he is always the first individually.

248
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,820
I think, if there are no surprises this time, it will still be him.

249
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,420
What's wrong? Laughing so happily. Are you his fangirl, too?

250
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,750
You don't say, Han Shangyan's little brother is a genius.

251
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,950
Same as him back then.

252
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,610
[Little Mi (China) vs NAYA (Norway)]

253
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,640
How is Little Mi's condition?

254
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,500
This side... Whoa! Unexpectedly, there's an obvious loophole.

255
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,880
Really full of loopholes, Little Mi!

256
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,470
Right now, he is behind by three points.

257
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,700
This competition is divided into three modes: Jeopardy (problem-solving), attack and defense, and mixed-mode.

258
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,440
Contestants are required to attack and defend around the server, mining and exploiting vulnerabilities,

259
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,210
and multiple categories of cybersecurity issues are all part of the competition.

260
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,310
Naya got a complete victory over Little Mi, on this side.

261
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,410
Congratulations to the contestant from Norway, 
[NAYA (Norway) - Win]

262
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,670
Naya that won this match. 
[NAYA (Norway) - Win]

263
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,940
But that's not to say Little Mi didn't show us a very interesting battle.

264
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,070
But I personally still think that during the middle phase, his mindset was a little blown.

265
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,470
Although he worked hard, a loss is still a loss.

266
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,600
Anyway, I still have one saying for Little Mi: he's an old general still willing to fight for his country.

267
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,940
Let's congratulate Norway's Naya once again.

268
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,280
- Let's also give a round of applause to our Chinese contestant, Little Mi. 
 - It's okay.

269
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,480
You're unused to this place.

270
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,280
All right! So far, the first round of the competition in the All-Stars Invitational has come to an end.

271
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,010
Yes. I noticed that during the first round, the Chinese contestants had very eye-catching performances!

272
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:33,280
Yes. Now, other than Little Mi, who unfortunately went up against the Norwegian CTF expert, Naya, and has been eliminated;

273
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,010
the five remaining Chinese contestants have successfully made it into the second round.

274
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,850
Wu Bai has always been first in the CTF world rankings.

275
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,890
Naya is also a very strong contestant.

276
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,030
I believe that he will be able to take down DT in the next match. 
[World's First Place DT (China) vs World's Second Place Naya (Norway)]

277
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,100
Actually, we are all looking forward to the duel between those two.

278
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,780
For the audience and us commentators, it will be visual enjoyment.

279
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,250
Yes. Fellow audience, please continue watching this All-Star Individual Invitational Competition.

280
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,730
We will begin the second round soon.

281
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,160
Eat more. Good luck this afternoon.

282
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,130
Ou Qiang, where's Little Mi?

283
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,820
He said he didn't want to eat and went out for some air by himself.

284
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:35,330
[Little Mi (China) vs NAYA (Norway) - win]

285
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,520
What? Can't accept the loss?

286
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,320
I can't be mentally weak?

287
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,440
It's just a competition.

288
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,560
I'm a bit regretful. It's my first time competing abroad.

289
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,040
I thought I could receive the people's applause on stage.

290
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,720
There are still a lot of opportunities.

291
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,490
I'm old now.

292
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,380
I'm older than you and you're telling me you're old?

293
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,410
Your younger cousin Wu Bai isn't bad. He has your past demeanor.

294
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,780
Compared to me, he's still a bit unskilled. Right?

295
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,810
Little Mi, no matter who wins or loses,

296
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,440
we will be fighting for China.

297
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,070
Good luck!

298
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,580
I just knew you would be here.

299
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,650
This is your unique way of preparing. I have long heard of it.

300
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,280
You... like to sit in silence by yourself.

301
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,410
Especially before a big competition like this.

302
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,580
Some people like it lively.

303
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,800
I like it quiet.

304
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,650
Then am I bothering you?

305
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,210
To be honest, a little bit.

306
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,570
Sorry. Then I'll keep it short.

307
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,800
I actually came to tell you, "Good luck!"

308
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,180
These years, I've seen your exceptional talent and perseverance.

309
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,890
So, I believe that you will help China win the championship today.

310
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,780
Truthfully, I don't only want to prove to the world that China can do it.

311
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,310
I more so want to, in front of you, win the championship on the international stage.

312
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,800
Thank you...

313
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,110
for liking me so much back then.

314
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,490
Did you know? Back when your Team Solo won the championship,

315
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,700
I was still a high school student.

316
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,470
But after seeing you shining so brightly on stage,

317
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,880
I secretly swore that I will one day be like you,

318
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,830
shining brightly on the stage.

319
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,160
In front of you, I will win a championship for China.

320
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,150
No matter if it was the Singapore Invitationals Competition or the International Tour Competition,

321
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,490
I paid close attention to your achievements.

322
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,070
Your performance really was exceptional.

323
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,810
That is different.

324
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,600
It was because of you that I chose CTF.

325
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,850
So whether or not I can take the championship today is very important to me.

326
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,480
Just wait and see.

327
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,750
Truthfully in my eyes,

328
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,040
you are already that shining star.

329
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,690
Good luck!

Next up is today's finals competition!

336
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,330
This will be between China's DT and Norway's Naya!

337
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,850
Now, although Wu Bai is globally ranked First Place,

338
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:43,200
coincidentally, Norway's Naya is globally ranked Second Place.

339
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,270
Furthermore, these two have never competed against each other before.

340
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,420
But from their individual achievements this year,

341
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,730
Naya has actually won three more times than Wu Bai.

342
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,970
Moreover, I heard Naya especially went into seclusion to analyze Wu Bai's tactics for over a month.

343
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,400
If it's like this, then I am concerned that Wu Bai's competition might not be so easy.

344
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:09,010
That's true. Let us warmly welcome the two contestants into the arena!

345
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,480
[World's First Place DT (China) vs World's Second Place Naya (Norway)]

346
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,990
All right, let's count down! Ten!

347
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,760
Nine!

348
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,430
Eight!

349
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,240
Seven!

350
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,030
Six!

351
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,680
Five!

352
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,310
Four!

353
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,080
Three!

354
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,760
Two!

355
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,170
One!

356
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:31,810
Go!

357
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,940
This round will be mixed-mode.

358
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:40,330
Yes. Mixed-mode has incorporated jeopardy (problem-solving) with attack and defense.

359
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,850
Ten problems. Ten nodes.

360
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:48,150
The contestant wins if they break through their opponent's nodes, or has solved ten problems.

361
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,720
 DT. Naya. Which one will you choose?

362
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,290
DT has chosen the mode that Asian contestants excel in: problem-solving mode.

363
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,160
Nice. DT has already solved the first problem.

364
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,350
The second and third problems have appeared simultaneously on DT's screen!

365
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,380
DT has stopped! What is he thinking?

366
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,120
Is he giving Naya an opportunity?

367
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,690
What is the situation? Could it be he wants to solve both at the same time?

368
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,540
Nice! He solved them all! Now what do we see?

369
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,750
The fourth, fifth, and sixth problems!

370
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,180
Three problems! There are three problems!

371
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,610
 I've been commentating CTF for many years, but I've never seen a contestant like this!

372
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,890
 Solved! DT has solved it!

373
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,440
He's like a monster! Did you guys see that?

374
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,800
 These are the skills of the one who is ranked first in the world for CTF!

375
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:46,960
 What's wrong? An error has occurred in Problem #7 for DT.

376
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,940
 It's Naya! He's forcefully attacking DT's server!

377
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,870
He has completely ignored the problem-solving!

378
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,090
This is the style of Vikings!

379
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,670
Plunder, plunder, and still plunder.

380
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,470
Naya has taken down three nodes in one go!

381
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,500
 DT is being forced to stop solving the problems. 

382
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,180
 He has been firmly gripped by the Viking!

383
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,180
I will one day be like you,

384
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,150
 shining brightly on the stage.

385
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:18,250
In front of you, I will win a championship for China.

386
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,050
It was because of you that I chose CTF.

387
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,410
So whether or not I can take the championship today is very important to me.

388
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,930
 Just wait and see. 

389
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,280
There is not much time left for DT. There is not much hope.

390
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,480
The ninth node! Looks like we will have to congratulate Naya in advance.

391
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,780
Wait a minute. Naya has suddenly lost five nodes. What's going on?

392
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,480
Nice!

393
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,380
Naya's security vulnerabilities have all been infiltrated at once!

394
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,020
DT has perfectly tricked Naya into thinking he was solving problems!

395
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,680
DT has perfectly brought Naya down to his own pace.

396
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,980
He made Naya think he was just going to focus on solving problems and not fighting!

397
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,380
In truth, he had already dug a trap for Naya.

398
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,280
Naya is now forced to defend.

399
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,660
He is now using all his energy on stopping the encroaching DT!

400
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,480
But he obviously cannot block it!

401
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,760
It is now 9 - 9.

402
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,980
DT is only one step away from being the champion!

403
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,980
Now, Naya is really on the brink of exhaustion.

404
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,680
Now let’s look at DT’s screen.

405
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,660
What?

406
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,780
 Beside this high-frequency attack, he still had the energy to keep solving the problems?

407
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,980
Four problems... three problems...

408
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,680
It’s the last problem!

409
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,080
DT has stopped! His hands are now on the enter key, he's pressed on it!

410
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,080
At the same time as the last question was solved, Naya's server has been breached!

411
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,180
[ACCESS GRANTED]

412
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,030
YES!

413
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,630
[DT CHAMPION]

414
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,830
♫ Get ready for the Crosstown Rivals ♫

415
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,930
♫ Be ready when I take the floor ♫

416
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,930

417
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,250
♫ Give everything to settle that score ♫

418
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,130
To our live audience and our live stream audience,

419
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:31,230
the champion of this year's CTF One-on-One Invitational Competition has already emerged:

420
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,030
He is the Chinese contestant, DT!

421
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,730
Second place goes to the Norwegian contestant, Naya!

422
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,440
And Inin from China...

423
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,930
He has won third place in this competition!

424
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,770
In the One-on-One Invitational Competition, China obtained first and third place.

425
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,030
Congratulations, China!

426
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:52,230
Yes! Let's give these three contestants another round of applause!

427
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,230
Summer, they won!

428
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,530
Meat jerky! Meat jerky!

429
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:05,030
Summer! Summer!

430
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,630
Hello?

431
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,330
Hello? It's really loud over here, can you hear me?

432
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,460
Han Shangyan!

433
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,330
It's me! It's Tong Nian!

434
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,920
I just saw your competition!

435
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,430
Congratulations to you all!

436
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,930
Thank you!

437
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,730
Do you want to hear the cheers for China on-site?

438
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,620
Okay, okay!

439
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:04,130
Hello? I will be going to the interview soon. I'll talk to you later!

440
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,190
Han Shangyan. Uh... I...

441
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,930
Congrats!

442
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,030
- Mom!!! K&K... 
 - What are you doing so early in the morning?

443
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,830
World champions!!

444
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,730
You scared me to death! It's so early in the morning, what do you want? What KKK?

445
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,530
"KK" what? You want me to spank you?

446
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:35,330
Han Shangyan's Club, K&K, is number one in the world.

447
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,930
Third place was also China's, but it was the other club.

448
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,930
In short, Han Shangyan is the best!!

449
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,530
Wait, wait. Come here, come here!

450
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,930
Han Shangyan's company won the world championship?

451
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,270
Look at my daughter! She really does have foresight!

452
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,030
Oh no, no, no...

453
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,030
- Where are you going? 
 - There's still the award ceremony!

454
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,030
This child really does have good foresight. You see...

455
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:05,530
Let's eat. Let's eat.

456
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:22,730
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome back to the 2019 CTF All-Stars Invitational!

457
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:28,160
We are on-site at the CTF All-Stars Invitational.

458
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,130
The champions have already been chosen.

459
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:36,880
Let's invite the organizers of our CTF All-Star Individual Invitational Competition to come here and present the awards.

460
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,230
And now, in third place,

461
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:49,830
hailing from the People's Republic of China, Inin!

462
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,530
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

463
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,430
In second place...

464
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,930
Congratulations.

465
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:15,630
And now, the champion of the 2019 CTF All-Stars Invitational is....

466
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,230
DT, Wu Bai!

467
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,830
Not bad.

468
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,240

00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:49,150
♫ Perhaps I’ll never become your radiance ♫

507
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,230
Congratulations to you.

508
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,430
- Hi. 
 - Okay. Come on. 
 - How does it feel after you won?

509
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,730
Congratulations.

510
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,330
Thank you.

511
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:01,630
 - Sure! 
 - Hi. Can I... interview you?

512
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,130
You don't need to interview me.

513
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:06,230
They are the main characters for today.

514
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,930
Let's do one more.

515
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,230
Ta-da!

516
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,430
Come, come!

517
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,830
Drink!

518
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,330
Cheers!

519
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:26,430
Congratulations! It was a good beginning.

520
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,230
Yes. I finally have something to present to headquarters.

521
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,630
But I really need to especially thank you.

522
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,330
Back then, you chose to stand on my side and start the China branch one year earlier.

523
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,730
Why so formal? Aren't we bros?

524
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:42,830
This is your wish, and I helped you fulfill it. Isn't that great?

525
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,730
But... I'll discuss one matter with you.

526
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,830
That friend of yours. His skills are not that great.

527
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,930
Mi Shaofei?

528
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,630
I watched the entire competition,

529
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,330
the Chinese competitors were all top-level, but he was just average.

530
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,230
Perhaps he was distracted?

531
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,830
Does he have a lot of pressure?

532
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,590
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry what?

533
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,830
I only finished doing half of my hair.

534
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,430
What is it?

535
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,730
Let's go. Taking you guys to have fun.

536
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,030
- I'm still not unrestrained enough? 
 - You're unrestrained enough.

537
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,630
- Where are we going? 
 - Wherever you want to go, we will go.

538
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,630
Great! Then, let's go!

539
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,830
Ou Qiang, I just drank some wine with Nan Wei. You drive.

540
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,130
Hello! My name is Ou Qiang!

541
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,830
Get on the car!

542
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,130
Hurry up!

543
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,910
Try out your car!

544
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,530
Let's depart!

00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,830
