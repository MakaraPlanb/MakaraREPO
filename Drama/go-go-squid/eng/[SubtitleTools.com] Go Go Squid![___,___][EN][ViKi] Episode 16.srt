Hello. An express delivery for Mi Shaofei.

31
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,700
- Who sent it?
- Han Shangyan.

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,760
Oh, thank you.

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,970
Our hotpot in Sichuan... now that's a specialty.

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,700
Little Mi, you have a present.

35
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,400
From who?

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,300
- A fan?
- From who?

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,600
From Han Shangyan.

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,470
Old Han!

39
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,100
The present from Old Han is already here, but where's the birthday present from Ai Qing?

40
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,100
Team Captain, so...

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:42,000
I have a thought. Right now, Ai Qing is also single. Have you considered...

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,900
We moved on!

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,500
Okay!

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Do you still remember?

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,400
That year when I came here from Sichuan, we arrived in Beijing on the same day.

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,800
Then, we charged all the way to Shanghai!

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,800
At that time, I just wanted to go all out, give it my all, no matter the cost!

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,300
Now that I think about it, it was pretty naive.

49
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,600
I'll forever remember that day.

50
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,950
Right when I got off the train, I saw you waiting for me by the flowerbed next to the platform.

51
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,100
It was so touching! You were worried that I wouldn't be able to find Solo or something.

52
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,500
Then I went to buy a bus ticket.

53
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,700
Turns out you were only waiting for me because you had no money!

54
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,600
You're a man. Get over it!

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
If you mention it again, I'll be mad at you!

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,200
Just joking, just joking!

57
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,700
Today, I didn't invite Ai Qing here.

58
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,500
1. Because I wanted a gathering between us men.

59
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,900
2. Because I wanted to discuss serious matters with you two.

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,700
We've been bros for so many years. If you have something to say, just say it! What's up?

61
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,500
How did you tell your families that you were coming to Shanghai?

62
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,900
I didn't really say anything. My mom is already used to it.

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,300
Anyway, even if I told her more, she wouldn't understand.

64
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,700
You know that I've been a penetration tester
<i>(T/N: testing a system to find security vulnerabilities)</i>

65
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,600
and that was how I made a living.

66
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,030
I reckon that she thinks that I went to a different place to play with computers, so she didn't reject me.

67
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,890
How about you, Little Mi?

68
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,200
Before I came, I had an argument with my mom.

69
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
I told her I didn't want to stay at our small shop.

70
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,800
I think a person shouldn't hide himself in a small place for a lifetime.

71
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,840
Honestly, I am the same as Han Shangyan.

72
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,900
I dream to be a champion.

73
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,480
What is it, Captain? Get to the point.

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,200
Say it.

75
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,000
To be honest, I mainly wanted to discuss with you two the individual competition we just finished in Norway.

76
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,900
You are our boss now. Whether you need to nag or scold us, do it!

77
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,900
I know that you guys are not young anymore.

78
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,100
To make you compete against young people in their teens or twenties is not really fair.

79
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,450
But, Little Mi,

80
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,300
if your score does not increase,

81
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,100
you will need to be transferred out of Team One.

Right now, the club is following CTF closely.

84
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,000
It's good, but it's also not good.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If the higher-ups are following closely, we have more resources,

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,100
so your salary, dormitories, and training rooms will be the best.

87
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,300
At the same time, the more resources we have,

88
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,700
you will feel more pressure.

89
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,700
The main thing is you have to push yourself again, Brother.

90
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,800
Live up to the effort you've put in.

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,800
I understand.

92
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,380
What? Hurry and eat!

93
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,700
You haven't eaten yet, how can we dare to eat? You're the birthday boy!

Boss, are you in a bad mood?

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,800
I can talk to you and comfort you a bit.

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,200
You're that idle today?

102
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,520
When I first came to K&K, you asked me why I went into this line of work,

103
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,500
and I didn't tell you.

104
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,600
Now you want to tell me?

105
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's say it this way.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,200

and you have the guts to say I'm your idol?

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,300
Before I retired, I was always MVP.

115
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,200
Boss, saying that is really too hurtful.

116
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,700
I am not trying to hurt you.

117
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,000
It is because I have higher expectations for you. Do you know that?

118
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,100
I know. Thank you, Boss.

119

To be honest, Boss,

120
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,100
at the start, if you hadn't seen my potential for CTF,

121
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,600
perhaps I would still not know what to do right now.

122
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,700
At the time, I didn't know what to do. I had no direction.

123
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,990
Luckily, Boss, you let me prove that I am useful.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,100
That feeling is really nice.

Come here, I'll introduce her.

151
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,260
This beautiful lady chief editor has been the chief editor of our country's CTF magazine since the early years.

152
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,020
A few years ago, when I was captain of Team Solo, she interviewed me.

153
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,730
And she went with us to several training camps and wrote a lot of articles about us.

Let's give a round of applause to show her our respect.

- Your introduction was too simple.

She released an article every day. We can't ignore her contributions.

161
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,100
Not only that. She's Han Shangyan's old fan.

162
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,820
She took such handsome pictures of him. I was jealous.

163
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,070
No, it's because you aren't as handsome.

164
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,400
It's been so many years and you still have the habit of secretly taking pictures.

165
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,310
If I don't do it secretly, will you allow photos?

166
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,470

00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,080
- Room cards are here.
- Thank you.

171
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,090
Thank you.

172
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,200
- You're welcome.
- Come get your room card.

173
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,150
- Everyone, take your room card.
- This one's yours.

174
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,350
Your ranking will update online each day.

175
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,490
- So, don't embarrass Boss, okay?
- Okay.

176
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,680
Zhou Shan signed in for your room, so it's not out yet.

177
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,590
I'll leave you here, then.

178
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,800
You've got your cards, so why aren't you going up?

179
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,430
Get set and prepare to train.

180
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,050
- Okay, let's go. We're going first.
- Get some rest.

181
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,090
All right. You can get back to your things.

182
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
Hi, Shangyan.

183
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,470
This is China's first CTF elite training camp.

184
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,930
Our CTF Weekly is a co-organizer and also the chief director of the event's brand marketing.

185
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm the project manager; I'm in charge of welcoming you all.

186
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,310
Too long. I can’t remember and I don’t need it.

187
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,480
That's okay. I assumed as much.

188
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,050
But if you have questions, you can ask me anytime.

189
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,350
I’ll give you one of my new business cards.

190
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,630
I know you don't use WeChat or Weibo often,

191
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,720
so contacting you is quite hard.

192
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,900
But I'm in media, so I've gathered quite a lot of information about you.

193
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,200
I heard... you’re dating?

194
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,060
That information isn't very clear. I heard it from a co-worker.

195
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,700
They said at the Guangzhou stadium, they saw–

196
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,240
If you have any problems, you can find our manager. Please don't bother me.

197
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,220
All right. I'll go take care of your check-in.

198
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,700
The room for this occasion is a special preparation.

199
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,860
Thank you.

200
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,300
You’re welcome.

201
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,120
Here, take a look. This is the daily schedule.

202
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,190
Most of the time it's intensive training.

203
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,450
Of course, there're also bonfire parties and some leisure activities.

204
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,410
Are you joking?

205
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,710
Having so many leisure activities, do you want to waste the children?

206
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,190
Let me say this, Han Shangyan, that you're so insensible.

207
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,700
Here, take a look.

208
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,930
They chose these themselves. It wasn't forced.

209
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,570
You can't possibly have them train 24/7, can you?

210
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,440
A person's energy is limited.

211
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,400
If you spend too much time playing, then you won't have time for training.

212
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,180
Okay, okay. Remove them all, okay?

213
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,360
Director Xiang, I do think the activities in the schedule are a bit too many.

214
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,700
The team tournament is going to start soon. If they lose focus, it's hard to lead the troops.

215
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,960
Okay, I’ll listen to you guys.

216
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,830
I’m going back to Shanghai today.

217
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,580
The intensive training activities this time were organized mainly by CTF Weekly.

218
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,700
From now on, if there's anything, go to their person-in-charge, Zhou Shan.

219
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,070
Here she is.

220
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,600
Hello, Zhou Shan. Have a seat.

221
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,010
- Here. These are the rooms of you two people in charge.
- Thank you.

222
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,600
Have you two both read through this contract?

223
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,790
We mostly hope that you two can follow the whole itinerary in this elite training camp

224
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,360
and don't give up or leave midway.

225
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,800
This way, we can properly account for it with the organizers.

226
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,980
After all, you two and your teams are all CTF stars in the country at present. Aren't you?

227
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,250
Don't worry, Zhou Shan. We won't.

228
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,160
I still hope that you two can consider my reputation.

229
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:18,500
The time that you're here: train, relax and don't argue.

230
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,920
Don’t you worry. I know what I’m doing here.

231
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,500
Leaving.

232
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,550
You can take it away.

233
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,360
Okay.

234
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,130
Look at that shark!

235
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,100
I'm really scared.

236
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,510
- I'm really scared of Zhou Shan interviewing me. Know why?
- Why?

237
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,940
Because as soon as she starts interviewing me, she immediately brings in Han Shangyan.

238
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,200
I don't know how Old Han is so magical that he can attract so many die-hard fans.

239
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,220
- Because he is handsome.
- Yup.

240
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,510
We were once on the same team. How come I don't have any fans?

241
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,900
Ou Qiang, I'm telling you. As long as you're arrogant enough, people will like you.

242
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,600
Arrogant? I know how to do that.

243
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,180
Go ahead.

244
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,670
First, the head is always tilted sixty degrees.

245
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,260
- Tilt a bit more, more.
- More?

246
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,960
Forehead: crinkle it a bit more.

247
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,650
- That's the look.
- The look in your eyes.

248
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,700
Eat candy, eat candy. Yes, yes.

249
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,450
- His trademark motion.
- Just right.

250
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,320
Pinkie sticking out.

251
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,350
Go eat candy!

252
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,930
Is this fun to you?

253
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,690
Looks like him, right?

254
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,600
If you were taller, you'd be so much like him.

255
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:11,780
<i> Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki

256
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,640
10, 9, 8, 7,

257
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,180
6, 5, 4, 3, 2...

258
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,620
1!

259
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,940
<i>It's break time.</i>

260
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,200
<i>It's break time.</i>

261
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,870
<i>Are you done? Then, can we chat and develop our relationship!</i>

262
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,050
<i>[......]</i>

263
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,190
<i>I’ve thought of a good idea.</i>

264
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,530
<i>It won’t bother you and you don’t need to type.</i>

265
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,970
<i>We can video call.</i>

266
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,590
<i>Are you sure?</i>

267
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,090
<i> Yes. This way is easier.</i>

268
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,250
<i>Can you see?</i>

269
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,250
Yes, I can.

270
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,080
<i>Is the angle okay?</i>

271
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,890
Yes.

272
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,520
I had a meeting the whole day, my throat is kind of sore.

273
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,260
<i>It’s okay, it’s okay. You don’t need to talk.</i>

274
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,000
<i>You can just leave the video call here. It’s okay.</i>

275
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,160
I'll watch the competition videos for a while, you can do whatever you want.

276
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,140
<i>Okay, okay. Do what you have to, don't worry about me. It's fine.</i>

277
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,760
The video is quite long. I won't disturb you; I'll turn the volume down to mute. Okay?

278
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,160
<i>Okay, okay. No problem.</i>

279
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,000
Surprise! Aren't they cute? The hotel wanted to gift them to you.

280
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,210
Do you need something?

281
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,720
I can tell you where they are.

282
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,720
Stop right there!

283
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,510
I'm going to help you find the seahorses.

284
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,150
Stop right there!

285
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,820
- Come quick!
- Stop!

286
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,990
Quickly!

287
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,700
Little seahorse! Where are you, shark?

288
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,620
Han Shangyan? Han Shangyan?!

289
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,930
If you don't have anything to say, please leave. I need to rest.

290
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,700
If I didn't tell you where the shark is, you wouldn't be able to find it.

291
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,760
Besides, seahorses are so small. Right?

292
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,020
I don't care.

293
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,650
Okay. Hug them. You're cute when you hug them.

294
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,660
Han Shangyan?

295
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,170
Han Shangyan?

296
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,210
Take a seat. I have some serious matters to discuss with you.

297
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:53,400
There's something I'm unsure about and want to talk to you about.

298
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,450
Today, I spoke with Director Xiang for a bit.

299
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,560
Honestly, I'm not too sure about it.

300
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,970
It has something to do with Mi Shaofei.

301
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,360
Mi Shaofei?

302
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,590
I know that after Little Mi went to SP, you still care about him.

303
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,290
Right?

304
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,080
Han Shangyan?

305
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,560
Can you see me, Han Shangyan?

306
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,540
Han Shangyan!

307
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,360
Don’t push me!

308
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,700
Mi Shaofei didn't perform very well at the Norway Competition.

309
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,210
The higher-ups at SP were displeased and wanted to demote him to Team Two.

310
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:55,910
I'm trying to say, I can use the media channels to find a solution for his ranking.

311
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,430
Do you know who you are talking to?

312
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,440
You're talking to KK's Chinese spokesperson.

313
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,000
If you raise Mi Shaofei's score,

314
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,770
a lot of professional players' scores will have to be negatively changed.

315
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,300
Do you think I would agree to you doing this?

316
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,310
Furthermore, CTF is a sacred occupation.

317
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,080
It's fair and transparent.

318
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,700
Don't you think what you're doing now is despicable?

319
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,160
I was also once a CTF competitor.

320
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,140
The two words I hate the most are "backstage plotting."

321
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,250
But Mi Shaofei is not young.

322
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,000
It's likely he will have to retire next year. Have you thought of that?

323
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,850
If he really is demoted to the second team,

324
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,820
then he won't have the chance to compete in the finals again.

325
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,570
What is the room number?

326
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:55,960
What room number? That’s called Poseidon underwater suite, do you know?

327
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,600
My results today weren't good. I bet Boss is going to be mad again.

328
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,580
If only Sister-in-Law were here.

329
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,420
Not necessarily.

330
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:09,000
If we happen on one of those days when their feelings as a couple can't be cultivated,

331
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,250
aren't we the ones suffering?

332
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,210
"One of those days when their feelings as a couple can't be cultivated"?

333
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,110
What's "one of those days when their feelings as a couple can't be cultivated"?

334
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,210
Are you dumb?

335
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,570
Wh-Wh-Who's this silkworm?

336
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,850
Can you guys untie me first?

337
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,550
Why would she appear in front of Boss’s door like this?

338
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,950
Thank you.

339
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,110
Hello, I’m Grunt.

340
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,390
Can we shake hands?

341
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,560
Grunt, do you think I can shake hands right now?

342
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,850
Demo, come here.

343
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,210
Open the door.

344
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,520
This kind of thing... why do I always have to do it?

345
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
Quick!

346
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,360
- B-Boss.
- Did you guys...?

347
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,860
Come in!

348
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,890
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

349
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:15,880
Hey! Help untie me first!

350
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,360
Boss's room is so much better than ours.

351
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,520
Look! There are fish, too!

352
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,390
- Hi, everybody!
- Are you dumb?

353
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,910
Help me buy a plane ticket. Also, help me go to the front desk and book another room.

354
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,300
For who?

355
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,820
Tong Nian.

356
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,900
You can't stand being apart from her, Boss?

357
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,290
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

358
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,380
Girls don't like guys who are too clingy.

359
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,080
Quickly.

360
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,030
Boss, don't worry or get worked up.

361
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,650
Now that there's an app, you can book it instantly.

367
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,320
Super convenient.

368
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,980
Right! How long is Sister-in-Law staying?

369
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,560
Let's just say this weekend for now.

370
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,600
What is the situation that has you so stressed?

371
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,500
Boss is missing Sister-in-Law, do you still need to ask?

372
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,570
Grunt, you have more experience.

373
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,080
How do I give a girl

374
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,920
a sense of security?

375
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,680
You've asked the right person.

00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,630
Tong Nian, what are you doing. Are you going to shower?

378
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,170
<i>ID.</i>

379
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,020
Want my ID number?

380
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,920
Don't randomly tell people your ID number. Be careful of con artists!

381
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,180
No, it's my friend. It's okay.

382
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,880
Why do they want to know your ID number? Unless it's because...!

383
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,290
What're you talking about? It's not. I don't know.

384
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,800
It clearly is.

385
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,390
You don't know what's up and you just gave it to them?

386
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,750
Look at that uneasy expression of yours.

387
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,400
When are you going to let us meet? I'll examine him.

388
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,100
I feel like there's something wrong with your taste.

389
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,290
Why are you so nosy? What does this have to do with you girls?

390
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,320
- There's indeed something up.
- Stop it.

391
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,240

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,430
Hello?

393
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,190
Hello. You got the notification?

394
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,800
If you don't have anything planned, come over and play for a few days. Think of it as a vacation.

395
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,810
Then who was that girl earlier?

396
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,980
I met a maniac.

397
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,650
Maniac?

398
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,180
Then since you've already booked the ticket, I'll go.

399
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,360
I booked two rooms, we'll sleep separately. Don't worry.

400
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm not worried about that. I...

401
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,100
It's set.

402
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,560
Look, there's a shark.

403
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,230
If you don't have any business, then go back. Don't stay here.

404
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,810
Boss, isn't booking two rooms too luxurious?

405
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,450
What does it have to do with you? Go.

406
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,850
- Right, Boss.
- Bye.

407
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,320
Sanya?

408
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,940
I'm leaving tomorrow. Don't have time.

409
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,890
Going in such a rush?

410
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,720
It's a big deal.

411
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,110
Such a big deal.

412
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,900
It probably won't rain, but will definitely be sunny. Take this.

413
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,470
Thanks!

414
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,580
Bring Kotex <i>(T/N brand of sanitary towels)</i> with you, just in case.

415
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,380
- Thank you!
- No Problem.

416
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,990
Hello? Han Shangyan, I'm here.

417
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:21,130

<i>Wait for me in the lobby.</i>

419
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,470
No worries. Take care of your business. I'll wait inside.

Everyone gets a lobster as a reward for all your hard work.

433

- Lobster?
- You worked hard.

434
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,400
Thank you.

435
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,330
You came?

436
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,870
Yes.

437
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,910
- Did you wait for a long time?
- No, no.

438
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,880
I booked your room already.

439
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,290
- Follow me.
- Okay.

440
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,940
Is there wine?

441
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,360
Hello? Is there wine?

442
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,530
Yes, yes. There is wine.

443
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,420
They are all hungry.

444
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,780
So cute.

445
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,440
These fish are pretty cute.

446
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,260
What is it?

447
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,800
Come here.

448
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,020
Thank you.

449
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,220
You have to be careful while walking.

450
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,700
Your shoelaces are untied, what if you trip?

451
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,330
Yeah.

452
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,870
Let's go.

453
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,880
This is your room.

454
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,210
Here is your room card.

455
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,730
Thank you. Then, where do you live?

456
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,550
Mine is not here. Mine is downstairs.

457
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,190
So big.

458
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,860
There's an amusement park down there?

459
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,040
The hotel's so big, I think I could get lost at any time.

460
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,390
My sense of direction is really bad.

461
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,020
Tell me your phone ID's passcode.

462
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,820
What for?

463
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,530
I need it.

464
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,020
My ID is...

465
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,890
the pinyin <i>(phonetic transcriptions of Chinese)</i> of "Tong Nian" plus my birthday, 0320.

466
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,770
Password is...

467
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,880
Forgot the password?

468
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,930
The password is your birthday.

469
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,640
- Not correct.
- I didn't finish yet.

470
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,080
Your birthday plus my birthday.

471
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,480
02140320.

472
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,650
When you go out, remember to always have your phone,

473
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,690
so that I can find you.

474
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,120
I don't mean to monitor you.

475
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,930
You said earlier this place was gigantic and you were scared of getting lost.

476
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,310
I’m afraid that you would meet a bad guy.

477
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,650
You came to Sanya by yourself just for me, so I should be responsible for you.

478
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,090
Also, I turned on my location.

479
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,350
So, you can find me anytime.

480
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:54,420
I didn't know you knew how to do this.

481
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,090
Grunt taught me.

482
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,410
The long-distance flight must have been tiring. Go rest early, I will get going.

483
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,800
Then, what am I doing tomorrow?

484
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,800
There are so many activities to do here, go ahead and play whatever. Bye-bye.

485
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,650
Bye-bye.

486
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,340
Bye-bye.

487
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,330
So big.

488
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:48,400
Eyeshadow, blush, eyebrow pencil, brush.

489
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,650
<i>Would Han Shangyan invite me to go diving?</i>

490
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,020
<i>Good thing I brought this.</i>

491
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,250
I'm going to have a meeting here later.

492
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,230
You go play for it bit. If you feel bored, then come back.

493
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,030
Don’t worry about me. Go do your stuff.

494
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,980
I'll give this to you. This way, entering and exiting will be easier.

495
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,710
Don’t worry.

496
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,380
Be careful!

497
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:21,620
Grunt, did your boss bring his family member here?

498
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,330
That's right. Isn't that her over there?

499
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,380
Hi, Sister-in-Law.

500
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,060
Do you want to drink a cup of coffee together?

501
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,090
I’ll come back later.

502
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:47,490
Captain, can you stop staring at the other team's manager?

503
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:52,750
Let me tell you. Put on this, then look secretly.

504
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,020
Go train.

505
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,060
But...

506
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,120
Why are you trying to be cool?

507
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,590
- Tong Nian.
- Ai Qing?

508
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,710
You have a work badge, too?

509
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,210
Han Shangyan just gave it to me.

510
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,570
But why's there nothing written for the position? Look at mine.

511
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,580
Captain, stop acting cool.

512
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,100
But...

513
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,080
I don't know. When he gave it to me, the position was empty.

514
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,630
If you have no position, they won't let you roam around.

515
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,700
Really? Then what should I write?

516
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,830
Just write...

517
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,050
“Family Member”?

518
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:39,940
This... It's not a good idea to just write that, right?

519
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,810
There's nothing bad about it. Tell Han Shangyan, "write in 'family member' for me.

520
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:47,350
If you don't write it, I won't follow you next time."

521
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,010
Can I talk to you for a bit? We’ve seen each other many times, but haven't really got to talk.

522
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,290
Of course. It's my pleasure to be able to speak with you. I am more than happy to talk.

523
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,110
Then I’ll treat you to... coffee?

524
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,790
- Thank you.
- Let’s go.

525
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,760
- There's a large age gap between you and Han Shangyan, right?
- Ten years.

526
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,150
That much?

527
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,360
Then, you are definitely not his fan.

528
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,720
Han Shangyan became famous when he was 21 years old.

529
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,990
That time...

530
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,210
you were only 11?

531
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,590
Yes. Before, I had no idea what CTF was.

532
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:24,480
I didn’t even hear of it before, so I was not his fan.

533
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,300
But after knowing him, I became his hardcore fan.

534
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,210
I couldn't imagine it.

535
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,280
We all used to think that Han Shangyan would certainly find an ace well attuned with him.

536
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,640
In the past, a lot of people liked him.

537
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,800
Of course, there are still many. So we came up with a nickname for him, "10,000 People Cutter."

538
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,400
He cut off all the admiring gazes.

539
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,190
Then... are there really a lot of people who like him?

540
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,660
Of course. Who is he? Gun God.
