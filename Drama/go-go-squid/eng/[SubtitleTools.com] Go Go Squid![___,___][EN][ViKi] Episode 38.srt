Didn't I tell you?

24
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Okay.

You don't have to be nervous or tensed. Just do as you please.

31

You don't have to be so tensed either.

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,300
This is my home, I'm— I'm very relaxed.

33
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,500
Why do you keep squirming?

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Nothing. I just felt like...

35
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,800
it's a bit weird.

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,200
What weird? It's not the first time coming here.

37
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,300
It's different. The first time you came to our house is to have a blind date with my older cousin.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,900
Blind date.

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,700
The second time you came to our house to mislead my parents.

40
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,100
Only this time are you actually sincerely coming to our house for real.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,200
Do you want to watch TV? If you want to, watch it yourself.

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll go pour a cup of water for you.

43
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,100
- Come back.
- It's fine. You are the guest. Should be like this.

44
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,900
Wait here for me, I'll come back very quickly.

Tea is done. What are you looking at?

47
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,500
You look good when you were little. It's a pity that you weren't a child star.

48
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,700
- How would you know whether I was a child star or not?
- Getting proud of yourself, huh?

49
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,100
I am not lying.

50
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
When I was little, I really on TV before.

51
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,200
When I was little, I was famous around the region, okay?

52
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,200
I can tell. You had quite a good childhood when you were little.

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Of course. When I was little, my parents love me so much. They would always let me do whatever I want.

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,700
Then are you happy being with me?

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,900
Yes. Of course, I'm happy.

56
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,600
I still haven't asked you. That day when your stepmom met my parents, what did they talk about?

57
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
Which day?

58
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,200
That time! Before your competition, your stepmom came.

59
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,200
She said she wanted to talk to my parents, that time.

60
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,700
It's that time when you lied to me, saying that you guys are meeting at home, but you actually went to a restaurant.

61
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,500
And so I rushed to get back here but no one was home, that time.

62
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,800
- That day?
- Yes.

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,000
Let me think about it.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What are you still thinking? Hurry and say it.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,900
What did you guys talk about?

66
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,330
I said...

67
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,400
I

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,600
was immature before I was 30.

69
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,300
And hope that Auntie and Uncle would please forgive me.

70
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,000
But towards Tong Nian, my love and feelings are real.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,800
But it's useless with just words from my mouth.

72
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,600
I want to get married. I want to prove with my action.

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,000
I also wish you can sincerely nod your head and agree.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,200
Then... what did my parents say?

75
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,000
If I were your parents, I wouldn't happy either.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,300
Look at you. Good looking, good temper, filial, not spoiled,

77
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
and you're also a top student.

78
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,700
The most important point is that your family is not short of money.

79
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,300
The only thing that I might be able to show is worse than yours.

80
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,000
Then what happened? What did my parents say?

81
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,720
Your Dad asked me,

82
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,700
what are you taking out to marry my precious daughter?

83
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,200
So I thought it over. And it seems like I really have nothing to take out.

84
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,600
If we talk about age, I am at a disadvantage. If we talk about education, I am also at a disadvantage.

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,500
Then I can only talk about dreams.

86
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,000
I said that for the sake of the path of China winning championship, I would sacrifice my body and shed my blood.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
but your parents still don't agree.

88
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,300
I got flustered, both of my eyes got red and I knelt in front of them.

89
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,800
I said that if you don't let me marry Nian Nian, I will stay single forever.

90
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,200
You think I'm a fool?

91
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,800
You think I don't know that you lied to me? Why did you make up those lies? Is it that you—

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,600
You are so used to using your hands and feet on me now. Taking advantage of me, huh?

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,000
Who is taking advantage of who? It's you that's holding my hands, okay?

94
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,600
What?

95
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,900
Hug for a bit.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,730
Me this kind of person

97
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,700
doesn't like to tell the truth.

98
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,900
Other than "I love you", It's better if you not think of other things.

99
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,600
I am just teasing you.

100
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,100
Let me ask you.

101
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,800
After retiring, have you ever regretted it?

102
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,400
Life is a one way street.

103
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,800
Even if one Han Shangyan is gone, there are still a team of K&K behind him.

104
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,500
Behind Han Shangyan, there are still countless Chinese teenagers

105
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,900
who would for the sake of the path to championship, sacrifice their bodies and shed their blood.

106
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,200
<i>Nian Nian! I'm back!</i>

107
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
<i>Look what food I bought you.</i>

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Dad!

109
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,700
- Uncle.
- Little— Little Han came?

110
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,100
Yes. He came.

111
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,200
- You guys talk. Later it's lunch, let's eat together.
- Dad.

112
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,800
It's the evening. Right now is the evening.

113
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,200
I am old and forgetful. You guys keep chatting.

114
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,500
Okay.

115
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,300
That scared me!

116
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Little Han, is the food I made good?

117
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,300
- Yes.
- If it's good then eat more.

118
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,400
- I'll get you a shrimp. Men should eat more shrimp.
- Thank you, Uncle.

119
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,800
Don't be so tensed. Just relax.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,300
After grandpa went back, most of the time, I would eat box meal at the club.

121
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,800
So I'm used to it.

122
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,000
Eat what? Eat box meal?

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Eat less box meal. Box meal is very bad for the body.

124
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,800
When you have time, come here often.

125
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
I'll make some good food for you, okay?

126
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Thank you, Uncle.

127
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,100
Eat, eat.

128
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,300
Yesterday's champion, eat more.

129
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,900
Your club won yesterday?

130
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,200
No we didn't. We lost. We got second place.

131
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,000
Second place is not bad either. It's equivalent to getting second place on a national exam.

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,100
It's a good results. Continue to work hard.

133
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,600
That's not it. He told his teammates, in his dictionary,

134
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,000
there are only championship and failure.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,200
You have ambition.

136
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,300
Why give yourself so much pressure?

137
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,400
Here, give it to me. I'll help you get another bowl of rice.

138
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you, Auntie.

139
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,500
Here, get me a bowl of soup.

140
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,100
Eat, eat.

141
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,500
What did I say wrong? Why did you kick me?

142
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,290
Speak less. The more you speak, the worse it gets.

143
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,200
What if they don't like hearing that?

144
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,900
I understand.

145
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,960
Little Han. What are you doing?

146
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,600
Hurry, put it down! Put it down!

147
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,900
- Why are you washing the dishes?
- It's fine. Put it down, let me do it.

148
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,100
You are the guest, I can't let you was the dishes.

149
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,300
Uncle, it's fine. It's fine.

150
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Little Han, listen to me. We have an excellent tradition in this home. Men handle the outside and women the inside.

151
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,600
This kind of thing is always Nian Nian's mother doing it.

152
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,300
- I never do any of it. You can't be doing this.
- It's fine. It's fine.

153
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,200
Put it down. Put it down, okay?

154
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,900
Old Tong, what's wrong with you? How could you let Little Han do the dishes?

155
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,900
I saw him doing dishes as soon as I came in. I couldn't persuade him.

156
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,400
Don't you feel bad? These are things that are normally done by you. Don't you feel bad?

157
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
- Enough. don't wash it anymore. Little Han.
- It's fine. It should be.

158
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,100
What it should be? It's the first time that you came to our house to eat dinner. It shouldn't be.

159
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,300
- That's right.
- Nian Nian, hurry and get him out.

160
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,000
It's fine. He normally does this. He is a model worker.

161
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,500
I almost finish washing it. Uncle, Auntie, you guys can go watch TV. I'll come later.

162
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,700
Go, go. It's fine.

163
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,900
Let's go.

164
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Model worker. Do you want me to help you?

165
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,000
No need. Just watch beside me, that'll be fine.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Okay then. I'll accompany you here.

167
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,600
- Do you know what your dad told me earlier?
- What did he say?

168
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,500
He said in your home,  the women handle the inside and men the outside.

169
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,300
He never does housework.

170
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,400
He said it?

171
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,900
He is the one doing the work normally. Why did he have to bluff to you?

172

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,200
Are you full?

174
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
I am quite full.

175
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,900
About that, thank you for washing the dishes.

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,400
Don't I wash all the dishes every time?

177
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,000
That's true.

178
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,800
Are you cold?

179
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,300
I wore so much, how can I be cold?

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,600
Exactly what do you want to say?

181
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,000
Be careful driving.

182
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's not what you wanted to say.

183
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,100
I want to say... Just that when I watch movies,

184
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,800
when two people date, when they say bye to each other,

185
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,120
the main guy would always...

186
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,400
To the girl...

187
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Nian Nian. I hope that you can be more courageous when you are with me.

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
If you want to do anything, just do it. You don't have to be afraid,

189
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
and you don't have to be scared of me, okay?

190
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,800
What are you doing?!

191
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,600
Oh it's you.

192
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
I apologize.

193
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,800
Sir. Have you eaten yet?

194
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,400
I am very full.

195
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,800
Young lady, I am so envious of you.

196
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,200
Envious of me?

197
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,000
This great young man.

198
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,100
In our neighborhood, he might as well buy a parking spot and sleep here every night.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,700
Every time I work night shift, I will bump into him.

200
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,400
I bet you guys were in a fight.

201
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,600
I didn't!

202
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,980
In the society nowadays,

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,800
how many boneheads would actually be waiting downstairs of a girl's place.

204
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,600
You must cherish him. These kind of people may seem wild.

205
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,600
But in reality, they are really stubborn.

206
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
He is a good man.

207
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Sir, don't say too much.

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,800
This one here, she gets embarrassed easily.

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,600
I am sorry. Sorry to bother.

210
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,100
Continue. Continue!

211
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,590
So there was someone waiting downstairs everyday?

212
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
He had the wrong person.

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,600
If I really did that everyday, wouldn't I be a pervert?

214
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,200
I'm leaving.

215
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,400
He has the wrong person!

216
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
Are you done?

217
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,400
Go back.

218
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,500
Okay, I'm leaving.

219
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,800
Get in the car.

220
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,600
I know, I will leave after I see you go back up.

221
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,000
You get in the car first.

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,200
There are many bad people in your neighborhood. Let me see you go back up first.

223
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Get in the car first.

224
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
You go back first.

225
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,300
Okay, I'm going back.

226
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,500
I'm really leaving.

227
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Come in.

228
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,300
You look so happy that it seems like you mouth can't be closed.

229
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,400
Nian Nian, let me tell you. I originally thought that if you had

230
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,800
chosen Little Han, you would turn bad.

231
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,500
I thought he wasn't sincere towards you.

232
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,900
But I later realized, I misunderstood.

233
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,000
Whether it is pursuing his career or love,

234
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,700
he is a very serious person.

235
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,600
But the most important point is that,

236
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,000
I think my daughter, she is very happy.

237
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,200
When I am with him, I am very happy, and I feel blessed.

238
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,800
But I think it's my problem.

239
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Perhaps it's because I care about him too much, I like him too much.

240
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,800
That's why for a lot of things, I always go along with him,

241
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,000
not having my own opinion.

242
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Lately, he has been telling me frequently that

243
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,300
he wishes that I would express my own opinion more often, and not just follow what he says.

244
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,700
He thinks that he wants me to have my own character.

245
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Nian Nian, do you know that day,

246
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,300
when we were with him and his stepmom, what he said?

247
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,600
What did he say?

248
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
<i>I realized I love Nian Nian more and more.</i>

249
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,100
<i>I wish that I could see her everyday, and that a life like this can continue for a lifetime.</i>

250
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,400
<i>That's why I mentioned it.</i>

251
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,100
He said he originally

252
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,800
only had two words in his eyes - winning championship.

253
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,300
But it's not the same anymore. Now, in his eyes,

254
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,720
there are four words - winning championship,

255
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,100
and Tong Nian.

256
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,100
He also said that he wants to marry you.

257
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,600
If he marries you, he can feel at ease.

258
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,700
He can then continue to cultivate his Chinese champions.

259
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,000
And for you, you can get as many Ph.D.'s as you wish.

260
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,210
Because he wishes that you have your own dream,

261
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,500
and he would support you fully.

262
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,200
What else did he say?

263
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,400
What else did he say?

264
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,200
You must let mom think for a bit.

265
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,400
Quickly tell me.

266
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,300
He also said he knows you were pampered by us since you were little, and you are spoiled.

267
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,800
That's a perfect match for him. He thinks he doesn't really have any strengths.

268
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,600
That he only knows how to teach the kids, and do housework.

269
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,300
And the rest, only knows how to spoil you.

270
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,800
Mom, do you know?

271
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Han Shangyan is really, really great.

272
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,500
When he used to be poor in the past, he lived with his teammates.

273
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,300
Cooking, cleaning and whatnot were all done by him.

274
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,400
He is not spoiled at all, and he also treats his friend very well.

275
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
In short, please get to know him more.

276
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Do you think that your mom hasn't observed him?

277
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
I think that now, he is

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,200
changing bit by bit for you.

279
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Just like when two people go on a walk, they don't have to say much.

280
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,600
But slowly, their pace would be the same.

281
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,800
And they would both see

282
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,400
the views that the other person enjoys. Do you understand?

283
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,600
It's not cooperation that only comes from one side.

284
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,900
Mom, thank you for understanding me

285
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,600
Oh right, then has he mentioned anything about the future?

286
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,600
He already proposed to me.

287
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,500
Really? Did you agree?

288
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,700
Why?

289
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,300
Is what I did wrong?

290
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
It's not wrong.

291
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
I never thought you would reject him.

292
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,200
Nian Nian, there is nothing bad about this.

293
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,000
Mom just hopes that when you make a decision,

294
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,500
it is made after thinking it through, and that would be fine.

295
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,700
You are here.

296
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,100
This is my first time coming here.

297
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,800
I am actually a bit nervous.

298
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,900
A grown man like you, after going through so much, what's there to be nervous about?

299
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,400
This is a new beginning.

300
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,600
Furthermore, the outcome of this is still unknown.

301
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,000
I am someone with a wife and a child.

302
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,900
Unlike you, all alone and empty-handed.

303
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,600
I have to take responsibilities for the people at home.

304
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Let me ask you a question.

305
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I kind of remember that your wife used to be your fan.

306
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
When she got together with you, would her love for you

307
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,600
be just a kind of personal admiration,

308
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
and a bit abnormal?

309
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,110
What are you saying? Why did you call my wife abnormal?

310
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,400
I think you are abnormal.

311
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,400
Han Shangyan. Are you finally troubled by love?

312
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
What troubles would I have?

313
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,400
I have a friend who has some troubles in these kinds of matter. I am asking for him.

314
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Tell me. Did you do something to her?

315
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,500
What would I have done? Are you going to tell me or not?

316
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,600
Okay. I will stop beating around the bush.

317
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,600
As someone who went through this, let me summarize it for you.

318
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,700
If one day, this girl yells at you,

319
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,400
and then hugs you while crying,

320
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,200
then it means that it is love, and not admiration.

321
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,200
<i>When you love someone, shouldn't you pay attention to them?</i>

322
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,800
<i>If you really love me, then you should pay attention to me.</i>

323
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
<i>So I don't think you understand me at all, if you understood me then you would know</i>

324
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,800
<i> that I'm allergic to Mangoes. I like to eat strawberries.</i>

325
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,100
<i>I don't care if you have money or not, what I care is if your future has me in it.</i>

326
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,800
<i>I like it when we're embarrassed and don't talk too much.</i>

327
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,200
<i>I don't like it when you talk all over the place and think too much.</i>

328
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,300
<i>Okay Okay, let's not argue anymore, okay?</i>

329
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,800
<i>If we continue like this there would be no end.</i>

330
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
<i>Let's calm down.</i>

331
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,610
Clean up. Later, come down to have a meeting.

332
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,050
My second place winners.

333
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,960
- Boss. We...
- What meeting are you guys having?

334
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,770
Boss... We... We are not slacking off. Our eyes don't feel well, we are resting for just five minutes.

335
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,020
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes.

336
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,480
I didn't scold you guys, what are you guys nervous about?

337
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,770
Scared me. I thought Boss took the wrong medicine today.

338
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,720
Boss, didn't you say before that there are only champions, second place winners are all failure?

339
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,110
That's right.

340
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,300
Really?

341
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,710
Then face the wall and reflect on your mistakes later.

342
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,910
Everyone please go to the conference room and we will have a small meeting.

343
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,560
You've worked hard.

344
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,540
That's not it.

345
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,250
Manager, what's going on? Boss today...

346
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,810
What's going on? What's with the positivity today?

347
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,600
Let's go to the meeting. Go. Asian Championship is starting soon.

348
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,380
Ghost scaring people.

349
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,840
Have a small meeting.

350
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,980
You've worked hard.

351
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,970
Let's go.

352
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,620
Hello everyone.

353
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,360
Hello.

354
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,150
Sit down.

355
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,840
Sit.

356
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,370
Buff, come here now to introduce yourself. Old rule.

357
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,450
Then I'll start.

358
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,940
Everyone, we went against each other before.

359
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,860
I lost to you guys.

360
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,660
I believe that even without a self introduction, you guys know me well.

361
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,330
We have already analyzed through you.

362
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:28,440
I am Buff. Real name is Bi Dongran.I am 31 years old this year, an advanced age player.

363
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,430
I have won the national championship.

364
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,800
Including this year, I have been a team leader for four years.

365
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,200
As of now, I am number four in the server ranking.

366
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,060
This is my first time joining an official club.

367
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,190
In the old days, there were no concept of clubs.

368
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,860
The reason that I came back after retiring for so long

369
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,140
is because I want to fight one more time for my dream.

370
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,740
Everyone knows already that I am an advanced age player.

371
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,130
No club would dare to just easily take me in.

372
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,780
Right here, I need to thank Club K&K for giving me this opportunity.

373
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,160
Welcome Buff, joining Team K&K.

374
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,810
As a new member, Buff

375
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,580
will train with us for half a month.

376
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,380
In this half month, there will be five official players and one substitute.

377
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,890
They will go through a rotating collaboration training.

378
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,730
After half a month, we will have two assessments.

379
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,490
One will be personal performance and the other one will be teamwork collaboration.

380
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,500
After that, we will be finalizing the competing team.

381
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,000
And then train for another half a month and compete in the Asian Championship.

382
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,750
Any questions?

383
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,030
No.

384
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,610
Of course.

385
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,770
This is very fair.

386
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,280
I'll listen to Boss.

387
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,880
The team's reputation trumps everything.

388
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,680
Good.

389
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,260
Buff, your team uniform.

390
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,420
Thanks, Boss.

391
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,860
Little Mi, when you see Little Bai later, let him meet his new teammate.

392
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,760
No problem.

393
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,000
New teammate.

394
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,720
In here is the registration form for new members. Hurry and fill it out later.

395
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,200
And give it to me. I need to help you get social insurance and whatnot.

396
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,990
We even have social insurance here?

397
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,700
Of course. Where is your social insurance under? Hometown?

398
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,490
Yes. In Jinan.

399
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,100
Okay. Then I should help you transfer that over.

400
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,000
It's fine. These are all the minor stuff. I will handle it for you.

401
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,520
Because for these stuff, we give them all to outsourcing companies to handle them for us.

402
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,840
But don't worry, I will definitely get it handled for you.

403
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,710
What's there to be worried about? The benefits here are really good.

404
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,890
Right. Indeed.

405
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,680
There's another important thing: our balance between work and rest.

406
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,240
You know that our boss has a quick temper, especially towards time management.

407
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
I understand.

408
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,350
Thanks, team manager.

409
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,890
Your computer.

410
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,960
- Okay.
- If you have any questions, tell me.
- Okay!

411
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,080
You four go to Boss's bedroom for a small meeting.

412
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,630
For Buff?

413
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,580
Go.

414
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,800
Whatever, let's go.

415
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,190
-Boss.
-Boss.
-Boss.
-Boss.

416
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,880
Sit anywhere.

417
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,860
Why are you guys standing there? Sit.

418
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,400
Earlier was our public welcome meeting.

419
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,120
Now, let's talk about proper business in private.

420
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,340
Boss, whoever you want to change, just say it.

421
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,210
I already said that after half a month, the decision will be based on your scores.

422
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,780
Currently, the ranking in my brain is empty.

423
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,460
Us two have the lowest rankings. It's definitely one of us.

424
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,930
If you don't want to get eliminated, then work hard.

425
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,850
K&K is very fair. It's not rigged.

426
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,490
You? Do you feel burdened?

427
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,110
No.

428
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,940
Say the truth.

429
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,120
I feel anxious, but not burdened.

430
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,230
Boss, I'm an adult. I'm not little Demo.

431
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,450
What does it have to do with me?

432
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,810
Using our skills to determine the outcome is most fair.

433
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,410
No wonder you're one of my members.

434
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,480
It's my turn, right? I'm also not burdened.

435
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,530
I'll also do my best, Boss.

436
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,130
You're not at risk of getting eliminated. Don't add to the trouble.

437
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:55,650
That's hard to say. Other than Captain, nobody can perform well steadily.

438
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,700
Right. Uncle Buff is ranked fourth.

439
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,110
Other than DT, nobody can defeat him for sure.

440
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,180
Have some ambition, okay? Have faith.

441
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,120
As long as you believe you are the strongest, you are the strongest.

442
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,490
It's same as getting a girlfriend.

443
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,500
How are those two related?

444
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,770
- Bring out your fighting spirit.
- Right.

445
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,530
Okay. it's all pretty good. You guys can go back.

446
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,430
Okay. We're leaving, Boss.

447
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,290
97, stay.

448
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,440
Let's go.

449
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,320
Bye.

450
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,360
Sit.

451
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,680
So sad. Our team is going to be adjusted.

452
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,090
Let's make a promise. No matter who becomes the substitute,

453
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,320
you're not allowed to cry or drag the team down.

454
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,870
Don't worry. I know myself.

455
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,840
No, what's wrong with you two, huh?

456
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,260
Didn't we already agree on it inside?

457
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,370
Have ambition and faith! Got it?

458
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,130
- Keep fighting!
- Keep fighting!
- Keep fighting!

459
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,910
That's right. Let's go.

460
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,520
Wu Bai acts aloof and doesn't like to talk,

461
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,410
while Grunt just looks annoying.

462
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,050
Do me a favor. Try to unify the team.

463
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,630
This?

464
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,200
Not willing to?

465
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,410
I am, I am. I was wondering why you asked me to stay.

466
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,720
You scared me!

467
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,890
Boss, actually, you're not willing to let anyone go, right?

468
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,990
We're like your children.

469
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,380
Yes. We're all close,

470
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,250
and you're all a part of my heart.

471
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,770
When SP first switched out Mi Shaofei,

472
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,910
I even yelled at Solo,

473
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,270
but reality later proved

474
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,170
that what they did is correct.

475
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,610
In any case, I understand.

476
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,190
In this national finals, judging by the current situation,

477
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,700
SP has improved by more than one grade.

478
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,420
If we don't change, we'll never win.

479
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,570
Boss, not only I understand.

480
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,560
Everyone understands.

481
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:35,410
<i>Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki
Ripped & Resync By HiDeYuKi KaKaShI</i>

482
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,670
Oh, my.

483
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,220
Doing CTF depends on physical strength, too?

484
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,190
Going to die, going to die.

485
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,930
I can't do it anymore.

486
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,860
Second to last?

487
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,080
Today is the first day. Let me try again.

488
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,730
Tomorrow, I'll pass two people.

489
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,640
Can't even run faster than a 30-year-old uncle. Aren't you embarrassed?

490
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,890
I'm not a long-distance runner.

491
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,370
If the youths are strong, then the nation is strong.

492
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,610
How is long-distance running related to patriotism?

493
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,800
I know it now, Boss.

494
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,400
Enough! Get up! There are still 5 rounds to go!

495
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,140
- What?
- We only rested for one minute, Boss!

496
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,840
Do you want to compete?

497
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,830
Come on. ♪ 56 ethnic groups ♪

00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,580

00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,030
- Give it.
- It's meat.

506
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,310
Where's he going?

507
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,740
You forgot to take juice.

508
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,140
Thanks.

509
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,290
The food here is nice.

510
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,530
Of course. Our Boss gives us the best food, even if he has to resort to eating steamed buns.

511
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,800
That's indeed his style.

512
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,610
Let me tell you. 97 is

513
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,320
totally evil, Buff. Be careful!

514
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,840
He's the best at creating factions.

515
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,760
Please don't let him trick you. If you treat him as a friend, he'll treat you as a follower.

516
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,920
What are you saying? Enough! What about it?

517
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,640
- It's the truth. Why can't we say it? Why did you steal my juice?
- That's how you are.

518
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,690
- Right.
- Didn't you get some earlier?
- I gave mine to Buff.

519
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,700
- Where's ours?
- I didn't even get to drink it yet.

520
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,320
You're not new here. Get more yourself.

521
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,820
Are we even brothers anymore?

522
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,510
- Pour some yourself.
- Seriously.

523
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,630
Buff. Once you're done getting food, come sit with us.

524
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,870
Okay! Tell me about how evil 97 is.

525
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,290
No problem!

526
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,360
So irresolute.

527
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,500
Tong Nian.

528
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,290
Zheng Hui, why are you here?

529
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:15,050
Wait for me. I'll come to find you after I hang up my clothes.

530
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,830
Why are you here? Didn't I say that I'll go out to find you?

531
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,950
This is... girl's dorm.

532
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,830
I have some things that I want to talk to you about.

533
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,710
Are you available?

534
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,610
Yes. Come in.

535
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,450
It's just that it's a bit messy.

536
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,310
Let me clean up a bit. Sit anywhere you like.

537
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,490
Is this... busy dating?

538
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,800
Also, I don't believe,

539
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,860
that person called Han Shangyan didn't go in your bedroom before.

540
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,920
He has been in my room.

541
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,900
You misunderstood. Han Shangyan is not that type of person.

542
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,430
He didn't do any to me. You misunderstood.

543
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,230
So?

544
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,740
Does he treat you like a little girl who worships him

545
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,570
or an accessory for him to use on his path to the championship while he's feeling bored?

546
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:40,700
Senior, I don't think it's suitable for us to chat here today.

547
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,630
You... I'm not feeling well right now. How about this?

548
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,160
Go back first and I'll treat you to coffee someday. Is that okay?

549
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,640
Tong Nian, look at me carefully.

550
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,410
Why can't you look properly at me?

551
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,650
I am looking at you.

552
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,470
I like you.

553
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,160
I like you. I like you!

554
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,030
I liked you for two years. Total of two years!

555
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,520
Didn't you realize how well I treat you?

556
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:15,140
Also, whether in education level, temperament, age,

557
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,220
or our majors,

558
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,870
I am the most compatible with you.

559
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,860
Also... Also, I'll earn more money!

560
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,900
I can become better. I can surpass him!

561
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,600
I... I can give you happiness. I will do all that I can to...

562
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,050
I know, senior! I know that you'll earn a lot of money in the future.

563
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,560
I know that you'll become better. You definitely will.

564
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,940
But that's not what I want. That's not what I want.

565
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,200
I thank you for liking me.

566
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,210
But let's end it here, okay?

567
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,380
Just right here.

568
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,680
Why? Why?

569
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,470
How am I worse than Han Shangyan?

570
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,530
How am I worse than Han Shangyan? Tell me and I can change, Tong Nian!

571
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,860
You're great. Zheng Hui, you really are great, but do you know how it feels for two people to be together?

572
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,060
When I'm with Han Shangyan,

573
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,810
there's a certain feeling to it. We understand each other.

574
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,490
We don't need to say anything to know what the other is thinking.

575
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,610
After he and I started dating,

576
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,000
I didn't care if he isn't giving me enough.

577
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Instead, I'm more worried if I have given him too little.

578
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,660
When I'm with him, I just want him to be happy. I want him

579
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,390
to be happier each day.

580
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,940
So you're so sure...

581
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,250
You're sure that you like him?

582
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,220
I love him.

583
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,390
I really really love him.

584
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,900
Each day, I love him more.

585
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,570
These past few days have been hard for me.

586
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:54,520
I can't eat or sleep properly.

587
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,410
I just want you to please give me a chance.

588
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,590
Can you give me a chance?

589
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,700
Thank you for liking me.

590
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:22,150
But I believe that in the future there would be a better girl

591
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,240
that is better than me for you.

592
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,730
For sure there will be.

593
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,800
Keep fighting, okay?

594
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,900
Sorry.

595
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,530
Zheng Hui.

596
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,580
I'm sorry.

597
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,860
<i>As I watched Zheng Hui walk away,</i>

598
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,690
<i>I suddenly understood something.</i>

599
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:16,630
<i>I love Han Shangyan, not because he's the famous Gun God,</i>

600
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,150
<i>but because I can truly feel his happiness and sadness.</i>

601
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,190
<i>I want to stay with him as he works towards his dream.</i>

602
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,450
<i>Over this half month, other than Wu Bai who trains alone,</i>

603
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,690
<i>the others have been training at K&K with all they've got.</i>

604
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,680
<i>Even Buff and Little Mi</i>

605
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,760
<i>are treasuring this rare opportunity.</i>

606
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,720
<i>Of the six people, only five can compete on the stage.</i>

607
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,180
<i>Although it's determined by skill, it's still very cruel.</i>

608
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,300
<i>As the competition date comes closer,</i>

609
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,530
<i>everyone is even more nervous.</i>

610
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,360
<i>Exhaustion and running low on energy</i>

611
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,670
<i>are inevitable consequences.</i>

612
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:05,250
<i>Because of this, they need even more determination and perseverance.</i>

613
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,940
<i>Everyone cheers on the other because we are all on the same team.</i>

614
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,610
<i>We are each other's best companion.</i>

615
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,660
Boo!

616
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,530
What?

617
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,020
Why are you this nervous?

618
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,000
Why are you guys laughing at me?

619
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,290
Little Demo!

620
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,260
You guys, don't always each instant noodles. Eat something else.

621
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,540
Instant noodles are fast. We need to train, Boss.

622
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,900
That's right.
