<i>[Episode 21]</i>

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm telling you. I've met that classmate of Nian Nian's.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,790
He's decent and hard-working.

24
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,600
I heard that he is doing a Ph.D. now.

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,800
My brother and sister-in-law really like him.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,300
They say this kid's prospects have no limit.

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,300
They're very optimistic about his future.

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,100
No, no.

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,890
You're saying that Nian Nian is with her male classmate?

30
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,400
Yeah, that's what I mean.

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,780
No, that's not right.

32
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,400
- Isn't Nian Nian dating my grandson?
- Oh my.

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,100
You don't know yet?

34
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,500
Know what?

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Look at my big mouth.

36
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,300
The kids are probably worried about you and didn't dare tell you.

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,400
This... Then tell me!

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,800
Nian Nian broke up with Little Han long ago.

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Broke up?

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
It's the kids' business, I didn't ask too much.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,200
My sister-in-law warned me, lest I should say something wrong.

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,700
Look. With my big mouth, I've still said the wrong thing.

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,000
No, that's not it.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,900
A few days ago, Nian Nian came to chat with me.

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,600
They feel they aren't a good match and broke up, but are still friends.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,300
No, no. I can see that Nian Nian has feelings for my grandson.

47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,500
Uncle Han, today I came to pass on a message.

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,700
Tell Little Han to let go.

49
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,390
There's plenty of fragrant grasses everywhere, right?
<i>(T/N: Idiom - same as "plenty of fish in the sea")</i>

50
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,300
Find a person that's suited for him.

51
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,000
What do you say?

52
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,400
What's the big fuss?

53
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,200
What's going on?

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,400
Sister-in-Law's gift to you... was this?

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,700
What're you here for?

56
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,200
The tournament... The tournament schedule is out.

57
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,700
This cat is really cute.

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,600
This cat is so endearing to hold, Boss.

59
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,500
Sister-In-Law knows you're unsociable and she gave you a cat to keep you company.

60
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,700
So thoughtful of her.

61
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,500
Boss, when you are free, spend more time with Sister-In-Law. Really.

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,600
Girls need to be kept company, right?

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,500
Like training. We can train by ourselves and do fine. Seriously, you don't have to mind us.

64
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,100
Why do you talk so much?

65
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
My cat. Take this.

66
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,900
Back to you.

67
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,500
Then... I'll be going, Boss.

68
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,500
Do you know what Sister-in-Law gave him?

69
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,300
- What?
- What?

70
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,200
What're you saying? I can't hear.

71
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Hurry, hurry!

72
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,600
Don't rush.

73
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,520
Do you all know what Sister-in-Law gave Boss?

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,700
Don't just blindly guess.

75
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,800
Hurry and tell us. Don't leave us hanging.

76
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
- A cat.
- What?
- A cat?

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Okay, start betting.

78
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
Let's see how many days this cat can last for.

79
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm betting on a week, I'll stake my latest purchase from a few days:

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,100
my new e-reader.

81
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,500
That much?

82
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,880
Auntie, who bought all of these?

83
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,700
Little Han ordered them. They just came.

84
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,100
What? Boss ordered them?

85
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,900
He said in a short while he's sending these things home along with the cat.

86
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,400
He needs to go back to headquarters for a week. There's no one to take care of the cat here.

87
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,700

What're you looking at?

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,900
Boss, that's so cute.

91
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,300
Kitty is cute, or I'm cute?

92
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
The kitty's cute!

93
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Both are cute!

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,690
Is Auntie Zhao here? Tell her to come and see me.

95
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,100
Okay.

96
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
What're you waiting for?

97
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,690
Auntie, I need to go out of the country for a week this time. I don't have the time to shut all the windows.

98
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,400
Be careful and don't open any doors or windows.

99
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,500
Cats aren't like dogs; they will jump out of the window.

100
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,700
And all the food and things are here.

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,900
Okay.

102
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,700
Hey, are you planning to spend a lifetime

103
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,100
to show what "trifling destroys the will" means?
<i>(T/N: Idiom - "The pursuit of petty pleasures thwarts high aims")</i>

104
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,100
It's not enough that you play on computers, now you're raising pets!

105
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,500
Then, that's it. Call me if anything happens.

106
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,300
Also, I've copied down the pet store number and vet number on the cat carrier here.

107
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,700
You can contact them at any time.

108
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,900
Hey, I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

109
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,900
Oh wait. There's also my grandfather.

110
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,700
Please, take good care of him.

111
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,500
Don't worry. I'll take care of Grandpa.

112
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,200
Then, I'll get familiar with the cat.

113
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,000
I've never raised one; let me try.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,500
Slowly.

115
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,400
I'm leaving the country for a week and there's no one to take care of the cat.

116
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,700
When I come back, I'll take the cat away.

117
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,600
We're going to Nian Nian's house.

118
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,370
- Now?
- Right now.

119
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,980
She's at school and not at home.

120
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,300
She's been at home the whole week.

121
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,400
I'm already clear about what happened between you and her.

122
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,400
What're you clear about?

123
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,500
You! To make a girl cry so brokenly, don't you feel remorse?

124
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,000
I won't care about you.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,200
You deserve to be alone! Just don't hurt others.

126
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,390
Let's go! Do you want me to get mad again?

127
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,600
You already said that I deserve to be alone, why would I go?

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
I'm wrong, okay.

129
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,300
You have such a bad temper, who can stand that?

130
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,500
Let alone a girl, you don't even have regular friends.

131
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,000
What're you laughing for?

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,400
I think your words are extremely true.

133
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,200
I really deserve to be alone.

134
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,700
Let's go, let's go!

135
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,280
Nian Nian's mother and I agreed on 8:00.

136
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,100
It's okay if you don't go in, but at least you have to take me!

137
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's go!

138
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,600
Don't get out yet.

139
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
I need to talk to you.

140
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,300
You and I are grandpa and grandson; can we not argue?

141
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,100
I've been yelling at you for so many years that even I feel tired!

142
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,900
Can you give me a little less to worry about?

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,800
As soon as your stepmother remarries,

144
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,000
the Hans will only be you and me.

145
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,900
I don't want to argue with you, either.

146
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,800
Look. Every time you yell, I'm just listening. Right?

147
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,570
Tong Nian is really a good kid.

148
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,300
You should open your eyes.

149
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,300
When your mom gets admitted to the hospital tomorrow, then my heart can be more at ease.

150
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,790
After that, we'll just have to wait for the surgery.

151
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,100
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Thank you.

152
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,500
No need to thank me.

153
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,400
Your mom's condition... the earlier we perform surgery, the better.

154
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,500
We'll arrange it according to the patient's actual condition.

155
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,090
Also, it's a big surgery for your mother.

156
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,400
You have to stay with her and take care of her all of the time.

157
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:45,100
The only point I'm worried about is: with you taking care of your mother, will it affect your studies?

158
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,000
Uncle, don't worry about this. I am in a Masters-Ph.D. combined program.

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
If I miss some time, I can make it up later for sure.

160
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,300
That's good.

161
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,080
Mom, don't worry.

162
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,700
Okay.

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,800
Uncle Han!

164
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,500
I was slow but managed to get home before you arrived.

165
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,100
Coming back this late?

166
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,500
I had some errands.

167
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,100
Go in.

168
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,000
Greet her.

169
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,400
Auntie... hello.

170
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,500
Let's go in.

171
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,500
Uncle Han, come in.

172
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,900
Old Tong. Old Tong.

173
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,900
- Uncle Han is here!
- Uncle Han is here?
- Little Tong.

174
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,700
Uncle Han, come, come.

175
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,100
Come inside and have a seat.

176
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,600
I will carry your bag.

177
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,100
Little Han.

178
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,800
Can I talk to you for a bit?

179
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,220
Nian Nian!

180
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,430
Grandpa Han, why are you here?

181
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,030
To see you.

182
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,810
- Grandpa Han.
- Sit.

183
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,600
Careful now.

184
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,180
You're playing on the computer?

185
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,720
No, I'm coding.

186
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,590
That's great. Good girl.

187
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,040
Hello.

188
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,320
Hi, this is...

189
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,240
His name is Zheng Hui. He's Nian Nian's senior in university.

190
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,080
At the time he was in his third year, he skipped directly to a Ph.D.

191
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,520
Moreover, this kid is extremely sensible.

192
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,200
- Hello, Grandpa.
- And this?

193
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,570
Zheng Hui's mom.

194
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,890
Hello, have a seat. You're guests.

195
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,550
You're welcome.

196
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,960
Bring Grandpa some tea.

197
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,800
Your name is...?

198
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,230
Grandpa, my name's Zheng Hui.

199
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,150
I'm Nian Nian's classmate.

200
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,760
I am actually her senior classmate. I am in the combined bachelor-master-doctorate program.

201
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,960
Last year, Nian Nian and I represented our school to go participate in ACM; a world competition!

202
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,930
We were the champions of Asia.

203
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,390
Oh. Great.

204
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,280
Do you come by often?

205
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,400
Nian Nian and I are good friends. We often eat together or have a drink.

206
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,830
Sometimes, after school, we also go back home together.

207
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,960
Then, what're you here for today?

208
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,820
My mom's health isn't great.

209
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,240
So, I'm asking Uncle to take care of her.

210
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,990
It's all thanks to Mr. Tong.

211
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,960
Next time, she can come alone.

212
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,600
You don't have to come with her.

213
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,260
- Yes.
- His mom is getting on with age.

214
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,890
This child is very filial.

215
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,360
- Where's Nian Nian?
- I'll go take a look. How come she's so slow?

216
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,740
Nian Nian!

217
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,430
Grandpa, have some fruits.

218
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,320
I don't like fruits.

219
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,180
Grandpa, it's fine. Don't take me for a stranger.

220
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm not that close with you.

221
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,680
Didn't we just meet today?

222
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:25,260
As a mother, I always hope my daughter can find someone matching in education

223
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,600
and age, to be her boyfriend.

224
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,360
That way, they could share a language and interests, isn't that right?

225
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,360
I'm not the kind of person who clings to the past.

226
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,270
But, Little Han, can you stand in my shoes and think from my perspective a moment?

227
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,590
Anyone who knows what you've been through since you were little,

228
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,180
I think would never rest easy giving their daughter to you.

229
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,630
Auntie, regarding my past, I have no excuses to make.

230
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,690
It's all my fault.

231
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,160
Also, you're so much older than Nian Nian.

232
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,470
Do you two share a language?

233
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,530
Also, what Nian Nian's learning right now, what is it called?

234
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,870
Neural network, can you understand it?

235
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,670
I don't understand Nian Nian's field,

236
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,410
but she has told me about it.

237
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,380
Whatever she does, I will respect it.

238
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,000
How about what you do?

239
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,830
Do you mean my club?

240
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:42,340
Right, I am an outsider. I can't criticize your profession.

241
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,210
I can only express my position of not appreciating it much.

243
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,560
What? Are you unhappy?

244
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,080
No.

245
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,440
I'm used to it.

246
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,400
I never count on an outsider to be able to understand me.

247
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,270
I haven't in the past and I won't in the future.

248
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,070
I'm telling you. Nian Nian is very simple.

249
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,310
When it comes to feelings, she has no experience at all.

250
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,500
But you're not the same. You've been in society for so long!

251
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,510
When you act and talk, you always have that same manner.

252
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,190
But to tell you the truth, I don't like it at all.

253
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:35,190
Did you think I couldn't see your attitude towards Nian Nian during the New Year's Eve dinner?

254
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,430
Enough. I don't want to stand here and keep finding fault with you.

255
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,670
Didn't you two break up?

256
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,140
Shortly before Nian Nian's birthday, right?

257
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,000
She cried a lot.

258
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,150
Fine, then. Since it's like this,

259
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,850
I hope you won't use Nian Nian's soft spot, her tender heart, to let this linger.

260
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,720
I'm her mom, I know her too well.

261
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,360
This root must be cut off from your side, understood?

262
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,770
Auntie, what you said is very clear to me.

263
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,890
I don't really know how to say things, so if I said anything wrong,

264
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,920
please consider that I'm an elder and try to understand me.

265
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,380
And please consider that we are of the older generation.

266
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,760
Don't trouble Nian Nian again, okay?

267
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,360
Okay.

268
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,430
I promise you.

269
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,560
Now that you've promised, I'm relieved.

270
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,010
Are you still going in?

271
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,750
No need, I'm going to drive around.

272
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,440
Take your time. And when Grandpa is ready to leave, give me a call.

273
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,000
Then, I'll be heading in.

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,760
Little Han,

275
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,660
can I really trust you?

276
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,660
Auntie,

277
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,420
am I this untrustworthy in your eyes?

278
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,310
I'll say this again.

279
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,020
I promise you I won't bother Nian Nian again.

280
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,320
I won't go find her again.

281
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,340
I won't let her have any feelings of love for me.

282
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,100
<i>Nian Nian is very simple.</i>

283

288
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,250
<i>I won't care about you. You deserve to be alone! </i>

289
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,400
Grandpa Han, try this. This is Earl Grey green tea, I just bought it recently.

290
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,060
You know it's good, so you bought it for your parents as a good daughter, didn't you?

291
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,860
Not really, my mom likes tea,

292
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,860
so I buy her some wherever I go.

293
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,270
Grandpa Han likes tea, too. Next time, buy me some, too.

294
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,030
Okay, what tea do you like? I can buy it for you.

295
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,790
Really?

296
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,740
Uncle Han.

297
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,370
- Where's Han Shangyan?
- Han Shangyan? Did he come?

298
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,700
Nian Nian, I'm speaking with Grandpa, don't interrupt.

299
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,000
Little Han said he wouldn't be coming in.

300
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,230
He is waiting outside. He probably thinks our older generation's conversations are boring.

301
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,810
Where are you going?

302
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,680
I'm going to find him. It's unsuitable for a guest to be outside.

303
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,700
I'm going to find him.

Louis, let me ask you. You've been a bartender for ten years,

315
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,820
haven't you ever wanted to see the world and travel around?

316
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,230
To do something more...

317
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,910

Actually, a bartender's knowledge isn't small. Try this brand.

320
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,470
What wine is it?

321
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,490
Besheen Wine.

322

It's a rare opportunity.

342
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,660
We got qualified for the next round. I'm taking a half-day off.

343
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,140
Alcohol isn't good for professional players.

344
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,540
An occasional indulgence is fine.

345
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,710
I've been in Shanghai for several months now and I haven't come here yet.

346
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,170
Do you remember we used to be over there?

347
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,700
We didn't have any money back then. Ou Qiang found out when Ladies' Night was

348
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,460
and men could come in for free.

349
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,710
Ai Qing brought the four of us in.

350
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,560
When the owner saw us...

351
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,640
Remember that?

352
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,390
Remember?

353
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,100
Memories.

354
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,680
Yeah.

355
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,030
Have a little bit. I got my paycheck. Today, I'll buy.

356
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,700
No, I have to drive.

357
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,710
Where did you park?

358
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,460
A street nearby; a friend's.

359
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,810
What? Did something happen?

360
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,150
I've personally never known self-reproach.

361
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,230
I always thought the past was in the past.

362
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,510
But actually, all the absurd things I've done were noted by people.

363
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Have you done something terrible and then regretted it?

364
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,750
Taking my mom's money earned from her shop and going to the internet cafe, does that count?

365
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,290
Your mom didn't beat you?

366
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,300
No. My mom loves me very dearly, you know that.

367
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:18,600
For over 20 years, I've been spoiled by her.

368
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,460
Girlfriend: don't have one.

369
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,840
Job: couldn't find one.

370
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,460
She told me it was fine.

371
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,610
As long as I was safe and healthy, it was fine.

372
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,160
But I do regret something.

373
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,270
That is retiring.

374
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:51,660
At that time my age, stamina, technique, everything was top-notch.

375
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,920
I let my emotions affect my decisions. All was wasted.

376
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,260
Little Mi,

377
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,180
when you say that...

378
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,870
it's like sticking a knife into my heart. Do you know that?

379
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,510
I can only tell you.

380
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,550
Only you can understand me.

381
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,010
Han Shangyan,

382
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,850
do you know you're the most pitiful?

383
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,190
Look at your attitude from back then?

384
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,150
Retiring?

385
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,510
How many people are below your level? Yet you retired.

386
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:48,710
You know how many people supported you since you were nothing until you become Gun God.

387
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,960
How many peoples' hearts did you break, Han Shangyan?

388
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,560
I know.

389
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,430
You and I, we thought retiring back then was really cool. Right?

390
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,850
When we were most powerful, we withdrew. It was like a myth!

391
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,330
It wasn't being unrestrained.

392
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,930
It was suicide.

393
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,470
Sometimes I also think about

394
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,730
what exactly was the point of me coming back to Shanghai?

395
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,390
Was coming back the right choice?

396
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,560
What's with all the depressing talk?

397
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,530
I just want to say that things, whatever they are, should not be forced.

398
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,290
I'm not suitable for competing and that's that!

399
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,560
Nian Nian, what are you doing at this time?

400
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,790
I'm waiting for a friend.

401
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,510
It's cold today; go wait inside.

402
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,740
Okay.

403
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,060
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

404
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,900
Nian Nian.

405
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,200
Mom, didn't you say Han Shangyan was outside?

406
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,710
He was just here.

407
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,380
Nian Nian, there are still many guests inside.

408
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,380
Having them wait isn't nice. Come in.

409
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,460
Old Han, why'd you come?

410
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,880
Little Mi, why didn't you tell me?

411
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,920
Here, drink.

412
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,880
Here.

413
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,380
- Chief, add a glass!
- Okay!

414
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,410
What? Unhappy that I came?

415
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,300
Talk!

416
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,530
Love problems.

417
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,750
What kind of love problems?

418
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,760
You, with a face like that you have love problems?

419
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,490
No way.

420
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,460
Get lost.

421
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,080
You two chat, I'm going.

422
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,620
I just came and you're leaving?

423
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,490
With the kid wandering blindly outside, I can't rest easy.

424
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,680
Since when did you have a kid?

425
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,410
No, whose kid?

426
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,320
Ask him.

427
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,180
Drink.

428
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,550
- Little Li?
- Uncle.

429
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,570
I see that Zheng Hui is a good child.

430
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:15,340
Yeah, and he takes good care of Nian Nian.

431
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,430
Can't be! He's so young, his heart isn't settled yet.

432
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,850
How would he know how to take care of other people?

433
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,950
I saw that you talked with Little Han for a bit.

434
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,390
Did he make you mad?

435
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,020
No.

436
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,990
My grandson doesn't really know how to talk

437
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,830
and he doesn't make his elders happy.

438
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,870
But his nature is not bad.

439
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,690
Uncle, look. Little Han is your grandson,

440
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,410
so if I say too much, it isn't good. Right?

441
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,210
Right, right.

442
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,850
Recently, I've been researching his online competition.

443
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,870
Actually, it's pretty difficult.

444
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,530
Regular people can't just do it.

445
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:07,360
I hope you can give him another chance, to know him.

446
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:13,500
I like Nian Nian a lot and believe he'll treat her well.

447
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:18,070
Uncle, please don't put me in a difficult position.

448
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,040
Just let the young ones do as they please.

449
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,310
Let's not care anymore, okay?

450
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,330
Go and have some tea.

451
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,550
Why would you duck behind a car? It's very dangerous!

452
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,090
Why're you hiding from me?

453
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,540
They are all inside. Are you not coming in?

454
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:58,880
Or did your club come upon something that made you unhappy?

455
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,920
Say what you need.

456
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,250
Is it because of Zheng Hui and his mom?

457
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,520
Who's Zheng Hui?

458
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,630
The boy you saw at the university last time.

459
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:17,400
Just a passerby. Why would I remember him? I'd forgotten.

460
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,820
Although you forgot, I'm still going to explain.

461
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,940
Zheng Hui was raised by his mother alone. His mom is sick, but they don't have money.

462
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,490
So, I told my dad to treat her. He brought his mom to Shanghai.

463
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:33,490
Oh, they're staying at our house because there are no spots in the hospital.

464
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,530
But tomorrow there will be. They'll leave and won't come again.

465
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,370
Explanation concluded.

466
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,300
Did you understand?

467
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,200
How's the cat I gave you? Is it behaving?

468
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,640
It almost bit me.

469
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,340
If it bites me, I have to get a shot.

470
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,010
Isn't that a bother to me?

471
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,910
Sorry.

472
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:07,250
How about... you give it to me, I'll take care of it.

473
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,450
I gave it away.

474
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,980
Who'd you give it to?

475
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,130
My housemaid.

476
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,370
Why your housemaid?

477
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,630
Because I don't like it.

478
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,170
Making decisions by yourself will make people resent you, you get it?

479
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,040
When I'd just given it to you,

480
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,900
you didn't say you disliked it.

481
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,120
And it's also a living creature. I gave it to you and you gave it to someone else.

482
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,050
What if that person doesn't treat it well?

483
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:55,340
How about if you ask for it back?

484
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,110
I'll take care of it.

485
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,720
Go back home.

486
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,390
What do you like?

487
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:10,290
I'll make a game code for you, as an apology gift. Okay?

488
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,750
I like to be alone in silence.

489
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,530
I'm in a bad mood. I don't feel like talking.

490
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,020
Go back.

491
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,620
I won't bother you any longer.

492
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:33,980
<i> Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki

493
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,560
What is it? Melancholy over the passing of seasons?
<i>(T/N: literary theme in poetry)</i>

494
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,170
A moment ago... I had a talk with Little Han downstairs.

495
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,010
I guessed that.

496
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,060
Say, I've been a teacher for so many years.

497
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,270
I've never spoken harshly to anyone.

498
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,600
You're the principal of a kindergarten. Every day you face a bunch of children,

499
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,400
who could you speak harshly to?

500
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,220
But I think that Little Han...

501
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,100
He and our Nian Nian aren't compatible in any way.

502
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:44,920
You see, whether we talk about education or age...

503
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,660
and his past... and his attitude!

504
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,210
None of that suits our Nian Nian.

505
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,800
What? You disagree?

506
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,320
I agree! How could I not?

507
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,220
On this matter, you and I will always have the same opinion.

508
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,590
You and I are on the same side of the war; we've been against it all along.

509
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,950
But I think when I talked to that kid a moment ago, I was a little harsh.

510
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,470
I'm afraid he can't take it.

511
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,800
He's a thirty-year-old man.

512
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,100
He can't take a few harsh words from you?

513
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,000
Doesn't he have any psychological endurance?

514
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,620
You're overthinking it.

515
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,640
You just keep too much worry in your heart.

516
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,110
Okay, stop worrying. Go to bed.

517
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,330
You kid, what have you been mulling over since we came back? Talk to me a bit.

518
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,800
<i>...that was just an excuse!</i>

519
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,990
Hey, where are you going?

520
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,550
I was afraid you couldn't sleep well, so I made you a soothing tea.

521
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,290
<i>Tell me. What do you want me to do?</i>

522
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,700
It isn't as good as the tea Nian Nian makes.

523
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,440
Back in the day, I should have locked you at home.

524
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,190
I shouldn't have let you get close to a computer so early but should have made you study properly.

525
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,890
Say, how good would it be if you were any bit like your father!

526
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,790
- Are you watching this?
- No.

527
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,490
Look. You just like to interrupt me.

528
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,090
What was I saying?

529
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,320
My dad.

530
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,720
Right, right! Look how good your father was in his studies.

531
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:00,640
Say, what parent will let their daughter marry a man with no proper occupation and a mouth full of nonsense?

532
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,790
- Peking opera or Shaoxing opera?
- Peking Opera.
<i>(T/N: different genres of Chinese traditional opera)</i>

533
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,480
I was chatting with Nian Nian's mom.

534
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,260
She dropped a line here and there.

535
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,660
She doesn't like you at all.

536
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,130
You changed it.

537
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,670
Little Bai, you're back? Why so late? Come here.

538
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,360
Come watch with Grandpa.

539
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,550
Look how nice Little Bai is!

540
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,240
Grandpa wants to watch Peking Opera. Watch with him.

543
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:45,130
Didn't you say you had acute appendicitis and wanted me to take you to the hospital?

544
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,610
You believe what I say?

545
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:52,570
Look how much the old man likes you. Keep him company, I'm going.

546
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,110
He's just like this! A mouth full of nonsense.

547
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,420
Whatever. What do you want to watch?

548
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,690
I'll watch Peking Opera.

549
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,920
Can you?

550
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,130
Yeah.
