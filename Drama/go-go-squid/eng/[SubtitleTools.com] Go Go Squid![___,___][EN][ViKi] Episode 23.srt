You are now watching the CTF Pro League Season 8 Regional Finals Qualifier for the Chinese Region.

36

<i>While we're waiting for the competition to start, let's introduce the current standing of the players.</i>

37
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,700
<i>Okay, first let's talk about SP's Mi Shaofei.</i>

38
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
<i>We can say that Mi Shaofei is a veteran.</i>

39
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,100
<i>His comeback to CTF was really unexpected.</i>

40
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,740
<i>- Mi Shaofei is way past his prime time and he's been retired for many years.</i>
- Get ready to enter the stage.

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,190
<i>- It's really surprising for SP to let him play.</i>
- Good luck!

42
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,590
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

43
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,180
Good luck!

44
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,300
Don't feel pressured. Just perform as usual. I believe in you.

54
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,120
<i>All right, the competition is officially starting. The first round is the attack and defend model that we're familiar with.</i>

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,960
<i>Okay, SP started off by reinforcing their server.</i>

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,760
<i>Team Taotao's captain is attacking a node straightaway.</i>

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,950
<i>Okay, we can see that with both teams starting, Team Taotao is using all their players for an all-out attack.</i>

58
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,220
<i>Starting off with the wolf pack tactic, while SP is completely the opposite.</i>

59
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,470
<i>The whole team is on defense,  with the strategy to wear Team Taotao out.</i>

60

<i>They're only one step away from victory.</i>

62

<i>Hope is minuscule.</i>

<i>Mi Shaofei's condition today is excellent.</i>

66
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,890
<i>- This is his best performance in a match since he made a comeback. He should win this match easily.</i>
- Strengthen defense. Hurry!

67
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,630
<i>That's right! He's basically carrying the whole team by himself.</i>

68
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,830
<i>Looks like Team Taotao has bypassed Ou Qiang's trap. Three people have now attacked at the middle.</i>

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,340

Thank you, everyone, for coming to see the competition.

Today, we have won. I have already made an all-out effort.

92

Today,

93
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,600
is my life's last professional competition.

94
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,060
What are you saying, Little Mi?

95
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:52,900
I believe many of those sitting here were there ten years ago, supporting Team Solo's Little Mi, Mi Shaofei.

96
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,780
My past ten years

97
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,390
have been filled with ups and downs,

98
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,770
but I have always believed that as long as I work hard and put in more effort,

99
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,560
I will obtain a good result.

100
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,290
But the truth is not like that.

101
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,120
But, speaking honestly, in my heart I feel very... calm.

102
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,920
There are many things I am grateful for.

103
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,220

110
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,760
There are still some things I want to say to everyone here.

111
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,820
And that is Team Solo's only player who is continuing to compete, Ou Qiang.

112
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,160
Maybe it was destiny, because his CTF username is called "All."

113
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,500
Thus, he will represent the five of us from Team Solo.

114
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,920
Improving together, working hard together on our behalf.

115
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,950
Becoming a national champion on our behalf.

116
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,010
Becoming a world champion on our behalf.

117
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,230
Having you guys, I am blessed.

118
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,530

119
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,580

120
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,930
Solo!

121
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,010
Solo, slow down.

122
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,160
I want to ask Little Mi what on earth he is thinking.

123
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,970
- Don't be anxious, can't you just wait until they're off the stage to ask? Solo!
- Solo!

124
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,790
Who let Mi Shaofei retire? Who made the decision?

125
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,830
Han Shangyan! Don't be impulsive.

126
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,890
Solo also didn't know before it happened!

127
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,440
What did you promise me at the beginning?

128
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,660
Han Shangyan, let go first.

129
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,260
Get out of the way!

130
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,120
What did you promise me at the beginning?

131
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,210
Let go. The audience hasn't left yet.

132
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,120
Wang Hao! I am asking you one last time.

133
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,780
What did you promise me at the beginning?

134
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,050
Ai Qing. Stand further away.

135
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,960
Han Shangyan, don't be impulsive. Let go first.

136
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,950
- Even yelling at you won't make you go away, will it?
- You're not allowed to talk to Ai Qing like that!

137
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,740
Who are you trying to intimidate? I am not your team member now.

138
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,410
That's right.

139
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,820
In this lifetime,

140
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,470
I won't have team members that belong to me anymore.

141
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,980
Before you retired, that was the first thing I promised you.

142
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,270
That if I leave the team, then I will not participate in any team events again.

143
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,540
So even up until today,

144
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,790
I have always been fighting alone.

145
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,640
I fulfilled the first promise.

146
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,980
The second thing, at Sanya, I promised you to take care of them.

147
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,120
Little Mi and Ou Qiang.

148
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
I apologize.

149
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,760
I did not fulfill the second promise.

150
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,110
Go on. Hit me however you want, I won't retaliate. Go on!

151
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,650
Han Shangyan!

152
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,110
What are you doing over here?

153
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,750
Your jacket.

154
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,140
It looks like we're just missing Ou Qiang.

155
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,410
Little Mi,

156
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,730
come with me. I'll bring you to K&K.

157
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,360
Wait.

158
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,810
Don't do anything more than three times.

159
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,190
I'll feel really sorry if I have to reject you again.

160
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,020
Good that you feel sorry. Come with me!

161
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,720
But, Gun God,

162
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,700
the worst ranking on your team is 71.

163
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,410
And I am tossed beyond 100.

164
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,860
Why would I go to your club?

165
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,860
Wipe the screens? Wash the keyboards?

166
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,020
Is that it? Do you want to see me like that?

167
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,730

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,040

169

What's wrong. What's with the long faces?

175
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,190

177
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,200
What do you mean isn't it just retirement? Did you discuss it with us?

178
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,080
How could I discuss it with you if you're so impulsive?

179
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,090
Just who is the impulsive one?

180
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,890
I can't win an argument with you. Let's stop talking about it.

181
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,390
Little Mi, I don't have time to joke around with you.

182
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,160
You announced to everyone onstage that you decided to retire.

183
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,430
Now, we can't even help you redeem yourself, Mi Shaofei!

184
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,100

187
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,820
- Don't be rash. Don't fight.
- Look at me!

188
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,940
What are you going to do once you retire? Have you thought about it?

190
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,830

Little Mi deliberately hid this from everyone.

208
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,850
Solo and Ai Qing didn't know either.

209

Take a look. The company's termination contract.

338
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,330
I have no choice. This is the regular procedure we have to go through.

339
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,330
I know.

340
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,200
I've caused trouble for you.

341
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,980
What are you saying?

342
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,810
There is no such thing as "trouble" between bros.

343
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,030
I just never would have thought that...

344
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,640
things would turn out this way.

345
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,950
I'm pretty sad.

346
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,070
What are you sad about?

347
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,290
I played and got those results myself. It has nothing to do with you.

348
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,600
Besides, Han Shangyan, Ai Qing, and you have already retired.

349
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,360
I should retire, too.

350
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,470
It's exactly because of this

351
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,170
that my heart feels uncomfortable.

352
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,680
We were all too selfish.

353
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:34,820
Why did we impose our unfulfilled dreams on you and Ou Qiang?

354
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,640
I was the one who led you on this road.

355
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,700
I was the one who sparked new hope in you.

356
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,290
But how come things have come to this today?

357
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,850
Honestly, I've thought it through. No matter how great a hero is,

358
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,640
there is a time that he must step down from his peak.

359
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,910
Ou Qiang is playing really well, judging from these past few days.

360
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,310
I believe he will continue to fight.

361
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,230
I believe in him.

362
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,970
Right.

363
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,140
You're only bringing this little luggage?

364
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,290
Yes, only... only these.

365
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,830
Let's hang out tonight.

366
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,870
I still have something to do tonight.

367
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,990
Come on! How do I sign this, Team Captain?

368
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,940
Just... I can't understand the contract.

369
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,570
What are you doing?

370
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:46,860
Our relationship as bros can't be expressed by a cold contract like this.

371
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,790
Other than compensation, no matter what happens in the future...

372
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,760
your matters are still my matters.

373
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,050
Thank you.

374
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,270
You're done?

375
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,720
Yes.

376
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,470
You've worked hard.

377
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,080
You're okay now; it's all done.

383
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,450

I saw your match and your retirement announcement yesterday and I cried!

386
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,750
- Can you write down my name, too. It's Jiahao.
- Sure.

387
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,120
Sister-in-Law, I'll call Boss for you.

388
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,180
Go! Go talk to him.

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,630
Okay. Then I'll go.

00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,640
- Take a seat, take a seat. Sit.
- Okay.

392
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,030
Sit. Do you want water?

393
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,200
Sorry about that. I came to see you without your permission.

394
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,820
I know these two days you are in a bad mood.

395
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,400
Mi Shaofei wanted me to tell you that he wanted to meet with you.

396
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,580
Also, he is at the front desk right now.

397
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,330
Are you going to see him?

398
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,490
Don't be impulsive.

399
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,310
Looking for me?

00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:53,200
<i>I don't think so.</i>

00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,380
Didn't we say we were going to go meet and have a drink?

403
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,980
Hey.

404
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
- What are they going to do?
- I don't know.

Let's go! Hurry!

411
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,720
No, Nian Nian. Your 800-meter time is good, but I can't meet that time requirement.

412
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,830
Plus, I'm really not feeling well today.

413
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,370

I'm dead.

419
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,050
You started running without a warmup. Aren't you afraid your heart can't take it?

420
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,680
We K&K run every morning.

I'm not even part of SP anymore.

Why do you still have to fight with me like it's life and death?

424
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,870
I am just mad that you have so little ambition!

425
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:38,780
I'm telling you. Ambition and strength should be proportional; otherwise, you are a joke!

00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,720

00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,810
Right.

To be honest, it's different now than it was before.

456
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,260
There are many job opportunities in the internet industry. You don't have to go home.

457
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,210
Let's not talk about it.

458
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,200
Did you already move out of the Team SP dormitories?

459
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,240
Where are you staying?

460
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,530
I'll see. I'll find a motel and stay for a few days.

461
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,790
Stay at my place.

462
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,120
I'm not married to you, why would I stay at your home?

463
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,460
My grandpa is heading back to Norway next month. While he's here, Wu Bai and I go see him.

464
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,700
Once he's gone, the house will be empty.

Are you okay?

471
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,260
Do you want to throw up?

472
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,620
Yes or no?

473
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,360
I'm fine!

474
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,870
From when I was young until now, I've never thrown up!

475
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:05,380
No, I actually prepared two solutions, so please don't worry.

476
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,560
Besides, in my family, all my cousins from my mom and dad's side like to drink.

477
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,340
And every time they throw up, I take care of them. So, you...

478
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,670
Don't hold it in and don't worry about your idol image.

479
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:19,720
What idol image!? I really don't want to throw up!

480
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,820
But... just throw up. You look like you need to. Go ahead.

481
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,970
I really don't want to.

482
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,700
<i>Thank you. Mi Shaofei is now signing off.</i>

483

On that day when you retired, you were so handsome!

00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,430
Under the attention of many,

485
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,830
you won the match and even announced your retirement on the spot.

486
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,970
There are some people who have endured for decades

487
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,140
and don't have that type of opportunity.

488
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,630
Really?

489
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,010
Just like that year when Han Shangyan retired.

490
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,220
Of all people, you have the best relationship with him. Right?

491
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,580
I'm mad at him,

492
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,600
but I really love him more.

493
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,100
Our relationship back then was so good.

494
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,380
What about now? What about now!

495
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,640
I know.

496
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:15,420
So that year, it was only you and him that retired.

497
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:21,700
Yeah. He was heartbroken, and I acted on impulse.

498
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,080
I regret it. I regret it now!

499
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,360
What now?

500
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,520
If I could keep playing now, and I hadn't have retired back then, my scores would definitely be better than before.

501
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,470
But what can I do? What now?

502
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:41,620
Now? Now, I... I...

503
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,230
That's enough.

504
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,950
Don't think about the past.

505
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,270
You-You need to think about the future.

506
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,530
Think about tomorrow. Tomorrow... Tomorrow let's go eat spiced chicken with chili sauce, okay?

507
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,950
Spiced chicken...

508
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:21,680
Did you break your phone in Norway?

509
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,570
Is there anything you want to say to me?

510
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,470
I think that today, you and Mi Shaofei–

511
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:38,510
Didn't I tell you before that I am not reliable?

512
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,110
I think you are pretty reliable.

513
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,240
I didn't tell you I went to Norway,

514
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,120
and I turned off my phone and left it in China before leaving. Is that called reliable?

515
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,450
When I came back, I also didn't tell you.

516
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:56,500
If we didn't happen to run into each other at the stadium, you wouldn't have even seen me. Is that called reliable?

517
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:00,770
I know you traveled overseas for work.

518
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,790
Today, you're not in a good mood. I won't fight you.

519
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:07,240
You drank so much earlier. Eat something first.

520
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,010
What if it wasn't for work?

521
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,310
Then why?

522
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,950
Matchmaking.

523
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,750
Introduced through the family. She's pretty well-off and rather good-looking.

524
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,760
Aren't you dating me?

525
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,600
I just said that we would get to know each other.

526
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:46,150
After getting to know me, do you think there is something not good about me?

527
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,040
You're all right.

528
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,190
How do I say it?

529
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,980
Do you understand the saying, "Chicken speaking with a duck?" <i>(T/N: people not understanding each other)</i>

530
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,690
The feeling you give me is like that.

531
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,940
Maybe because our age gap is too wide.

532
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,720
I'm almost 30, I should marry soon.

533
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,840
I shouldn't just hang myself on one tree, right?
<i>(T/N: put all your eggs in one basket)</i>

534
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,070
You... should also see other people.

535
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,800
I don't want to see other people.

536
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,960
- This kid, why are you so stubborn? Don't you understand the subtext?
- I don't understand.

537
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,020
I think...

538
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:44,390
You can't go out with me and see other people behind my back.

539
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,090
If you don't like me–

540
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,100
I don't like you.

541
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,900
<i>Am I really that untrustworthy in your eyes?</i>

542
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,820
<i> I promise you. I won't bother Nian Nian again.</i>

543
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,050
<i>I won't find her anymore.</i>

544
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,900
<i>I won't let her have any more expectations towards me in terms of love.</i>

545
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,290
There's no point if we have to force it.

546
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,630
Right?
