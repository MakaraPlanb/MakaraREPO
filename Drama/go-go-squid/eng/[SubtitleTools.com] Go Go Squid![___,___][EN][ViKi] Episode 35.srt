30
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,360
If I had known earlier that you were coming here, I wouldn't have come.

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,300
What are you saying?

32
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,750
All these years, this place hasn't changed at all.

33
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,780
Go early and come back early.

34
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,290
You're not coming with me?

35
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,830
If I go by myself it's so improper.

36
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,510
Don't forget how Wang Hao's mom has taken care of you all those years.

37
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,740
You came back for so long and didn't come and see her. How improper.

38
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,810
- Go, go! Let's go.
- You don't understand.

39
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,220
Let's go!

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,400
Get out of the car.

41
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,750
This child.

42
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,870
Are you getting out or not?

43
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,680
If you don't get out, I am going to yell your name.

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,360
You want everyone to come welcome you in, is that it?

45
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,380
Okay.

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,770

- Okay, okay!

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,830
Come, come. Come out!

48
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,140
Wang Hao is already the China region's boss!

49
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,370
How come he still hasn't swapped to a villa instead?

50
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,000
You've inquired very clearly about this.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,480
What did I inquire about?

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,910
I just casually looked on SP's official website.

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,430
Come here, come here!

54
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,050
- Coming! Coming!
- Be more spirited!

55
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,770
She's coming!

56
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,880
Wang Hao's mom!

57
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,800
- Do you not recognize me?
- You–

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,350
I'm Shangyan's mom!

59
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,520
I recognize you, I recognize you! It's been more than a decade but you still haven't changed.

60
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,020
You're still so beautiful, how could I not recognize you?

61
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,890
How have I not changed? I've gotten old.

62
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,080
Hurry, come in.

63
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,210
What are you doing? Come in!

64
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,270
This child, you!

65
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,430
Little Ai! Quickly, come down!

66
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,410
Look who is here!

67
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,850
Oh my God, am I imagining things?

68
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,820
Monster, what are you doing at our house?

69
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,620
What are you saying?

70
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,110
Hurry, greet Grandma!

71
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,130
- Hello, Grandma!
- This is...

72
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,040
Wang Hao's daughter!

73
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,890
You're so big now! Very pretty!

74
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,500
Grandma, you are really pretty too.

75
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,620
This little mouth is so sweet!

76
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,870
Greet Uncle.

77
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,030
Monster.

78
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,250
Greet Uncle Han!

79
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,710
Hello Uncle Han...

80
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,900
Go, pour two cups of water for us.

81
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,360
Sit, sit! Hurry and sit!

82
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,980
She is really cute!

83
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,700
Little Han, sit!

84
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,180
Okay.

85
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,560
Little Han, ever since you came back to China, you haven't come to see me.

86
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,100
That... I haven't had the time.

87
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,710
I've criticized him!

88
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,540
I said to him, "In the past you received so much care from Auntie Wang,"

89
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,150
"how can you not go see Auntie after you've come back to China?"

90
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,850
Grandma. Drink tea!

91
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,790
Okay, okay! Thank you!

92
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,290
Oh, right!

93
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,140
Red envelope for our first meeting.

94
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,490
- Don't be so polite!
- It's what I should do!

95
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,160
I got to make the gesture for meeting the kid the first time.

96
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,450
I've heard that Wang Hao's prospects are getting better and better!

97
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,210
His business is getting bigger and bigger.

98
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,370
His business is so big, why has he still not swapped for a villa?

99
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,520
Probably for old time's sake.

100
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,900
But no matter what, he will have to marry again.

101
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,780
He should at least prepare for a new marriage room.

102
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,160
My dad doesn't intend to find another.

103
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,380
Why?

104
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,000
Wang Hao is still so young, how can he not get married?

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,050
Let's not mention him.

106
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,950
How is Little Han?

107
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,010
My son... he has one!

108
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,580
He has children already?

109
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,140
No, no, no! He has a girlfriend!

110
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,890
They're going to get married soon!

111
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,530
You need to marry my sister Tong Nian?

112
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,130
Little Ai, you've got the seniority in the family wrong.

113
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,580
You call me Grandma, so if you greet Tong Nian, you should at least call her Auntie.

114
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,030
His girlfriend isn't even older than me by ten years.

115
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,060
Why would I call her "Auntie"?

116
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,270
Go. Go do your homework!

117
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,570
Go!

118
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,130
You hear? Go do your homework!

119
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,190
None of your business!

120
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,950
This little girl!

121
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,860
At the beginning when you came to our home, you weren't even twenty.

122
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,360
Now look how promising he is!

123
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,420
Time has passed so fast!

124
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,010
Hasn't it?

125
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,980
- Your health is good?
- It's all right.

126
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,090
Really? That's good!

127
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,000
<i>Next, wishing everyone a Happy New Year!</i>

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,070
<i>Let us start anew in Shanghai!</i>

129
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,500
<i>- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!</i>

130
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,970
<i>Cheers!</i>

131
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,740
<i>Come!</i>

132
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,100
Look at Little Han, he is so impressive now too!

133
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,590
I know that too! He has done so well.

134
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,180
The two are good bros, advancing side by side!

135
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,130
That's right, advancing side by side!

136
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,970
<i>What is this?</i>

137
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,460
<i>Cold medicine. You all need to take good care of your bodies.</i>

138
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,000
<i>Then Team Captain, where is ours?</i>

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,220
<i>There is only one box here.</i>

140
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,580
<i>Buy it yourself.</i>

141
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,950
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

142
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,400
<i>Dad. Uncle Han came to our house.</i>

143
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,980
Dad, you're back! Why didn't you pick up my calls?

144
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,110
I didn't bring my cellphone. It's in the kitchen charging.

145
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,660
Where did you guys go?

146
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,470
Didn't we just go to meet his stepmom?

147
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,690
Look at how nervous you are.

148
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,920
How can I not be nervous?

149
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,490
When you met with his stepmom, what did you guys talk about? Did you guys talk about me?

150
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,760
What else can we talk about?

151
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,820
We just talked about her flight to Shanghai, talked about family life.

152
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,530
But after chatting this time,

153
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,030
we have come to understand Little Han more, right?

154
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,860
Then, what have you come to understand about him?

155
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,000
Right, Nian Nian. Are you guys going to Beijing to see the competition tomorrow?

156
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,150
I originally wanted to tell you guys when you came back tonight.

157
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,020
We are going to Beijing to see the competition.

158
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,510
Nian Nian, I am telling you like this.

159
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,890
In the future for things like this, you and Little Han must truthfully report to the two of us.

160
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,630
If there are things that are false, I will kill you on the spot.

161
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,110
Aren't you guys just dating?

162
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,400
Why do you have to be hide and not be open like this? Really.

163
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,290
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

164
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,750
I'll go make food.

165
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't have anything else to say to me?

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,010
No. Right, go and support that Little Han on my behalf.

167
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,370
Dad. What did you guys talk about?

168
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,730
Right. In my study, I still have some information about my patients that I haven't looked at.

169
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,750
Look at this memory of mine.

170
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,980
Why are they all so strange?

171
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,970
Come, look. This is Wang Hao's room.

172
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,750
It's already been many years, but he still doesn't let me touch anything.

173
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,970
This room, you must have a lot of feelings towards it.

174
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,590

Look, the trophies that you all won as bros, he has always placed it here.

180
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,930
No matter how many years it's been, he won't let me touch it. Even if I go to clean it, he won't let me.

181
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,820
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,870
Look at this bro of yours, he values relationships way more than you.

Look toward the eastern direction, you used to yell over there.

221
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,880

Why did you keep this old house?

223
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,050

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,760
It was because of you, Boss, that I came into this circle.

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,960
Tomorrow, I need to play in the finals in the place where you won the championship back then.

Can I not feel nostalgic?

263
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,690
It's like a full circle. I feel satisfy and yet also pressured.

264
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,530
When you say it like that, it really does seem like it is very meaningful.

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,190
Don't stand! Sit, sit!

342
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,860
You. Go sit over there.

343
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,390
- Sit, sit!
- Auntie, you sit!

344
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,730
Okay, okay! So polite.

345
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,370
Han Shangyan, other than the club in his heart,

346
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,850
there is you!

347
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,160
He's the type of person, on the surface when he's the meanest to someone,

348
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,940
then it means he really cares about that person.

349
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,600
Don't pay attention to it.

350
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,810
He's flustered inside so he pretends not to care.

351
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,440
I know, Auntie.

352
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,630
I knew you were a smart girl.

353
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,200
- Is it hard studying for your doctorate?
- It's okay. Not too hard.

354
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,760
In the future, you just focus on studying for school.

355
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,630
Let him do all the house chores.

356
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,500
If men don't show their strength, then who will.

357
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,770
Normally, he's the one doing the house chores. I haven't done any.

358
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,490
Really? I knew it. He treasures you.

359
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,830
This son of mine has a bunch of flaws.

360
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,040
Blame me for not teaching him well. In the future, you'll often need to be tolerant.

361
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,350
Not really, Auntie.

362
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,110
There's also one more point.

363
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:43,350
Just because he looks like a big man, his heart is like a glass heart.

364
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,970
He's very afraid of losing things. Especially relationships.

365
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,140
He's very fixated towards relationships.

366
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,300
He's also has a one-track mind.

367
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,450
In the future, if you two fight,

368
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,290
you can argue it out, but don't ever say things like "let's break up" or "don't want you" to him.

369
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,110
He... He won't be able to take it.

370
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,200
What happens if someday, he cuts his wrist? What should we do?

371
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,340
Okay, I got it.

372
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,280
I haven't spoken much to the little girl and you're already rushing us.

373
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:23,920
Tong Nian, do you know how Han Shangyan's K&K Club was formed?

374
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,380
All these years, he invest a lot and suffered a lot of hardships.

375
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,870
You didn't know.

376
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,110
I also didn't understand this in the past.

377
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,730
Later, when I came back, I saw all the trophies he obtained.

378
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,240
That's when I understood.

379
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,740
The reward of a trophy is paid with heart and blood from many people behind the scene.

380
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,080
There are many things that he doesn't want to tell you.

381
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,150
Oh right.

382
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,530
What's wrong?

383
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,960
- Boss, do you need help?
- No need.

384
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,840
You hungry? Eating this many things?

385
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,420
I prepared these for you.

386
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,750
I can't finish all of this.

387
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,330
There's not a lot here.

388
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,420
Are you the type of person who has a weird fetish and likes to watch people eat?

389
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,590
I prepared stuff for you and now my preparations become a shortcoming?

390
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,830
My fault. My fault. Thank you.

391
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,150
Want some?

392
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,860
- Do you guys want some?
- No.

393
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,940
This.. Is this a new style?

394
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,700
Weather's too hot so the candy melted together.

395
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,570
So impressive, Han Shangyan.

396
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,550
First time seeing that QQ candy can be like this.

397
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,300
Edible.

398
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,280
Are you thirsty?

399
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,200
Are you still hungry?

400
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,180
The air conditioner blowing too coldly?

401
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,300
No problem. No problem. No problem.

402
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,430
Clean it with wet wipes in a second and it'll be fine.

403
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,890
Eating at this rate, Sister in-Law would gain 10 pounds when she gets off the plane.

404
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,040
He wasn't able to learn how to be nice to someone so he's faking it till you kill it.

405
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,600
That's why he never had a girlfriend in the past.

406
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,960
Learned a lesson right? Don't blame others for being single. Reflect more upon yourself.

407
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,700
Coach, what do you mean?

408
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,660
I remember you were just recently off the market.

409
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,990
Don't look down on us single dogs <i>(bachelors)</i>.

410
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,090
Very yummy.

411
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,300
Then eat more.

412
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,380
- Slow down.
- Come, move faster.

413
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,560
What is it?

414
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,730
Finally, waited till you came.

415
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,470
Good thing I waited in front of the hotel since early in the morning.

416
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,860
Little Mi, let me borrow your boss for one night.

417
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,950
Sure. Borrow early, return early.

418
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,250
The emotional support of our brotherhood can't be gone for too long.

419
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,530
Look how arrogant you've become.

420
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,220
Okay buddies, let's all go upstairs and rest.

421
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,510
6 p.m. econd floor Chinese restaurant. 8 p.m. training.

422
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,480
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

423
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,220
Then I'll go up with them.

424
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,790
Come along.

425
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,170
No, it's okay. You guys hardly get to meet together. I don't want to budge in.

426
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,970
This is the rule.

427
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,120
Whoever has a family member <i>(i.e. new addition to the family)</i> then everyone must interrogate.

428
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,700
Afraid you won't pass the interrogation? Let's go.

429
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,000
- Our old place.
- Haven't closed down yet?

430
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,800
If we don't go eat there, then how would it close down?

431
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,050
Here. Today, we'll eat here.

432
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,320
Is this where you guys often gather together in the past?

433
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,440
This is our old base.

434
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,750
The main dishes in there are from Beijing. Whatever you want to eat, they should have it.

435
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,080
All in one.

436
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:41,140
Back in the day, Old Han and I, no matter if we won or lost the competition, drink till we feel good.

437
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,770
Drink till all is beautiful.

438
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,430
Let's go.

439
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,050
How is it, Tong Nian? The view here is nice right?

440
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,360
Order whatever you want to eat. It's my treat.

441
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,240
Thank you.

442
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,010
You covered the team separation meal.

443
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,530
This meal, I'll take over.

444
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,960
Why don't we have some alcohol?

445
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,250
Sure. Since we've both retired, it wouldn't affect the competition.

446
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,640
Whatever. Let's go by one box first.

447
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,090
- Two boxes.
- Three boxes.

448
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,130
Four boxes.

449
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,760
Why don't you guys order one box at a time?

450
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,870
Sure.

451
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,320
Waiter, bring six boxes of beer.

452
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,610
All right.

453
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,690
Tong Nian, go ahead and order.

454
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,050
The food here is really good.

455
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,810
Come, Old Han. Let me toast to you again.

456
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,900
Don't always pull a long face <i>(i.e. put on a grave expression)</i>. Can't you give me a smile?

457
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,610
- Is he not able to take anymore?
- He has low alcohol tolerance.

458
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,870
- Low alcohol tolerance and still ordered six boxes of beer?
- He likes to get himself drunk on his own.

459
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,390
- Who said my alcohol tolerance is low?
- No. No. No.

460
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,870
Come. I propose a toast to you.

461
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,260
- Bottoms up.
- Drink it slow.

462
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,520
In the past, what were the five of you like?

463
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,030
Back then, we were quite happy.

464
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:31,370
But we didn't just have happiness,

465
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,830
we also had frustrations.

466
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,480
But every time there's something frustrating,

467
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,290
there's always this saying that appears inside my heart.

468
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:44,600
I'll recite to you. Old Han also knows.

469
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,560
Old Han, you also listen. You know this saying.

470
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:56,350
Our dream has been sleeping deeply for a long time.

471
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:06,740
In the past, all the experiences and achievements will all be once again refreshed from this moment on.

472
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,310
How was it, Tong Nian?

473
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,980
- Good. Good poem.
- Come. Come. Come.

474
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,120
Come Come Come. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

475
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,920
He's crying.

476
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,320
Are you okay, Solo?

477
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,750
Go pay the check.

478
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,420
Wait.

479
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,280
Take this.

480
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,770
I'll go pay out the check.

481
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,070
Old Han.

482
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,220
Don't drink anymore. Let's go.

483
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,980
Look how drunk you are and you're still drinking. Let's go.

484
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,570
- We're here.
- Boss, why did you call me so urgently?

485
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,790
Hold him.

486
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,030
You killed the opponent's general before the war, Boss.

487
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,540
Why don't we put him here.

488
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,240
Go to the bathroom.

489
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,090
Slowly.

490
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,580
Be careful.

491
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:49,760
<i> Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki
Ripped & Resync By HiDeYuKi KaKaShI</i>

492
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:02,100
You guys leave first. Let the two of us stay here alone.

493
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,780
Okay.

494
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,760
Then, I'll leave first. Call me if you need anything.

495
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,860
Little Han,

496
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,890
tonight we drank so happily.

497
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:52,900
How long has it been since we drank so much together?

498
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,760
Do you know these ten years

499
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,000
how long I've thought about spending it happily with you?

500
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,100
Every time, no matter if I am happy or sad or when we won the competition,

501
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,460
we all wanted to spend the time with you and share the feelings.

502
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,460
But you? Where where you?!

503
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:31,360
You acted so cowardly, hiding away.

504
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,600
I didn't hide!

505
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,700
That year, how old was I?

506
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,900
I was feeling confused about being a father. All right.

507
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,830
I had to be a dad, do you understand that?

508
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,570
I don't want to hold you guys back.

509
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:48,840
Han Shangyan, you are someone who needs to go on the World's Stage.

510
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,420
You need to go on the World's Stage. Do you understand?

511
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,620
So you abandon us? Can we still climb up to the peak then?

512
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,320
Wang Hao, I'm telling you!

513
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,210
No matter how high we flew, no matter how far we flew,

514
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,950
I'd always hoped that you are the force that will always support us.

515
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,460
Did you know how...

516
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,190
how lonely I was?

517
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,850
Old Han...

518
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,510
Sorry.

519
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,080
Do you know

520
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,690
to hear this word, "sorry",

521
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,030
how long I have waited?

522
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,680
Sorry!

523
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,830
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

524
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,270
Old Han.

525
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,940
Sorry.

526
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,850
You're here.

527
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,630
- They're inside.
- Are they okay?

528
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,980
They drank too much. They got a box of beer and drank at least twenty bottles and two bottles of vodka.

529
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,190
Now, Han Shangyan is inside with Solo and won't let anyone else in.

530
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,070
I know, he called me here.

531
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,580
Don't worry, they know how to drink.

532
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,220
Han Shangyan said Solo can't drink too much.

533
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,870
He lies, don't you know that?

534
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,060
Lied to me?

535
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,920
He loves lying.

536
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,660
Then I'll go in first.

537
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,200
They're inside talking and won't let anyone in.

538
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,780
Don't worry.

539
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,860
Enough, get out and dry yourselves.

540
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,280
Quickly! Why are you sitting there?

541
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,360
Take this!

542
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,960
The first championship we won was in Beijing.

543
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,440
The last one is too.

544
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,830
Han Shangyan.

545
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,890
Sorry!

546
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,880
Actually all these years, I've wanted to say sorry!

547
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,410
Today, I finally get the chance to.

548
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,880
That year, when your career was at its peak, we were a burden to you.

549
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,380
If not for us, you would have gone further.

550
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,960
It was because of me.

551
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,620
Ai Qing,

552
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,760
it's all my fault.

555
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,690
Solo, in my heart,

556
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,370
you are the best team captain.

557
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,760

560
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,480
Han Shangyan!

561
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:07,430
<i>Old Han, Solo, you guys are living too luxuriously!</i>

562
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,180
<i>Such a big room!</i>

563
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,270
<i>We can all live here.</i>

564
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:15,660
<i> How is it? Champions need to have the champion's environment.</i>

565
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,720
<i>Take a look inside.</i>

566
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,870
<i>Such a big bed!</i>

567
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,170
<i>The five of us can roll around in it!</i>

568
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,430
<i>Let's go!</i>

569
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,300
<i> Scram, Old Han.</i>

570
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,150
<i>Go look over there, there is still a surprise!</i>

571
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,220
<i>Really?</i>

572
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,440
<i>Wow! There's a kitchen too!</i>

573
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,610
<i>You can cook here.</i>

574
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,180
<i>I'll make dinner later.</i>

575
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,650
<i>Look what I found!</i>

576
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,020
<i>Juice?</i>

577
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,030
<i>Do you want to take a look at the hotel's pricing? It's probably more than outside.</i>

578
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,210
<i>Really?</i>

579
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,370
<i>They're expensive.</i>

580
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,360
<i>20 RMB (~$3) for a bottle! So expensive!</i>

581
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,180
<i> We are champions. Don't scrimp. It's my treat.</i>

582
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,000
<i>No!</i>

583
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,020
<i>Wait.</i>

584
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,590
<i>The three of us can drink one bottle.</i>

585
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,610
<i>Let me see.</i>

586
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:19,180
<i>That way, everyone is about 7 RMB (~$1).</i>

587
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,750
<i>Better!</i>

588
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,400
<i>Let's.</i>

589
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,460
<i>- Cheers!
- Cheers.</i>

590
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:36,330
<i>Say, why does this juice taste better than the ones outside? Is it because it is expensive?</i>

591
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,380
<i> That's in your mind.</i>

592
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,840
<i>Wait until we win national championships,</i>

593
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,210
<i>I'll buy a box and send it to your room.</i>

594
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,260
<i>Besides, we have to also become the national endorser for this juice!</i>

595
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,450
<i>Drink as much as we want.</i>

596
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:51,620
<i>That's right! Wait until we win the national championships, no need to even talk about endorsing this juice.</i>

597
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,400
<i>Shirts, pants, shoes - we can endorse whatever we want, right?</i>

598
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,240
<i>For Old Han's endorsement, cheers!</i>

599
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,990
