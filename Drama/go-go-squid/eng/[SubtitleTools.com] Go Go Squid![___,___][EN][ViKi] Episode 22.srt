Who is this?

31
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,550
In the middle of the night.

32
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,850
It's you.

33
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,130
What's wrong? Did you argue with your girlfriend?

34
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,530
If you argued, staying here all night won't help.

35
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,010
If I hadn't seen your car tonight,

36
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,280
I'd think you were a thief.

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,180
How do you know I'm not?

38
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,580
This building is a young lady's home. I know.

39
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,370
What if I'm familiar with this place and am here to commit a crime with malicious intent?

40
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,840
Careful, careful.

41
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,860
Look at your bad temper. You said some things you didn't mean, right?

42
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,660
Seems you did get in an argument.

43
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,110
Don't worry. I argue with my wife often, too.

44
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,720
When I was young, I was like you.

45
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,660
Every day, I was outside her building. I couldn't sleep.

46
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,030
Do you know why?

47
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,060
I'd wait for her to come out.

48
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,330
You think I was being romantic? That's not it!

49
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,940
I'd wait for her to come out and keep arguing.

50
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,010
An arguing woman gets very intense.

51
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,140
You ignore her to avoid fighting.

52
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,480
But they chase after you to argue.

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,870
They even take out all their past grudges against you.

54
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,440
You say, with such great memories,

55
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,370
they must have scored enough on their entrance exams for the top universities.

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,830
I'm chatting with you. Say something. Reciprocate, okay?

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,930
If you don't have anything else, go back and patrol.

58
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,540
Candy?

59
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,980
Eat more candy and smoke less. Your wife will be delighted.

60
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,450
Why are you up so early?

61
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,320
Boss, aren't you also up very early?

62
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm asking you. Why did you wake up so early?

63
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,020
Yesterday's newest rankings came out, I'm only in 71st place.

64
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,880
Captain is number one again!

65
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,930
I'm scared to see him; I'm afraid he'll say I'm dragging them down.

66
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:32,020
So, I woke up early to watch some of his competition videos and some important global competition videos.

67
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,720
Watch and learn a bit.

68
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,080
A boy worth teaching.

69
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,780
Since you're here, when they wake up, tell them

70
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,550
I need to report to headquarters. I won't be going to the competition next week.

71
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,560
What? You aren't going to next week's competition?

72
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,150
But it has already been officially announced.

73
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,300
What does the announcement have to do with me?

74
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,170
Boss, you don't use Weibo so you don't understand.

75
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,290
They announced using you as an incentive. They said Gun God would make an appearance.

76
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,510
How come I didn't know about this?

77
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,030
The internet is full of deceit.

78
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,510
Also, if you really don't go, many people will be disappointed.

79
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,460
There are many people who are disappointed in me. It doesn't matter if there's one more or less.

80
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,960
I'm leaving.

81
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,730
You really aren't going?

82
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,570
If I were you and had so many fans waiting for me,

83
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,260
I'd go even if there was bad weather!

84
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,310
Competing isn't for fans but for honor.

85
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,050
Understood?

86
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,910
I understand.

87
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,450
Also, this time in Norway, I temporarily won't be using my domestic phone.

88
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,700
If you want to contact me, call my other number.

89
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,300
Okay.

90
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,280
Driver, let's go.

91
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,340
Tong Nian, why'd you come so early?

92
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,600
I have breakfast for everyone.

93
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,000
- Wow, Sister-in-Law, is this all for us?
- 97.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,430
I never knew with Boss gone, you'd be so nice to us.

95
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,990
Truly our real sister-in-law!

96
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,150
Then, I'll bring it in.

97
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,930
You said Boss isn't here? Where'd he go?

98
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,960
- You didn't know?
- No.

99
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,870
Boss left the country today.

100
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,460
He didn't tell me.

101
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,070
- He didn't?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,140
Why is he like that?

103
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,360
We'll still accept breakfast. Thanks, Sister-in-Law.

104
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,100
Come in and sit!

105
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,350
As soon as you get here, you come to eat and drink. Pretty cool.

106
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,470
Where's my money? Pay me back.

107
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,070
Didn't I transfer it to your account already?

108
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,800
Did you transfer enough?

109
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't you know it has increased in value?

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,410
I'm poor and penniless anyway. Say what you want.

111
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,240
Did you give it to the little girl?

112
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,360
Little Bai told me.

113
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,160
Okay, okay.

114
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,250
I forced him to tell me.

115
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,030
A person like you... always worrying about your ex-husband's son.

116
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,340
Wouldn't your new husband be angry?

117
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,330
If you call me "Mom" for one day, I'll be responsible for you until the end.

118
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,350
Look at you now,

119
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,920
not even a trace of a smile.

120
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,330
That's cute.

121
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,400
I was planning to prepare a gift for you,

122
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,680
but there was only ¥700 left in my card.
<i>(~US$100)</i>

123
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,810
So, treating you to a meal is enough.

124
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,270
You didn't deny, so did you really give it to the little girl?

125
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,250
Son, come with me.

126
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,940
Come with me. Did you pay the bill yet?

127
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,750
- Nan Wei did.
- Good, good!

128
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,870
Hurry, come with me first!

129
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,270
Hurry!

130
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,980
Quick, look, look!

131
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,690
These things were the dowry from marrying your dad.

132
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,090
I remember this should be a watch...

133
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,380
No, I saw wrong, it's not.

134
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,620
This one is.

135
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,470
Look, a watch.

136
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,800
And this.

137
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,340
This is an emerald.

138
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,460
Right, this one, too. A whole set; rubies!

139
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,340
These are all worth a lot!

140
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,990
The most important one is this.

141
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,030
Look! This jade bracelet is the family heirloom from my grandma.

142
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,230
I am reluctant to wear it; it's worth a lot!

143
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,930
I'm giving these all to you.

144
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,190
Once my wedding is over, you can go back and use these to propose.

145
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,240
No need. Take it back.

146
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,410
What do you mean?

147
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,570
Do you dislike that these are second hand?

148
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,560
Gemstones aren't afraid of that!

149
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,780
Look! You just don't understand!

150
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,930
I've already said I don't need it.

151
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,760
You were dumped?

152
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,500
No way! My son's so handsome! How could he get dumped?

153
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,530
Could it be... that girl... doesn't like appearances, but likes money?

154
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,030
Stop joking around.

155
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,110
How am I joking?

156
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,970
Look at you! How disappointing.

157
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,610
I'm past forty and have married twice.

158
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,390
You? Almost thirty and can't even secure a girlfriend.

159
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,310
Are you done?

160
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,600
With you like this, how am I supposed to marry in a few days?

161
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,860
You were rebellious since you were young;

162
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,630
causing trouble for me every day.

163
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,100
Now you're great.

164
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,340
I prepared so many surprises that can't be used.

165
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:24,570
Tell me truthfully. Did I really not listen when I was young?

166
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,370
That's not entirely it.

167
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,920
Well, who doesn't have a rebellious stage?

168
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,060
I remember when I was younger and rebelling, I was way worse than you!

169
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,270
After today, you might not get another chance to scold me.

170
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,520
I didn't mean it like that.

171
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,610
Raising you all the way until now,

172
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,200
no matter what people say,

before I close my eyes forever, I'll always be responsible for you.

You're not my birth mother.

175
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,290
When it's time to let go, let go.

176
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,590
People... always have to consider emotions.

177
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,820
I still remember the first time I saw you.

178
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,480
That time, you were...

179
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,260
only this tall.

180
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:36,190
At that time, we were destined to be mother and son forever.

About what?

184
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,290
Talk about that girl. What happened?

185
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,240
How'd she dump you?

186
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,730
Did your bad temper come up again?

187
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,540
But shouldn't your handsome face add some points, too?

188
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,010
I won't attend your wedding. I'm jealous in place of Dad.

189
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,790
What's up with your bad temper? You're really leaving?

190
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,380
Bye-bye.

191
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,160
You really have such a bad temper! You're just going to turn against me like that?

Yes, he's in the office.

Okay, thank you.

Hey, you're here.

201

I need a budget of a million.

202
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,050
The headquarter is out of money.

203
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,680
Your really too biased towards the players in China.

204
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,210
The ones here will get jealous.

205
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,780
You know that we should all remember our roots.

206
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,630
China is our roots.

207
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,820
And the reason I entered this field was because of participating on a Chinese team.

208
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,430
If their results are good,

209
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,380
then China will have the opportunity to get a ticket straight to the Global Finals for the first time.

210
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,190
More importantly, then we will be able to receive lots of prize money.

211
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:30,000
The income from the side businesses can help with the huge operating problems for the club, right?

212
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,690
What you're looking forward to aren't just those things, right?

213
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,440
I understand you. You didn't get first place in the world.

214
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,530
You hope that Wu Bai can fulfill that in your place.

215
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,520
This lot of kids have suffered too many doubts from outsiders and their families.

216
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,910
They aren't playing.

217
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,920
They're training and competing.

218
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,460
What they're doing is a hardworking and honorable profession.

219
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,450
And what I need to do, is to help them prove to the world that they can do it.

I still hope that I can see Chinese teams and individuals on the world's stage.

247
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,670
I have faith that you'll be able to appear in it.

But, Old Han, you have to promise me,

00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,240
you have to get K&K a world champion.

While the past Solo was important,

253
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,390
but now, the friends here are your good brothers.

254
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,370
They helped get you to where you are now.

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,010
Okay, let's not talk about work.

257
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,400
Tell me, where's your girlfriend?

258
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,450
I don't have one.

259
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,550
You were dumped.

260
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,510
- Annoying.
- No.

261
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,270
If you don't tell me, you won't get even ¥1,000,000.

262
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,950
I'm going.

263
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,240
Your 1,000,000 is gone!

264
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,060
You dare?

265
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,800
It's been four days.

266
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,190
I still can't contact him.

267
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,120
Could it be that he got into an accident?

268
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,730
Yaya, nothing will happen. Right?

269
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,620
No, if something happened to him, it would be all over the news. Don't worry.

270
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,550
He's a big shot in the industry. Lots of people are watching him.

271
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,660
If you say it like that, why do I feel more scared?

272
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,140
Is he mad at me?

273
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,240
Say, do you think it's because of the cat, or because of the group photo?

274
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,770
I don't know.

275
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,510
Look at his attitude towards Mi Shaofei and Ou Qiang.

276
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,900
He wouldn't reject his brotherss from before, so taking a group photo shouldn't be a problem.

277
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,810
About the cat...

278
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,090
He's a man but may not be able to handle the little kitty.

279
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,040
Even more, he's a big man.

280
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,360
Right now, it's daytime where he is.

281
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,120
He should be working in the daytime.

282
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,790
But why would his phone be off during work?

283
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,550
Why would he turn it off?

284
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,060
He's definitely mad at me, right?

285
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,220
Did he get mad at me?

286
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,620
He must be mad at me... what to do?

287
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,240
He must be mad at me, no doubt!

288
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,500
Hello?

289
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,600
<i>Your cat has diarrhea.</i>

290
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,200

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,800
<i>Demo's mom wants to take him away,</i>

292
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,600
she won't let him compete anymore.

293
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,200
Tomorrow is Auntie's wedding, right?

294
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,400
Yes.

295
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,400
If you come back tomorrow, you'll make it to SP's group competition.

296
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,500
Depends on my mood.

297
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,400
I'm done.

298
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,900
<i>Hold on.</i>

299
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Is Grandpa... doing well?

300
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,100
He's fine. <i>I'm hanging up if there's nothing else.</i>

301
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,300
Can't you understand "hold on?"

302
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,600
Um...

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,400
Has Tong Nian come to find me?

304
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,200
- It's Boss, hurry.
- Hurry.

305
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,400
She has. <i>She has.</i>

306
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,100
<i>The day you left, she came and even brought us breakfast.</i>

307
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,000
<i>Seriously though, Boss. You left without even telling Sister-in-Law; so inconsiderate!</i>

308
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,600
Boss, you care way too less.

309
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,700
Who let you put me on speaker, Wu Bai?

310
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,600
Why do you keep petting my cat?

311
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,700
Why don't you raise one yourself?

312
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,800
He doesn't even care about his own wife?

313
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,400
Originally, he did.

314
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,400
- Once you say something, he doesn't dare care anymore.
- Wait,

315
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,100
Boss is too boring.

316
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,800
Old men get embarrassed? Seriously.

317
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
- Boring.
- Let's go, let's go!

318
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,800
When do you prepare to leave?

319
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,100
To where?

320
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,400
You can't sleep here, can you?

321
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,800
What's wrong with me sitting a bit longer?

322
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,700
I booked a room next door.

323
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,400
You won't go home to sleep. Why sleep in a hotel?

324
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,300
You are now part of my maiden family.

325
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,400
What's wrong with staying with my maiden family?

326
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,200
Plus, you're in this room. I'm next door.

327
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,400
It's the same as being sent off from my maiden family.

328
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,800
My husband is picking me up for the wedding tomorrow anyway.

329
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,400
Contentious.

330
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,900
Han Shangyan, ever since you became my son,

331
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,300
I've raised you for nine whole years.

332
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,600
It was also your most rebellious nine years.

333
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,400
This movie is currently showing a young lady

334
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,800
raising a kid herself.

335
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,600
Seeing this scene, it makes me think of

336
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,500
the days when we depended on each other for survival.

337
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,000
If you want something, say it. I'll put it on my tab.

338
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,900
Next month, I'll be getting a bonus. I'll buy it for you.

339
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,000
Forget it.

340
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
The necklace was bought as a dowry.

341
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,800
Look at it now. I don't even know who got the necklace.

342
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't even know what she looks like.

343
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,400
You really haven't taken a photo with her?

344
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,100
Then, you must feel very wronged.

345
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,800
I really don't know what the person in my son's heart looks like.

346
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,600
Hey, where are you going?

347
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm going to sleep.

This is the kind I like.

350
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,700
I just want to make sure you saw that drawing.

351
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,900
This one?

352
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,700
My drawing skills aren't great,

353
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,800
I don't know if you can see her clearly.

354
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,400
I guess I can.

355
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,600
From this drawing, I can see the girl has a smile on her face.

356
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,800
I can tell she's a beautiful girl with a caring heart.

357
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,000
My son has good taste.

358
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,300
I'll attend your wedding tomorrow, but I won't go to the after-party.

359
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,700
I have to catch a plane ride.

360
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,600
Are you putting in minimal effort with me?

361
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,000
No.

362
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,800
I have a close friend competing in China. I have to go back and watch him.

363
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,000
It's really not because of me?

364
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You think too much.

365
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,600
I'm sleeping.

366
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,700

I'll pick it up for you.

Don't! I'll do it myself. I'll do it myself.

- Hello?
- Hello.

377
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,900
I am Jiaodong University's security guard; the front gate security guard.

378
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,300
There's a girl around ten years old saying she's here to find her sister.

379
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,200
She's wearing jeans.

<i>Vinyl shoes. She's wearing a backpack and a hat.</i>

381
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,400
<i>She said she's called Little Ai. Do you know her?</i>

382
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,560
I do know her. Please tell her to wait for me for a bit.

383
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,800
I will come now to pick her up. Thank you.

384

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
You'll know once we get there.

387
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,850
Let's go.

388
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,500
- Hello. I am the one who was on the phone just now.
- Hello.

389
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,700
Sorry for the trouble. We'll take her now.

390
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,200
No trouble. I was just a bit worried.

391
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,400
Since you know each other,

392
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,500
then I can pass her on to you.

393
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,300
- Okay.
- It's just that both of you are Jiaodong University's students.

394
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,400
Did you bring your student ID?

395
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,700
This is mine. Here.

396
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,100
- I'll record it down.
- Okay.

397
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,400
Came to find me?

00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,200
<i>You came by yourself? Does your family know?</i>

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,400
It's quite cold outside. How about we talk in the dorms?

401
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,300
Sounds good.

402
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,100
- Here, your student ID. I'll hand her over to you.
- Thank you.

403
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,700
Sounds good. Sorry for the trouble.

404
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,400
- No problem.
- Let's go.

405
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,600
- Bye!
- Bye!

406
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,300
That way, that way.

00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,000

What?

412
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,800
What's wrong?

413
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,000
She... is really Solo's daughter?

414
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,300
Yes, but I can't explain too much right now.

415
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,000
I will tell you in detail tonight. Right now, we must think of a way to send her away as our priority.

416
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,900
No, no, no.

417
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,300
What now?

418
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,800
Are her ears—

419
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,200
She is wearing a hearing aid. She can technically hear us.

420
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,700
She ignored us earlier... She was probably just being willful.

421
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,100
Why aren't you guys coming in?

422
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,400
- We'll go in... go in...
- Go in...

423
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,300

<i>She is probably hungry.</i>

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,000
Okay! Okay! Little Ai is probably hungry. Right, Little Ai? What do you want to eat?

429
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,600
<i>She probably has something to say to me individually.</i>

430
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
Then I will...

431
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,500
- Check it out and randomly buy some.
- Randomly buy some.

432
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,400
- Okay. You guys talk.
- Go ahead.

Don't you have my Wechat?

434
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,700
Why didn't you send me a message before you came by yourself?

435
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,400
I wasn't happy, so I came to find you.

436
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,000
If I told you ahead of time, you wouldn't have let me come.

437
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,200
Why did you want to come and find me?

438
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,000
I wanted you to help me with something.

439
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,050
You need my help?

440
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,100
Han Shangyan is my mom's boss.

441
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,400
Make Han Shangyan transfer my mom back.

442
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,500
Why? Don't you want to see your mom?

443
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Now that I've seen her, it's no longer a novelty. I'm hoping she will leave soon.

444
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,300
Her presence has disturbed my dad's life.

445
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,100
Disturbed your dad's life?

446
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,800
Didn't your mom already re-marry?

447
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,100
Do you think your mom wants to get back together with your dad?

448
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,600
She wants to take me away!

449
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,100
That's seriously disturbing my dad's life!

450
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Then, Han Shangyan's power isn't as strong as you think.

451
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,200
You should just directly say you can't handle Han Shangyan.

452
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,500
How could I not?

453
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Forget it. Han Shangyan's temper is so bad.

454
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,100
My dad's is much better. Consider my dad.

455
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,900
- What?!
- What?

456
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,600
In term's of CTF rankings, my dad's isn't that much worse than Han Shangyan's.

457
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,900
Besides, my dad is much more handsome than Han Shangyan.

458
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,400
Your dad– What kind of eyesight do you have?

459
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,000
Clearly, it's Han Shangyan that's more handsome.

460
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,500
What eyesight do YOU have? Clearly my dad's more handsome.

461
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,000
Your dad– Your dad is like this.

462
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,700
Han Shangyan's face is always like this every day.

463
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,900
- Your-Your dad has a big head.
- Han Shangyan's temperament is worse!

464
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,400
Your dad's leg is-is shorter than Han Shangyan's by a half.

465
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,600
Han Shangyan's feet stink!

466
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,500
- How would you know if his feet stink?
- I heard!

467
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,600
Who said?

468
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,800
You– Don't care about who said it. The fact is that it stinks! Han Shangyan's feet stink!

469
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,200
- My Han Shangyan's feet stink! No! They don't stink!
- Han Shangyan's feet stink!

470
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,500
- Your dad's feet stink!
- Have you smelled them?

471
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,300
I-I...

472
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,600
I'm back! I bought a lot of good stuff.

473
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,400
You're finally back.

474
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,800
Little Ai must've been starving.

475
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,900
I don't know what you like so I bought a little of everything.

476
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,500
There's Kentucky Fried Chicken, bread, pan fried buns, shaomai <i>(Chinese dumplings)</i>...

477
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,200
I was afraid you wouldn't like savory so I bought a lot of cakes, too. Take a look and see what you like to eat.

478
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,800
- What's wrong?
- Wait!

479
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,500
Little Ai, look. Yaya and I specially went to buy this after class.

480
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,100
"You guys," how do you plan to take care of it?

481
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,900
I don't know. I called Han Shangyan but he didn't pick up.

482
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,000
It's been a few days since we've talked. What should I do?

483
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Seeing it's like this, he probably got into a fight with Solo.

484
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,900
What about this? You call Mi Shaofei

485
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,000
and ask him to tell Solo to come and pick her up.

486
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,700
I don't think that will work. With rebellious kids, we cannot do things by force.

487
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,900
But we should let her dad know first.

488
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,400
There's an SP competition tomorrow.

489
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,700
I'll think of a way to get tickets and bring Little Ai there.

490
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,700
After the competition, they'll mend their relationship.

491
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Tonight, let's let her stay here to calm down.

492
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,800
It's not a big deal. We don't have to make it even more serious.

493
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,100
Okay, let's go with your plan.

494
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,600
He is on the way back.

495
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,400
He's back. He's back.

496
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,200
Okay, okay. Idol, I'll pass the phone to Nian Nian.

497
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,800
Okay.

498
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,300
We found her.

499
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,000
Hello, this is Solo.

500
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
<i>Hello, Solo.</i>

501
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,800
I'm Tong Nian, Han Shangyan's... friend.

502
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,600
I know. Is Little Ai with you right now? I can't find her anywhere.

503
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,000
<i>Yes, she's with me. Don't worry.</i>

504
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,700
How about this? Tomorrow, I'll bring her to the competition arena and safely hand her back to you.

505
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,700
<i>Just let her stay with us tonight, okay?</i>

506
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,600
Okay, thank you, Tong Nian.

507
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,800
No problem.

508
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,400
<i>Right...</i> She... She's okay, right?

509
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,800
She's fine. Everything is okay. Don't worry.

510
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Sister Tong Nian,

511
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,600
Han Shangyan's temper is so bad. What do you like about him?

512
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,400
No, it's not.  Everything about him is good. I like everything about him.

513
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,810
You're looking through rose-colored glasses!

514
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
How about you consider my dad?

515
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,300
Forget it. I don't like him. Thanks.

516
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:53,000
Uh, Little Ai, have you considered that your dad probably likes someone who's got gaming skills?

517
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,200
Who said that my dad likes someone with gaming skills?

518
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,000
On this point, I must really debate this out with you.

519
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,500
Wait! What do you want? What are you doing?

520
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,200
What do you want?! Harassment! Help me!

521
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,800
Don't move! My hearing aid is really expensive.

522
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,900
I-I was wrong, okay?

523
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,600
I-I'll stand on your side, okay?

524
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,000
Hey, Yaya! You betrayed me so fast!

525
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,600

526
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,400
Uh, let me say Nian Nian doesn't like handsome men.

527
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Then Han Shangyan...?

528
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,200
He... He's an ugly monster.

529
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,700
You're an ugly monster! How is he ugly!? He's so handsome!

530
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,200
You... You're four-eyed! Four-eyed frog!

531
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Uh... I was wrong.

532
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,000
Sister Yaya!

533
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,600
So... right now you and me are on the same side then!

534
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,000
I– This...

535
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,600
When Uncle Mi first came to Shanghai, he was living at my house.

536
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,400
Whatever question you have, ask away.

537
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,800
I... I don't have anything I want to ask...

538
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,000
Really?

539
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
- For real?
- Really!

540
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,700
Okay, enough! Sleep. Let's sleep. Go. Sleep.

541
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,800
Just sleep over there! It's pretty good!

542
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,520
You can also ask about matters related to Uncle Mi!

543
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,600
Really?

544
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Really real! Let's sleep!

545
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,700
- What are you guys doing?
- Time to sleep.

What's up?

550
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,500
I can't find you if I don't want something from you?

551
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
Nervous?

552
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,800
Nervous about what?

553
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,700
It's the last battle in the group competition.

554
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,400
The next one will be the quarterfinals.

555
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,900
Didn't we qualify early? What's there to be nervous about?

556
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,550
Has Solo talked with you?

557
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,200
In my heart, I keep feeling unsettled.

558
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
What are you unsettled about?

559
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,100
Don't be so fussy. Just say it directly.

560
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,900
I heard rumors that Team Two's captain Fu Ying is preparing to be promoted.

561
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,100
That also means that on our team, someone may be getting dismissed.

562
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,600
Isn't that great?

563
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,000
So, I...

564
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,600
You're afraid they're going to swap me out?

565
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,400
I didn't mean that!

566
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,400
It's possible the one being dismissed is me!

567
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,370
Bro, let me tell you something from the heart.

568
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,000
Say it.

569
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,120
Back then, the five of us were the strongest.

570
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,000
But I never expected that now I would be the worst!

571
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,800
It's the most embarrassing thing in the world!

572
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,500
I'm telling you! If I get swapped out, it doesn't matter!

573
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,100
At least I won't have people talking behind my back saying that I was relying on Solo!

574
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,000
What crazy things are you saying?

575
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,800
If you say stuff like that again, I'm going to be mad!

It's nothing. I'm here!

581
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,600
I'll help you. We will win for sure.

582
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,400
Okay, we'll win a big one tomorrow!

583
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,000

Doesn't my dad have a secretary? Why are you bringing us the tickets?

Your dad's secretary has other things to do.

594
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,700
She doesn't usually come to the competition.

These are three VIP tickets in the same row. It will be more convenient for you guys to sit together.

He's not coming today. Did he not tell you?

599
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,300
I know he went abroad. I was just asking again.

600
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,600
He might be too busy.

00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,000
Today, we are competing. It's not K&K's matches.

602
