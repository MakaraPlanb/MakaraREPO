22
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,880
I said that Solo's teaching had problems. You should have brought her back long ago and taught her yourself.

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,780
There's no problem!

24
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,130
You and your mom might have a bad relationship, but towards an elder, you at least have to have some respect.

25
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,100
Did your dad not teach you this?

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,260
Proves that your dad isn't a competent dad.

27
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,610
Where was I not respectful? Where?

28
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,720
I'll go then.

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,320
You said it! That's settled then.

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,870
You have to accompany us, too.

31
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,310
Okay. In ten minutes, see you downstairs.

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,670
Han Shangyan, you fraud!

33
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,120
Han Shangyan? Why did we come here?

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,840
Wait for me.

35
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,240
I've finished the software.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,660
It's best to test it on your computer.

37
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,000
When connected online, you'll be able to see everyone's results.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,510
That fast?

39
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,890
It wasn't that difficult anyway.

40
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,980
Do you want to come with us to play?

41
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,380
- Go where to play?
- To the amusement park.

42
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,220
Amusement park?

43
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,810
Let’s go together.

44
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,710
Is it appropriate to go with you guys?

45
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,730
Do like kids?

46
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,040
Then it’s appropriate. Get in the car.

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,450
Who would ride this?

51
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,410
Why are you scared of him?

52
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,890
You don’t understand?

53
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,190
That's not it. I didn't process it earlier. I get it now.

54
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,770
I’m not scared of him. I am... Forget it. You’re too young.

55
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,420
If I tell you, you wouldn’t understand either.

56
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,720
Isn't it just dating? What's so complicated?

57
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,280
How old are you?

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,820
In any case, I'm younger than you.

59
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,310
Say, for guys like Han Shangyan,

60
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,620
besides being a bit handsome, they don't have any good traits.

61
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,960
He's full of shortcomings. What is there to like?

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
How does he not have good traits?

63
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,230
He's full of good traits. He has so many good traits!

64
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,960
Fine, Number One Fangirl.

65
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,870
Go ride a boat. I'll give you guys some time alone.

66
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,050
Gun God! Go buy the boat tickets!

67
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,620
Why aren’t you going yourself?

68
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,030
You're taking care of guests! Of course, you're going!

69
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,960
We're riding boats later?

70
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,770
Go ahead and buy them.

71
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,490
Worried about her? Ten years ago, you gave up once.

72
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,710
Ten years later, you’ve thought of a way?

73
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,000
I've always liked running away from things.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,300
So, I couldn't become a professional player.

75
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,490
Unlike you guys, who run towards the target;

76
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,590
never giving up.

77
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,860
To Little Ai, me abandoning her has caused great harm.

78
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,390
I don't know how to make it up to her.

79
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,400
I only believe in doing it or not doing it.

80
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,670
I don't think about whether I can do it.

81
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:03,910
If you don't do it, then you have nothing. Isn't that so?

83

Why are we so far away?

85
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,790
Yours is too crowded!

86
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,740

Don’t you young girls all like to take pictures and put it on Moments?

89

I’ll help you take pictures.

90
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,960
I don’t need it. I usually don't post these things.

91
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,310
How about I’ll help you take a picture? My photography skills are very good.

92
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,840
No need.

93
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,860

Han Shangyan!

95
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,650
Delete the photo! Did you hear me?

96
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,290
You wish! I need to send it to my Moments!

97
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,710
You dare? You don't think I'll throw you into the river once we reach the shore?

98
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,340
This is too dangerous!

99
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,550
It's too dangerous. Too dangerous.

100
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,460
Are you still taking pictures?

101
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,430
Don't think I'll beat you up once we're on the shore?

102
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,090
I'll beat you up till your dad can't even recognize you!

103
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,880
Why are you laughing?

104
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,790
Take it slow. Take it slow.

105
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,830
Give me your phone! Do you understand photo rights?

106
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,390
Do you understand privacy rights? Going through a person's phone!

107
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,220
You are already 30, Gun God.

108

Crow's feet, forehead wrinkles, age spots: you have them all!

109
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,990
There's nothing worth photographing!

110
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Why do I feel like I've taken two kids out for dinner?

111
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,200
Are you guys hungry? What do you guys want to eat?

112
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,090
I’m good with anything. Whatever you eat, I’ll eat the same.

113
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,510
What if I’m not eating?

114
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,650
If you don't want to eat, remove your unpleasant presence!

115
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,020
Who's an unpleasant presence?

116
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,220
When I go and buy good food, don't pester me for any!

117
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,460
What are you trying to strut?

118
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,600
You're extremely inferior to my dad!

119
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,540
You were born with a golden spoon and enjoy bragging about yourself!

120
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,630
You're a hypocrite who claims to work hard and endure hardships.

121
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,000
My dad is a true person who started from scratch!

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,130
Pieced together from the remote valleys!

123
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,360
You're a prime example of someone who brags about Solo!

124
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,180
Enough. I’m hungry. Go buy it.

125
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,860
- Any dietary restrictions?
- I don't have any.

126
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,090

Is your stomach hurting?

133
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,770
I don’t need you to care. If my stomach hurts every month, are you going to care every month?

00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,840
How about this? I’ll let you play one round.

172
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,280
If your score is higher than mine, I’ll buy you water.

173
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,590
If your score is worse, you buy for me.

174
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,140
Easy. Watch how I'll kill you.

175
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,710
You're cheating! This speed is too fast!

176
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,540
Your skills are not that good and you feel exasperated?

177
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,920
That's because you were cheating!

178
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,020
Watch carefully.

179
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,790
You play it every day; of course, I can’t beat you.

180
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,900
Why are you messing around now?

181
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,960
I can still win you by playing with one hand.

182
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,200
Look. Just a bit of effort and my score's higher than yours.

183
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,630
Sister Tong Nian, why do you like a jerk?

184
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,590
Don’t talk nonsense.

185
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,840
Han Shangyan, enough.

186
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,600
Little Ai, you can play against anyone, yet you choose Gun God?

187
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,240
Your dad can’t even defeat him.

188
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,050
Can you let me try?

189
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,590
You know how?

190
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,960
Everyone in the world knows how. Don't look down on others.

191
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,360
I may be a gaming idiot but I do know how to play this and Minesweeper.

192
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,110
Thank you. Look.

193
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,050
Sister Tong Nian, fighting! Fighting! Keep it up!

194
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,250
Fighting! Keep it up! Beat him!

195
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,530
Han Shangyan, she really isn't worse than you.

196
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

197
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,850
- My score could've been higher.
- So close.

198
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,550
Your score is higher than mine and you're still not content.

199
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,740
Is my score higher than yours?

200
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,590
Sister Tong Nian, we exceeded Gun God!

201
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,330
How amazing!

202
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,320
I didn't know you had that skill.

203
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,890
If there is time, we should swap pointers.

204
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,110
When? I can do it anytime.

205
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,410
Sister Tong Nian, you’re so amazing.

206
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,460
Tong Nian, really. No one's ever won over him.

207
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,380
He met a competitor this time.

208
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,100
Nian God, let's go eat rice cakes.
<i>(T/N: Rice cakes is "nian gao")</i>

209
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,990
Let's go.

210
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,200
Tong Nian's parents raised her so well.

211
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,570
Girls should be like this.

212
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,070
Pure without any hidden intentions.

213
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,530
She is bright every day.

214
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,530
An annoying kid...

215
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,010
You should stop being so stubborn.

216
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,990
You don't want to develop your relationship with her?

217
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,190
Are you envying her?

218
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,960
Little Ai, wake up.

219
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,190
Time to get off the car.

220
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,930
We're here.

221
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,800
So soft and squishy. Really cute!

222
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,550
That's harassment!

223
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,830
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

224
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,220
Remember to go on WeChat when you have time and we can play!

225
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,700
How old are you? I'm not going to play with you.

226
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,000
Remember to do your homework.

227
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Remember to go on my Moments to see the picture of you two.

228
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,350
Bye-bye.

229
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,070
<i>I love the expression of a sudden photo.</i>

230
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,170
<i>Big fool and little adorable girl.</i>

231
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,810
<i>Do you guys know who the big fool is?</i>

232
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,920
Your debt from when my dad picked you up at the train station back then has been repaid.

233
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,200
There's also the debt of taking you into the industry, taking you to win the championship, we will work on those later on.

234
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,870
Also, don't give my dad the sour face so much in the future.

235
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,930
Bye-bye!

236
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,360
I'm so tired.

237
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,490
Send you back to school?

238
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,870
But I haven't shown the software to you yet.

239
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,520
We didn't complete anything today and you haven't seen the software.

240
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,930
How long will the testing take?

241
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,090
It can be done in about one hour.

242
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,000
After it's done, I can go home by myself.

243
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,490
Sure.

244
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,640
<i>[SP Gaming]</i>

245
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,570
What'd you just say? Headquarters want to switch members?

246
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,410
Little Mi's individual world ranking match results were not ideal. That is the main reason.

247
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,850
Also, since he joined Team SP,

248
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,330
his individual ranking in China is also very low.

249
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,820
It's understandable that HQ did that. But I have a request.

250
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,520
You say it.

251
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,780
Opportunity. I need an opportunity to strive for it again.

252
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,700
Before the quarter-final competition, we will go to Sanya to participate in the elite training camp.

253
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,910
This may be his last opportunity.

254
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,560
If his ranking cannot raise up to the country's Top Ten,

255
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,270
he will be removed from Team One.

256
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,100
<i>- Walk faster!
- If you keep pushing, I will not forgive you!</i>

257
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,760
Guess who came.

258
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,470
I came.

259
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,140
Stop messing around! Your dear daughter is here!

260
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,390
You're back?

261
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,700
Dad!

262
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,140
Guess what I brought you.

263
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,120
You brought me presents?

264
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,910
Not presents, it’s this.

265
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,890
Han Shangyan? Let me see.

266
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,970
Tell me. Who's the nicest person in the world to you?

267
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,350
Of course, it’s you.

268
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,150
Look, look. There’s more.

269
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,480
Did you have fun today?

270
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,730
Who bought you the presents?

271
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,410
Mom bought them.

272
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,500
Happy Valley.

273
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,460
This is what haunts Old Han.

274
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,590
Han Shangyan can never beat this dungeon because he's...

275
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,790
scared of heights!

276
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,230
This one, still remember?

277
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,880
That time, we pushed Old Han onto that ride.

278
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,970
And then when we weren't looking, he ran off.

279
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,920
Look at his expression!

280
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,610
This one.

281
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,200
This, this, this.

282
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,210
There are three computers here, each one is connected to the internet and has no password.

283
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,300
You can use whichever one you want.

284
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,200
After an hour, I will come and find you.

285
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,600
Can I go with you? Wherever you go, I'll go. Can I just do it next to you?

286
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,700
Go with me?

287
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,900
You mean... you want to go to my room?

288
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,200
Your room?

289
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,800
My plan was to use ten minutes to shower and use fifty minutes to sleep.

290
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,600
You still want to go?

291
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,000
No need, I'll just stay here and wait for you. You go do what you need to do.

292
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,200
- You really won't go?
- I really won't. I'll just wait here for you.

293
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,600
<i>[Start]
[Click when the color changes]</i>

294
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,840
<i>[Click]
[Tries:3 of 18]</i>

295
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,900
That... my software is done, you can take a look over here.

296
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,200
I made a color-changing one, to test APM.
<i> (T/N: actions per minute)</i>

297
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,600
Another one is a game about hitting little pigs.

298
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,100
I made two. I feel that when they are bored, they can play it on rotation.

299
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,900
They won't be as bored, and they can also train their APM.

300
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,600
They train APM as part of their training, not to play games.

301
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,400
Ah... training.

302
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,200
Little Bai, the software he talked about, I went home and searched it up.

303
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,300
According to the software he talked about...

304
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,350
According to that software he talked about, I made a few models.

305
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,910
I thought that these two models were easier and simpler.

306
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,800
You guys can try them out.

307
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,400
1.002 seconds?

308
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,100
The worst score, really could only be yours.

309
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,840
That... y-you can try it out.

310
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,100
Y-You can try it out.

311
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,200
0.102 seconds?

312
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,800
So... So fast.

313
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,600
You must be thirsty. We don't have other drinks, just this.

314
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,500
This is alcohol...

315
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,000
Little kids can't drink alcohol. Then I'll change it to water for you.

316
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
I'm not a little kid. I can drink it.

317
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,400
The percentage is only 3.

318
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,500
It should be almost the same as water.

319
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,670
It doesn't taste good?

320
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,400
It tastes good.

321
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm so hot.

322
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,060
Hot?

323
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
I've turned the air conditioning on already.

324
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,120
Or...

325
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,600
Feel it. Isn't my face really hot?

326
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,900
You... what are you doing?

327
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,300
This software... do you like it?

328
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,600
I...

329
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,500
Are you drunk?

330
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,610
Do you only have this to say to me?

331
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,800
You don't have anything else to say to me?

332
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,900
- What do I say?
- Say...

333
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:00,300
For example... you... do you like this software?

334
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,290
That day, when it was raining, I went to pick you up.

335
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,600
I helped you make software.

336
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,300
Are you not going to say that you like it?

337
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,700
You... answer my questions.

338
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,800
Don't be so touchy with me.

339
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,400
Okay. I like your software.

340
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,230
I won't be touchy with you.

341
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,000
Can you please not get too close to me?

342
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Okay!

343
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,900
Then, I won't be so touchy with you either.

344
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,300
Tong Nian,

345
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,100
I am going to go find a few people to help you test out your software, okay?

346
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,850
I'm going then.

347
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,140
You sit here and wait for me.

348
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,600
Where are you going?

349
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,400
What are you doing?

350
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,200
Boss! We brought some desserts for Sister-in-Law. Do you guys want to eat some?

351
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,000
Loosen your hands first.

352
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm so dizzy.

353
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,600
I'll go and get some food for you to eat.

354
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,100
No. I don't want to eat.

355
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,100
Let them be alone for a while. Let's go.

356
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,400
Then, I'll give you a present.

357
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,400
Really?

358
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,200
Really.

359
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,000
Loosen your hands first, then I can get your present.

361
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,470
Wait for me here.

362
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Get in here quickly!

363
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,400
Tong Nian. Tong Nian!

364
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,000
Tong Nian.

365
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,000
You cannot lay on the bed. Later, if people see, they will misunderstand. What will we do then?

366
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Geez!

367
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,600
- Go to the sofa! Go sit on the sofa for a bit.
- Let me sleep for a bit.

368
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,600
Sit on the sofa for a bit.

369
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Puzzle!

370
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,000
No, no! You can't touch that!

371
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
Yes.

372
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,800
Why don't you turn on the light?

373
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,500
You... You're not thinking about doing something to me, are you?!

374
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,000
You can't!

375
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,380
I'll go turn on the lights for you.

376
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,200
Be good and sit here for me.

377
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,900
Do not go anywhere, do not touch anything. Do you hear me?

378
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,500
Is this for me?

379
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
So pretty.

380
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,900
Tong Nian, put that down. Tong Nian!

381
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,800
Okay, okay. It's for you, for you. Hurry, take it off.

382
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,600
Thank you. I like this.

383
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
It’s so pretty.

384
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,400
Thank you.

385
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,900
Tong Nian.

386
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,800
Tong Nian?

387
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,400
Tong Nian? Stop sleeping.

388
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,700
Where is your phone?

389
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,600
Call your friends and tell them to pick you up.

390
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Why is the door not closed?

391
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,400
Let’s go take a look.

392
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Sister-in-Law?

393
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
- Boss?
- Boss?

394
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,800
Hello?

395
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,200
- Go, go, go.
- Quieter!

396
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,800
Where are they?

397
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,300
They drank beer.

398
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Do you understand? Drinking means pleasant feelings.

399
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,600
Drinking allows feelings to advance with leaps and bounds.

400
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,200
So, Boss and she are at...

401
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Not here, so for sure in Boss’s room.

402
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:59,300
Boss hasn't dated in a long time, but I didn't think that he would make this much progress when he does.

403
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,400
What are you guys doing?

404
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,390
Go! Go! Go!

405
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,600
No.

406
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,800
No... we just finished practicing and were going to wash up.

407
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,310
Right.

408
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,260
You guys were going to Door Four's guest room to shower?

409
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,300
We forgot to take something.

410
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,800
- Right! Forgot to get something.
- Right!

411
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,100
Right, right, right.

412
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,000
Since you're all so bored right now, then you can give a mental report.

413
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,900
No...

414
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,300
Grunt, you first.

415
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,600
Me?

416
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,200
Boss, right now, I’ve read so many books—

417
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,500
Grunt, have you dated before or not?

418
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,780
Let me tell you that your private life is very complicated right now.

419
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
The team manager has already put your name on file so you better be careful.

420
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,600
I do not allow public dating, understand?

421
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,500
I understand.

422
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,900
I understand, Boss.

423
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,500
97.

424
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,900
When are you planning on dating?

425
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,600
What?

426
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,700
Your mom has come to find me many times.

427
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,300
If you don't date, she is going to bring a blind date to the club for you, do you know?

428
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,220
No, didn't you say no dating is allowed in the club?

429
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,300
How come your perspective is different now?

430
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,900
I said no public dating, I didn’t say you can’t date.

431
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,200
Be straightforward. When are you going to?

432
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,190
Boss, how am I supposed to be accurate?

433
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,600
I only go back home on Chinese New Year, I spend all the other holidays here at the club.

434
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,200
Don't mention girlfriends...

435
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
I can’t even see a girl.

436
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,500
Wait, I have seen girls. Other than One's mom, Auntie Zhao, who cleans for us, there's also our married team manager.

437
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,400
What can I do?

438
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,900
What nonsense is that? Set a goal!

439
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,300
Boss, then can I also...

440
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,800
that...

441
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,400
You... too young. You can’t.

442
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,200
Why are things different for me?

443
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,300
How am I young? I’m not young at all.

444
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,100
You don't have to worry about me. My mom's always been matchmaking for me.

445
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,900
Boss, you and Sister-in-Law...

446
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,300
Did something happen? You're suddenly bringing up dating... Did you two–

447
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,300
What does it have to do with you?

448
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,400
Didn’t you guys say you're going to take a shower?

449
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Still not going?

450
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,000
- Yes, a shower.
- Bye-bye, Boss.

451
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,600
This door breaks so easily.

452
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Oh right, Boss. Don't drink too much alcohol.

453
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,900
- Nothing, nothing.
- So awkward.

454
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,800
