I just wanted to celebrate with him earlier,

I have never understood.

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,920
How come between me and Solo,

71
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,840
you chose him?

72
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,530
You want to hear the truth?

73
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,010
Yes.

74
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,760
Of the five, the two of us are most similar.

75
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,900
We've only been on Team Solo.

76
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,760
And we only recognize Solo as the team captain.

77
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,790
We also retired together.

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,060
To me, Solo is not just a person.

79
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,120
He represents a spirit, a symbol.

80
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,980
He is the beginning of my dream.

81
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,730
Han Shangyan, you should understand what I mean the most.

82
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,490
I know that the team disbanded because of Solo and Ai Qing.

83
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,800
But Han Shangyan, just because they did one thing wrong doesn't mean you can take the two of them and crucify them,

84
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
and have them repent to you forever!

170
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:48,380
Listen. This is the first time you guys are representing China.

171
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,060
At the arena, you can lose to our opponents because your skills are inferior to them.

172
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,390
But you can not give up before the competition is over. Understand?

173
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,330
Understood, Boss.

174
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,470
Wu Bai, as the team captain, do you have anything to say?

175
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,440
This time we aren't competing for ourselves, it's for China.

176
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,860
We're competing to let the whole world know the reputation of the CTF circle.

177
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,150
Come. Let's cheer.

178
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,680
Go!

179
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,020
Team China. Let's go!

180
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,280
<i>As network security is developing by leaps and bounds at the moment,</i>

181
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,720
<i>the matter of cybersecurity is becoming increasingly serious.</i>

182
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,450
<i>Today, top players in cybersecurity competitions coming from all over the world</i>

183
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,690
<i>representing their own countries,</i>

184
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,700
<i>will contend for the title of National Cyberpower.</i>

185
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:56,020
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the CTF All-Star One-on-One Invitational Live Show in downtown Norway.

186
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:03,660
Today, the 50 best players from 34 countries will compete for the superstar in a CTF World Hall of Fame.

187
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,100
- Good to see you again.
- Nice to meet you, Archie.

188
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,670
Welcome everyone to our CTF All-Star Individual Invitational Competition.

189
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,970
I'm your commentator, KK.

190
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,270
At our right side is our English fluent commentator, Archie.

191
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,700
On our left is the beautiful commentator you guys are familiar with. Let's hear her introduction!

192
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,630
Hello, everyone. I am the commentator for today, Grace.

193
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:29,700
Yes. Today, there will be 50 contestants from the top 34 countries in the world.

194
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,780
<i>They're competing in this arena for individual wins.</i>

195
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,210
<i> The winner will immediately enter our CTF World Hall of Fame. </i>

196
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,670
We will first begin the random selection match. Competitors, please pick up your phones.

197
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,270
<i> Press the start key to choose your opponent. </i>

198
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,900
<i>And over here on the screen we can see the competitors are being shuffled.</i>

199
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,100
<i> This side, I also want to ask one of our co-workers, our English fluent, Archie. </i>

200
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,040
<i>Which players are you projecting to do well?</i>

201
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,430
It's hard to say. We've got great competitions every year.

202
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,450
We've got DT from China. We've got Naya from Norway.

203
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,430
Two of the best players in the world as well. Let's see what happens.

204
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:10,980
We see that Archie is watching DT from China.

205
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,280
But to DT, today's competition might be very difficult for him.

206
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,000
That's right. Whoever they match up with will not be an easy match.

207

<i>[ICER (France) vs LNIN (China)]</i>

211
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,690
Little Mi's opponent is pretty strong.

212
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,060
<i>[ALL (China) vs PLAY (Columbia)]</i>
Little Mi might be in trouble.

213
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,530
<i>[Little Mi (China) vs NAYA (Norway)]</i>

214
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,420
Okay.

215
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,690
Little Mi vs Naya?

216
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,870
- Relax.
- Stay calm.

217
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,450
I'm telling you to relax! It hurts!

218
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,290
What are you two doing? Be quiet.

219
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,140
Look.

220
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,450
Meeting your opponent, you must not take it lightly. Your opponent is quite strong.

221
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,850
Am I not strong? I'll beat him for sure.

222
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,920
What's happening?

223
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,880
Who's up for Team China? Who else?

224
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,670
K&K has completed the first round.

225
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,850
Now, Wu Bai and Grunt have won.

226
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,470
As predicted. What about our guys?

227
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,370
Lnin won. Next is Ou Qiang.

228
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,930
<i>[ALL (China) vs PLAY (Columbia)]</i>

229
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:45,030
<i>Okay. So for this match, it will be China's All versus Columbia's Play.</i>

230
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,710
On this side, All force-attacking an eternal defense player is a complete surprise.

231
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,390
<i>Yes. 1-0 and the second round will start.</i>

232
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,930
<i>They immediately found another loophole; on this side, Play noticed that the opponent might've changed attack nodes.</i>

233
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,320
<i>Congrats to All who directly took the win for this round!</i>

234
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,840
Yes! All won!

235
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,530
The old warrior is as strong as ever!

236
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,110
All these years, Ou Qiang's been working as a penetration tester.

237
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,250
He stopped for a few years but he was still able to keep his condition at its peak.

238
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,610
His professional age is even higher than I imagined.

239
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,090
Based on the results from the first round,

240
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,900
China has a very big chance of winning first place in the afternoon's finals!

241
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,760
- Guess: who is the most projected to win?
- Of course, it will be...

242
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,680
What? Think I'll blame you if you say KK's players? I won't!

243
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,040
On the world stage, we are all representing China.

244
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,270
As long as Team China wins, we will all be proud!

245
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,070
Then I'll be honest. The most projected <i>(to win)</i> is definitely DT.

246
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,250
In CTF's competitions, he is always the first individually.

247
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,940
I think, if there are no surprises this time, it will still be him.

248
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,540
What's wrong? Laughing so happily. Are you his fangirl, too?

249
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,870
You don't say, Han Shangyan's little brother is a genius.

250
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,070
Same as him back then.

251
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,730
<i>[Little Mi (China) vs NAYA (Norway)]</i>

252
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,760
How is Little Mi's condition?

253
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,620
<i>This side... Whoa! Unexpectedly, there's an obvious loophole.</i>

254
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,000
<i>Really full of loopholes, Little Mi!</i>

255
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,590
<i>Right now, he is behind by three points.</i>

256
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,820
<i>This competition is divided into three modes: Jeopardy (problem-solving), attack and defense, and mixed-mode.</i>

257
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,560
<i>Contestants are required to attack and defend around the server, mining and exploiting vulnerabilities,</i>

258
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,330
<i>and multiple categories of cybersecurity issues are all part of the competition.</i>

259
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,430
<i>Naya got a complete victory over Little Mi, on this side.</i>

260
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,530
<i>Congratulations to the contestant from Norway,</i>

261
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,790
<i>Naya that won this match.</i>

262
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:46,060
<i>But that's not to say Little Mi didn't show us a very interesting battle.</i>

263
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,190
<i>But I personally still think that during the middle phase, his mindset was a little blown.</i>

264
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,590
Although he worked hard, a loss is still a loss.

265
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,720
Anyway, I still have one saying for Little Mi: he's an old general still willing to fight for his country.

266
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,060
<i>Let's congratulate Norway's Naya once again.</i>

267
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,400
- <i>Let's also give a round of applause to our Chinese contestant, Little Mi.</i>
- It's okay.

268
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,600
You're unused to this place.

269
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:22,400
All right! So far, the first round of the competition in the All-Stars Invitational has come to an end.

270
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,130
Yes. I noticed that during the first round, the Chinese contestants had very eye-catching performances!

271
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:33,400
Yes. Now, other than Little Mi, who unfortunately went up against the Norwegian CTF expert, Naya, and has been eliminated;

272
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,130
the five remaining Chinese contestants have successfully made it into the second round.

273
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,970
Wu Bai has always been first in the CTF world rankings.

274
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,010
<i>Naya is also a very strong contestant.</i>

275
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:49,150
<i>I believe that he will be able to take down DT in the next match.
[World's First Place DT (China) vs World's Second Place Naya (Norway)]</i>

276
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,220
Actually, we are all looking forward to the duel between those two.

277
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,900
For the audience and us commentators, it will be visual enjoyment.

278
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,370
Yes. Fellow audience, please continue watching this All-Star Individual Invitational Competition.

279
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,850
We will begin the second round soon.

280
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,280
Eat more. Good luck this afternoon.

281
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,250
Ou Qiang, where's Little Mi?

282
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,940
He said he didn't want to eat and went out for some air by himself.

283
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:35,450
<i>[Little Mi (China) vs NAYA (Norway) - win]</i>

284
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,640
What? Can't accept the loss?

285
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,440
I can't be mentally weak?

286
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,560
It's just a competition.

287
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,680
I'm a bit regretful. It's my first time competing abroad.

288
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,160
I thought I could receive the people's applause on stage.

289
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,840
There are still a lot of opportunities.

290
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,610
I'm old now.

291
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,500
I'm older than you and you're telling me you're old?

292
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,530
Your younger cousin Wu Bai isn't bad. He has your past demeanor.

293
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,900
Compared to me, he's still a bit unskilled. Right?

294
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,930
Little Mi, no matter who wins or loses,

295
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,560
we will be fighting for China.

296
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,190
Good luck!

297
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,700
I just knew you would be here.

298
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,770
This is your unique way of preparing. I have long heard of it.

299
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,400
You... like to sit in silence by yourself.

300
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,530
Especially before a big competition like this.

301
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,700
Some people like it lively.

302
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,920
I like it quiet.

303
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,770
Then am I bothering you?

304
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,330
To be honest, a little bit.

305
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,690
Sorry. Then I'll keep it short.

306
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,920
I actually came to tell you, "Good luck!"

307
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,300
These years, I've seen your exceptional talent and perseverance.

308
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:11,010
So, I believe that you will help China win the championship today.

309
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,900
Truthfully, I don't only want to prove to the world that China can do it.

310
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,430
I more so want to, in front of you, win the championship on the international stage.

311
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,920
Thank you...

312
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,230
for liking me so much back then.

313
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,610
Did you know? Back when your Team Solo won the championship,

314
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,820
I was still a high school student.

315
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,590
But after seeing you shining so brightly on stage,

316
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,000
I secretly swore that I will one day be like you,

317
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,950
shining brightly on the stage.

318
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:57,280
In front of you, I will win a championship for China.

319
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:09,270
No matter if it was the Singapore Invitationals Competition or the International Tour Competition,

320
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,610
I paid close attention to your achievements.

321
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,190
Your performance really was exceptional.

322
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,930
That is different.

323
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,720
It was because of you that I chose CTF.

324
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,970
So whether or not I can take the championship today is very important to me.

325
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,600
Just wait and see.

326
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,870
Truthfully in my eyes,

327
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,160
you are already that shining star.

328
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,810
Good luck!

332
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,920
Fighting, Han Shangyan! Fighting, Han Shangyan!

333
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,130
Isn't he handsome?

334
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,440
Next up is today's finals competition!

335
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,450
This will be between China's DT and Norway's Naya!

336
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,970
Now, although Wu Bai is globally ranked First Place,

337
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:43,320
coincidentally, Norway's Naya is globally ranked Second Place.

338
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,390
Furthermore, these two have never competed against each other before.

339
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,540
But from their individual achievements this year,

340
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,850
Naya has actually won three more times than Wu Bai.

341
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:59,090
Moreover, I heard Naya especially went into seclusion to analyze Wu Bai's tactics for over a month.

342
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,520
If it's like this, then I am concerned that Wu Bai's competition might not be so easy.

343
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,130
That's true. Let us warmly welcome the two contestants into the arena!

344
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,600
<i>[World's First Place DT (China) vs World's Second Place Naya (Norway)]</i>

345
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,110
<i>All right, let's count down! Ten!</i>

346
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,880
<i>Nine!</i>

347
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,550
<i>Eight!</i>

348
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,360
<i>Seven!</i>

349
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,150
<i>Six!</i>

350
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,800
<i>Five!</i>

351
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,430
<i>Four!</i>

352
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,200
<i>Three!</i>

353
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,880
<i>Two!</i>

354
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,190
<i>One!</i>

355
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,760
<i>This round will be mixed-mode.</i>

356
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,150
<i>Yes. Mixed-mode has incorporated jeopardy (problem-solving) with attack and defense.</i>

357
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,570
<i>Ten problems. Ten nodes.</i>

358
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:47,970
<i>The contestant wins if they break through their opponent's nodes, or has solved ten problems.</i>

359
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,440
<i> DT. Naya. Which one will you choose?</i>

360
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,010
<i>DT has chosen the mode that Asian contestants excel in: problem-solving mode.</i>

361
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,980
<i>Nice. DT has already solved the first problem.</i>

362
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,170
<i>The second and third problems have appeared simultaneously on DT's screen!</i>

363
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,200
<i>DT has stopped! What is he thinking?</i>

364
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,840
<i>Is he giving Naya an opportunity?</i>

365
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,410
<i>What is the situation? Could it be he wants to solve both at the same time?</i>

366
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:20,260
<i>Nice! He solved them all! Now what do we see?</i>

367
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,470
<i>The fourth, fifth, and sixth problems!</i>

368
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,000
<i>Three problems! There are three problems!</i>

369
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,120
<i> I've been commentating CTF for many years, but I've never seen a contestant like this!</i>

370
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,510
<i> Solved! DT has solved it!</i>

371
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,960
<i>He's like a monster! Did you guys see that?</i>

372
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,220
<i> These are the skills of the one who is ranked first in the world for CTF!</i>

373
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:47,580
<i> What's wrong? An error has occurred in Problem #7 for DT.</i>

374
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,560
<i> It's Naya! He's forcefully attacking DT's server!</i>

375
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,490
<i>He has completely ignored the problem-solving!</i>

376
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,710
<i>This is the style of Vikings!</i>

377
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,290
<i>Plunder, plunder, and still plunder.</i>

378
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,090
<i>Naya has taken down three nodes in one go!</i>

379
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,120
<i> DT is being forced to stop solving the problems. </i>

380
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,700
<i> He has been firmly gripped by the Viking!</i>

381
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,800
<i>I will one day be like you,</i>

382
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,770
<i> shining brightly on the stage.</i>

383
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,770
<i>In front of you, I will win a championship for China.</i>

384
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,670
<i>It was because of you that I chose CTF.</i>

385
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,930
<i>So whether or not I can take the championship today is very important to me.</i>

386
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,450
<i> Just wait and see. </i>

387
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,900
<i>There is not much time left for DT. There is not much hope.</i>

388
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,000
<i>The ninth node! Looks like we will have to congratulate Naya in advance.</i>

389
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,400
<i>Wait a minute. Naya has suddenly lost five nodes. What's going on?</i>

390
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,100
Nice!

391
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,000
<i>Naya's security vulnerabilities have all been infiltrated at once!</i>

392
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,640
<i>DT has perfectly tricked Naya into thinking he was solving problems!</i>

393
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,300
<i>DT has perfectly brought Naya down to his own pace.</i>

394
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,600
<i>He made Naya think he was just going to focus on solving problems and not fighting!</i>

395
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,900
<i>In truth, he had already dug a trap for Naya.</i>

396
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,900
<i>Naya is now forced to defend.</i>

397
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,280
<i>He is now using all his energy on stopping the encroaching DT!</i>

398
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,100
<i>But he obviously cannot block it!</i>

399
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,380
<i>It is now 9 - 9.</i>

400
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,600
<i>DT is only one step away from being the champion!</i>

401
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,500
<i>Now, Naya is really on the brink of exhaustion.</i>

402
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,300
<i>This attack from all sides really is too fierce!</i>

403
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,000
<i>Now let’s look at DT’s screen.</i>

404
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,980
<i>What?</i>

405
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,100
<i> Beside this high-frequency attack, he still had the energy to keep solving the problems?</i>

406
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,300
<i>Four problems... three problems...</i>

407
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,000
<i>It’s the last problem!</i>

408
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,400
<i>DT has stopped! His hands are now on the enter key, he's pressed on it!</i>

409
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,100
<i>[ACCESS GRANTED]</i>

410
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,100
YES!

411
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,700

418
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,100
<i>He is the Chinese contestant, DT!</i>

419
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,800
Second place goes to the Norwegian contestant, Naya!

420
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,510
And Lnin from China...

421
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,000
He has won third place in this competition!

422
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,840
In the One-on-One Invitational Competition, China obtained first and third place.

423
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,100
Congratulations, China!

424
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,300
Yes! Let's give these three contestants another round of applause!

425
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Summer, they won!

426
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,600
Meat jerky! Meat jerky!

427
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:03,100
Summer! Summer!

428
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,700
Hello?

429
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,400
Hello? It's really loud over here, can you hear me?

430
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,530
Han Shangyan!

431
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,400
It's me! It's Tong Nian!

432
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,990
I just saw your competition!

433
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,500
Congratulations to you all!

434
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,000
Thank you!

435
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,800
Do you want to hear the cheers for China on-site?

436
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,690
Okay, okay!

437
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,200
Hello? I will be going to the interview soon. I'll talk to you later!

438
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,260
Han Shangyan. Uh... I...

439
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,000
Congrats!

440
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,100
- Mom!!! K&K...
- What are you doing so early in the morning?

441
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,900
World champions!!

442
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,800
You scared me to death! It's so early in the morning, what do you want? What KKK?

443
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,600
"KK" what? You want me to spank you?

444
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,400
Han Shangyan's Club, K&K, is number one in the world.

445
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,000
Third place was also China's, but it was the other club.

446
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
In short, Han Shangyan is the best!!

447
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,600
Wait, wait. Come here, come here!

448
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,000
Han Shangyan's company won the world championship?

449
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,800
Look at my daughter! She really does have foresight!

450
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,100
- Where are you going?
- There's still the award ceremony!

451
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,100
This child really does have good foresight. You see...

452
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,600

- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

460
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,500

- Hi.
- Okay. Come on.

505
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,800
Congratulations.

506
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,400
Thank you.

507
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,700
Hi. Can I... interview you?

508
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,200
You don't need to interview me.

509
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,300
They are the main characters for today.

510
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,000
Let's do one more.

511
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,300
Ta-da!

512
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,500
Come, come!

513
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,900
Drink!

514
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,400
Cheers!

515
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,500
Congratulations! It was a good beginning.

516
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,300
Yes. I finally have something to present to headquarters.

517
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,700
But I really need to especially thank you.

518
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,400
Back then, you chose to stand on my side and start the China branch one year earlier.

519
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,800
Why so formal? Aren't we bros?

520
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,900
This is your wish, and I helped you fulfill it. Isn't that great?

521
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,800
But... I'll discuss one matter with you.

522
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,900
That friend of yours. His skills are not that great.

523
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,000
Mi Shaofei?

524
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,700
I watched the entire competition,

525
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,400
the Chinese competitors were all top-level, but he was just average.

526
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,300
Perhaps he was distracted?

527
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,900
Does he have a lot of pressure?

528
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,660
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry what?

529
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,900
I only finished doing half of my hair.

530
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,500
What is it?

531
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,800
Let's go. Taking you guys to have fun.

532
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,100
- I'm still not unrestrained enough?
- You're unrestrained enough.

533
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,700
- Where are we going?
- Wherever you want to go, we will go.

534
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,700
Great! Then, let's go!

535
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,900
Ou Qiang, I just drank some wine with Nan Wei. You drive.

536
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,200
Hello! My name is Ou Qiang!

537
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,900

538
