There's no use! With his bad temper?

39
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,380

You and Han Shangyan came to find me for the same thing?

48
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,280
Did he come because of this, too?

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,080
I already rejected him and I will reject yours, too.

125
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,580
I would have gone to Singapore to find you.

126
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,080
We are opponents. What is there to be happy about?

127
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:14,040
So how is it? We haven't seen each other in so long, are you doing well?

128
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,730

134
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,760
You came here to show off?

135
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,080
You know this. I have never shown off in front of you.

136
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,280
And I don't need to show off.

137
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,180
Because in my heart, you are always the brightest star.

138
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,600
Same with Little Mi.

139
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,580
It was his own choice to join SP.

140
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,680
He thinks that SP is more suited for him.

141
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,580
I will give him the best resources to train him,

142
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,780
and get him to return to a condition where he can compete as soon as possible.

143
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,890
If this was his own choice,

144
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,280
I will respect it.

145
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
You are giving up so quickly? That's not like you.

146
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,780
It is he who gave up on me, not I who gave up on him.

147
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,480
I will take good care of him.

148
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,480
It is best that you do as you say.

149
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,280
Or else, I will settle both my new and old debts with you.

150
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,580
He is also my brother.
<i>(T/N: good friend)</i>

151
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
You can leave.

152
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,580
What? You're really not going to give me some time so we can talk about some private matters?

153
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,180
The two of us do not have any private matters to discuss. See you in the competitions.

<i> we've been questioned and gossiped about,</i>

172
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,980

173
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,180

174
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,080

<i> Also, I am formally retiring.</i>

 - Gun God, what is your reason for retiring?</i>

182
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,880
<i> - Gun God.
 - Han Shangyan!</i>

183
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
<i> - Han Shangyan!
 - Gun God, say a few things.</i>

184
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,080
<i> - Why are you retiring?
 - Old Han, what are you doing?</i>

185
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,180

<i> Our team is called Team Solo!</i>

202

204
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,680

<i> What else do you want me to believe in?</i>

207
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,280
<i> Everyone, please let me say something.</i>

208
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
<i> Han Shangyan, you shouldn't be this impulsive.</i>

209
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,480
<i> We just won the championship inside just now.</i>

210
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,280
<i> Outside, there're a bunch of fans and also a bunch of reporters waiting for us.</i>

<i> Everything can wait until tonight's celebratory feast to discuss how we move forward. </i>

<i>- Yeah.
 - Can we?</i>

213
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,720
<i> Old Han!</i>

214
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,280
<i>We will meet at the usual place tonight!</i>

215
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,970
<i> We already got the national champion.</i>

216
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,080
<i> Why are we giving up?</i>

217
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,780
<i> We can be the world champions.</i>

218
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,380

<i> Here, let me make a toast to everyone.</i>

220
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,280
<i> Let me say my farewell here.</i>

221
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,780
<i> I am going back home in a few days.</i>

222
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,180
<i> Little Mi, what are you up to? Why are you suddenly leaving, too?</i>

223
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,980
<i> Little Mi, don't join in the trouble.</i>

224
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,180
<i> I've... thought it over already.</i>

225
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,480
<i> Thought over what?</i>

226
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,580
<i> I've decided to retire.</i>

227
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,980
<i> Go back home and look after the convenience store for my mom. Isn't that great?</i>

228

<i> What are you adding into the trouble for?</i>

229
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,080
<i> You are so young. What is the hurry?</i>

230
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,480
<i> Little Mi, you shouldn't be impulsive.</i>

231
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,480
<i> I am not being impulsive, Captain.</i>

232
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,680
<i> You shouldn't copy Old Han!</i>

233
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,980
<i> I am doing it for myself.</i>

234
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,280
<i> Do you really think I only care about world champion?</i>

235
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,580
<i> What is the point of our team if it is missing a member?</i>

236
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,380
<i> You are just like a pile of messy mud on the floor.</i>

237
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,080
<i> Old Han, where have you been?</i>

238
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,880
<i> Why didn't you answer my call? I called you so many times! Why didn't you answer?</i>

<i> Also, the reward money.</i>

262
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,460
<i> Did you come here just to bring me money?</i>

263
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,890

<i> I admit that you have the talent to be a captain, but you've wronged every one of us.</i>

266

<i> You don't deserve it and you also don't have the qualifications to be a captain.</i>

<i> I don't deserve to be a captain.</i>

268

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,420
Do you still remember the championship game from ten years ago?

276
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,560
Old Han, one decipher; it was an instantaneous kill.

277
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,940
He got that Buff so angry that he directly kicked the chair.

278
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,620
Thinking on it now, that was called satisfying.

One day of being brothers

289
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,080
is being brothers for life.

290
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,810
If you go to Shanghai in the future, if there's anything you need my help in, let me know anytime.

291
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,690
No need to be polite.

292
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,020
I am going now. I need to catch a flight.

293
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,790
You're going?

294
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,270
Why does this kid look familiar somehow?

295
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:16,190
Grandma, you forgot? That's my best bro, Little Han.

296
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,450
Yes. That's why he looks so familiar.

297
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,260
Did you pack everything?

298
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,470
Pretty much.

299
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,690
You are not young anymore.

300
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,020
Do some more reasonable things in the future.

301
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,660
Don't worry, Grandma. This time I'll definitely win a championship and come back.

302
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,730
All right, Grandma will wait for you.

303
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,500
What is it?

304
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,530
Seems like he didn't pay for the drinks.

305
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:49,200
We are brothers, why are you talking about that?

306
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,870
Please give me a computer.

307
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,520
- I'm off work. Go ask that guy.
 - Hello, please show us your ID.

308
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,040
Elder cousin! I am ready; let's go.

309
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,440
Let's go eat breakfast. Go home and eat breakfast.

310
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,330
Sis, what is the matter?
<i>(T/N: They are cousins, but in Asian culture, they still call each other by "brother" and "sister.")</i>

311
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,340
It's free to use the internet and he still doesn't come.

312
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,620
Sis, I have to do something right now. You go back.

313
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,760
- I will look for you later.
 - Give me the bag. / - That's right.

314
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,910
What are you up to?

315
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,500
- Why are you back?
 - Something urgent.

316
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,580
- Bro.
 - What is it?

317
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,390
Do you play that often?

318
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,570
Ah, yeah.

319
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,760
What... What kind of game is this?

320
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,130
Doesn't your family own an internet cafe? You don't know this?

321
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,330
I don't play games much.

322
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,130
Chamber Storm.

323
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,450
Then, how can I find out who recently played this game?

324
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,780
This... As long as you know their username, that's enough.

325
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,660
How would I know their username?

326
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:21,500
If you don't know, how would I know?

327
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,080
That's true.

328
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,040
Dad. Mom. I am back.

329
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,700
You are back.

330
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,170
Where is Dounan?

331
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,530
Why didn't he come back with you? Didn't he say he will be back together with you to eat?

332
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,920
Yeah, he originally said he would come back with me together.

333
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,880
I don't know why but he went back half-way.

334
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,830
I'll say, what's going with you these days? Always coming back so late.

335
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,610
Are you staying up all night with your younger cousin?

336
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,200
I need to help him watch the store. What can I do?

337
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:27,180

338
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,700
He probably blocked me.

339
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,560
- Sis! Sis!
 - What?

340
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,930
I have a way to find that person.

341
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,490
- Han Shangyan.
 - Yes.

342
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,270
I pulled the store's surveillance video and I found the game he was playing.

343
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,320
Even a ghost knows that. Isn't it that "Chamber Storm?"

344
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,600
You are a game idiot. How do you know this?

345
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,580
In a little while, I am going to compete for the recording of the theme song.

346
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,240
But what is the point of knowing the name of the game? I still can't find him.

347
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,130
We can find him.

348
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,270
- We can find him?
 - Yes.

349
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,580
- Is that for real?
 - Absolutely true.

350
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,270
I can even borrow my friend's pro-level ID for you. We don't even need to register.

351
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,460
- All right, I'm not saying anymore. Let's go in. I'll help you.
 - Not bad!

352
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,600
Dounan!

354
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,840
Okay.

355
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,980
And then this is the password.

356
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,660

"1 Dash of Handsome?"
<i>(T/N: friend's username)</i>

358
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,120
Ignore it, ignore it. Next, we need to invite a friend.

359
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,440
I will enter his game ID.

360
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,570

362
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,150
Grunt?

363
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,390
No wonder his WeChat ID is Gn.

364
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,750
So he is called "Grunt." It's such a nice name.

365
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,040
- Grunt. Grunt.
 - All right, all right.

366
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,450
Stop fangirling. This... This sounds like "roller."
<i>(T/N: grunt and roller sound similar)</i>

367
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,880
- That's enough. Pro-level people all use this kind of name.
 - It sounds like he's cursing someone.

368
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,620
At least, it sounds better than your Hu Dounan. Hu Dounan. Hu Dounan.

369
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,030
Stop calling my name.

370
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,180
All right. Let's follow my friend's instructions. I will read it for you.

371
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,590
The W A S D is the forward, left, back and right. You try it.

372
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,030
Shoot with the mouse. Left-click.

373
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,720
When you start every round, you need to purchase a weapon.

374
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,520
If you win more in the previous round, you have to buy better weapons in the next round.

375
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,730
Anyway, the moves are not hard. You just need to practice them. There are no shortcuts.

376
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,580
You are so smart. You will get it soon. Practice makes perfect.

377
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,600
- That's true.
 - Let's start with the invite.

378
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,630

Let me tell you. I am more relaxed that he didn't accept my invite.

Why is he still not finished?

392

393
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,290
- Don't be nervous.
 - I am not nervous.

394
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,640
When we go in later, you have to calmly say hi to him. Okay?

395
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,980
I am calm. Calm.

396
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,510

Did he accept it? Did he accept it?

400
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,410
- Crap!
 - What happened?

401
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,670
He chose the opponent team. You won't be able to see him.

402
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,560
What should I do then? I want to see him! I want to see him!

403
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:04,120
You will only be able to see him if you use the public chat or if you bump into him in the game.

404
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,170
- Bumping into him in the game is fine, too.
 - Don't be so worried yet.

405
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,390
Even though he is your rival, you can still greet him, right?

406
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,230
- Friendship comes first, competition comes after.
 - Okay.

407
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,290
- Okay.
 - What should I do?

408

Yes, and then...

411

You... the mouse! Use the mouse to fight!

412
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,420
The person just now already passed!

413
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,850
I... hit him, hit him! He won't die!

414
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,120
Why are you shaking yourself?

415
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,980
- How do I do this?
 - Do you know how to play?

416
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,300

 - Go forward!

417
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,700

423

Hit him!

424
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,090
Did I die?

425
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,250
I... I think so.

 - I've been helping you all along!

 - You helped me die!

428
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,540
I helped... I have been helping you! If you hadn't kept on moving the mouse...

429
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,370
- If you hadn't moved around randomly, how would you have died?
 - It's all your fault! It's all your fault!

430
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,180
- Why are you blaming me again?
 - It is because of you!

431
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,410
Why are you blaming me?

432
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,420
So annoying. I haven't even seen him and I already died.

433
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,320
- Grunt, where is your passport?
 - Let me just finish this round.

434
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,820
- Remember to give it to me later.
 - Okay.

435
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,370
Such noobs. It's no fun.

436
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,180
It's vacation time. There are a lot of newbies.

437
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,800
Demo! Play a round for me.

438
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,190
I will go get the passport for the manager.

439
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,680
Where is Boss?

440
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,810
He is taking a nap. He just got back and he is already in a bad mood.

441
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,880
The other day, I kept hearing his notifications from WeChat.

442
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,350
I thought he never used WeChat to chat?

443
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,580
What happened? Is he dating?

444
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,110
That day, a small internet cafe added him on WeChat and kept sending him advertisements.

445
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,980
I told him I could help him block it, but he wouldn't let me.

446
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,250
He went offline. Did he leave?

447
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,200
He needs to rest, too. Right? You can use this time to look at strategy guides.

448
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,930
When you play together next time, you won't be as silly.

449
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,990
This game seems pretty easy to me anyway.

450
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,780
See, there are just those four keys, the mouse, and the space bar. How hard can it be? It's really easy.

451
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,170
Hu Dounan, can you let me be alone for a bit?

452
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,020
- Okay.
 - Thank you. I am grateful.

453
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,650
You are welcome.

00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,780
I play once in a while.

500
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,410
Do you know this person?

501
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:30,400
No, I don't. Just a kid.

502
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,670
It's a pro-level account.

503
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,280
He is probably secretly using someone else's account in the family.

504
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,930
I've also encountered this kind of situation before. Just try to play along.

505
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,260
<i>I have already seen two stolen accounts this week. Is this another one?</i>

506
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,240
<i>It's so late at night. Account stealing thief, don't you need to sleep?</i>

507
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,680
<i>Little kid, let me save you this once.</i>

508
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:59,000
<i>Not a stolen account. Some kid in the family is using the account; just do your best.</i>

509
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,250
<i>Then, isn't this 4 vs. 5 now?</i>

510
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,870
<i> We have Grunt, we won't lose.</i>

511
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,480
<i> Do you see the door ahead?</i>

512
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,800
<i> Yes, I can see it clearly. My monitor is especially good, I guarantee it won't lag.</i>

513
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,160
<i>Hide there, until the game ends.</i>

514
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,010
Why don't you register for an account instead of always using Grunt's?

515
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,560
If I register, what would you guys do?

516
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,690
I am going to shower first; start a round for me.

517
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:06,000
Right, that 1 Dash of Handsome, remember to add him for me.
