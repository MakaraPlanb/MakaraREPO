Sister-in-Law, you brought your computer?

24
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,670
I snuck out of school, so there are a lot of things I haven't done yet.

25
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,330
Pretty nice, huh? In the internet cafe, we don't have to fret over no WiFi.

26
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,090
Sister-in-Law, have you been to an internet cafe before or did you play at home?

27

My aunt's family manages an internet cafe.

28

I met Han Shangyan through an internet cafe.

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,730
- Internet cafe?
- Yeah.

He's been to an internet cafe?

31
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,430
Did you two fall in love at first sight?

32
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:27,670
Us two... We met right before New Year's when he came to the internet cafe for a night.

33
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,930
Really? Tell me the details. You two...

34
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,640
You really think you're here for vacation?

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,810
No, I was just worried that Sister-in-Law might have been bored.

36
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,910
Worried she'd be bored?

37
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,390
How about you go write a retirement letter and I'll immediately let you leave,

38
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,690
then you'll have plenty of time to chat with her.

39
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,630
I'm so young. Why're you making me retire?

40
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,090
- Still talking?
- I'm going to train now; talk to you later.

41
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,170
Is this hat ugly?

42
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,090
You didn't give me enough time this morning.

43
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,420
I didn't have time to brush my hair so I wore a hat.

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,370
Is there something in my eye?

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,270
Wait! I'm going to the restroom.

46
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,720
Didn't you go to the restroom?

47
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,430
I'm not going anymore.

48
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,710
She's going to be here for another two hours.

49
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,170
Are you just going to be eyeing her the whole time?

50
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,590
Is she going to be like this every day?

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,590
So, she'll come every day?

52
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,940
But I'm leaving tomorrow. How many more days are you staying for?

53
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,450
One week... or maybe more. I'm not sure.

54
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:47,690
She's not going to be just here. Later, we have lots of meetings, competitions, parties–

55
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,670
Party?

56
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,340
Didn't you come here to train? Why are there parties?

57
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,140
They can't just train, they have to rest.

58
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,980
You can rest. You can go and surf, swim, or bathe in the sun.

59

Why do you have to party?

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:17,930

There are lots. Which do you want to hear?

Okay.

81
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,940
First, I'll tell you about criminal investigations.

82
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,930
Actually, we're just making a face identification system

83
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,570
to help them find the needle in the haystack through finding offenders from decade-old cases.

84
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,050
These offenders are very cunning, you know.

85
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,370
If they just change their names and location, it's impossible to find them.

86
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,890
Also, ten years have passed. A human's eye cannot detect their changes.

87
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,720
At that time, it's our turn.

88
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,070
- You've cracked cases before?
- Of course, more than one thousand cases.

89
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,930
For example?

90
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,930
For example, there was a murderer who escaped.

91
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,450
Then, he became a monk,

92
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,100
so this case hadn't been cracked since.

93
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,070
And then?

94
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,200
Then, we made a face identification system.

95
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,390
The police put his picture from ten years ago in the computer,

96
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,250
and the computer searched and found his current ID photo as a monk.

97
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,400
Even if your name and birth date are all fake, that's okay.

98
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,410
The computer can recognize faces. Amazing, right?

99
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,960
This case has been on the news, so I can tell you.

100
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,360
There are also many I have to keep secret.

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,160
There are only two rankings in K&K's dictionary.

173
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,680
- Winner and loser.
- All right, Boss.

174
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,660
Also, handsome and not handsome.

175
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,250
You want to die?

176
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,860
Joking, joking.

177
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,070
Okay, let's start.

178
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,520
Then let's flip a coin.

179
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,910
No. Let K&K choose first.

180
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,400
Cool.

181
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,590
Okay, Team K&K choose first.

182
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,460
My opponent is Lnin.

183
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,030
- Take good care of me, all right?
- Take good care of you? You're going to lose for sure.

184
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,080
Blow him up.

185
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,900
Following.

186
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,440
I got Ou Qiang.

187
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,020
Little Demo, call me older brother.

188
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,370
Mine is Hua Ti.

189
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,740
Okay!

190
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,020
- I'm against you.
- You're so unlucky.

191
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,060
- You seem to always be put up against the hardest people.
- It's all the same.

192
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,670
What do you mean? If you're against him, that means you'll get eliminated the earliest.

193
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,010
How will you increase your rank? I'm not saying your skills aren't good enough, just...

194
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,890
Okay, okay.

195
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,000
His ranking is number one. Whoever competes against him is the same.

196
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,980
Okay, let's change our seats. Sit across from your opponent.

197
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,280
In this one-on-one competition case, because this is a training camp, there aren't many judges watching,

198
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,160
so please keep yourselves in check.

199
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,350
Later, whoever wins will raise their hand.

200
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,270
I will keep track of winners and ones eliminated on the whiteboard.

201
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,600
Grunt won.

202
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,900
Bingo!

203
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,980
Ou Qiang won.

204
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,320
Yes!

205
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,340
Hua Ti won.

206
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,110
Following won.

207
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,430
Wu Bai won.

208
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:13,330
Today's winners are Wu Bai, Grunt, Ou Qiang, Hua Ti and Following.

209
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,200
Congratulations, everyone!

210
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,200
So comfortable! We can have a break like this.

211
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,120
Is Little Bai really powerful? No one can win against him.

212
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,180
Before Solo retired, he won against him once.

213
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:43,570
Solo? Their ages are so different, but they've competed before?

214
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,930
Little Bai started his career early.

215
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,690
Sister-in-Law! Want to go play in the water?

216
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,180
Want to go play together?

217
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,400
Boss! Sister-in-Law!

218
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,420
- Done competing?
- Yes!

219
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,770
What are you guys doing?

220
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,900
- Relaxing.
- Yeah, taking a break.

221
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,490
Relax?

222
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,160
You lost to SP and you still want to relax?

223
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,180
Don't you have a sense of shame?

224
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,990
No, Wu Bai and I won, right?

225
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,980
Right, right.

226
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,480
Although we lost, we still have to relax!

227
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,060
Yeah.

228
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:21,440
Go ahead. If you want to relax, then do fifty push-ups on the spot and I'll let you go.

229
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,280
What?

230
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,570
- Boss!
- No, seriously?

231
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,940
Do you want to relax?

232
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,260
- Okay, let's do it.
- Let's do it, let's do it.

233
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,950
Count for yourselves.

234
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,790
- Okay.
- Okay.

235
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,740
One, two, three...

236
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,660
- Continue.
- What?

237
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,460
Four.

238
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,280
- Your... What was it? Artificial intelligence.
- Five.

239
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,330
Last time, I talked to you about criminal investigations. This time I'll tell you about medical applications.

240
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,700
- My senior is mainly in charge of medical applications.
- Six.

241
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,960
- We're working together with the hospital to identify pulmonary nodules.
- Seven. Eight.

242
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,560
- Before that, we had actually been working with another hospital.
- Nine.

243
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,380
- But that hospital didn't really trust us.
- Ten.

244
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,940
They found a very professional team to compete with our program.

245
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,320
Mainly, we use old medical records and imaging to identify the nodules and to see which team can identify more.

246
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,660
You won?

247
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,290
Not only did we win, we also found ones the hospital originally missed.

248
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,080
You know, because some nodules are especially small,

249
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,500
it's difficult for doctors and experts to identify all of the nodules within.

250
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,510
But our artificial intelligence system, on that day, was able to do it.

251
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,340
Within the old record, we were able to find a nodule that had not been identified.

252
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,250
- That's a blessing for that patient.
- 37.

253
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,730
That's right.

254
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,800
- I think if we are given a few more years, we can do even better.
- 44, 48.

255
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,170
- Furthermore, our program filters cases very quickly.
- 48. 46.

256
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,280
It can save a lot of manpower for the hospital.

257
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,180
50!

258
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,430
Are you all okay?

259
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,980
Boss, we finished.

260
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,380
You're all so tired, it must mean your bodies are weak. How about you go back and rest?

261
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,660
- No, we aren't tired.
-Yeah!

262
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,820
We're perfectly good!

263
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,450
- Right.
- So easy!

264
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,600
Go play.

265
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,100
- Let's go!
- Thanks, Boss!

266
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,760
I have to say, Old Han really has a way of leading his team.

267
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,960
Yeah.

268
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,810
Looks like these kids really look up to him.

269
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,660
Absolute skills bring about absolute admiration.

270
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,710
Shouldn't leaders be like that?

271
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,620
What? You two don't want to roll with me anymore?

272
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,390
Do you need to do some push-ups, too?

273
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,890
No, no, no!

274
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,060
- No need.
- It's so hot, go and change so we can swim a bit.

275
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,720
Okay.

276
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,490
- I'll set the bar.
- Come on!

277
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,450
Want to sit for a bit?

278
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,650
No.

279
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,340
- When's your flight tomorrow?
- At night.

280
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,810
Oh, at night.

281
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,830
I have training at 3:00 p.m., so I won't be able to send you off.

282
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,540
It's fine.

283
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,480
Then, you're still free in the day.

284
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,870
You can play around more.

285
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,390
Okay.

286
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,320
Go rest, I'll leave now.

287
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,210
Okay.

288
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,280
It's already 10:00 p.m. Do you still have to work?

289
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,810
Of course. Two phone call meetings. One at 10:00 p.m. and one at 12:00 a.m.

290
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,410
Then, you'll be sleeping at 1:00 a.m.

291
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,380
Pretty much.

292
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,560
So tiring.

293
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,130
Then, I'll really be going.

294
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,140
Or after you finish your meetings, you can tell me.

295
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,660
I won't sleep that early.

296
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,220
We can chat or something.

297
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,830
How about if you just come with me?

298
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,060
Don't you have some programming code to write?

299
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,930
After my meeting, I can keep you company.

300
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,600
Okay.

301
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,000
Bring your computer, let's go.

302
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,400
- I'll look up some data for a bit.
- Okay.

303
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,600
I have something I'm very curious about that I want to ask you.

304
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,900
Say it.

305
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,000
I see that when you are writing code, you like to wear these headphones;

306
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,200
but no one else is in the room, so why do you still wear them?

307
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,700
What is this?

308
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,600
It's nice to listen to, right?

309
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,020
These sounds can help make me calm down and think deeply.

310
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,400
- Interesting, right?
- Yes!

311
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,200
If you press here, you can add in the sound of light rain.

312
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,290
And this one, listen closely.

313
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,000
You can add in a pleasant sound of bells.

314
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Did I fall asleep?

315
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,300
When did I fall asleep?

316
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,000
Just when I went to go pour out some coffee.

317
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,450
I was just listening along, and I fell asleep!

318
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,200
You came to Sanya, and you didn't even go out to play. Do you feel very aggrieved?

319
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,300
No, not at all!

320
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,700
To be honest, I'm usually like this; about the same.

321
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,000
Compared to what I thought...

322
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,500
you are a bit different.

323
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
What is different?

324
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,600
Just...

325
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,400
Is it... Is it good or bad?

326
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,400
Say it!

327
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Do you want to go back and sleep or go out and walk a bit?

328
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,600
I am good with anything, I'll listen to you!

329
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,700
It's also the first time those kids from the club have come to Sanya.

330
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,600
I can't just always arrange for them to train at an internet cafe every day.

331
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Then, I won't sleep either.

332
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Go back and get ready.

333
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,200
Go!

334
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,050
- Where should I put–
- Just give it to me!

335
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,400
Then, I'll go back first.

336
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,700
- Bye!
- Bye!

337
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
See you later!

338
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,400
You're not going to sleep for a little?

339
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,800
I'm making a small version of software; it's almost done!

340
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,000
What is it?

341
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,200
Not telling you right now!

342
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,500
Hey! Not allowed to look. Even if you saw it, you wouldn't know what it is.

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,000
Boss has a fear of heights. He doesn't dare to go.

345
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,700
Really?

346
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,450
Fear of heights?

347
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,200
Listen up. For today's morning training, we have arranged for self-training.

348
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,700
No way, Boss.

349
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,810
Look. It's just mountain trails everywhere!

350
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,000
How do you expect us to train here?

351
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,700
We've been in Sanya for so many days already.

352
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,900
Every day we are just training, going to class, competing.

353
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,200
This is a place for vacation, and we haven't even rested for a day! You are too inhumane!

354
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,100
Sailing against the current. If you stop moving forward, you fall back. <i>(T/N: An idiom)</i>

355
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,300
Do you not know that competitions and rankings are also very cruel?

356
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,700
But there isn't just one type of training method! Some people are suited to rigorous training.

357
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,700
- 97.
- Besides, if you stretch a rubber band too taut, it can break! We are all really tired already!

358
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,600
- Can you stop talking already?
- What? Are you guys not tired?!

359
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,300
97, don't talk to Boss like that.

360
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,600
What's wrong with what I said? You guys don't dare and say it, I'll say it on your behalf!

361
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,000
Are you guys tired? I'm asking you! Are you guys tired?

362
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,200
97,

363
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:35,360
I still remember when you first started. Back then, you worked really hard.

364
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,000
You quickly learned how to make reinforcements and catch loopholes.

365
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,500
And you even used log analysis to support the team,

366
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,500
and that's how you rose quickly in rankings.

367
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,800
But in our line of work, isn't this how it should be?

368
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,400
Just now I already said,

369
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,500
today is self-training.

370
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,000
It is to let you guys relax.

371
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,600
You guys can do whatever you want.

372
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,400
It's not like I took a rope and tied you guys up.

373
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,000
Also, I have a question for you.

374
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,100
Do you remember your enthusiasm from back then?

375
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
I remember.

376
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,800
Boss, I haven't worked hard enough.

377
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
I should be fighting harder.

378
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,200
Go relax.

379
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,300
- Let's go.
- Don't be unhappy.

380
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,800
Let's go.

381
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,300
Don't be upset. They're still kids; they're immature.

382
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,990
And how old are you?

383
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Let's go sit for a while.

384
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,600
- Sister-in-Law!
- Sister-in-Law!

385
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,000
Be careful!

386
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,800
- Okay!
- We know!

387
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,100
You're awake? Look, I finished it!

388
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,400
Right now, it is a total of fifty-two cards.

389
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,900
Other than the ones in your hand, there are fifty remaining.

390
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,000
Then in the next round, the probability of the cards dealt will be like this.

391
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,900
If all your cards have been pressed down by the opponent,

392
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,900
then you need to flip a card again and you have to continue.

393
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,300
But this software calculates using the cost-plus method.

394
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,860
<i>You worked so hard and didn't sleep just to make a game for me to play?</i>

395
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,350
Like this.

396
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,900
Do you understand it?

397
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,900
I am currently working hard to understand what you are saying.

398
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,800
This... It isn't hard, is it?

399
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,400
It's very simple. You just need to use probability to understand it.

400
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,460
Do you not like it?

401
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,600
It took me two nights to make it.

402
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,400
Do not sway it! Boss!

403
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,900
Look at 97, he keeps swaying!

404
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,200
Boss, control him! You–

405
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,600
97, stop swaying! You're representing K&K–

406
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,400
They are really noisy.

407
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,700
Boss!

408
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,600
There's a lot of people over here.

409
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,500
Let's go with them together to play for a bit!

410
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,950
Let's go!

411
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,100
Let's go!

412
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,500
It's so high up!

413
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,400
Look! Isn't it high, Han Shangyan?

414
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,700
Tong Nian? If you're scared of heights, then let's not go over.

415
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,300
I'm not scared of heights. I can do it.

416
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,860
-  Hurry. Hurry.
- You aren't scared of heights?

417
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,600
Then, you should go first. I'll come after.

418
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,800
No. We clearly said we'd go together.

419
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,000
Come here.

420
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,700
I get it now. You are scared?

421
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,700
If you're scared, it's fine. We can go down the mountain.

422
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,400
Are you joking? Why would I be scared?

423
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,000
Are you okay?

424
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,100
Tong Nian, let's just stay right here.

425
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,000
No, people say this is the lover's bridge.

426
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,800
If lovers walk across the bridge, they'll be together forever.

427
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,900
- We must walk over.
- No, no, no...

428
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,100
Don't believe in superstition. This is just a bridge, it can't determine anything. Let's stay here.

429
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,700
I guessed it right.

430
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,200
I finally know what Han Shangyan, who isn't scared of anything, is afraid of! He's scared of heights!

431
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,600
Han Shangyan is scared of heights!

432
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,800
Hold onto my waist and we'll walk there slowly.

433
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Close your eyes.

434
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,500
All right. You come back here!

435
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,400
You're going back so fast! You're not scared!

436
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,000
Come back here!

437
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,300
Han Shangyan!

438
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,400
Hello.

439
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,200
Why aren't you getting into the car? You have something to say?

440
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,400
I want a new team uniform, can I?

441
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,380
To match with this badge.

442
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,500
I'll keep it as a souvenir, okay?

443
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,300
If there isn't any, it's fine.

444
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,200
Pretend I didn't say anything. Take care.

445
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,400
Don't always work overnight. Sleep more.

446
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,830
I'm going.

447
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,390
Take it home and wash it.

448
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,600
Sir, to the airport!

449
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,000
All right.

450
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,600
Bye-bye! Take care of yourself.

466

Tong Nian! You're back?

467
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,300
Man's clothes! Man's clothes!

468
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,600
I... I didn't say it's not.

469
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Why did you bring back his clothes?

470
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,000
Did he trick you to Sanya and then live in the same room as you?

471
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,210
What are you talking about?

472
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,800
No, no, no! I had a room. I had my own room.

473
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,400
- Really?
- Really.

474
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,900
No, I'm still concerned.

475
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,500
Tell me straight. How old is he?

476
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,600
29, almost 30.

477
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,100
30? That old?

478
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,970
Not old!

479
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,200
Then... Then where did you guys meet?

480
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,400
Internet cafe.

481
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Internet cafe? How long have you guys known each other?

482
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,200
Anyway, we have quite a lot of fate.

483
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,800
At first, we met each other, but we didn't know each other.

484
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,200
Then, we met each other in another city, and we just suddenly got together.

485
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,700
That doesn't count. That time doesn't count as dating. So later, we broke up again. After breaking up, we met again.

486
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,300
When we met again, we got back together again. After we got together, we broke up again because I drank too much.

487
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,400
After breaking up, which is now, we are back together again.

488
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,800
Anyway, it was all a mess but I really like him, Yaya.

489
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,600
I really, really like him.

490
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,400
Hold on a second. Hold on. Let me sort this out.

491
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,900
Let me sort this out. So first,

492
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,800
So first, in a mess you two got together and broke up.

493
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,000
Then you got back together again. Then, you were drunk and then you guys broke up again.

494
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,700
Now you guys are together again.

495
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,900
That's about what happened.

496
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,390
You... Wait.

497
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:59,200
This person and the two before are the same person?

498
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,600
How could you hang yourself on just one man?

499
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,100
Did you know that if a man breaks up with you multiple times, he doesn't cherish you–

500
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,700
No. At first, he wasn't the one who wanted to break up with me. Just...

501
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,200
Well, it's not his problem.

502
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,400
Then, tell me what he does for a career.

503
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,800
Anything's fine.

504
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,600
As long as he's not an old dude who sits around in an internet cafe all day long.

505
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,800
He is older than me, by a lot!

506
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,190
- Move, move. I'm going down to clean up.
- You...

507
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,900
I can't explain clearly to you.

508
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,700
Don't touch my things.

509
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,400
<i>Have an orange.</i>

510
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,700
<i>Eat more, eat more. Bite it, bite it.</i>

511

<i>Is it good?</i>

512
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,770
Shangyan.

513
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,130
I heard you caught a cold.

514
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,400
I especially got you this cold relief.

515
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I've heard a very moving story.

516
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,800
It was during the Team Solo period.

517
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,000
Whenever you guys would go to a competition, Captain Solo would prepare this.

518
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,600
Give me a cup of warm water.

519
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,100
No need.

520
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,600
I'm going back to my room to rest very soon. Thank you.

521
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,800
Isn't it tiring to date a little girlfriend?

522
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,200
She can't take care of you, and you still have to spend time keeping her company.

523
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,000
I really don't know why you want to make yourself so tired.

524
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,000
You're wrong.

525
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,600
It's because I can't bear her leaving so I got sick.

526
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,700
Oh... right. You haven't dated for too long that you don't know this feeling.

527
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,600
But as soon as you fall in love with someone, your energy will be great and your strength greater.

528
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,800
I ask you not to spend your time and energy on me.

529
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,700
It's no use. I'm going.

530
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,710
Shangyan!

531
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,800
What are you looking at?

532
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,000
An advanced CTF tutorial.

533
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,200
Why are you suddenly interested in this?

534
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,300
It's not sudden. I even recorded a theme song for them before.

535
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,400
I really like this. Tell me about it.

536
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
- Really?
- Yes.

537
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,800
Okay, okay. Hurry, Yaya. Come here.

538
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,500
Hurry and come teach me, in case I get yelled at later.

539
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,600
He yells at you?

540
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,200
No. He doesn't. He yells at his team members.

541
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,700
What an attitude.

542
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,600
Why are you always talking bad things about him?

543
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,800
Okay, I won't say it anymore.

544
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,200
So dedicated. Is it because of that old man that you're suddenly learning CTF?

545
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,450
I can't just watch you be scammed.

546
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,000
Who knows if your boyfriend really knows CTF?

547
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,900
He does. His CTF skills are really, really great.

548
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,200
How good is it?

549
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,000
I just know that online he's rated as the Grand Master Level.
<i>(T/N: basically the OG level)</i>

550
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,700
Grand... He's so good at bragging!
