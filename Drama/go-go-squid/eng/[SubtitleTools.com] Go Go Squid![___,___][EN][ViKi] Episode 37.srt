143
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,540
- Go to a place with me.
- Where?

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,940
Beijing Station! It's the first time I come here!

145
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,580
The first time I came to Beijing, it was just to join Solo and the others.

146
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,840
Since then, my life was turned upside down.

147
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,880
That day I sat in the train for over 10 hours.

148
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,300
When I got to Beijing, I was dead tired and dead sleepy.

149
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,290
But when I saw Solo and the others, I came fully awake.

150
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,390
At that time, the 5 of us had very simple ideas.

151
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,940
It was just: make up a team, compete, win the championship.

152
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,280
But people were enough and money wasn't.

153
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,800
I took a trip back home specifically

154
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,210
to take the money my father had left me as education funds before he passed away, and made it into a contribution.

155
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,020
- I know that.
- Let me finish.

156
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,170
All right, I'm listening to you.

157
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,060
The day we disbanded... Solo wanted to give the captain position to me. I refused.

158
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,790
Why?

159
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,060
How to say...

160
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,580
When the captain changes, it feels like it's not the same team as before.

161
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,270
At the time I... was very mad, very pained.

162
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,960
I left everything to Solo and then I just went back to Norway.

163
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,400
Later on I founded K&K.

164
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,700
My original intent was very simple.

165
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,800
I only wanted to make up for my decision back then.

166
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,260
I wanted to establish a formidable club and get all our ex-teammates to come back.

167
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,980
And we can all start over.

168
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,960
Three years ago, when the headquarter was just starting to take off, I couldn't wait to form the China division.

169
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,570
Do you know why?

170
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,220
You're worried that they couldn't wait that long.

171
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,510
You're worried that they would retire.

172
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,350
That's right. I couldn't wait.

173
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,730
I was afraid that they couldn't wait for me.

174
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,610
But no one expected that all 4 of them went to SP.

175
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,640
So you were left all alone, and became the Boss of KK.

176
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,630
Are you bored by the story?

177
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,420
Not at all! I like to hear you tell me these things.

178
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,860
When the 5 of us won the championship,

179
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,550
I felt like the sky belongs to us, the world belongs to us!

180
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,380
As long as the 5 of us work together, there's nothing that we can't do.

181
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,900
Do you know why the Earth spins?

182
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,020
Because of the sun's gravitational pull.

183
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,190
Wrong. It's because the Earth doesn't want everyone to stay in the same spot.

184
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,830
Whether happy or sad,

185
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,780
it hopes everyone can look forward.

186
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,150
After so many years, your dreams have all came true, right?

187
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,350
All that you went through only served to make you better.

188
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,310
But I have one more dream that hasn't come true yet.

189
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,270
What's that?

190
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,870
This is the championship ring that I got when I won my first championship.

191
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,520
It's a little big. You may not be able to wear it.

192
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,500
Who says I can't wear it?

193
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,590
I can wear it on my bracelet. Or I can get another bracelet for it too!

194
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,750
You can figure out a way to wear it.

195
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,260
Tong Nian.

196
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,750
Let's get married.

197
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,720
Married.

198
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,650
Okay?

My parents...

201
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,830
How would we talk to my parents about this?

202
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,810
If we get married now, what happens if they hate you?

203
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,970
I already spoke with them about it.

204
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm not lying to you.

205
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,110
When my step-mom came last time, she came to meet your parents.

206
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,280
So our parents have already met each other.

207
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,340
And I've also promised them that I'm going to take good care of you.

This is the first time someone's proposed to me.

214
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,120
Give me a second. I'm a bit...

215
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,530
I'm especially nervous. I feel like I'm seeing double everywhere!

216
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,970
I'm sorry. Give me some time.

217
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,630
Let me—

218
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,050
I'm not going to eat you!

219
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,390
Feel my hands! My hands are ice cold.

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,850
I didn't expect... I didn't expect you to...

221
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,590
Don't worry. Don't worry.

222
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,050
It's fine.

223
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,550
It's fine. Don't worry.

224
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,580
It's fine.

225
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,050
Why did you take it back?

226
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,020
I...

227
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,860
- I was too impulsive.
- What?

228
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,920
Next time.

229
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,140
When will the next time be?

230
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,420
Didn't you propose to me today?

231
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,700
We can talk about it later.

232
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,760
Let's go eat first.

233
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,260
Then when will you propose next time?

234
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,530
When you no longer have any doubts and hesitations towards me,

235
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,760
and you sincerely want to say yes.

236
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,730
Let's go eat.

237
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,840
<i>I didn't agree to his proposal. Is he going to be okay?</i>

238
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,630
You didn't eat, are you hungry?

239
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,370
I'm not hungry.

240
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,900
Did you think back to the days when you first came to Beijing?

241
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,500
<i>Why did she reject me?</i>

242
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,560
<i>Between the two of us, could it be that there is still a problem that cannot be resolved?</i>

243
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,230
<i>Why did I reject him at that time?</i>

244
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,470
<i>I don't know.</i>

245
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,170
<i>Could it be because it was too sudden?</i>

246
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,590
<i>Or is it that in my heart, I am scared of something?</i>

247
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,240
Later on, I have to go hang out with my bros. We might go out for the entire night.

248
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,020
I won't be able to stay with you.

249
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,470
If you want to sleep here or go back to your room and sleep, that's fine.

250
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,090
I'm going.

251
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,970
Han Shangyan.

252
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,390
Are you... afraid of sleeping alone in the dark?

253
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,970
Your mood right now, it's... okay?

254
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,300
It's great.

255
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,470
That's good.

256
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm going to go now.

257
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,560
Go ahead.

258
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,150
- Bye.
- Bye.

259
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,990
What? Han Shangyan proposed to you and you... you rejected him?

260
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,870
No! I didn't reject him! At the time...

261
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,260
My head was just buzzing...

262
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,660
So I... I-I... I... I was just stunned, you know?

263
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,740
If you didn't say yes, isn't that still rejection?

264
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,350
No, I...

265
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,210
What do I do... Hurry and help me think of something.

266
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,490
Nian Nian. Tonight, your boyfriend only just returned to the competition circuit.

267
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,700
He finished a true farewell match and beat the top 5 hottest players right now.

268
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,320
<i>Do you know the fans all cried so much, they were so touched that they almost went crazy!</i>

269
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,970
And at this time, he proposed to you, Tong Nian.

270
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,680
He brought his championship ring to propose to you.

271
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,840
<i>Do you know how precious that thing is?</i>

272
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,610
<i>The championship ring from Gun God's first win.</i>

273
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,370
<i>There's only one in the entire world.</i>

274
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,260
And on top, it has G-U-N engraved on it.

275
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,210
Do you know what this means?

276
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,140
At the time my mind was just blank.

277
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,880
I just kept feeling like there was something missing in the middle.

278
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,340
Or... how about this?

279
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,190
So that he doesn't feel sad, I'll go and say I want the ring?

280
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,340
Are... are you stupid?

281
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,260
No one asks for the ring beforehand!

282
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,830
Then what should I do?

283
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,290
Can you not scold me anymore, I already feel really bad.

284
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,980
I also don't know what to do.

285
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,930
Bye Bye.

286
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,000
What should I do?

287
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,720
Gun God is finally here.

288
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,520
You're here?

289
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,260
What big things did you go do? So secretive.

290
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,810
Sure you can?

291
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,680
If you'd come any later, I'd be drunk already!

292
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,430
- Yeah!
- Where did you go? Punish yourself with three cups!

293
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,730
- Get three cups!
- Punish yourself with three cups! Hurry!

294
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,380
Old rules.

295
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,990
Pretending to be in deep thought.

296
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,850
You went to propose?

297
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,820
- Propose?
- Propose?

298
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,690
Propose?

299
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,390
You really intend to marry?

300
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,450
Stop messing around.

301
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,820
You got rejected?

302
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,370
Look at his deflated expression, it's probably true.

303
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,750
You have a lot to say!

304
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,580
Don't be anxious!

305
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,250
- We're all bros.
- Yeah!
- Tell us the truth.

306
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,950
Han Shangyan, you really got rejected?

307
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,450
Didn't she pursue you?

308
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,540
A girl and she backward pursued?

309
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,590
Yep. He's got all the luck with women.

310
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,310
How did you fail?

311
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,750
Tell the bros. We'll work it out for you!

312
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,200
Who said I failed?

313
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,690
I just... suddenly didn't want to propose.

314
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,550
So you proposed halfway and then stopped?

315
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,830
Why? You regretted it?

316
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,320
Han Shangyan, a proposal is a major thing. It's not a trifling matter.

317
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,540
Who said I was treating it like a trifling matter?

318
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,230
She was way too nervous!

319
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,600
She was sweating all over, her face was pale. If it was you, would you keep proposing?

320
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,640
Are you stupid or something?

321
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,480
- That girl, that's the sweat of happiness, right?
- Yeah!

322
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,950
What girl who is being proposed to wouldn't be nervous?

323
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,360
You guys don't understand.

324
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,380
I'm just afraid that she hasn't thought it through and if she impulsively agrees, that in the future she will regret it.

325
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,300
It hasn't been a smooth path for us.

326
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,590
Tell us! We're anxious to death.

327
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,420
Once she was nervous, I thought, was I too impulsive?

328
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,940
After all, today was the farewell match. I'm not very calm.

329
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,380
Besides, there's no other people in my heart anyways.

330
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,590
Let's just take it slow.

331
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,490
Why do you guys keep staring at me?

332
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,210
I'm done talking.

333
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,690
You're just going to leave like that?

334
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,480
If you're not willing to talk about it, we won't ask anymore.

335
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,210
Say, bro. Let's stop pretending to be deep.

336
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,640
This little heart, was already thumping nonstop early on, wasn't it?

337
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,320
Perturbed.

338
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,830
You're afraid the girl will run?

339
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,190
This guy...

340
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,500
Han Shangyan, you're a woman. You're even scared to court a girl!

341
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,280
I am talking about you! You don't even dare to pursue a girl!

342
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,210
Wing Chun martial arts, right?

343
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,090
It hurts.

344
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,980
If I don't teach you a lesson, you won't know who's the boss here, is that it?

345
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,280
- Han Shangyan, what you said is wrong!
- That hurts!

346
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,570
In this house, who is the boss?

347
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,850
Bros. Make him know who the team captain is! Get him!

348
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,370
Who's the boss?

349
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,520
You're the boss?

350
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,220
Keep acting out, huh? Keep acting up!

351
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,280
You're brokenhearted and you vent your anger on your bros, is that it?

352
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,350
Keep acting up, then.

353
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,140
This little face, this beauty!

354
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,320
You're a woman. Give me a kiss!

355
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,600
Give me a kiss!

356
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,130
Say it, say it! What do you want? What do you want?

357
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,630
Let's go gaming all night. What do you think?

358
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,000
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

365
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,030
I'm so bored. Pink, pink, up! Pink, pink, up!

366
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,440
Wu Bai, sorry for bothering you.

367
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,510
I wanted to ask you a few things regarding Han Shangyan. Is it convenient for you?

368
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,540
It's convenient.

369
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,530
I actually wanted to ask you

370
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,190
your brother, in the past has he been rejected by someone before?

371
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,460
I mean in terms of love.

372
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,470
No.

373
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,090
You're his first love. He never took a liking to anyone else.

374
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:13,250
Then... all these years, he's never had a girl he liked?

375
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,360
Why would he like me?

376
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:22,410
Maybe... you're the first one who liked him not because of his achievements in CTF.

377
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,600
When the average person sees his scowling face or his bad temper they would've run away long ago.

378
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,290
Why do you like him?

379
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:33,580
Me? I fell in love with him at first sight.

380
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,940
When you hear that, it might be a bit hard to understand.

381
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,680
But when I first saw him,

382
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,480
I felt that he was the most special person on this planet.

383
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,450
I wasn't simply attracted by his handsomeness.

384
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,190
I really think that he is charming, different from everyone else.

385
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,590
Besides, I really idolize him.

386
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,090
The more I got to know him, I realized that

387
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,580
he has become very awkward and doesn't know how to love

388
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,410
because he lacked a lot of love when he was young.

389
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,060
Thinking about it, he is pretty pitiful.

390
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,120
So it's fortunate that you appeared.

391
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,880
In this period of time, I find that he has become a lot softer.

392
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,260
Telling you honestly, I also really like him like this.

393
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,770
Then he... for example, if someone rejected him for something... afterwards, would he bear a grudge?

394
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,940
Or would he become really fragile, sensitive, or something like that?

395
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,000
Solo disbanded the team... and he remembers that until now.

396
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,360
That's true.

397
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,930
Whatever question you have, just ask directly.

398
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,420
Beating around the bush wastes too much time.

399
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,550
He proposed to me, but I rejected him.

400
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,390
At the time he proposed so suddenly, and in that moment I was stunned and didn't think it through at all.

401
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,570
Do you think he's angry?

402
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,340
That's pretty good too.

403
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,270
Let him have a sense of crisis of losing you.

404
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,490
Perhaps, that's not a bad thing.

405
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,650
I'm guessing that he still doesn't really understand how to love you.

406
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,180
44, 45.

407
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,110
46.

408
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,640
Scram. Count properly!

409
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,250
You're a little too weak, aren't you?

410
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,820
We just did 200, and we didn't even shout.

411
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,520
-Continue.
-47.

412
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,780
48, 49.

413
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,030
50.

414
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,800
Little Mi!

415
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:42,440
You had to do 200 because you lost to us four times!

416
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,390
- It sounds like you're unsatisfied.
- Unsatisfied.

417
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,350
- Then, let's battle again!
- Come!

418
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,680
Come! Who is afraid of who?

419
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,270
Continue.

420
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,740
So just now, in the end how many did you guys do?

421
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,010
Not that many less than you.

422
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,960
I think it was 200 or 300.

423
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,200
It was 300!

424
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,950
Instant noodles are coming!

425
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,600
- Instant noodles are coming!
- Instant noodles are coming.

426
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,190
Sorry, only three are left. Please make do with it.

427
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,960
Thank you! Keep the change.

428
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,930
No need, no need. You guys are Team Solo, right?

429
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,320
I just finished watching your competition. It was so impressive.

430
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,860
- Did your blood boil with passion?
- Yes!

431
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,660
Awesome!

432
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,530
Give it your all! My treat.

433
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,010
- Thank you!
- Thank you!
- Bye!

434
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,100
Old rules.

435
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,620
Girls, and the youngest ones eat first.

436
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,680
I'm already an old man now, team captain.

437
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,810
- We can't break the rules.
- We're letting you eat first so eat. Stop talking nonsense.

438
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,410
That's right! Come. The rest, we'll divide among everyone.

439
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,940
These few days, it's like I was dreaming.

440
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,560
I especially want to return to when I was twenty in the days when we were hanging out together.

441
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,590
For people, a lifetime goes by so fast.

442
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,790
It ends just like that.

443
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,330
Say something nicer to hear!

444
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,410
Yi Qian. I remember in the earlier years you didn't wear glasses.

445
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,300
What have you been doing recently?

446
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,910
My work is selling medical equipment.

447
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,680
That's a good job. You don't have to worry about your salary.

448
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,290
- It's a good job.
- Just doing it for the money.

449
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,060
Why are you sighing? What do you do?

450
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,320
I also sell machines.

451
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,660
Anyway, my life isn't as dynamic as yours.

452
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,240
It's just work. All the same.

453
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,800
Of course there's a difference!

454
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,530
At least in your hearts you guys still have this!

455
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:29,000
Thirty years old and you guys can still have a heart just like a twenty year old. That's so hard to come by!

456
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,900
When you first brought Mi Shaofei and the others back,

457
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,050
didn't you post on Weibo on behalf of the club?

458
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,420
I still remember that quote!

459
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,070
Listen up.

460
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,670
"Our dream has been sleeping for a long time.

461
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,770
All of our past effort and honor

462
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,290
have been renewed,

463
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,220
- starting from this moment."
- Starting from this moment.

464
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,720
So great!

465
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,550
Yes!

466
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:32,510
<i> Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki
Ripped & Resync By HiDeYuKi KaKaShI</i>

467
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,620
We're leaving.

468
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,090
You guys can do it!

469
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,070
This time coming back, I'm most happy to see that you and Old Han are back to how you used to be.

470
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,040
Once our team captain, always our team captain.

471
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,840
If you guys are free, you need to come back more often, you know?

472
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,620
SP Club will always be Team Solo's home.

473
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,260
Of course.

474
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,800
Go!

475
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,090
Okay.

476
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,950
GOod luck.

477
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,760
I will miss you guys.

478
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,540
Safe travels.

479
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,020
Have a safe trip.

480
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,780
Give it your all!

481
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,420
We're going!

482
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,010
Good luck, you two!

483
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,740
Good luck!

484
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,430
There's no banquet in this world that doesn't end.

485
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,820
It's not like you'll never see them again.

486
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,570
We'll meet again.

487
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,920
You're back.

488
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,010
You must be tired.

489
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,900
I'm okay, not tired.

490
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,770
Do you want to go eat breakfast?

491
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,760
Okay. I'll go wash up a bit.

492
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,220
<i>Nian Nian, just pretend like nothing happened!</i>

493
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,420
<i>Treat him so well that he can't help but propose to you again!</i>

494
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,540
To be honest, although they say men cannot be spoiled,

495
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,770
but on his farewell match you rejected him.

496
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,910
Then emotionally, you do need to make it up to him!

497
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,220
<i>That's right just treat him super well. </i>

498
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,620
Sis, I think that men always want to save face.

499
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,540
You broke him, you need to give him a way to back out gracefully! Are you stupid?

500
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,000
I'll be done soon! I'm brushing my teeth.

501
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,610
No need to hurry.

502
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,390
No need to hurry.

503
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,360
That... I-I am going to change.

504
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,580
Going to change. Not in a hurry.

505
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:10,580
But this door is translucent... I can still see you.

506
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,870
What do you want to eat? I'll go get it for you.

507
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,170
No, no! Sit. I'll go get it for you.

508
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:37,420
If I go get it for you, isn't it right and proper?

509
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,410
No. Last night you didn't sleep at all, I was afraid that you were too tired.

510
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,700
What do you want to eat? Are fried eggs okay?

511
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,560
If I was tired, I wouldn't have come down to eat.

512
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,680
I was afraid that you just wanted to accompany me and that's why you came down.

513
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:00,500
I do not wish to make you feel that I came down here to eat just to accompany you.

514
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,590
I hope that you can have your own ideas and make your own choices.

515
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,770
I can eat anything.

516
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,440
Do you want to drink coffee?

517
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,810
Milk? Or milk

518
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,870
I have hands and feet, so why do you have to help me?

519
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,220
I heard that yesterday Boss' marriage proposal was rejected.

520
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,600
- No way! What kind of situation is this?
- Oh my God!

521
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,220
So right now they are performing ex's battle of defense.

522
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,000
You guys believe what he says? It's definitely that Sister-in-law wanted to get married,

523
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,560
Boss loves to chatter. Probably set a whole bunch of stipulations.

524
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,140
Sister-in-law told me! Manager, you be my witness!

525
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,150
Love is not something that us outsiders can understand!

526
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,440
Boss is so pitiful.

527
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,260
It's time someone teach him a lesson.

528
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,310
And it can vent frustrations for those of us who are usually bullied by him.

529
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,990
I feel that saying it like that is going too far, isn't it?

530
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,160
Okay. Eat, eat, eat!

531
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,640
It's really tasty!

532
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,010
Hello, would you like to drink anything?

533
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,560
No need.

534
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,930
I was afraid you would be cold, and I don't know how to adjust this so I covered you with a blanket.

535
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,400
Thank you.

536
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,550
- You're not going to sleep a little?
- I'm not going to sleep, you sleep!

537
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,530
<i>Tong Nian, let's get married.</i>

538
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,300
<i>Get married.</i>

539
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,120
<i>Okay?</i>

540
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,550
<i>My dad and mom... how do we tell my dad and mom?</i>

541
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,130
<i>If we get married now,</i>

542
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,750
<i>if they don't like you, what do we do?</i>

543
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:38,130
<i>You... still aren't ready?</i>

544
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,350
<i>It's the first time someone has proposed to me.</i>

545
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,700
<i>Just wait a minute, my mood right now...</i>

546
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,830
<i>I'm especially nervous. I feel like everything I see right now is double.</i>

547
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,800
I was too impulsive.

548
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,570
Next time.

549
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,370
When is next time?

550
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,470
In your eyes, am I especially useless?

551
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,260
No personality, lots of shortcomings.

552
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,220
And...

553
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,340
Is it that because I didn't accept your proposal, you are still angry about it now?

554
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,940
I'm not angry.

555
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,490
I'm just a bit... disappointed?

556
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,360
♫ <i>I carefully covered up</i> ♫

557
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,230
On the contrary, I don't feel that you have shortcomings.

558
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,520
The one with shortcomings is actually me.

559
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,050
It's just that in the time that we have been together,

560
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,530
you've always been accommodating to things that make me happy or angry, sad or joyous.

561
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,510
But instead, you lost your own personality... didn't you?

♫ <i>I attempted to cherish this experience</i> ♫

563

564
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,910
I'm afraid I‘m not worthy of you.

565
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,340
So I just wanted... wanted to be able to silently support you,

566
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,700
I didn't want to be a useless person.

567
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,630
How could you be useless? You've helped me a lot.

568
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,380
You've taught me how to love someone, did you not realize?

569
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,700
I have been trying hard, trying hard to become a better me.

570
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,250
So, I need to thank you.

571
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:20,330

Are your dad and mom home?

580
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,710
No, they're still not off work.

581
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,390
Then, I won't go in. Later on, go take a shower and rest earlier.

582
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,570
Do you want to go in for a little bit?

583
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:14,720
What I mean is... do you want to eat dinner before you leave?

584
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,970
After the Asian Championships, I'll spend more time with you.

Okay.

Why did you come back?

587
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,560
Passing the door and not entering, it's shameful.
