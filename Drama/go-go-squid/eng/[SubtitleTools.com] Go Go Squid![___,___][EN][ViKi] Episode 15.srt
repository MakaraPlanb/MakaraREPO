Tong Nian, what are you planning to do today?

23
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,890
Today?

24
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,340
Last time when you treated us to food, you mentioned your birthday. Do you remember?

25
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,030
Yes, I remember.

26
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,030
It’s today.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,770
Then, how are you planning to celebrate?

28
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,280
Today... I... don’t really want to celebrate it.

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,500
<i>He already has a girlfriend, what's there to celebrate?</i>

30
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,710
<i>Celebrate that I returned to being single and that he already found someone?</i>

31
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,950
Tong Nian, I... am graduating soon.

32
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,350
Congratulations to you.

33
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,700
Tong Nian, I...

34
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,260
I prepared you a present.

35
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,860
So, I... I want to...

00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,920
Why the long face?

38
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,600
I don't...

39
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,720
You bullied her?

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,170
No, I didn’t. I'm her senior.

41
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,120
We compete in coding competitions together.

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,550
Brother, please don't misunderstand.

43
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,010
ACM competition?
<i>(International Collegiate Programming Contest)</i>

44
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,420
You know ACM?

45
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,410
Did you compete with the person over there?

46
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,920
I... I remember him.

47
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,060
He... He also competed in ACM.

48
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,970
I remember he was with two blonde boys.

49
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,980
They spoke English the whole time.

50
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,200
World champion! Tong Nian, the world champion!

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
He's the captain of the world champion team!

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,710
World champion?

53
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,180
Losing to him isn't embarrassing.

54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,860
Young man, you have to accept your loss.

55
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,510
Can we go now?

56
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,650
Where are we going?

57
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,380
We're going to go play. I'll send you back before nine.

58
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,930
Bye-bye, Zheng Hui.

59
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,020
How did you know I was at school?

60
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,420
I asked Lan Mei's husband and he asked Lan Mei.

61
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,130
You have so many spies.

62
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,340
You're the ACM's world champion?

63
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,510
Not a big deal.

64
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,500
I couldn't tell you were so amazing.

65
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,050
I don't want to be bullied by you later on.

66
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,910
I won't go back home with you later. Let me borrow the car.

67
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,000
Why aren't you returning?

68
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,750
My sixth sense tells me it's best to stay away.

69
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,550
I have a question.

70
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,010
We aren't going out to play, but we're playing at your house. Right?

71
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,090
Grandpa wants to see you. I had no other choice, so help me.

72
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,270
Is that so? I like seeing Grandpa, too.

73
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,690
Don't worry, I'll help out.

74
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,810
Just this once. It won't be repeated.

75
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,380
Shouldn't I say that?

76
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,590
Then, we're going. Bye-bye.

77
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,620
I've brought her here.

78
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,880
- Nian Nian.
- Hello, Grandpa!

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,740
You're here!

80
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,150
- Have you been busy?
- No, not very.

81
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,340
Where's Little Bai?

82
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,710
He escaped.

83
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,690
- Escaped?
- Little Bai said...

84
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,230
He said he had friends and went to find them.

85
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,640
When did he have friends?

86
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,090
This is the first I've ordered this steak take-out. I don't know if it's good or not.

87
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,190
Except... this cake was bought by Han Shangyan.

88
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,370
Originally, I told him to make the steak but he said it was too bothersome.

89
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,600
You know how to cook steak?

90
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,700
If you live alone for too long, you learn a bit of everything.

91
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,580
Nian Nian, next week I'll be going back in Norway.

92
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,800
After I return this time, it'll be hard to come back to China.

93
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,500
Because of the long plane ride, my old bones can't take it.

94
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,360
Oh right, I heard from your parents that you have flight phobia?

95
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,090
Do you still?

96
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,640
- Flight phobia?
- Flight phobia?

97
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,440
I don't have that fear.

98
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,220
I always go to different places overseas to compete for my school. I fly often.

99
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,750
Really? Then, that's strange.

100
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,420
Last time, I was talking with your mom

101
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,830
and I said, "If Nian Nian has time, let her go play in Norway."

102
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,470
You can ask Han Shangyan to travel around with you.

103
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,180
But she said you have a flight phobia and can't ride airplanes.

104
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,890
My mom might think that since I'm a little girl, if I go out, I can't protect myself.

105
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,410
So, she said I have a fear of flying.

106
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,080
But she probably tells everyone else that, too.

107
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,280
That's good, that's good; reduced many troubles.

108
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,530
Troubles?

109
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,010
Because I was questioning whether your wedding should be in the country or out.

110
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,200
Wedding?

111
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,680
We didn't say anything about marriage.

112
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,500
- I'm full.
- Wait, wait, wait!

113
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,390
When I found a blind date for you, you didn't like her.

114
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,080
Then, you have such a great girl like Nian Nian, and you don't want to marry.

115
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,160
Just what do you want to do?

116
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,420
Where are you going?

117
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,200
Conference call.

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,550
Take your time.

119
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,380
Han Shangyan! Come back here! I'm talking to you!

120
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,150
Come back here! I'm talking to you!

121
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,140
- Remember today is Nian Nian's birthday!
- Grandpa, it's okay.

122
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,410
Don't be mad, I'll eat with you.

123
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,500
Since he was a teenager, all he does is game.

124
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,980
Now, he's older but still only cares about playing the computer.

125
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,620
He doesn't know how to do something more productive.

126
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,530
Nian Nian, my grandson is disappointing. It must be hard for you.

127
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,600
No, Grandpa. It's not hard at all.

128
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,770
Honestly, I like seeing him work in this field.

129
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,590
Don't speak for him.

130
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,290
He's played on computers for so long and I've worried for that long.

131
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,790
But he is still respectful towards me.

132
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,150
He doesn't talk back, or else I would've been frustrated to death long ago.

133
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,130
Grandpa, you might've misunderstood him.

134
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,580
Actually, he isn't playing.

135
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,480
Those are official competitions; he's gaining glory for the country.

136
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,130
This... I know!

137
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,610
He and Little Bai tell me about it all day.

138
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,900
They said they are coaches and professional competitors, that it's official.

139
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,780
But I know that they only wanted to comfort me.

140
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,630
They aren't comforting you. It's all true.

141
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,570
Grandpa, I think this is proof of their hard work achieved through many years.

142
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,580
Grandpa, did you know?

143
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,020
Ten or so years ago, when he first got into CTF, China's environment was very lacking.

144
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,900
There weren't any coaches or clubs.

145
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,730
There also weren't any experienced seniors.

146
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,560
But they depended on themselves and created a world of their own.

147
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,960
They let the whole world know that there was a team that came from China, called Solo.

148
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,270
They also let everyone know that there was a powerful competitor in CTF,

149
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,480
that is Han Shangyan.

150
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,970
Grandpa, every time I think of this, I'm very proud.

151
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,680
Especially when I think about his retirement speech, my heart really aches for him.

152
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,020
So, I can understand his passion for CTF.

153
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,210
No, no.

154
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,540
- His retirement speech?
- Yes.

155
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,600
When his career was at its peak, he chose to retire.

156
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,310
That time, he said a speech.

157
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,590
I remember that many people use his speech as a personality signature

158
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,530
on websites, discussion boards, and even official websites.

159
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,250
Let me see.

160
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,810
I've already memorized it.

161
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,080
I'll tell you now.

162
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,640
"In the two years and three months that have passed,

163
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,890
there have been wins and losses,

164
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,520
laughter and crying,

165
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,240
we've been questioned and gossiped about,

166
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,640
we've been criticized and blacklisted.

167
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,930
We never had to give explanations, there was no need to explain.

168
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,950
Tonight's feast finally comes to an end

169
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:55,070
Success and fame are blinding folly."

170
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,600
Grandpa, do you understand now?

171
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,940
He really loves this profession. Just like me.

172
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,260
I also really love my programming, but maybe the level of my passion is not even as great as his.

173
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,550
Nian Nian, I'm sorry.

174
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,960
A moment ago I was taken in anger.

175
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,720
Actually, these many years, I've been worrying about Han Shangyan,

176
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,610
so I've been constantly watching his profession.

177
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,760
To me, it may be a sort of new product of your younger generation.

178
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,210
I've been trying all along to find a way to understand it, to know it.

179
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:01,520
I get it. For sure, this profession for us is all a new product.

180
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,120
When I was little, I didn't even know the word "network security."

181
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,940
I'd never gotten in contact with it, either.

182
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,170
I... really never thought I could meet Han Shangyan.

183
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,920
He is able to persist and stay true to himself in such a small profession.

184
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,260
I really admire him a lot.

185
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:26,040
In the past, there was not even the word "Artificial Intelligence," so I admire you, too.

186
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,160
Thank you, Grandpa.

187
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,650
Actually, with this society prospering,

188
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,600
more and more new products and new professions will be born.

189
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,130
You young people in this generation are very lucky.

190
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,430
If this was 10 or 20 years ago,

191
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,380
this society wouldn't have been so accommodating.

192
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,480
It wouldn't have let you, youngsters, have a choice among so many passions.

193
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,980
Sure, my parents often say that, too.

194
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,760
Grandpa, look, you just spoke so much with me.

195
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,250
Actually deep in your heart, you already understand him.

196
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,380
Why, then, do you always yell at him?

197
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,780
I... am old.

198
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,830
There are some things that I can open my mind to.

199
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,960
But as soon as I get mad,

200
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,340
I just give a tantrum and take it out on him.

201
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,240
After my tantrum, I also regret it.

202
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,490
I'll think of a way to understand him because he's my grandson.

203
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:43,630
But if your parents have no way to understand him,

204
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:49,910
that will be hard on you two because, after all, sooner or later you'll have to discuss marriage.

205
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,870
Grandpa, let's not talk about this for now. Eat something.

206
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,680
No. No. No.

207
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,150
That day, I could tell.

208
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,760
Your parents are not very satisfied with Han Shangyan, are they?

209
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,270
They... never mentioned it to me.

210
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,300
If they never mentioned it, it's best.

211
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:18,670
Actually, this grandson of mine has a lot of flaws.

212
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,790
But his merits are numerous, too.

213
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,770
You need to be in touch with him for a long time to know that.

214
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,030
I know, Grandpa.

215
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,970
In truth I said it long ago: to me, everything about Han Shangyan is good.

216
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,130
Good, good.

217
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,030
Nian Nian, today's your birthday, so you should be happy.

218
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,960
I'm extremely happy today.

219
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,680
Do you mean to say that spending your birthday with Han Shangyan makes you extremely happy?

220
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,440
Come, come, eat, quick.

221
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,400
Grandpa, you eat, too.

222
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,760
I'll toast to you. Thank you, Grandpa.

223
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,130
<i>In the two years and three months that have passed,</i>

224
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,030
<i>there have been wins and losses,</i>

225
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,110
<i>laughter and crying,</i>

226
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,480
<i>we've been questioned and gossiped about,</i>

227
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,390
<i>we've been criticized and blacklisted.</i>

228
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,990
<i>We never made explanations,</i>

229
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,960
<i> there was no need to explain.</i>

230
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,270
<i>Tonight's reception has eventually come to an end.</i>

231
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,190
<i>Our achievements reached fame, but it is all viewed as ridiculous.</i>

232
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,900
<i>Don't be like that! Don't leave! Stay!</i>

233
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:04,960

234
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,070
Careful.

235
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,620
Okay.

236
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,460
Grandpa, take some rest. I'll just be in in the living room. Call me for anything.

237
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,680
No need, no need.

238
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,770
Go look for Han Shangyan and have fun.

239
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,460
Look, he prepared this for me.

240
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,980
If I press it,

241
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,780
he can hear me.

242
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,620
- Go, go.
- All right.

243
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,270
I'll pull the curtains for you so that the sun doesn't bother your rest.

244
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,610
Good. Grandpa, I'm going then.

245
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,990
- What happened to Grandpa?
- Nothing... he's just taking an afternoon nap.

246
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,140
- Then, what about that bell?
- Grandpa was showing it to me as an example.

247
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,940
It's nothing.

248
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,400
How about you go sit in the yard? I'll cut some fruits.

249
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,100
All right.

250
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,410
I don't know what you like to eat. Is mango okay?

251
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,200
Sure... Okay, no problem.

252
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,550
Aside from my name, Han Shangyan, what else do you know?

253
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,250
Actually, I don't know much.

254
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,760
I've just seen the videos of your public competitions and, also, of your interviews.

255
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,680
Nothing else.

256
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,100
Han Shangyan: birthday February 14;

257
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,720
born in Norway;

258
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,120
at age 18, chose Chinese nationality.

259
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,090
I was a professional CTF player for a few years.

260
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,580
The rankings and awards I obtained can all be found on the Internet.

261
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,590
Two years later, I retired.

262
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,070
I went to university for a few years, majored in Industrial design.

263
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,770
After graduation, I founded the K&K club in Norway.

264
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,500
I'm the first investor and I'm also one of the bosses of the club.

265
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,490
After establishing K&K club's section in China, I've been permanently residing here.

266
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,550
I know all of this; it's all on the net.

267
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,270
I have an unsociable personality.

268
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,100
Even though I know that CTF is a world of coding,

269
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:39,380
it seems only in this world I'm able to find calmness and balance.

270
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,780
I don't like peppers and eggplants, but I like candy.

271
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:50,530
Every time I'm troubled or feel like yelling at someone, I'll stuff candy in my mouth to stop myself from speaking.

272
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,900
I hate the feeling of being restrained and confined.

273
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,760
That's why I don't like to fight with my grandpa.

274
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,530
I'm mad at him that he always wants to decide my future for me.

275
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,310
I'm also mad at those people who look at CTF with doubt and mistrust

276
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,920
because they don't know that those kids have a dream.

277
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,980
They study hard hoping to create their future with their own two hands.

278
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,900
Am I talking too much?

279
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,200
Not at all. I like hearing you talk about this.

280
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,340
<i>Such a detailed explanation,</i>

281
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,850
<i>with information that can't even be found on Baidu Baike,

282
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,100
<i>is coming out from his mouth word by word.</i>

283
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,370
<i>It seems he's telling me:</i>

284
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,380
<i>"Welcome in my world, Tong Nian."</i>

285
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,740
This is a sort of official presentation of myself.

286
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,550
Don't take me for some hero like they say on the Internet.

287
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,110
I'm not. You know?

288
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,160
So, do you want to yell at someone right now?

289
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,320
I just saw you eat candy.

290
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,670
What I want to tell you is...

291
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,340
that I'm no prince.

292
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,500
I have a bad temper, have no gentlemanly manner, I don't like romance,

293
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,560
I don't even have time for dates.

294
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,030
My whole life is about K&K, about my team members.

295
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,660
Very monotonous. No fun. No trips, no holidays.

296
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,300
I detest social events even more.

297
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,590
I don't even have days off, festivities, or vacations.

298
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,230
So, I'll give you one more chance.

299
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,430
Do you still want to break up?

300
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,410
♫ <i>So many times I wish I could leave</i> ♫

301
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,670

♫ <i>Nothing to hide, not be afraid</i> ♫

303
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,690
You haven't decided how to answer?

304
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,140
Or maybe you want to think about it some more?

305
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,170
I don't.

306
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:50,380
♫ <i>You found another way, I believe</i> ♫

307
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,380

♫ <i>So many times I wish I could leave</i> ♫

311
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,770
Then we won't.

312
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,080
For the things I didn't do well before, please be tolerant with me.

313
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,790
Okay, then. Get to know each other first, is that good?

314
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,260
Okay.

315
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,600
Actually, I'm not very reliable. I always bring trouble to my friends.

316
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,990
After knowing me, you'll find there's nothing to like about me.

317
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,880
I need to take a conference call first.

318
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,040
Go ahead.

319
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,900
<i>- Old Han!
- Boss is back!</i>

320
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,660
Hello.

321
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,700
Sorry, I was cut off just now.
<i>[Connecting...]</i>

322
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,790
<i>Okay, let's continue.</i>

323
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,230
<i>There's two more clubs that just teamed up together.</i>

324
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,630
<i>All right, the game is on.</i>

325
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,330
Boss, do you know when China will start training for their new season?

326
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,490
Next month.

327
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,590
You guys go ahead, I'm still listening.

328
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,890
<i>Okay, there's two more teams.</i>

329
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,110
<i>It's a huge alliance, and they're all merged together. But I feel so sorry for this case.</i>

330
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,610
Because due to their sponsors, it caused their disbandment.

331
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,960
Law of the jungle; the strong one survives.

332
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,170
Nothing to be sorry for.

333
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,870
What're you staring at me for?

334
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,840
Nothing. Keep talking; don't pay attention to me.

335
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,170
Boss, your phone is still on.

336
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,940
<i>Boss, trust me. I don't understand Chinese.</i>

337
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,070
<i>Even if I couldn't hear everything, I know there is a girl nearby you.</i>

338
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,750
Awkward.

339
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,470
A frog's call.

340
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,300
<i>- Frog?
- What do you take us as?</i>

341
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,050
<i>Don't forget I know Chinese. I even know Shanghai dialect.</i>

342
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,220
I'm telling you, we have a girl here at our meeting, too!

343
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,900
So you need to pay attention to your actions, okay? Naughty!

344
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,140
Sorry, my bad. My girlfriend is here.

345
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,080
She's a bit moody. I gotta comfort her.

346
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,190
Just for a second.

347
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,810
I'll wait for you inside. Keep chatting, I won't bother you.

348
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,260
<i>So sweet.</i>

349
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,240
Nonsense, continue the conference.

350
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:52,040
<i>Old Han, to be truthful, I worry about you.</i>

351
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,440
About what?

352
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,720
<i>Did you forget what you promised your shareholders? </i>

353
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,900
<i>If this year, China cannot win first place, then they'll immediately disband.</i>

354
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,840
Did I ever say that? With who and when?

355
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,500
<i>I'm not joking with you right now, I'm speaking with you seriously.</i>

356
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,220
Do you have too little confidence in me or too much confidence in Team SP?

357
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,100
No, Old Han. I'm not saying I have no confidence in you.

358
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,720
If it were you competing, I would believe in you 100%.

359
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,810
But the problem is you are already retired. You cannot compete in place of five kids.

360
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:34,160
Back then when I just started competing, people didn't think highly of me either.

361
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,930
But at the end, we were still the ones that took the title of national champion, and it wasn't just one title.

362
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,950
That year was that year, now is now.

363
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,600
If you don't try, you'll never be able to see how strong these kids are.

364
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,600
National champion: it'll be ours.

365
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,640
Okay, I'll believe you for now.

366
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,160
Let's not talk longer, I have to bring a child home.

367
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,790
<i>What? A child?</i> He finally admitted it.

368
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,640
Admit what?

369
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,320
Last time, when you came to Norway to compete, you wouldn't admit she was your girlfriend.

370
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,830
You kept saying she was your friend and not girlfriend, "just friend."

371
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,860
<i>"Just friend," as if!</i>

372
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,750
Are you done? I'm hanging up.

373
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,990
Little Bai.

374
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,370
Little Bai.

375
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,020
You're back?

376
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,830
Something up?

377
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,160
You need to borrow money again?

378
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,000
No way.

379
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,630
I'll pay you back next month.

380
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,200
I have no more money.

381
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,350
It's her birthday.

382
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,490
Thanks.

383
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,360
- Just put it down and I can wash it.
- It's fine, I've finished.

384
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,670
Mosquito bite?

385
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,520
<i>- I can't let him know I'm allergic to mangoes.</i>
- Yes.

386
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,330
I was bitten by a mosquito.

387
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,800
Then, we...

388
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,470
Time to go.

389
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,320
Okay.

390
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,600
Thank you.

391
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,330
This. Do I need to help you?

392
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,340
It's fine, I can do it myself.

393
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,550
We... Are we still going anywhere?

394
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,820
Where do you want to go?

395
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,150
I don't...

396
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,770
- Nian Nian!
- Grandpa!

397
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,200
- You're going home?
- I'm going back.

398
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,370
Come by often.

399
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,110
Okay, okay.

400
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,690
Escort her out.

401
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,430
I was already going to, you don't have to remind me.

402
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,850
Let's go.

403
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,720
- I'll go then, Grandpa.
- Okay.

404
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,560
Bye, Grandpa.

405
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,260
Is it still not better?

406
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,530
No, no. I've used medicine, I'm fine now.

407
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,540
Can you let me see your car keys for a second?

408
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,140
Wait.

409
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,530
Here's your birthday present.

410
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,580
My birthday passed long ago, keep it for yourself.

411
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,390
I bought it for you on your birthday.

412
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,350
Even though your birthday passed, you can still use it.

413
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,230
I'll do it.

414
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,270
- Thanks.
- Do you like it?

415
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,580
I chose it according to your online username.

416
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,180
Gun: "Gun."

417
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,950
Right, today's your birthday.

418
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,200
- I'll take you to buy a present.
- No, no, there's really no need.

419
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,640
What are you being polite for? You give and take.

420
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,570
Seat belt.

421
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,090
Where should we go?

422
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,210
Anywhere is fine. Where do you usually go?

423
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,390
I have little chances to buy people presents.

424
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,190
Then, have you ever bought gifts for a girl?

425
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,520
I've already told you that I'm very practical. I don't know how to be romantic.

426
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,530
Then, will you be like regular people and

427
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,180
go watch a movie or have a meal?

428
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,010
Ever since I entered CTF,

429
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,890
the only thing I've cared about is the team's score

430
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,140
and how to let China take the World Champion title.

431
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,530
You're already amazing, really.

432
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,580
You have your own dreams, that's admirable.

433
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:57,750
But, I think shouldn't you... give yourself less pressure?

434
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,470
Of course, pursuing honor is important.

435
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,280
For example, if your team wins in a competition,

436
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,670
you can take that honor and share it with all the brothers on your team.

437
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:12,370
But when you lose in a competition or when you are going through hardships,

438
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,620
you must want to find someone to rant to.

439
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,870
Of course, being number one is really good,

440
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,790
but being number one must be also very tiring, isn't that so?

441
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,640
At the very least, this is what I think.

442
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,130
If you don't mind,

443
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,210
I am willing to be your listener.

444
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,320
To accompany you in times of unhappiness.

445
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,190
We're here. I usually come over here to buy things.

447
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,720
What should we buy?

448
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,290
No need! I have a lot of computer accessories at home. I don't need anymore.

449
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,650
- You have a lot of computer accessories?
- Yes.

450
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,970
You major in computers.

451
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,300
If you don't pick, I'll choose myself.

452
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,290
I really don't need them. I can't game; it'll be a waste of money.

453
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,590
These are very simple.

454
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,730
You're so smart. You'll figure it out in ten minutes.

455
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,290
Then, you buy and I'll learn. As long as you like it, I can learn it.

Even if you finish your courses, you need to continue to learn. What's that old saying?

508
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,810
"Learning is like a sea without boundaries."

509
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,240
Do you need me to finish the quote?

510
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,090
What's the second half?

511
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,300
"Only through studying hard can one reach their destination."

512
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,250
That...

513
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,240
Do we need... need to...

514
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,870
need to hug a bit?

515
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,200
No... No...

516
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,760
It's okay. This is the front of the school. There's quite a lot of people.

517
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,460
I'm not the one who wants to hug, but in dating, this is a necessary process.

518
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,950
I understand.

519
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:04,830
Look at that sweet potato stand. The students from my school all love eating sweet potatoes there.

520
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,120
It tastes delicious.

521
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,800
Wait for me.

522
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,780
Where are you going?

523
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,620
How much is it?

524
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,380
¥20.
<i>(~$3)</i>

525
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,490
Sorry, I forgot you didn't eat today.

526
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,940
You bought that much?

527
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,680
I don't know what you like to eat, so I bought a bit of everything.

528
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,010
You choose first. I'll take away the ones you don't like.

529
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,580
I like it all. I can eat all of them.

530
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,080
Can... Can you finish them?

531
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,950
Yes, I can. Yes, I can. Give it to me.

532
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,860
Also, the game machine.

533
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,490
Give it to me.

534
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,910
Are you really okay?

535
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,680
- I'm okay. No problem.
- Okay.

536
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,530
Then I'm leaving.

537
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,060
Goodbye.

538
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,840
Be careful!

539
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,440
Bye-bye.

540
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,580
Bye-bye!

541
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,330
Wow, did you get rich?

542
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:17,230
No, I just wanted to eat because I'm happy today.

543
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,050
I thought you weren't coming back today. I was prepared to eat instant noodles.

544
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,380
Today, Zheng Hui said your older brother came to the school to pick you up.

545
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,860
Since when did you have an older brother?

546
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,580
It wasn't my brother who came to pick me up.

547
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,270
Not your brother?

548
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,390
New boyfriend?

549
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,420
Let's eat together.

550
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,830
- He bought all these?
- Yes.

551
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,660
This is good.

552
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,610
The peach tree that doesn't blossom for 10,000 years, finally blossoms and blossoms in full.

553
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,770
Who is it this time?

554
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,970
Showing off affection dies fast. I won't say. I won't say. I won't say.

555
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,240
- What is it?
- He gave you these, too?

556
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,980
- He gave me that as my birthday present.
- This is good.

557
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,150
You don't even play these, why did he give you these?

558
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,630
What do you know?

559
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,800
He likes to play them. Whatever he likes to play, I can learn it.

560
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,580
- I definitely can learn to play.
- Sure, sure.

561
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,230
This one. It's super easy. Fits you.

562
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,370
Car racing. Good.

563
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,700
How do you know so much?

564
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,750
Of course. I'm a game expert.

565
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,430
This... These two. Gun-shooting ones. I used to love playing them.

566
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,300
Really?

567
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,550
Why are there so many labels on here?

568
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,610
There are pandas, turtles, and little piggies.

569
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:47,550
He labeled them for me. He said to follow the order to play. He's really nice.

570
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:51,430
Don't break 'em. Don't take them off. Or else—

571
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,700
"Tong Nian."

572
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,900
What did I just say? Told you not to take them off. Give it back.

573
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,660
- "Tong Nian."
- He labeled them for me. Don't mess them up.

574
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,000
- Oh, he labeled them for you?
- I have to follow this order!

575
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,060
Give it to me! Give it to me!

576
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,630
Don't mess it up!

577
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,580
You're so annoying. Seriously.

578
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,070
Good thing it's not broken. Eat your stuff.

579
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,080
Boss, I'm sorry. I woke up late.

580
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,100
After I finish eating, I'll go to practice.

581
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,490
It's okay.

582
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:31,170
Boss, can you have a bit more of a club boss's demeanor? Why are you still eating box lunches?

583
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,510
What wrong? Feel like you haven't been scolded enough normally?

584
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:39,940
No. I don't expect you to get a sports car or mansion,

585
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,760
but at least eat something good.

586
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,250
If someone were to capture a photo of you like this, people would think that our club is going into bankruptcy.

587
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,240
Are you complaining that you're not getting enough insurance or that your salary is too low?

588
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,590
- Don't be passive-aggressive with me.
- I'm not, I'm not.

589
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,550
I do not dare. I do not dare. You keep looking.

590
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,500
This... What's happening here?

591
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,960
Stop displeasing our boss.

592
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,040
I didn't. This...

593
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,180
Look at the date you picked. You really know how to throw yourself in front of the bus.

594
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,320
Wait. What's today? I see that there's a smile on Boss's face. It all seems good.

595
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,260
Today is Mi Shaofei's birthday.

596
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,680
Boss especially went to buy presents.

597
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,770
Little Mi's birthday?

598
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:15,050
Really?
