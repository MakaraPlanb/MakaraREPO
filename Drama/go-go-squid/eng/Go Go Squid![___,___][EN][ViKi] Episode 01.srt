Okay, okay. I'll help you. Is that enough?

162
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,110
- How are you going to help me?
 - Give him one week of free overnight rentals?

163
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,260
Just say that he won from a raffle.

164
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,130
Overnight rentals for a week?

165
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,020
No, no.

166
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,130
How about we give him a free week of an all-inclusive?

167
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,370
So then whenever he wants to come, he can come.

168
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,160
- Good idea. You go.
 - I have to go again?

169
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,430
Of course, it is you going.

170
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,710
You go and tell him, our internet cafe has a raffle game today.

171
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,390
But he must use WeChat to scan our QR code in order to get the prize.

172
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,260
Our store... doesn't have a public WeChat ID.
<i>(WeChat is a Chinese messaging, social media and mobile payment app)</i>

173
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,380
You opened an internet cafe and you don't have a public WeChat?

174
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,480
It's not really mine. I am only here to watch the store and collect the payments.

175
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,000
<i> "Predestined Tonight Cafe?"</i>

176
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,780
Use mine. Take it.

177
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,970
Let me speak a little bit.

178
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,140
Our internet cafe is having an activity: Christmas Raffle.

179
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,890
You won a big prize. One week for free. Everything for free!

180
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,780
No thanks.

181
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,180
This is a rare opportunity. Free internet access for one week. It's free.

182
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,900
Brother.

183
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,460
Our internet cafe really can't make the change for you.

184
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,440
Is there another payment method?

185
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,850
Keep the change.

186
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,610
I can't do that. My mom said one must be honest in conducting business.

187
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,700
I must give you your change back.

188
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,310
Then let's use WeChat Pay.

189
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,820
Sorry about that.

190
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Our WeChat Pay suddenly broke.

191
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,340
Then how can I pay?

192
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,940
Make a transfer.

193
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,010
But I need to friend you on WeChat.

194
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,250
I'll add you.

195
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,520
Oh right, Brother! Don't forget.

196
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,220
One free week of internet. It's all free, bro!

197
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,900
This is his WeChat. I got it for you.

198
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,280
- Let's look.
 - This GN is him.

199
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,430
- Let me see.
 - Hurry and look at his Moments. See what he does.

200
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,040
Besides sharing cybersecurity news, there's nothing else.

201
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,370
Do you understand this?

202
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,860
Forget it. It's a waste of effort to ask you. You are a computer idiot.

203
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,820
True, true, true! I am the number one dummy! So what?

204
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,890
I'd better ask someone who knows tomorrow.

Check, please.

207

Didn't you book for the entire night? It is only... 2:00 a.m.

208

It's 2:00 a.m.

209
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,000
Is it not late?

210
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,260
For the underaged, then it is too late.

211
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,850
They shouldn't hang around here. But you are already an adult so...

212
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,900
Please wait.

213
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,870

214
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,830

Next time?

218

Are you here every night?

219
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,700
No, I am on school break, so I am helping my relative to watch the store.

220
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,510
I'm not here every night.

221
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,730
Don't misunderstand. I don't have other meanings.

222
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,560
I just thought a little girl here at the internet cafe is not safe.

<i> They have great talent.</i>

<i> They have a dream of helping China get the championship.</i>

240

<i> Their parents gave an important segment of their children's life to me.</i>

241
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,920
<i> That's a kind of payment for their future.</i>

242

<i> Facing such a big responsibility,</i>

243
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,580
<i> how can I train these young people even more strictly?</i>

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,250
<i> When love is deep, the harsher the responsibility is.</i>

245
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,800
<i> But they are only young people around twenty.</i>

Did you guys... see Boss last night?

255
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,770
- I didn't see him.
 - No, I didn't.

256
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,740
None of you saw him?

257
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,280
Did he come back or not?

258
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,570
It's hard to say.

Boss, where did you go last night?

268
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,610
Did you need me?

269

333
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,380
A CTF player,

334
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,850
the best golden age only lasts for 6 years.

335
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,440
These few years are when you are in your prime condition.

336
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,790
After this time has passed,

337
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,250
even if you no longer want to have a New Year's Eve dinner reunion and want to train instead,

338
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,060
see if there is anyone who would want to train you.

339
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,530
From yesterday to today, you were all pretty happy!

340
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,250
Did you forget about losing?

341
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,300
Boss, we did get 2nd Place after all.

342
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,000
Plus, losing to SP isn't embarrassing.

343
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,220
Their team's leader for many years...

344
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,660
Boss, Demo is young, he is just saying nonsense. Don't take it seriously. What are you saying?

345
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,960
Losing to SP isn't embarrassing?

346
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,250
Wrong! The most embarrassing thing is losing to SP!

347
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,820
It's just that you don't want to lose to Solo, right?

348
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,170
- Are you crazy? What are you saying?
 - What? Am I wrong?

349
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,630
Boss, he's just saying random things.

350
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:43,560
Let me tell you. In my dictionary, the word "lose" doesn't exist.

351
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,420
Understood?

352
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:53,100
Let me ask you. You are all educated people.

353
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,740
After so many years, do you still remember 1st Place in your class?

354
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,980
I remember. I remember clearly. Homeroom teacher praised him every day.

355
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,350
Then, who remembers 2nd Place?

356
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,510
For something like CTF, it's best you don't get into it.
 <i>(T/N: CTF - "Capture the flag (base)" competition between two companies.)</i>

357
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,260
If you are in it, then you must show some results! Do you hear me?

358
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,480
Understood...

359
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,000
- Louder!
 - We understand, Boss!

360
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,760
Go eat.

361
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,550
Didn't I speak the truth?

362
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:41,810
<i> Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki

363
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,160
Little Bai, come out for a second.

364
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,220
With you like this, they are under lots of pressure.

365
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,860
If they can't withstand this bit of pressure, how can they compete professionally?

366
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,180
What a joke!

367
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,670
Help me... withdraw some money.

368
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,430
The password is 214214.

369
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,270
Withdraw how much?

370
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,770
You decide. It's a New Year's red envelope.
<i>(T/N: Traditional New Year's gift containing money)</i>

371
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,250
Didn't you already distribute the year-end rewards?

372
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,060
These are separate matters.

373
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,220
Year-end rewards are a must. This red envelope is just a little something from me.

374
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,710
Then... ‎¥500 per person?
<i>(‎around $70)</i>

375
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,520
Make it ‎¥5,000 <i>(around $700)</i>. Let everyone have a good New Year's.

376
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,230
As your younger cousin, I get one, too. Right?

377
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,020
You get one. It's by the number of people, just take your share.

378
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,800
Oh right.

379
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,080
Do you know how to block someone on WeChat?

380
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,870
"Predestined Tonight Cafe?"

381
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,770
Did you go on a blind date?

382
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,170
This is an internet bar.

383
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,650
- They were hard-selling me food and even added my WeChat.
 - Then block them or delete them.

384
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,910
It's very easy. Let me help you.

385
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,800
Forget it. It's too troublesome. Just leave it.

386
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,850
You, go get them some good food.

387
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,680
If anything isn't enough, just add it.

388
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,110

389
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,130

390
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,610
Two days.

391
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,930
Boss has left?

392
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,340
Why did Boss leave?

393
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,750
- He went out of town.
 - Went out of town for what?

394
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,690
No one ever knows what he wants to do.

395
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,410
Then... does that mean... we can eat?

396
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,020
That's right. I am hungry.

397
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,050
I'm starving!

398
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,060
I waited so long!

399
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,240
You're so annoying. You scared me.

400
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,820
Why are you always here by yourself, looking at your phone in a daze?

401
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,070
It's almost Winter Break and you are acting ill at ease...

402
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,700
Are you secretly planning a trip somewhere?

403
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,290
No, I didn't.

404
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,380
Didn't my younger cousin open an internet cafe? No one is watching it right now.

405
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,900
Whenever I have time during the Winter Break, I will go and help him out. I don't have time for a trip at all.

406
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:47,780
Let me tell you. You can't only think about studying, researching every day.

407
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,020
Winter break is finally here, and you're still helping others to look after their internet cafe?

408
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,120
Look over there. Who lives such a boring life?

409
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,510
You should start a romantic adventure.

Yaya, what does it feel like when you like a person?

412
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,600

What nonsense are you saying? He is my senior.

416
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,130
Senior Zheng Hui is a very honest person. Don't make a joke like that.

Just a little while. Go. Just a little while.

429
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,960

Whoa, Han Shangyan. You’re so not easy.

502
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,460
You're still following this circle?

503
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:22,450
I don't really have any hobbies, so I occasionally look at the news for this circle.

504
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,980
Sometimes I feel sad after seeing the news, so I'd rather not follow it.

505
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,730
You can’t let go?

506
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:33,940
I can't really say. I don't know.

507
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,610
If you can't let go, then come and help me.

508
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,230
Stop kidding.

509
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,750
Do you think I’m kidding, Little Mi?

510
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,700
Come to my team. Help me fight in the competition.

511
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,480
Old arms, old legs. Can't play.

512
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,500
You're younger than me. How could you say you're old?

513
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,890
I came all the way from Shanghai just to look for you.

514
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:06,520
I don't have the energy, endurance, and technique anymore.

515
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,580
Alright, let’s not talk anymore. Let’s go drink some wine.

516
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,700
Today, I invited someone that you will want to see.

517
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,130
- Who is it?
 - You’ll know when we get there. Let's go.

518
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,770
Let’s go.

519
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,100
You're being so mysterious. Am I meeting your girlfriend?

520
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,980
What girlfriend? Who will be interested in me?

521
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,860
He’s here!

522
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,380
This place is pretty nice.

Old Han?

525
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,050
When did you come back?

526
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,270
You get dumb once you see me. What's the problem?

527
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,770
What's there to be dumb about? Who have I ever been scared of?

528
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,360
I just didn't think you would come back.

529
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,030
- Today, I brought you guys someone.
 - Who?
