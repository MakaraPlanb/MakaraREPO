61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,360
My guess is, the reason why you aren't explaining is that you don't want her to be publicly humiliated.

62

 - It's all right, I'll sign for them.

170
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,980
- So many people.
 - They might all be his fans.

171
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,450
- Thank you.
 - Demo, could you sign this for me? Thank you.

172
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,370
- Wow...
 - You're so handsome.

173
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,450
Thank you.

174
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,910
Boss told me to bring you inside!

175
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,450
- Go inside?
 - Wow.

176
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,960
Who's Sister-in-Law?

177
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,930
Sister-in-Law, don't just stand there. I'll bring you inside. Come here.

178
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,760
Little Squid, when'd you get married? I didn't even know!

179
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,960
No, he's just saying nonsense.

180
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,040
We have been hanging out for three years and you actually found a... I need to go ask.

181
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,980
What are you doing? Lan Mei!

182
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,980
Hey, who's your boss?

183
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,030
What does it matter to you?

184
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,660
Excuse me, I need to get through.

185
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,960
Sister-in-Law, I still have five minutes before the competition starts.

186
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,520
Let's talk while we walk.

187
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,340
Um... Demo.

188
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,700
Oh right, Boss isn't in the best mood today.

189
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,010
Demo, that one's my friend. Can I bring her in with me?

190
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,330
Of course! Sister-in-Law's friend is definitely okay!

191
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,850
Excuse me, let us get through again.

192
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,140
- Let's go.
 - Demo, we'll always support you!

193
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,900
- Demo, you have to work hard!
 - Demo, Demo!

194
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,280
- Good luck, Demo!
 - Can I get another autograph?

195
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,100
Wow... so many people.

196
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,370
This is the contestants' rest area.

197
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,250
Hey, look, that's Team SP.

198
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,100
Little Squid, is that... Gun God?

199
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,520
Could you get me an autograph? Just sign on my dress.

200
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,190
This way, I won't wash my dress for a year.

201
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,970
That... don't worry.

202
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,250
Although our boss... never gives out autographs...

203
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,640
Sister-in-Law's friend...

204
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,480
- Sister-in-Law's friend...
 - ...is definitely not a problem.

205
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,210
Oh, okay!

206
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,890
What is he saying? Sister-in-Law's friend?

207
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,160
Sister-in-Law.

208
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,950
Their boss is Gun.

209
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,210
So, that's saying my husband's male god is your man?

210
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,420
Your man is Gun God, and Gun God is my husband's male god.

211
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,780
No, what are you saying? Now I'm all confused.

212
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,980
I... I've actually only seen him twice.

213
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,040
Today is only my third time seeing him.

214
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,740
- <i>Boss is that awesome?</i>
 - Wow, Little Squid!

215
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,280
Only two times and he's yours!

216
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,360
Two times?

217
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,410
No, no, no!

218
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,860
- Sister-in-Law, come sit!
 - Where are you going?

219
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,350
No, didn't I tell you yesterday I'm not your sister-in-law?

220
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,530
So amazing.

221
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,460
No, Lan Mei, listen to me.

222
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,480
Later, when you see Gun, don't ask anything.

223
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,430
His temper isn't good and I'm afraid he'll get mad.

224
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,430
Any other questions, we'll go back and I'll slowly explain to you, okay?

225
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,080
Don't worry! I'll definitely pretend like I'm dead till the end.

226
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,140
I won't interrupt your lovey-dovey talk.

227
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,230
Wait, no! We aren't talking about lovey-dovey things!

228
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,100
Okay, okay. Anything is fine.

229
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,320
Not anything is fine.

230
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,290
Come here, come here, com here! Let me tell you guys something.

231
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,180
Hurry, hurry. Manager, you come, too.

232
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,440
Guess who I brought over?

233
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,140
Who?

234
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,380
Sister-in-Law.

235
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,780
The one in the blue, see?

236
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,950
Did you guys know, Sister-in-Law just told me she's only seen Boss twice.

237
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,320
Today is the third time.

238
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,950
No way, so you're saying yesterday was the second?

239
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,260
So that means...

240
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,880
Boss got Sister-in-Law with just one meeting?

241
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,000
What is this efficient?

242
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,740
Stop gossiping! The competition is about to start.

243
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,940
Boss has got game...

244
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,860
- Sounds good.
 - I'm going to eat something first. You go.

245
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,880
- I'll go ask why he wants to see me.
 - Okay.

246
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,530
You asked for me?

247
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,630
She's my friend, I brought her in.

248
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,930
Come and sit.

249
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,960
Do you want some food?

250
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,620
Hurry and go. Just pretend I'm air.

251
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,860
Go! Hurry.

252
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,240
<i>Anyhow... you wanted me to sit.</i>

253
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,900
My team members really like you,

254
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,510
so they want you to see the competition for free.

255
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,360
You don't want to?

256
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,950
No, I do. I want to watch.

257
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,710
Then wait ten minutes. Enter with us.

258
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,440
<i>Gaming again... Isn't he going to talk?</i>

259
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,490
<i>His nose is so straight.</i>

260
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,230
What do you want to do?

261
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,840
I'm just thinking if I should clear the misunderstanding with them.

262
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,730
Misunderstanding?

263
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,240
They misunderstood that I'm your girlfriend.

264
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,590
That isn't really good for you.

265
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,270
Although, I...

266
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,430
Even though you like me,

267
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,900
you do not want to cause trouble for me.

268
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,410
Go ahead.

269
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,840
Explain in under one minute,

270
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,750
don't disturb their mood for the competition.

271
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,530
One minute isn't enough to explain.

272
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,170
Yesterday, I explained for so long and they still didn't understand.

273
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,810
I have to explain for at least five minutes.

274
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,420
Then, explain after the competition is over.

275
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,000
Let's go.

276
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,530
- Don't be nervous, play well.
 - Okay.

277
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,900
Hurry, hurry!

278
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,740
- K&K, I love you!
 <i>- KK! KK! KK!</i>

279
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,280
- Is your stomach better?
 - Much better.

280
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,510
Little Squid, remember to get me an autograph.

281
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,450
I don't dare. I'm scared he'll get mad and throw us out.

282
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,880
What's wrong with asking your man for a signature?

283
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,070
He's not.

284
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,730
He isn't?

285
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,110
I like him, but he doesn't like me.

286
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,740
You are backward pursuing him?
<i>(T/N: backward pursuit - when a girl pursues after a guy)</i>

287
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,860
You haven't gotten him?

288
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,660
Let's go.

289
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,020
You are too lame.

290
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,040
Hurry!

291
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,100
Here.

292
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,040
Um... we'll sit...

293
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,700
How about you sit up front and Tong Nian and I sit here, is that okay?

294
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,840
How could I sit with Boss?

295
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,970
- He...
 - Then, I'll sit here. Tong Nian, you sit up front.

296
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,770
Thanks.

297
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,160
You know her?

298
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,860
Not really. Yesterday, she brought me in.

299
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,400
Do you know who she is?

300
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,800
She told me she was a staff at SP.

301
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,300
She is SP's Appledog, the previous CTF champion team's main offensive player.
<i>(Capture The Flag, a computer security competition where you protect your network and attack your opponent's)</i>

302
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,370
Now, she is SP Team One's manager.

303
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,830
Appledog, Appledog.

304
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,290
Appledog?

305
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,450
One of the two Team Solo's main offense players,

306
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,720
one of them being you, that Appledog?

307
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,950
You did your homework.

308
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,570
<i>That's the person he likes.</i>

309
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,780
Who's that?

310
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,790
<i>They are CTF's... dream couple?</i>

311
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,300
I also don't know. We met yesterday in the arena.

312
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,590
She's probably a K&K fan, so I brought her in directly.

313
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,680
Old Han's got a girlfriend?

314
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,660
I don't think so.

315
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,700
Is me sitting here not suitable? Should I...

316
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,260
Should I leave first?

317
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,110
Leave?

318
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,900
She'll misunderstand if I sit here.

319
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,760
Misunderstand what?

320
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,060
Sitting here...

321
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,700
If she thinks I'm your girlfriend and isn't happy, then you'll be in trouble.

322
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,880
It will be even harder to get her back.

323
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,820
I won't add trouble for you. I know, I know. I understand.

324
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm going to find a place to sit.

325
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,000
Are you joking?

326
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,400
What does it have to do with me if she misunderstands?

327
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,310
Also...

328
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,900
Little girl, your information is off the mark.

329
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,480
Didn't you say that you like me?

330
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,880
How come you don't even know I'm single and uninterested in women?

331
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,680
Sit back down.

332
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,680
Oh right, it's not only women.

333
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,080
I'm not interested in men, either.

334
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,680
<i>Hello, friends, this is the CTF Doppler Summit Final competition.</i>

335
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,280

 - Good luck!

341
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,580
- <i>After all, this is the first time they're back on stage after many years.</i>
 - Good luck! / - Good luck!

342
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,680
<i>- Yes.
 - I wonder if the feeling of killing enemies on the battlefield from back then still exists.</i>

343
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,820
<i>Yes, that is correct. Speaking of that, let's have our director show us the three main forces of the past.</i>

344
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,880
<i>First, let's invite Solo's team captain, Solo!</i>

345
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,580
<i>Next to him is our past CTF's goddess, Appledog!</i>

346
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,280
<i>Lastly, is our Gun God, Han Shangyan!</i>

347
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,680
<i>- Gun God still hasn't changed. Makes us so nostalgic.
 - Right.</i>

348
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,480
<i>Okay, now that the competition is about to begin its countdown, we will soon see an exciting competition!</i>

349
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,980
<i>Yes.</i>

350
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,580
<i>All right. Under the increasingly severe sppearance of cybersecurity,
[10, 9]</i>

351
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,280
<i> CTF Tournaments have become one of the methods to discover and select cybersecurity talents.
[8, 7]</i>

352
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,080
<i>Furthermore, it is a reflection of the strategic thinking of internet powers.
[6, 5]</i>

353
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,680
<i>The candidates in this Cybersecurity CTF will compete based on server attack and defense, vulnerability probing and use,
[4, 3]</i>

354
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,680
<i> and other categories of cybersecurity issues.
[2, 1]</i>

355
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,480
<i>All right, we can see that K&K has selected four players to attack the main port.</i>

356
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,180
<i>The team captain, DT, is auditing game codes by himself and searching for an opportunity.</i>

357
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,330
<i>That's right. And K&K's attack this round has also yielded results.</i>

358
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,180
<i>Nice! All and Little Mi were able to delete the backdoor code to block the loophole.</i>

359
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,280
<i>Instantly reversing the situation.</i>

360
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,980
Not bad.

361
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,280
<i>K&K only has DT, who is responsible for defending their main server, left.</i>

362
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,580
<i>Now SP has many points of attack. DT can only choose to give up reinforcing the safety to storm down SP's server.</i>

363
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,780
<i>Now, we must see if DT can display his full ability and perform a miracle!</i>

364
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,780
<i>Yes, now over here we can see that Little Mi has exposed his node, attracting the attention of DT!</i>

365
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,980
<i>DT really did change to attack Little Mi with the exposed node.</i>

366
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,280
<i>He hasn't realized that All and Hua Ti are about to break down K&K's backdoor!</i>

367
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,380
<i>Nice! It looks like SP won this round in the end!</i>

368
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,180
<i>Yes. Now, because they are behind after the last round, they have conducted aggressive attacks towards SP's server.</i>

369
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,180
<i>DT has quickly audited the problem with the game code.</i>

370
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,580
Let's go.

371
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,080
To where?

372
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,280
To the restroom.

373
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,680
They're competing.

374
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,080
Just come with me.

375
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,080
Sorry, we're going outside for a second. We'll be back very soon.

376
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,460
I have something to ask you.

377
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,180
Okay, okay, okay.

378
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,680
I'll try my best to get you an autographed photo, okay? I'll try my best.

379
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,380
It's not about the autographed photo!

380
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,780
Just... what's up between my man's male god and you?

381
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,780
We're so close and you won't tell me.

382
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,380
It's not that I won't tell you. I really didn't mean to not tell you.

383
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,580
I just think...

384
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,380
I just think confessing and being rejected is so embarrassing.

385
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,180
Confessing?

386
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,880
Don't you know that confessing is a big no-no when it's backward pursuing?

387
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,980
Who would be interested in a chick who confessed after meeting only twice?

388
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,680
Your intelligence, I... My goodness...

389
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,480
No. Actually, I didn't want to confess.

390
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,780
But that day, I–

391
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,180
Okay, okay, stop.

392
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,980
Look at you, with just your 90 points looks.

393
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,980
How can you not even have 9 points of dating know-how?

394
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,980
First love, secret love, and confession.

395
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,180
With you like this, how can you win over my man's male god?

396
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,880
Let me tell you. The most idiotic thing about backward pursuing is

397
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,380
when the other person has not yet seen any of your good points.

398
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,380
You already go up and say, "I like you."

399
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,180
Only ghosts would accept your craziness, okay?

400
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
You need to infiltrate!

401
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,580
You need to appear beside him in various ways, display various kinds of your beauty.

402
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,380
For example, "mo mo da,"
<i>(T/N: a way of acting cute)</i>

403
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,980
cold and grim, or sexy.

404
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,980
Anyways, you can't verbally confess you like them.

405
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,580
They must be anxious and have a bunch of thoughts.

406
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,680
They think that you clearly like them,

407
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,480
but how come there's no answer? Understood?

408
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,380
Also, you have to let him say it first.

409
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,980
If they hint it first, they'll confess first.

410
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Also, look here. He clearly had a chance to explain but he didn't.

411
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,580
Why? That means he doesn't dislike you.

412
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,580
Even more, he has a good opinion of you!

413
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,780
He doesn't like me.

414
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,480
You must know that men, they're all talk.

415
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,880
Let's go... Let's go.

416
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,480
<i>Team K&K fought very passively today.</i>

417
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,260
<i>Yes, and if you look at SP on this side, after getting the two players Little Mi and All,</i>

418
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,380
<i>the entire team's strength has increased significantly.</i>

419
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,740
<i>Yes, yes, yes! Their play has completely caught K&K off guard.</i>

420
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,480
<i>You're right. I think that Team K&K over here would never have thought that</i>

421
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,910
<i>the arrival of these two veterans would be able to spur on the other three team members.</i>

422
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,580
<i>Even directly disrupting all of K&K's tactical arrangements.</i>

423
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,140
<i>Yes. We have always said that in CTF, with players that are a bit older,</i>

424
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,480
<i>- their reaction time will not be as fast as the younger players.
 - Yes.</i>

425
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,210
<i>But this time, these two veterans' cooperation can be deemed as seamless.</i>

426
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,480
<i>Right.</i>

427
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,790
<i>Little Mi successfully finished this 1 vs. 2 disaster.</i>

428
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,480
<i>Congratulations to Team SP for getting this time's competition's win.</i>

429
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,380
<i>- Congratulations, SP!</i>
 - Yes!

430
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,010
- Okay.
 - Great!

431
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,380
Old Han.

432
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,820
Little Mi and Ou Qiang's performance today was pretty good.

433
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,980
You're really not considering hanging out?

434
00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:01,570
<i> Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki

435
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,300
Go.

436
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,080
It's okay that you lost this time, you can win it back next time!

437
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,580
Keep it up!

438
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,580
Didn't you want to explain?

439
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,580
Now?

440
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,380
Yes. Now.

441
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,570
You can't explain. Once you do, your chance is gone.

442
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,980
Just let him misunderstand.

443
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,580
That's the sprouting start of love.

444
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,680
Don't explain. You stay here first, I'm going to the back to ask for an autograph.

445
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,120
I was not expecting those two veterans to play so well.

446
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,480
- Exactly, they played so smoothly.
 - I didn't expect it.

447
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,980
Rehearse here first, how you'll explain.

448
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,180
Rehearse?

449
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,680
Let me see if you can explain clearly.

450
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,860
Everyone lost the competition today,

451
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,380
I don't want to take up their time.

452
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,980
Oh, okay.

453
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,810
Han Shangyan and I...

454
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,380
The... The two of us–

455
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,180
You don't know how to say it?

456
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,580
Then just don't say it.

457
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,250
Don't say it?

458
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,770
We won't see each other in the future anyway.

459
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,060
The misunderstanding won't matter.

460
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,580
To be frank, I have no plans to date.

461
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,980
These kids, their dreams and futures are in my hands.

462
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,880
All just for the thought that one day, they can bear our country's flag as world champions.

463
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,380
Prove to their parents that their choices weren't wrong.

464
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:11,230
Therefore, I don't have time or energy to deal with anybody outside of K&K.

465
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,780
Understood?

466
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,880
Yes.

467
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,780
You can go.

468
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,780
Okay, see you again.

469
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,780
No need to see you again.

470
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,430
We probably won't meet again in the future.

471
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,580
Clean up, let's go.

472
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,580
- Okay, let's go.
 - Let's go, let's go.

473
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,580
- Where's Wu Bai?
 - Take your stuff.

474
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,780
Captain got in the car himself.

475
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,580
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

476
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,980
- Bye-bye.
 - Bye-bye.

477
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,380
No way, did my prediction go wrong?

478
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,680
He likes you.

479
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,780
- <i>Just like that...</i>
 - It's okay, it's okay.

480
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:16,380
<i>...my first love ended with failure at the Guangzhou Sports Stadium.</i>

481
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,370
You're back? You worked hard.

482
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,180
These are the travel expenses for the competition in Norway after the new year.

483
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,870
Sign here.

484
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,000
- What are you going to do about that girl?
 - Who?

485
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,170
The one from Guangzhou. Round face, big eyes, short skirt girl.

486
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,130
- Tong Nian?
 - Yeah, I think she's pretty cute.

487
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,370
It's solved.

488
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,980
Solved? How?

489
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,640
It's solved, so it's nothing.

490
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,210
Do you not want a girlfriend your whole entire life?

491
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,400
This is the Internet Club, not a matchmaker club.

492
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,710
The only thing I'm worried about is helping these kids fulfill their dreams.

493
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,080
Helping them become a national champion, Asia champion, and even world champion.

494
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,810
Those things I'll prepare. You should save some time for yourself.

495
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,080
I think that girl's not bad.

496
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,890
I'm going.

497
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:53,780
♫ <i>I carefully covered up that I don’t mind</i> ♫

499
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,040
♫ <i>I attempted to cherish this experience</i> ♫

502
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,360
<i>We probably won't meet again in the future.</i>

503
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:30,830
♫ <i>I start to portray an unfamiliar me</i> ♫

504
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:39,460
♫ <i>Fathoming the untrue distance behind the words</i> ♫

505
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:46,350
♫ <i>I thought I possessed the acting skills to deceive everything</i> ♫

506
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:54,890
♫ <i>But no matter how much I practiced, I can't act like myself</i> ♫

507
00:35:54,890 --> 00:36:01,780
♫ <i>The me who doesn't care about you</i> ♫

508
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,760
Say, how come every time our boss sees SP's boss, his expression turns dark?

509
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,020
You noticed it, too? I feel that as well.

510
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,160
This is a nearing ten-year-old love-hate conflict.

511
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,610
Watch what you say. That's what our boss is sad over.

512
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,760
97, come here. You say it.

513
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:29,110
When Boss came back to China, he and Solo and Appledog formed Team Solo.

514
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,280
You guys know that already, right?

515
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,170
Solo and Ai Qing were a couple.

516
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,520
Later, because Solo's ex-girlfriend suddenly appeared, Ai Qing couldn't take it and wanted to break up.

517
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,200
After breaking up, she left the team.

518
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,850
Due to guilt, Solo also left the team.

519
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,750
Out of the three main forces of the team, two of them left. Isn't the team practically disbanded then?

520
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,910
So, our boss has always had resentment toward Solo and Ai Qing.

521
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,940
But so many years have passed.

522
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,020
It's still that he... can't let go, is it?

523
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,640
Team Solo isn't a regular team.

524
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,670
They were the country's most powerful team!

525
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:12,220
Did you know that when they got the national champion, they were about to go for the world champion!

526
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:17,050
At their most brilliant time, Solo for his own personal reasons resulted in the team disbanding.

527
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,140
How can Boss not hate him?

528
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,290
I don't think it's hate; it's more of sadness.

529
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,190
Boss is someone who really values relationships.

530
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,370
When those who value relationships are hurt, it is very difficult for them to let go.

531
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,580
That's true. Originally, he could have won the world championship,

532
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,450
but, instead, he got screwed over by his best friend.

533
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,300
If it were me, I wouldn't be able to take it either.

534
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,940
I'm telling you guys! You must not let our manager know this matter.

535
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,140
- Why?
 - It has something to do with our manager, too?

536
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,760
Our manager is the biological mother of Solo's daughter.

537
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,180
- What?!
 - What?

538
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,120
Oh my god.

539
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,440
- No way!
 - What kind of secret meeting are you guys holding?

540
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,130
That...

541
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,930
- We aren't, we aren't.
 - We aren't!

542
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,050
- You guys were saying we had a meeting?
 - I'm going to eat something!

543
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,750
- Are you hungry? Let's go together!
 - I'm going to go train!

544
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,870
Oh, right! There is an English class later.

545
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,590
Remember not to be late. You need to tell the others to remember to go to class.

546
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,740
What are you spacing out for?

547
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,540
Manager, why do we need to go to English classes?

548
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,120
Because you must go abroad for competitions and you are representing China.

549
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,670
If you can speak English fluently, wouldn't it be an honor for China?

550
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,170
- Yes.
 - Your Boss found this teacher especially for you guys. It was very expensive.

551
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:28,100
You guys need to study well; don't waste money.

552
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,530
Why do you keep staring at me?

553
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,820
I'm not.

554
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,650
- Hurry and go! Go on!
 - Okay.

555
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,990
The way to say it is "I am from"...

556
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,680
This is the big class. It goes on for two periods of forty minutes each.

557
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,560
After the big class, each person also has twenty minutes of one-on-one verbal teaching.

558
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,450
"I am from Beijing" or "I am from Shanghai"

559
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,930
- is the correct way to say it. Okay?
 - Yes.

560
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,560
- How many times a week do they go to class?
 - Twice.

561
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,950
Do they have tests?

562
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,720
A test every three months.

563
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,760
A test every three months?

564
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,260
They will definitely slack off. A test every month.

565
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,720
Let the teacher bring me the grades so I can personally see.

566
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,530
You can say "I come from." In this case...

567
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:19,840
He seems more handsome than your husband.

568
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,800
Exactly.

569
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,280
We can try it together, to play the game.

570
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,820
- Mom, I'm going out!
 - Where are you going?

571
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,090
Oh right!  In the afternoon go with me to go buy some New Years things.

572
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,610
I can't, I can't! Zheng Hui is waiting for me at the school.

573
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,770
You two are dating?

574
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,640
What? What are you saying?

575
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,730
The new students in our junior class are going to school to look around.

576
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,320
The teacher wants me to give them a hobby lecture.

577
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,250
- I am the main speaker!
 - Okay then!

578
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:59,430
How about this? Once you two are done, you bring Zheng Hui home to eat dinner! Okay?

579
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,490
I'm leaving first, Mom!

580
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,390
- Nian Nian!
 - I'm going to be late!
 - Listen to your mother, you hear?

581
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,260
There are so many people!

582
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,960
Okay everyone, look over here!

583
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,950
- The student in the back sleeping, wake up!
 - Nian Nian!

584
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,210
Look at your eyes, they look like they aren't even open.

585
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,800
Today's lecture will definitely be wonderful. Just wait and see!

586
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,260
- First, give the laptop to me.
 - It's in my bag.

587
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,640
Okay.

588
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,140
How come there're so many people?

589
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,800
Zheng Hui was scared there would be awkward silences, so he purposely called all the first and second year students, too.

590
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,550
I'm not scared of awkward silences, I'm scared when there are too many people. I'm nervous!

591
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,080
Don't be nervous, you got this!

592
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,530
Okay.

593
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,950
All right! First, I will introduce to you all our main guest speaker for today.

594
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,980
She may look young, but she was born in the junior class.

595
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,830
At the same time, she was the previous second place winner for the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest.

596
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,560
This competition is extremely prestigious.

597
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,250
There are more than 200 countries that participate.

598
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,850
For her to win second place, it was definitely not easy.

599
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:24,010
Today, her speech topic is Artificial Intelligence <i>(AI)</i>. Let us welcome her warmly!

600
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,470
Our main guest speaker, Tong Nian!

601
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,400
Hello, everyone, I am Tong Nian.

602
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,850
AI as a topic is much too broad.

603
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,570
Some of you here are not in university or taking this major.

604
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,460
I want to start off by talking about a small game.

605
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,440
From shallow to deep. To give everyone a better understanding.

606
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,670
This is a simple elimination game.

607
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:55,000
This little program does not need to eat or drink, learns and practices at the same time for three days,

608
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,980
and it can turn from a newbie into a pro-player.

609
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,760
Can it learn on its own?

610
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,600
Of course. He is not worse than humans.

611
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,380
Look! It really is acting on its own.

612
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,440
Yes! Actually, machines are very intelligent.

613
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,940
It has a life just like us and it also has a very strong learning ability.

614
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:17,190
All right! So we will let this small game keep playing as we continue.

615
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:23,240
Artificial Intelligence, in short form is AI, which also means artificial intelligence.

616
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:29,910
Actually, the word "AI" existed already 60 years ago, but its usage only became popular in current days.

617
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:34,240
But can you guys imagine? Ten years ago what was "AI"?

618
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,700
No one knows.
