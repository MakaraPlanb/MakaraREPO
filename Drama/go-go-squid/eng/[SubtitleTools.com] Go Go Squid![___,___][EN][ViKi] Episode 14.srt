00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,290
I lost it.

I just knew you would say that.

Your aunt is going to get married soon. She is about to leave us.

I did not lie to you. I really lost it.

Yeah.

31
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,120
Did you sell the necklace because you're short of cash?

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,150
I didn't! The other branches still have profit we can use to make up for the losses.

33

Han Shangyan, if you need money, just tell me.

You didn't mention Han Shangyan to them, did you?

00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,590
Of course not. Do we still need men for this?

69

Don't bring it up in the future either. I broke up with Han Shangyan.

Broke up? Why?

71
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,520
That night, Han Shangyan even opened up and said...

72
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,050
What did he say?

73
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,090
He said he didn't know you well, you'd just met a few times.

74
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,140
If we must ask him whether he liked you and he said he did, it would be too hypocritical.

75
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,100
What he said is correct. It is like this.

76
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,970
But... he also said...

77
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,930
"All things in time. Sooner or later feelings will come."

78
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,370

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,450

82

83
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,730
I brought it up. He said okay.

84

You brought it up?!

85
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,680
Seriously, you obviously like him, why did bring up breaking up?

86
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,680
Aren't you torturing yourself just for your pride?

87
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,860
Besides, he originally just wanted to appease the elders.

88
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,930
Now, we don’t need it.

89
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,650

90
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,450
Okay, okay. Don't talk about it. Just break up.

91
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,490
Regarding love and pain, if it makes you unhappy, then get rid of it.

92
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,540

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,190
We were just about to choose a song for Little Squid to audition.

170
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,900
If there is anything you think is suitable, you can ask for her to sing it.

171
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,110
Okay.

172
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,090
Then use that flowery method you just mentioned to sing "Little Donkey."
<i>(T/N: popular song for children)</i>

173
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:33,700
♪ I have a little donkey that I never ride ♪

174
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:39,980
♪ One day it suddenly comes to mind that I ride it to the market ♪

175
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:46,770
♪ I hold a whip in my hand, my heart feels delighted ♪

176
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:52,940
♪ I don't know how la la la la, fell and got all muddy ♪

177
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,940
♪ I have a little donkey that I never ride ♪

178
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,810
♪ One day it suddenly comes to mind that I ride it to the market ♪

179
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:15,510

180
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:21,790
♪ I don't know how la la la la, fell and got all muddy ♪

181
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,940
May I ask is there any feeling that you want...

182
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,240
to express with this song?

183
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,900
Since the judge asked me to use the method of expressing emotions that I described to sing this song,

184
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,600
I imagined the Little Donkey to be my lover and sang this song.

185
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,400
Then, what happened to your "Little Donkey"?

186
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,100
My "Little Donkey" is gone.

187
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,590
Sorry.

188
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,610
Everyone's score is out.

189
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,090
If no one else has any objection,

190
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:15,370
the selected ones for this audition are number 8, Lan Mei, and number 1, Tong Nian.

191
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,120
Old Han, you were late.

192
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,210
You also heard Tong Nian sing. Do you have any thoughts?

193
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,650
I... don't really have any thoughts.

194
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:29,290
It's just that the style of our theme song is more towards hot-blooded and lively.

195
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,740
Does everyone really think her style is suitable for our theme song?

196
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,410
This is the result from the overall scores.

197
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,890
I think that her singing was not bad. At the very least, it touched me.

198
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,840
I think that I am starting to like her. What do you think, Solo?

199
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,910
I think Tong Nian's voice is very clean, like a kid.

200
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:52,250
Furthermore, using the voice of a kid to interpret our theme song is nothing bad.

201
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,210
But what Old Han said is reasonable, too.

202
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:58,030
Since it is the theme song, we will have to be careful.

203
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,750
But no matter what we say, it is a fair selection.

204
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,110
Look, Tong Nian's score is in fact the highest.

205
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:09,860
Old Han, didn't you say just now that you would not give any opinion, and would just observe?

206
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,060
Isn't this what you asked me? You asked, I answered.

207
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,120
Okay. I have nothing to say.

208
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,960
Good. In the future, please cooperate well with Tong Nian.

209
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,540
But when did I ever agree to be this promotion ambassador thing?

210
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,720
I came to be a judge because of our relationship.

211
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,280
You asked me to come, so I came.

212
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,380
Today, I was late because one of my team members got in a car accident.

213
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,960
I went to the hospital, confirmed that his injuries were not serious before coming here.

214
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,080
It delayed me for some time. For my lateness, I am very apologetic.

215
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,820
If there's nothing else, then I'll be leaving. Continue.

216
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,730
Old Han, you can't say it like that.

217
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,760
Old Han?

218
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,470
Old Han!

219
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,380
Han Shangyan is coming out.

220
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,020
Take it easy.

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,510
Congratulations to you guys. I look forward to your performance.

222
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,120
Go back and learn the song well.

223
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,200
Don't worry, Director Xiang. We will.

224
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,650
Next Saturday, you must be here at 3:00 p.m.

225
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,340
For that day, I will invite Solo, Wang Hao; and Gun God, Han Shangyan,

226
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,450
to check up on you guys. Is that okay, Solo?

227
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,570
No problem! You are always taking care of SP, I'll be here for sure.

228
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,900
Director Xiang, may I ask you something? Will Han Shangyan really come?

229
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,180
Of course, he will. Today he had something to do, so he left early.

230
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,080
After the recording, I will take everyone out to dinner so everyone can get to know each other.

231
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,190
- Okay.
- Sure.

232
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,540
How are you two leaving? My car is over there. Do you need me to give you a ride?

233
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,590
No need, no need.

234
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,690
That's fine. Bye.

235
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,560
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

236
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,010
If anything comes up, I will give you a call.

237
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,920
All right. I will get going.

238
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,790
- Thank you, Director Xiang.
- Bye.

239
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,980
- Goodbye, Director Xiang.
- Bye.

240
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,110
Hey, Little Squid. Say, Solo and Han Shangyan's personalities are really opposite.

241
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,690
To be honest, every time I see Han Shangyan, I am scared.

242
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,690
His actual personality isn't like that.

243
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,920
Do you think he'll come next week?

244
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,150
Do you mean at the recording studio?

245
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,050
I think he probably will.

246
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,290
Don't worry. Just wait for a week and you can see your handsome Han Shangyan.

247
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,020
Then, we'll force him to answer about what he is thinking.

248
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,000
He better not be playing hard to get, or anything like that.

249
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,680
Let's go.

250
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,310
Isn't that Han Shangyan's car?

251
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,210
Tong Nian, let's do it again. Okay?

252
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,610
- Pay attention to your emotions!
- Okay!

Didn't he say that there was no need for him to come? So he certainly wouldn't come.

00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
I didn’t buy it.

336
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,100
Then... Thank you, Brother Solo.

337
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,800
I didn’t buy these either.

338
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,800
A handsome guy out there just came to the front desk, changed 100 coins and bought these from the vending machine.

339
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,400
Who?

340
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,200
He said he’s your friend. Pretty handsome.

341
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,600
Friend?

342
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,040
Who cares who bought it. Just drink.

343
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,700
Come.

344
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,100
Little Squid, hurry, look. Did he write this?

345
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,000
- He even especially chose the "Confession" bottle!
<i>(T/N: "Confession" is the juice brand)</i>
- Wait a moment.

346
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Where are you going?

347
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,200
Old Han's bad temper really hasn't changed. Coming and going without even saying hello.

348
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,000
- What?
- Why do you keep staring at her?

349
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
She's the type I like.

350
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,700
Say, does she have a boyfriend? If not, I’m going after her.

351
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,300
You should give up now.

352
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,800
What? Is she already taken?

353
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,500
A friendly reminder, you can never pursue this girl.

354
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,370
Give up!

355
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,000
Save your life.

356
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,000
<i>[Keep fighting!]</i>

357
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,500
Boss, what are you doing instead of sleeping? I thought it was—

358
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,000
Thought it was what?

359
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,300
I think it was you being overly suspicious.

360
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,950
Good night, Boss.

361
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,000
Little Han, you should wake up now. What time is it already?

362
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,700
It's already daytime. Hurry and get up!

363
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,000
Stop sleeping.

364
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,700
Auntie, it's too bright.

365
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,700
Get up, get up! What are you doing sleeping during the day?

366
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,500
Get up, get up!

367
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,000
Why does your complexion look so bad? Are you sick?

368
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,700
No. Just a bit hungry and a bit dizzy.

369
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,700
Something's wrong. You really do have a fever.

370
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
Auntie, what are you doing?

371
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,800
Measure your body temperature, quickly!

372
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,900
♫ <i>I carefully covered up that I don’t mind</i> ♫

373
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Auntie, if there's nothing else, you should hurry out.

374
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,800
If I really have some virus, it will infect you, too.

375
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,400
Next week, you can come into my room and clean and disinfect it.

376
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,900
If I'm sick, it's no big deal, but the lot out there are precious. They cannot get sick.

377
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,700
Okay. Next week, I'll make some garlic soup.

378
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,400
Kids who drink it get better really quickly.

379
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,600
I am not scared of getting sick.

380
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,600
- I’ll go pour some water for you.
- Okay.

382
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,100
Boss, you woke up so early. Didn’t you go to sleep really late yesterday?

383
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,470
I've only been off work for three days, why does your complexion look so bad?

384
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,100
Staying up late.

385
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,900
What kind of important work do you have that you have to stay up late?

- Yes, yes!

389
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,600
Little Bai.

390
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,900
I don’t have any money.

391
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,400
Why are you being like this? Are we brothers or not?

392
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,430
Even if you were my biological father, I'd have no money to lend to you.

393
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,400
I didn't come to you for this.

394
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,300
Go to Jiaodong University and drive my car back.

395
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,500
Why did you park your car there?

396
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,810
Oh yeah. Bring some cash.

397
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,200
Fill it full of gas for me.

398
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,700
Hurry and go.

What? Why are you staring at me?

401
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,900
Didn't you tell me before that every month I have a bonus?

402
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,800
Didn’t you say you didn’t want it?

403
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,000
Tell me first, what's in the bonus?

404
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,400
Not a lot. Every month, there's a thousand for meals and two thousand for car allowance.

405
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,400
Based on my standards, is it enough?

406
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,590
What did you spend all your money on?

407
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,030
As a club's boss, why are you so short on money?

408
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,180
I lost my stepmother's antique necklace.

409
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,220
I've already given her all of my savings.

410
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,760
I already borrowed some from Little Bai, but it's still not enough.

411
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,100
Too pitiful.

412
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,790
This month, transfer the bonus into my card.

413
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,380
Do you want me to give you a red envelope?

414
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,690
Thanks in advance!

415
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,600
Little Bai, you drove your brother’s car back?

416
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Yes.

417
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Your brother has a fever. Go take a look at him.

418
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,200
Don't worry. A poor man won't get a fever.

419
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
You’re sick?

420
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,900
You're rarely sick. Is it because you broke up?

421
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,360
Do you know how to talk? Do you understand how to talk?

422
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,680
I wonder who it was that drove all the way to Jiaodong University until there was no gas left.

423
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,800
I’m not going back today. My head hurts.

424
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,640
If I go back and have to go through the old man's lecture, I can just die.

425
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,600
Grandpa said that if you don’t go back to see him,

426
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,700
he will come live at the club.

427
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,700
Are you still going back?

428
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,300
You drive.

429
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
You filled it up?

430
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,900
I'm first place in the world, and I still need to fill it up?

431
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,000
I’m asking you. Did you fill up the gas tank?

432
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,800
The gas meter was down to zero. How could I have driven here without filling gas?

433
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:27,000
Right now, do I look very much like someone who is going through a breakup?

434
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,600
Stop looking.

435
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,500
You’re very handsome.

436
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,720
I'm sorry, I've come late.

437
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,000
No problem. You just need to sign your name here.

438
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,560
I wanted to ask if everyone was already here?

439
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,900
Yes. Everyone is here.

440
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,260
Is there a gentleman whose name is "Han" here as well?

441
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,870
A gentleman whose name is "Han"...?

442
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,490
I don't know. I don't know which gentleman is called "Han."

443
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,700
But the people that should be here are all here.

444
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,090
- Thank you!
- No problem.

445
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,460
Tong Nian, you're here!

446
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,820
Everyone is here already?

447
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,060
What's wrong? You look really disappointed.

448
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,250
I thought that Han Shangyan was here.

449
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,210
I was so anxious that I didn't even take the bus, I just took the taxi straight here.

450
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,410
Forget it, forget it.

451
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:41,400
In a moment the two of you can listen with us and see if there is anything else we need to record.

452
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,820
I think it's pretty good. There's no need for any touch-up recordings.

453
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,600
Okay. In a moment, we can listen together.

454
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,010
Director Xiang, I want to ask you something.

455
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,550
How come Brother Solo and Han Shangyan didn't come today?

456
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,510
They're both busy people. To be able to see them last time was already not bad.

457
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,880
They have clubs that participate in competitions.

458
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,910
And they aren't even from our company.

459
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,320
That's true.

460
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,160
The sample is out. It's not bad!

461
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,660
Thank you.

462
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,960
Director Xiang.

463
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,260
I... am quite curious about Han Shangyan.

464
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,030
How about you tell us some gossip on him?

465
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,220
I find that no matter if a girl is single or taken,

466
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,280
she'll always like to ask about Han Shangyan.

467
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,740
After all, he is handsome.

468
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,070
When he played professionally, he had the most female fans.

469
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,630
And they were also the type of fans that genuinely and sincerely wanted to be his girlfriend.

470
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,160
It made us all envious.

471
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,910
No, don't misunderstand!

472
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,710
My husband is a die-hard fan of Han Shangyan, he wanted me to ask.

473
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,440
So it's like that. I thought that you were interested in him.

474
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,170
No, I'm already married, already married.

475
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,390
I didn't realize!

476
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,350
How about you?

477
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm single.

478
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Let's continue talking about Han Shangyan. Does he have a girlfriend or not?

479
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,650
- Teacher, I want to listen. May I?
- This, I don't know.

480
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,090
- You can.
- You need to ask his old team. Han Shangyan isn't easy to get along with.

481
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,620
He mixes well and he's a guy with an open heart.

482
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,640
But most people are only nodding acquaintances.

483
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,000
Yet, this is fine, too: he's reassuring to people, he doesn't smooth-talk people with slickness.

484
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,610
Then, what about now?

485
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,430
Now?

486
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,190
Does he have anyone that he is seeing right now?

487
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,570
Probably.

488
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,900
- He does?
- He does?

489
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,380
Our company had a girl before who kept pursuing him.

490
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:43,220
But I heard an insider from K&K say that Han Shangyan seems to have a girlfriend.

491
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,910
When did that happen?

492
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,560
Probably in the past few days? I'd never heard about it before.

493
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,520
It must have just started recently. It seems pretty mysterious.

494
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,390
Nobody knows.

495
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,990
Say, this guy is really heartless.

496
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:05,200
He just broke up with you not too long ago. Not even a few days?

497
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,690
Two weeks.

498
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,570
Two weeks? I hate this type the most! You just broke up and he already found the next one.

499
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:14,930
Say, didn't he go through any moment of sad transition?

500
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,080
If you ask me, in the last period, he put no heart in it.

501
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,120
And I thought he was a pretty good person, too!

502
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,650
When I go home, first I'll give a beating to my hubby to vent my anger, that'll teach him to be a fan of such an idol.

503
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,570
Little Squid, I urge you to just give up.

504
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,790
<i> We worked together with several top students from a research lab in Jiaodong University to finish this project.</i>

505
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,500
Jiaodong University? Isn't that Nian Nian's university?

506
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,070
<i> [Officer Li: They're helping our city's investigative team with a facial recognition software.]</i>

507
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,970
I think it is.

508
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,700
This granddaughter-in-law I have is just like you!

509
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,680
She's a genius! A high technology genius!

510
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,150
Nian Nian hasn't come in a long time, has she?

511
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,420
Yeah.

512
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,410
Why is that?

513
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,670
I don't know.

514
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,140
Little Bai. Child, you have never been a liar, since you were little.

515
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,980
Tell me quickly. Why is that?

516
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,030
You should ask my bro instead.

517
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,860
I'm asking you!

518
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,690
I think... there's a bit of a problem.

519
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,510
But for the specifics, you definitely have to ask my brother.

520
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,740
Morning.

521
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,960
Morning!

522
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,830
You're up?

523
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,280
Do you still have a fever?

524
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,730
I'm fine. No fever now.

525
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,470
You hurry to the school, pick up Nian Nian and bring her back here.

526
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,010
Why would I bring her?

527
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,780
Today is her birthday!

528
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,840
So what? What does it have to do with me?

529
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,750
Did you forget or have you never even remembered?

530
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,190
She never even told me.

531
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,240
For your girlfriend's birthday, you should be more hectic.

532
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,570
During New Year's, that day when I went matchmaking for you, I had to ask her mother in a roundabout way to find out.

533
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:39,070
- Aren't you embarrassed?
- You're such a mother hen...

534
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,300
What did you say?

535
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,400
- Nothing.
- Mother... yes, right, I just asked her mother!

536
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,330
I asked Nian Nian's mother.

537
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,900
I had to ask her for her to tell me.

538
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,840
I haven't eaten anything in days. Can you let me eat a bit in peace, please?

539
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,760
Then eat! I'm not disturbing you.

540
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,990
Han Shangyan, I really like this girl, Nian Nian.

541
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,230
She is cute and well-behaved. She is very smart, too!

542
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,190
A moment ago on the news, I saw their university laboratory...

543
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,880
That's one of the main laboratories in the country!

544
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,250
Tell me. What point does she have that isn't worthy of you?

545
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm not worthy of her, okay?

546
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,760
Good that you know!

547
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,150
Sit, sit, sit. Sit!

548
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,880
For someone to has fallen in love with you is already not easy.

549
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,060
For such a good girl to have fallen love with you is even less easy!

550
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,850
Are you going to go pick her up?

551
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,490
No.

552
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,330
You're not listening to me again?

553
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,800
She is still studying. To go back and forth every day, is it proper?

554
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,980
Today is a Sunday.

555
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,620
Hurry and go!

556
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,320
No.

557
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,520
If you don't go, I am not eating today!

558
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,570
Now you are going to blackmail me with a hunger strike?

559
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,530
I'm not eating tomorrow either!

560
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,750
If you don't eat, you may get angina, right?

561
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,370
I'm telling you, you know my temper!

562
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,770
Are you going or not?

563
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,530
Little brat!

564
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,950
Did you say something to Grandpa again?

565
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,530
No.

566
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,190
Okay. I'll go pick her up for you.

567
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:06,660
But my condition is that he must go with me, too.

568
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,330
Me?

569
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,650
<i>I heard a K&K insider say that Han Shangyan seems to have a girlfriend.</i>

570
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,270
<i>When did that happen?</i>

571
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,170
<i>Probably in the past few days?</i>

572
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,930
Tong Nian! Come here for a second.

573
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,170
- What's up?
- Are you busy right now?

574
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,270
I'm overseeing them as they self-study.

575
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,200
Have you forgotten something today?

576
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,500
- What did I forget?
- I just knew you'd forget.

577
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,220
Can you come out to talk for a moment?

578
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,200
Then, hold on a second.

579
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,860
Later, when class ends, you can all leave on your own.

580
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,870
But during self-study, you must be quiet!
