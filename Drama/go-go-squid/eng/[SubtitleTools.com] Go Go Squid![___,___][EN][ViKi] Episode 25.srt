22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,960
Idol!

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,880
Why are you here?

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,440
I haven't heard from you lately. I just wanted to make sure you were still alive.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,490
I am fine.

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,560
Last time, after we exchanged WeChat, you haven't even sent me a picture.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,240
I wanted to send you one, but I didn't know what to send.

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,020
What did you buy?

29
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,640
Just some snacks to kill time.

30
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,050
Instant noodles? Don't eat too much of this. It has no nutritional value.

31
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,380
What is this? You bought wine. Is wine a snack, too?

32
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,580
Bixin?
<i>(T/N: means "each other's heart")</i>

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,310
Your heart or my heart?

34
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,620
It's the other party's heart. "Bi" means the other party.

35
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,730
I know that. Does it mean that if you drink this, you are drinking the other's heart?

36
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,140
But if you treat me to drink, then you are my "other party,"

37
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,760
so that means you want me to drink your heart?

It's just that last time I went to a Shanghai bar.

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,230
You have the time to go to a bar?

41
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,660
Of course. Before leaving this big city, I wanted to enjoy the environment one last time.

42
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,830
Which day is your flight home?

43
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,870
Day after tomorrow.

44
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,010
We should stay in contact.

45
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
Wait a minute.

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,150
What is it? I have to go watch the quarterfinal competition.

47
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,770
If you are going back home already, why do you care about the quarterfinals?

48
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,820
I can't win a debate with you. How about we talk more after the competition?

49
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,690
No, come with me.

50
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,210
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

51
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,500
Let's find a place to watch the quarterfinals.

52

<i>Congratulations to Team SP for winning the eighth season CTF's professional league, the Chinese regional qualifying round.</i>

53
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,530
<i>Chinese region's first ranked team...</i>

54
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,510
Yes! Team SP immediately changed after they changed members.

55
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,300
The person who got switched out is you.

56
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,920
It's all right, I have no complaints.

57
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,010
Competition is dependant on an individual's ability.

58
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,170
A group competition is not about an individual's feelings. What my boss said was correct.

59
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,810
If I don't understand and support that principle, I wouldn't have retired. Right?

60
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,640
What do you want to drink? It's okay. My treat.

61
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,160
- Do you have beer...
- Big bro, you've been reduced to eating those things.

62
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,100
Just let me do it, okay?

63
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,610
Guys scrimp on themselves, not on their friends. Okay?

64
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,600
All right then! In the outer Shanghai Bund, there are plenty of Michelin-starred restaurants.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,320
Let's try them all.

66
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,050
Sun Yaya, are you being deliberate?

67
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,740
Three bottles of beer.

68
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,120
Sit down.

69
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,100
Since you like this industry so much, why do you have to leave?

70
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,560
Do all men like to cut things off so cleanly?

71
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,800
- What can I do if I don't leave?
- Stay here. There are plenty of other things to do.

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,880
You can do live streaming. Or work for an internet company.

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,690
It's all good. Regardless, they are all closer to your dream and hobby.

74
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,760
Nian Nian, help me talk to him.

75
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,550
That's right. Also, if you leave like this, the four of them will feel bad.

76
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,310
I mean the original four members of Team Solo.

77
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,630
Ai Qing, Han Shanyang, and Solo.

78
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,140
Even though they've retired, they still stayed in the industry.

79
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,730
Right.

80
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,860
Look at Han Shanyang's personality.

81
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,440
If he can't bear to leave, you must also feel the same.

82
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,830
Tong Nian, are you saying this for Old Han's sake?

83
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,150
I really believe that he doesn't owe me anything. Really.

84
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,980
For sure, I didn't say this for Han Shanyang. It's for...

85
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,930
for... someone...

86
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,270
Don't just smile. Say something.

87
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,110
Let me think about it more. All right?

88
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,460
What is there to think about? Let's take action right away.

89
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,210
I already made appointments with many realtors. Let's go look at apartments.

90
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,230
- Why are we looking for apartments?
- To rent a place.

91
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,940
You can look for a place while you are thinking. Once you've decided, you will have a place, too.

92
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,530
Then, there's nothing to worry about.

93
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,980
What if I don't stay behind?

94
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,240
Then... you can just return the apartment.

95
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,960
Didn't you say you were a man?

96
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,620
Are you full yet?

97
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,790
The group rentals are above it.

98
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,500
It will get very noisy at night. This won't work.

99
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,810
The main gate is always open. It's not safe here.

100
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,170
Also, the hallways are too dark. Not good enough.

101
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,890
This hallway is clean and bright.

102
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,310
The door also remains closed at all times. This should do it.

103
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,710
But I think that the realtor was not very straightforward. He didn't seem very dependable.

104
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,890
He seems like one of those scammers.

105
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,970
You are very experienced.

106
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,190
I did a lot of homework. Let's keep looking.

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,280
This is the apartment I want to show you today.

108
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,580
Even though it is a bit small, it is very bright.

109
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,400
Ten-minute walk to the subway.

110
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,210
Also, there are three bus stops nearby.

111
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,030
Grocery store, gym, stores: everything you need is available.

112
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,170
This is one of the high-value apartments.

113
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,630
How much is the monthly rent?

114
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,870
Sir, it is ¥5,200 <i>(~US$750)</i>. One month deposit and prepay for three months.

115
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,140
- ¥5,200?
- Right.

116
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,360
Sir, you two look like a couple. Correct?

117
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,970
If you two work on it together, you can definitely afford the rent.

118
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,620
- No...
- No... we are not a couple.

119
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,220
She is here to help me look.

120
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,330
- Oh, it's a misunderstanding. Sir, you are the one looking for a place?
- Yes, it's me.

121
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,960
That's right.

122
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,320
Then, Miss, why are you spending so much effort in looking?

123
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,700
It's because he just came to Shanghai and I am worried that he won't pick a good place.

124
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,060
- A local to help check a place out, right?
- Yes.

125
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,550
Then, Sir, what do you think about this place?

126
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,920
Give me five minutes to think it over, okay?

127
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,350
Okay, then think it over for a bit here. I will go return a call to a client.

128
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,000
- Sorry, Sir.
- Thank you.

129
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,340
You don't like it?

130
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,660
To be honest, I haven't had much thought about the future.

131
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,000
I think this place is too big. I can rent and settle for a smaller place first.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,350
Haven't had much thought?

133
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,390
Have a seat.

134
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,030
- Close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?

135
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,730
Close your eyes.

136
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,950
Close your eyes, and then you can start to imagine.

137
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:02,280
Right now, you can feel relaxed and sit on a couch.

138
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,710
This doesn't seem relaxed enough.

139
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,900
Just a second. Don't open your eyes.

140
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,840
Can I open them now?

141
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,120
No, you can't.

142
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,050
What is this?

143
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,730
A face mask.

144
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,270
Right now, we're feeling relaxed and sitting on the couch.

145
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,450
Then, you can start to imagine.

146
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,500
Imagine that this house will become like home.

147
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,380
Every day, on the dining table, will be dishes that smell good.

148
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,090
Do you feel like you can smell food all of a sudden?

149
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,690
Yes.

150
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,650
In addition, you will have a very cute dog, your favorite kind of big dog.

151
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,670
Every day, it will be good and lie on the couch to keep you company.

152
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:19,240
Then, you can keep petting its cute and fluffy head. You are happy about that, right?

153
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,990
Also, in many places of the house, there will be green plants placed.

154
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,140
The entire house will look lively.

155
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,930
Furthermore, every day when you get home,

156
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,830
you will hear some beautiful music

157
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,770
and your mood will brighten.

158
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,490
Who will play the music for me?

159
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,990
Of course, it'll be someone who likes you very, very much.

160
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,460
Do you think it's pretty beautiful?

161
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,670
Beautiful.

162
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,380
Really beautiful.

163
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,250
So, you made your decision?

164
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,570
Rent!

165
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,280
Success!

166
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,120
Yeah!

167
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,620
I really have to thank you and Tong Nian.

168
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,380
I'll treat you guys to a big meal.

169
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,550
No need for a big meal.

170
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,740
I'm pretty worried about Tong Nian.

171
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,770
Han Shangyan always hurts her.

172
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,560
Hand it to me. I'll help you deal with it.

173
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,160
Really?

174
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,790
I've got all your clothes back.

175
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,000
- These two are yours, right?
- Thank you.

176
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,400
Nian Nian, I'll help you put yours into the closet.

177
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,940
Okay. Thank you, Yaya.

178
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,220
<i>I should provoke Han Shangyan.</i>

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,400
<i>If he still likes Tong Nian...</i>

180
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,270
<i>If Tong Nian says that she's forgotten him, would that stimulate him?</i>

181
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,220
Nian Nian, you put away all the things Han Shangyan gave you?

182
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,310
And this jacket?

183
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,410
I already washed it and was preparing to give it back to him.

184
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,100
Preparing to give it back to him?

185
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,730
Then... how about we take some pictures to remember?

186
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,760
Then you take the picture.

We are going back to headquarters soon. Are you not going to pack up?

223
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,350
You bought that much stuff? You have money now?

224
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,060
It's for Tong Nian.

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,960
Breakup gift.

226
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,930

- When you're in love, you spend a lot of money.

227
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,060
When you're together, you give an ancient necklace. When you've broken up, you even give breakup gifts.

Isn't this what a man should do?

Right, but if you have extra money,

230
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,960
can you give me back a bit?

231
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,700
That...

232
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,370
can you lend me a bit more money?

233
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,940
Don't transfer them through WeChat, the best would be cash.

234
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,060
You really take me for an ATM? Or are you getting ready to break up with someone else?

235
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,610
What's with all the nonsense? Are we still brothers?

236
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,200
You're calling me brother now?

237
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,350
How stingy.

238
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,010
Shangyan! Congratulations on advancing to the semifinals!

239
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,620
Shangyan?

240
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,130
Can you say it all in one go?

241
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,660
I'm telling you, there's someone in your room. Auntie Zhao let him in.

242
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,200
I dare not stop them. This has nothing to do with me; don't blame me.

243
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,290
Here, Little Mi. Drink some water.

244
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,390
Thank you, Auntie Zhao.

245
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,650
Have you been well these last few years?

246
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,910
Pretty good. How about you?

247
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,730
It seems you've thinned out!

248
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,820
Maybe.

249
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,460
Little Han, I saw it was Little Mi so I directly let him in.

250
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,620
That year when I applied to work for Team Solo, I just wanted to take care of you guys.

251
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,060
I didn't expect your team to break up; in a blink, you kids have all grown up into men.

252
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,160
We are old.

253
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Last time, I didn't get to see you. In the end, Han Shangyan was able to bring you back.

254
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,900
This kid is very affectionate.

255
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,900
I don't even need to do much. I just tidy up a bit in the bedroom, the conference room, the training room.

256
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,240
I don't even need to take care of those kids' dorm. I'm so idle!

257
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,190
Actually, he just wants to see you every day to feel at peace. The same. Nothing's changed.

258
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,400
- That's right. You guys talk, I'm going outside.
- All right.

259
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,230
You didn't leave?

260
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,400
No.

261
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,860
You didn't even tell me you stayed. I almost flew to your house to find you.

262
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,710
I wanted to give you a surprise.

263
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,200
It's good that you didn't leave. We can meet often.

264
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,200
I rented a house. Come take a look.

265
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,220
That fast?

266
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,800
Yaya helped me find it. She's familiar with it.

267
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,290
Your fan is pretty good towards you.

268
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,130
What are you thinking?

269
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,560
Doesn't she have Tong Nian as a friend?

270
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,990
Since you've chosen to stay, what are you planning to do?

271
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,360
I'll look some more. Anyway, for now, I'm just staying.

272
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,140
Let me tell you. Last time, I forced Han Shangyan to come.

273
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,760
If he doesn't come, we won't be brothers anymore.

274
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,870
I've done washing it. Come eat some.

275
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,440
That's great!

276
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,510
Here. I don't know if it's sweet or not.

277
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,890
Thank you two for coming here and helping me clean up today. It's all sparkly!

278
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,760
It's as we should.

279
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,790
Tong Nian, let me tell you. Han Shangyan is a great trickster.

280
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,710
He's not reliable, especially his mouth. Don't believe whatever he says.

281
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,810
I know.

282
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,050
Do you really know that?

283
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,090
I know he doesn't like me, but he's a good person.

284
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,700
He likes you!

285
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,230
You know, he usually doesn't get much interaction with women. Right?

286
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,220
It's either Auntie Zhao, his mother,

287
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,660
or the little lolitas on his computer screen...

288
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,380
In short, he's not great at dealing with love.

289
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,740
Believe me. He likes you. He likes you very much.

290
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,090
So... Tong Nian, please, can you help with something?

291
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,430
The surveillance camera button on my door is broken, so I can't open the door downstairs.

292
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,970
Can you go down to help me open it? It's Solo, Solo.

293
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,800
Okay, I'll go pick him up.

294
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,230
Okay, thank you.

295
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,870
Who actually came?

296
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,930
He who should come is here already.

297
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,490
Sorry, I thought the door would open pulling inward.

298
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,700
You don't have training today?

299
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,790
Who else is here?

300
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,180
Me, Mi Shaofei, and Yaya.

301
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,930
Not many people?

302
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,430
Not many.

303
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,110
- Sister-in-Law is here to bring us in?
- Don't call her that.

304
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,840
Did I mistake her for someone else?

305
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,680
No, such a cute sister-in-law, how could I be mistaken! It's her!

306
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,240
- Which floor?
- The fourth floor, on the left.

307
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,700
How can you change your mood so quickly?

308
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,950
Are you a donkey?

309
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,500
Ignore him.

310
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,700
Okay. You guys should go up.

311
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,740
Let's go!

312
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,580
You guys go first. I'm going to wait here for other friends.

313
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,880
The security monitor is broken upstairs.

314
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,150
Then, we'll wait for you upstairs.

315
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,830
"A happy housewarming, a red envelope for a townhouse."

316
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,310
Thank you!

317
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,420
- It's thick!
- So thick!

318
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,640
When there is no one around, count it yourself.

319
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,600
All right. I am just joking. There's no point in doing this. Take it back. Take it back.

320
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,950
- Take it!
- I'm giving it back to you!

321
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,870
- Why are you being so polite with me?
- You coming here is good enough!

322
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,950
Take it!

323
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,080
- Take it!
- Going back and forth like this, aren't you guys tired?

324
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,310
- If you don't want it, I can take it on your behalf!
- No!

325
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,320
It's a bit thin, don't mind it.

326
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,470
Why would you tell us that it's thin? Take it out and let everyone see!

327
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,620
Don't, don't, don't. Look at it by yourself!

328
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,560
All right! Thank you, guys. When you guys get married, I will return the favor.

329
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,900
Where is our Little Squid?

330
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,890
Ou Qiang, she didn't come up with you?

331
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:26,330
You lectured the girl for no reason, so she is still downstairs feeling wronged. She refuses to come up.

332
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,500
Why did you lecture her again?

333
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,280
She is still feeling sad, y-you... Why did you lecture her?

334
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,810
Don't listen to his nonsense.

335
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,440
Han Shangyan, I'm warning you. Little Squid is my guest today.

336
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,100
If you bully her again, I'm going to toss you out from here.

337
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,900
Who says you didn't? You treat a little girl like her the same way as you treat us.

338
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,790
Poor her.

339
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,690
I really didn't yell at her.

340
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,900
- Did he?
- He did. Very fierce.

341
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,640
Sister Tong Nian!

342
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,800
Naughty! You scared me.

343
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,190
You guys are here. We're just missing you two; let's go up!

344
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,810
Solo, Han Shangyan is already up there.

345
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:19,690
Later on, no matter what he says or does...

346
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,200
could you not be mad at him?

347
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,440
Rest assured. I wasn't in the past, and I won't be in the future.

348
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,620
Okay. Let's go up then!

349
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,770
Hurry up!

350
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,770
There are also loquats and oranges! They are all especially sweet.

351
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,500
Hello!

352
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,340
- Welcome, welcome!
- Why is he here?

353
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,100
- Don't say that.
- Everyone is already here?

354
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,770
Everyone's here, except for Ai Qing.

355
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,420
If she doesn't come, whatever.

356
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,300
Little Ai, everyone is an elder here, you have to speak with respect.

357
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,620
Little Mi, come. "A happy housewarming, a red envelope for a townhouse."

358
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,970
Thank you.

359
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,200
Did you two plan it out to say the same congratulatory words to me?

360
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,390
Team Captain, you are too good to Little Mi! Red envelopes and presents.

361
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,510
Look, look!

362
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,990
Laundry detergent, towels, toothbrush...

363
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,790
Fluidixine!
<i>(penicillin antibiotic)</i>

364
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,920
But, Captain... For "a happy housewarming," how can you bring Fluidixine?

365
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,170
This is giving good health! My dad is worried about Uncle Mi, you understand?

366
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,520
It's a habit. I need to take responsibility for the health of each of you.

367
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,450
It's better to be safe than sorry. It's like what I have always said.

368
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,000
"When you are out, you must have it with you every single moment!"

369
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,970
Team Captain, it's been ten years! It's time to change. You can't just say the same thing all the time.

370
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,340
Okay. Then all of you, sit wherever you want. Treat it as your own home. Come, move a chair over here.

371
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,680
- Come over, wherever you want.
- All right.

372
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,480
Little Mi...

373
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,970
Actually, I'll sit over here.

374
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,670
Then...

375
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,100
Sister Tong Nian, what I asked you at the dormitory last time...

376
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,040
have you thought about it?

377
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,130
What did you ask me?

378
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,320
I asked you, "What do you think of my dad?

379
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,840
Do you think you could become boyfriend and girlfriend?"

380
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,230
Little girl, can you not make trouble?

381
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,750
What are you saying? I-I'm going to the supermarket!

382
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,350
- Anything anyone–
- Why are you going to the supermarket?

383
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,900
My dad is a good person and doesn't earn any less than a certain somebody.

384
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,880
Little Ai!

385
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,750
Go, go, go! Go to the supermarket with me. Pick up your hat.

386
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,520
I'm going to bring her to the supermarket!

387
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,600
- I'll go with you then!
- Together, together, together!

388
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,420
Wait, wait, wait! In my kitchen, I have a really big fish and I don't really know how to fry it up.

389
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,640
You need to help me, so...

390
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,130
I understand. I'll help you.

391
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,900
Little Ai, come here.

392
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:01,190
I heard the teacher say recently that in class you've been absentminded, is that true? Be honest.

393
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,900
Dad, this is... spring sleepiness, you know?

394
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,360
Spring is here.

395
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,720
Then, if there is no one else going, I'm going to go!

396
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,030
What do you guys want to eat? I'll buy it and bring it back for you.

397
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,030
I still need a lot of things.

398
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:18,200
- I'll write down a list for you! Get a paper and pen for me.
- I'll go.

399
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,300
That... okay!

400
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,940
I need... laundry detergent. Four bags.

401
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,800
Didn't I buy laundry detergent for you?

402
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,260
I moved into a new home, I have a lot of things I need to wash!

403
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,930
- Four bags. What else is there?
- R-Rice!

404
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,320
Rice!

405
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,090
Two big bags. That's right!

406
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:40,940
And... salt!

407
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,710
- Salt!
- Buy a bit more salt!

408
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,700
- A house needs salt.
- Yes, yes!

409
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,350
- Flour!
- Flour!

410
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,450
Get a few big bags.

411
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,170
Sure! What else is there?

412
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,910
Water!

413
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,280
- Water! At home...
- Mineral water.

414
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,010
We need water. That's right. Water.

415
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,000
- We need a big box.
- A big box. Yes.

416
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,460
You might as well get a moving company to buy it for you. She's just a small girl, can she carry so many things for you?

417
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,150
Go with her!

418
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,260
I'll trouble you with this.

419
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:50,280
It seems that the last time we walked around the supermarket was on New Year's Day.

420
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,600
The things that Little Mi wants... why are there none here?

421
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,180
Wait a second for me.

422
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,410
You like eating these snacks, too?

423
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,960
I saw you take them the last time. I still remember.

424
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,320
Good memory. Can't help it.

425
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,900
Okay.

426
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,390
I'll help you look for these.

427
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,890
I already told Yaya and Little Mi. They're coming down to help. Oh, they're here!

428
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,380
You two went for a pretty long time.

429
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,950
- Gun God, help Nian Nian move some stuff!
- Yeah!

430
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,140
I won't help you guys move the stuff upstairs.

431
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,100
I'll put it at the entrance. There are still some matters at the club.

432
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,020
Don't lie!

433
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,600
I'm serious.

434
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,600
But... my wrist is so uncomfortable.

435
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,660
It might be the professional competition that did this, uh... carpal tunnel syndrome.

436
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,940
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm teasing him.

437
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,790
Coming!

438
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,690
Come.

439
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,060
Are you okay?

440
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,320
Let me help you!

441
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,660
Help me take this.

442
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,330
I'll take it, I'll take it.

443
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,800
I'll take it.

444
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,090
Put it on top.

445
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,480
We've moved everything out.

446
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,300
Do you want to stay and have dinner with us before going?

447
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,690
That... It might be a bit difficult.

448
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,000
No worries, no worries. Your work is important.

449
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,510
Then-Then remember to eat dinner. Don't go hungry.

450
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,680
Oh right. I have something to give you.

451
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,020
Last time, when I was shopping, I just bought it in passing.

452
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,390
Some of them are out of print.

453
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,010
Thank you.

454
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,230
Why don't you stay and eat dinner before going?

455
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,120
Everyone... Everyone is pretty reluctant to see you leave.

456
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,660
They don't want you to leave.

457
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,740
Then, I'm going up first. Come up anytime if you want to eat dinner!

458
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,050
All of us are waiting for you!

459
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,630
Take care.

460
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,740
<i>Can I really trust you?</i>

461
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:36,300
<i>I promise you, I won't bother Nian Nian.</i>

462
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,490
<i> I won't go find her again.</i>

463
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,380
<i> I won't let her believe she has any chance of romance with me. </i>

464
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,200
<i>Little Mi, I have something that I need to take care of later, I won't go back up.</i>

465
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,960
Where's Han Shangyan?

466
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,600
- He left.
- What?

467
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,480
I wasted all that effort to create an opportunity for you guys.

468
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,400
What did you say to him?

469
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,760
I didn't say anything.

470
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,760
Han Shangyan!

471
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,350
What?

472
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,590
Tong Nian treats you so well.

473
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,670
Can you treat her just a little better?

474
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,850
Give me your phone!

475
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,850
- What do you need it for?
- Let me show you something.

476
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,640
Just hurry up.

477
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,930
Take out your go-get-it attitude from your gaming champion years, will you?

478
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:54,460
The official website of the Chinese division of K&K looks like it's made by an elementary school student.

479
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,480
So Tong Nian made another one for you.

480
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,320
She used her own money to rent a server.

481
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,600
Take a good look at this. When you are done, please come back up. Okay?

482
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,800
In order to finish this, Nian Nian had to pull several all-nighters and barely slept.

483
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,480
So pitiful.

484
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,660
If you don't go up and have dinner, she will be very sad.

485
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,070
♫ <i>I’ve gotten used to my friend, Loneliness</i> ♫

486
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,290
Gun God, I honestly think our Tong Nian is quite good.

487
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,420
If you like her,

488
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,400
then please don't make her suffer. Okay?

489
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:43,200
♫ <i>Reject the way my heart feels, but you saw through me</i> ♫

490
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,590
♫ <i>Seeing you be sad</i> ♫

491
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:52,650
♫ <i>But really, my heart hurts more than you</i> ♫

492
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:58,390
♫ <i>I try my best to avoid it but memories are not up to me</i> ♫

493
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,700
♫ <i>All the things you’ve said flash past my ears</i> ♫

494
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,210
♫ <i>To move toward happiness, there are so many gates to cross</i> ♫

495
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,210
♫ <i>Just to run into your embrace</i> ♫

496
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,800
Where did you go?

497
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,800
A button fell from my shirt, so I went downstairs to look for it.

498
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,960
And guess what? I actually found it.

499
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,000
But your shirt doesn't have any buttons.

500
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,050
Idol! Don't expose me!

501
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,680
Come on, Ou Qiang! Let's start playing games! Hurry!

502
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,900
- Hurry!
- The one that I just bought.
- What game are we playing?

503
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,790
- Tong Nian, go play with them.
- No, it's fine. Let me help you.

504
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,680
It's quite good. Go play.

505
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,040
- Just put it here.
- The first one!

506
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,000
Yaya, help me. Hurry.

507
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,860
Hand me the soy sauce. Let's make some fish.

508
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,940
Which one should we use?

509
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,570
The one on the left.

510
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,750
<i>In the two years and three months that have passed,</i>

511
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,960
<i>there have been wins and losses,</i>

512
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,660
<i>laughter and crying,</i>

513
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,130
<i>we've been questioned and gossiped about,</i>

514
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,540
<i>we've been criticized and blacklisted.</i>

515
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,670
<i>We never had to give explanations,</i>

516
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,210
<i>there was no need to explain.</i>

517
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:31,420
<i>He never said why he became a Chinese citizen when he turned eighteen.</i>

518
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,200
<i>But I know, it's for the same reason that I competed in ACM (International Collegiate Programming Contest).</i>

519
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,400
<i>To win a championship as a Chinese,</i>

520
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:45,020
<i>hoping that in an international arena, there will be a Chinese flag raised and the Chinese national anthem playing.</i>

521
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,680
<i>Although he's retired now, </i>

522
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,620
<i>he's still holding in there, fighting.</i>

523
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:07,200
<i>In the two years and three months that have passed, there have been wins and losses</i>

524
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,180
<i>laughter and crying,</i>

525
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,860
<i>we've been questioned and gossiped about, we've been criticized and blacklisted.</i>

526
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,160
<i>We never had to give explanations,</i>

527
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,140
<i>there was no need to explain.</i>

528
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,600
<i>Tonight's feast finally comes to an end.</i>

529
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,330
<i>Success and fame</i>

530
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,500
<i>are blinding folly.</i>

531
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,140
<i>Thinking about it, I can't compare to her courage.</i>

532
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,500
<i>I don't even have the courage to love someone.</i>

533
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,200
Here. It's fine to not eat, but you must have a drink.

534
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,520
The first toast to Little Mi, who has moved into happiness.

535
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,800
Cheers!

536
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,450
Congrats!

537
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,120
However, don't let this become your second nest. I can't afford to welcome you.

538
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,420
So stingy.

539
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,810
This second toast is to your dumb luck fortune.

540
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,200
How did you find such a pretty girl fan?

541
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,550
I'm not worse than Little Mi, why don't I have any fans?

542
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,770
This isn't fair.

543
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,880
No! I'm also your loyal fan.

544
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,880
Stop trying to comfort me.

545
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,640
- Group fan. Group fan.
- Okay.

546
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,530
But she only has you in her heart. Don't listen to her. Come on. Come on.

547
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,400
Cheers!

548
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,220
Okay. No more. No more. Stop trying to trick me of my alcohol.

549
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,360
If you still aren't drunk by now, my next month's living expenses will all be used up.

550
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,060
Am I, Ou Qiang, someone who tricks people for drinks?

551
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,660
- The third toast, come on, come on!
- No! No more, no more!

552
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,560
I'll do it! I'll do it.

553
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,860
The third toast is to thank all of you.

554
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,400
Thank you all for never leaving me.

555
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,460
Including Han Shangyan.

556
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:12,030
No matter where his heart lies, other people might not understand, but I understand.

557
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,330
Cheers to all of you and Han Shangyan.

558
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:25,110
Drink less, all right? The alcohol's expensive.

559
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,400
Tong Nian, Han Shangyan is a workaholic.

560
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,990
Sometimes, if he doesn't have enough time to spend with you, don't be upset.

561
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,410
I'm... I'm not upset.

562
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,940
It doesn't matter if I'm upset or not.

563
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,940
Nian Nian, it's time to go to the hospital. Isn't Zheng Hui's mom having surgery today?

564
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,540
I almost forgot! Sorry, I don't think I can eat with you all anymore.

565
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,800
My friend's mom is undergoing surgery. My dad is the head surgeon, so I need to go see.

566
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,150
You guys eat on your own, all right? I'll go now.

567
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,180
Sister Tong Nian, let my dad send you there.

568
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,790
I'll call my own taxi. I'll call my own taxi.

569
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,710
I'll send you–

570
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,230
It's really okay. I'll call a taxi. Got to go. Bye!

571
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,900
Be safe!
