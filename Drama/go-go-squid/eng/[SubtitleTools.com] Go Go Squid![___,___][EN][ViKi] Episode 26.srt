Zheng Hui, how is it?

23
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,050
- Tong Nian.
- Did it go smoothly?

24
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,340
The surgery was very successful, thanks to your dad.

25
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,060
The time that the surgery took was shorter than expected.

26
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,430
That's good then.

27
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,940
Tong Nian, actually, you didn't have to personally come here.

28
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,090
How could I not?

29
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,790
Today is Auntie's operation. I have to rush over here to see if there's anything I can help with.

30
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,960
Thanks.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,910
Tong Nian, let's go over there to talk. Sit and talk.

32
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,500
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

33
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,430
Hello, where is the ICU for liver surgery?

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,350
The third floor.

35
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,570
Okay, thank you.

36
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,850
It's okay. I can do it myself.

37
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,970
- All right.
- Thanks.

38
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,850
How's Auntie? She's okay, right?

39
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,070
Pretty good. Your dad said that everything's quite well.

40
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,540
It's just that I might have to stay here all night tonight.

41
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,480
Today, Auntie just finished having the operation.

42
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,770
You indeed need to take care of her. It'll be hard work.

43
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,610
Then... If you were here to accompany me for a night, it'd be even better.

44
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,780
Maybe, I shouldn't accompany you to stay here for a night.

45
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,080
Are you hungry? You're definitely hungry, right?

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,490
Then let's have a meal together, okay?

47
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,300
I already ate just before coming here.

48
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,920
It's okay, it's okay. Are you hungry?

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,950
- If you're hungry, you can go and eat.
- Uh, no.

50
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,680
Because you need to wait a whole night here today.

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,100
It just so happens that I'm not hungry, either.

52
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,240
Then let's drink something. Let's rest for a while.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,770
Okay.

54
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,730
Tong Nian, I-I...

55
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,190
Are you still worrying about your mom?

56
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,590
Don't worry. Your mom is just a little bit old,

57
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,530
so she will have to stay in the hospital for a few hours longer than other people.

58
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,670
But tonight, my dad is working the night shift.

59
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,050
Don't worry. There won't be any problems.

60
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,030
Thanks to you being here.

61
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,700
Then...

62
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,170
Actually, I...

63
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,440
- Actually, I...
- Huh?

64
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,370
If–

65
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,820
Didn't you guys want to go drink something together?

66
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,650
Why are you here?

67
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,300
- Hello, Tong Nian's brother.
- Don't try to get close to me.

68
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,110
He's not my brother.

69
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,100
How should I address him?

70
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,420
Our family's elders are close.

71
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,180
Hello, Tong Nian's Uncle.

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,210
Didn't you want to go and eat?

73
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,090
How did you know? Did you overhear?

74
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,730
I just passed by and overheard it by accident.

75
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,920
Let's go. We shouldn't waste precious time.

76
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,270
Thank you, Uncle.

77
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,150
Tong Nian, let's go then.

78
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,950
- Let's go drink some–
- Hey.

79
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,690
Did I say that I'm not going?

80
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,290
Then, let's go together.

81
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,860
Let's go.

82
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,420
Be careful.

83
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,330
- Let's sit here.
- Okay.

84
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,490
- Here. Be careful.
- Thank you.

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,660
- Here. Sit properly.
- Thanks.

86
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,830
Thank you.

87
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,750
- I'll sit across the table.
- Okay.

88
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,350
Waiter!

89
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,950
<i> The atmosphere is really awkward. What does he want to do? </i>

90
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,670
- Here.
- Thanks.

91
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,800
Thanks.

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,860
I'm really thirsty.

93
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,950
You're welcome.

94
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,950
See what you'd like to order.

95
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,560
Thanks.

96
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,890
Tong Nian, you like eating strawberries. Right?

97
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,090
Then, two strawberry tarts.

98
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,720
It works, thanks.

99
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll pay.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,270
I want an Australian beef curry plate,

101
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,790
spaghetti, a round table platter, and burning chicken wings.

102
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,760
After the meal, give me a metropolitan red velvet cake.

103
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,400
Okay.

104
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,320
Thanks.

105
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,770
<i>I need to find a way to quickly end this meeting.</i>

106
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,460
<i>Don't think you can get rid of me.</i>

107
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,790
Didn't you just tell me that you needed to go back to the club?

108
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,260
I just remembered that I have a friend who's hospitalized.

109
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,030
I need to visit him later.

110
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,150
What friend? In which department?

111
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,510
Right, who?

112
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,700
Zheng Hui, my dad said that someone needs to be waiting outside the ICU.

113
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,120
The time that you have left is quite long. It'll be bad if something dangerous occurs.

114
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,910
You should go back and wait for her.

115
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,860
If by chance, something happens and you're not there, it'll be very dangerous.

116
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,420
Go, go. Hurry up and go back.

117
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,200
- If something happens, call me.
- But–

118
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,260
I'll pack this up for you and bring it over.

119
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,270
- Bye-bye.
- Wait a moment.

120
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,140
Pay the bill first.

121
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,310
Just kidding, I will. Hurry up and leave.

122
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,540
Thank you.

123
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,500
Zheng Hui is from a single-parent family. He lives with his mom.

124
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,430
He's very pitiful.

125
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,910
However, he's studying for his Ph.D. Isn't that impressive?

126
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,190
How do you want me to answer you?

128
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,560
My parents passed away early.

129
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,700
I was raised by my stepmother.

130
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,240
I heard about it a little before.

131
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,880
This time, when I went back to Norway to report on my work,

132
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,330
my stepmother got remarried.

133
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,890
Grandpa and I are the only ones left in my family.

134
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,500
Getting remarried?

135
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,860
That's a good thing!

136
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,520
She has regained happiness. It's good.

137
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,430
Ten years ago,

138
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,030
I traveled all the way back to China,

139
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,910
but I ended up living in a basement with Solo.

140
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,790
We were so poor that we had nothing but the bare walls of the basement.

141
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,580
Then, we finally established a club,

142
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,360
and we wanted to achieve some merits;

143
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,160
but in the end, it all failed.

144
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,110
You asked me, do I think he's pitiful?

145
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,070
Do you think I'm pitiful?

146
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,770
It's okay; don't be sad. You still have K&K and also me.

147
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,240
I will always support you.

150
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,960
Forced laughter.

151
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,560
Don't cry.

152
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,270
- Eat.
- You eat. You eat.

153
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,280
You ordered all of this.

154
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,570
How come you started cleaning as I was walking guests out?

155
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,280
Let me do it.

156
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,740
Thank you, Idol.

157
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,690
What are you thanking me for? I should thank you.

158
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,810
Then, I won't thank you.

159
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,800
Anyway, you're my idol. I'm willing to help you.

160
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,040
Here. It's dirty.

161
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,480
Thank you, Idol.

162
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,500
Let me give you a suggestion.

163
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,540
Can you not call me "Idol" anymore?

164
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,040
We're already this familiar with each other.

165
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,330
It's fun calling you that.

166
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,030
Call me Mi Shaofei or Little Mi.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,710
Does it not sound good?

168
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,080
It shouldn't be worse than Han Shangyan's name, right?

169
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,430
It's better than Solo or Wang Hao by a lot, right?

170
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,130
It's not bad. Powerful. Sounds good.

171
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,860
Sounds like a name from operas.

172
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,330
Didn't you leave? Why did you come back?

173
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,530
Actually, I wanted to ask...

174
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,580
I saw that post you posted recently.

175
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,680
I was thinking...

176
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,760
That wasn't me. It was Yaya who posted it.

177
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,080
After I found out, I deleted it.

178
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,510
You still saw it?

179
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,100
Then, the words in the post...

180
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,380
I don't think that at all!

181
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,160
That jacket is very important to me.

182
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,570
I wouldn't post that.

183
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,650
I think that us talking and strolling

184
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,630
is pretty nice.

185
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,730
It seems that only at this time can we get closer.

186
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,230
If we have the chance in the future,

187
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,650
can we spend more time like this?

188
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,870
Actually,

189
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,730
these few days have been hard for me.

190
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,270
I regretted some words immediately after I said them.

191
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,590
I think you...

192
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,500
What's so funny?

193
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,330
Knowing that you went through a hard time.

194
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,430
Because of me, you went through a hard time. Right?

195
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,800
Now, I'm very happy.

196
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,730
What are you doing?

197
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,110
What?

198
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:32,960

199
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,120
Sun Yaya!

200
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,980
What is it, Idol?!

201
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,800
What did you just call me?

202
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,090
Brother Little Mi...

203
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,040
It's late. How about I take you to the subway?

204
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,380
Let's go.

205
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,560
Why are you looking at me? What are you smiling about?

206
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,830
I-I was watching a video. So funny.

207
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,360
You weren't looking earlier.

208
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,500
When you weren't looking earlier, you smiled so much...

209
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,460
I'm asking you. Who sent you home today?

210
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,150
Y-You saw wrong. It was the school officer.

211
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,080
I didn't even say who it was, and you already said I was wrong? School officer?

212
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,260
The school officer brought you back, and that's why you were laughing with drool?

213
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,040
Did I?!

214
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,600
Look! You're still trying to trick me now. Tell me. Who was it?

215
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,130
I...

216
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,180
Are you talking about me?

217
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,460
Did you take a big step in progress today?

218
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,460
W-What progress would I have? With who?

219
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,330
- No?
- No.

220
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,420
Can it be when you went to the hospital,

221
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,970
Zheng Hui confessed to you and you realized Zheng Hui is your Mr. Right?

222
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,780
What Zheng Hui?! How could I like Zheng Hui?

223
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,430
Exactly! You see? It's still Han Shangyan.

224
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,170
I don't understand what you're saying. No comment.

225
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,660
Look at you! I have to take a picture.

226
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,510
Let's look at our Nian Nian being like this.

227
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,720
- Stop! I don't want to.
- Here.

228
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,880
I don't want to! Just send a picture of yourself to Mi Shaofei!

229
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,390
- No!
- I want to take a picture.

230
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,330
- Quickly!
- So annoying.

231
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,100
Have you seen this kind of Nian Nian?

232
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,220
So ugly.

233
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,650
Auntie, thank you for taking care of it so well.

234
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,810
It was no trouble at all.

235
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,010
Hey! This cat is so annoying.

236
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,640
It wouldn't stop meowing all day and night.

237
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,490
Don't worry. I'll bring it back to K&K tonight.

238
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,170
This... Can't even take care of himself and wants to take care of a cat.

239
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,700
See how long it takes until the cat dies.

240
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,060
I raised a cat before.

241
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,720
Grandpa, he's very attentive.

242
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,210
- Want to carry it?
- No! Don't come here!

243
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,500
Don't come here!

244
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,030
- Carry it.
- Go away!

245
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,830
Say "Grandpa." "Grandpa."

246
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,590
What happened today? Why are you so happy?

247
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,230
Did you win?

248
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,100
Pretty much. Semifinals.

249
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,260
Give the cat to me.

250
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,900
Whatever. At least you weren't wasting your time.

251
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,030
Grandpa,

252
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:58,460
have you gotten bored of listening to these opera CDs?

253
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,140
Later, I'll look around and get you some new ones.

254
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,950
Why are you looking at me like that?

255
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,870
Did you change personality?

256
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,240
It's rare for you to be so filial to me.

257
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,420
Oh right.

258
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,650
Wasn't your phone camera broken?

259
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,530
I have a few- Hey, this one is new.

260
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,200
Take it and use it.

261
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,050
Did the club lose money and you want to borrow from me?

262
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,800
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

263
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,710
Do you have anything else you want?

264
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,880
Make a list and I'll buy it one at a time later.

265
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,530
We're the only ones left in our Han family.

266
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,240
We only have each other; don't try to be polite with me.

267
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,990
Oh my god! Kitty! We're going back to K&K.

268
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,300
What is this scoundrel doing?!

269
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,820
Come, come. Let's go back to K&K.

270
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,390
<i>[SP Gaming]</i>

271
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,200
If you agree, I'll start procedures for Little Ai leaving the country.

272
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,950
Give me a few more days.

273
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,120
I need to talk with Little Ai first.

274
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,340
Thank you, Solo.

275
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,260
You're right.

276
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,750
Girls are more suited to be with their mothers.

277
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,740
As a man, I can't say anything comfortably.

278
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,210
I believe you and Nan Wei will give her the best environment to thrive.

279
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,290
Your family is more suited for Little Ai's growth.

280
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,490
Then, I will wait for your news.

281
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,430
After you leave, will Han Shangyan be okay on his own?

282
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,570
You understand how he is.

283
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,610
There's nothing that he can't handle.

284
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,960
He has his own way of managing that group of kids. He can control them.

285
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,530
His abilities are admirable.

286
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,220
You are the same.

287
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,900
As someone without any background, you relied on your own ability to get to this position.

288
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,180
Solo, I wasn't able to help you in those years.

289
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,530
In fact, I hurt you.

290
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,230
I hope you will get better and better. I always have.

291
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,220
Little Ai is not only my daughter.

292
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,380
She is yours, too.

293
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,460
Boss, Mi Shaofei retired and SP found a stronger player to replace him.

294
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,470
He's called Fu Ying, do you know him?

295
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,930
He is a worthy young talent.

296
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:11,840
The technical ability of SP Team Two's captain is on par with Grunt's.

297
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,410
If he's so great, why put him on the Team Two?

298
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,630
Solo has been managing the SP Club well these past years.

299
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,980
They wanted to develop two equally-capable teams

300
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,130
so that they can get two medals.

301
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,220
Two medals?

302
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,090
My cat.

303
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,780
Their goal is to get a gold and bronze medal at the same time.

304
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:45,560
Even more, when our club isn't doing its best, to get a gold and silver then kick us out.

305
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,040
They're so ambitious.

306
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,820
97, I need to have a private chat with Boss.

307
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,310
Okay.

308
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,570
There's something I want to give you a heads-up about.

309
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm taking Little Ai with me.

310
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,690
You want to take away his daughter?

311
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,540
She's also my daughter.

312
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,760
Actually, you didn't need to let me know about this.

313
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,480
When we first came back to China to establish the Chinese branch, I already said

314
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,980
that what happens between you two is not my concern.

315
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,850
<i>Little Ai.</i>

316
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,140
<i>Little Ai, what are you doing?</i>

317
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,070
Do you hear me?

318
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,620
Wait a moment. I need to change.

319
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,170
It takes that long to change?

320
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,290
You only opened the door after I knocked on it for such a long time?

321
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,470
I was putting my ointment on and wasn't wearing my hearing aid.

322
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,100
Next time, don't lock your door when you're not wearing your hearing aid.

323
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,590
It's nothing!  We are no longer living in a bungalow now.

324
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,660
Also, nobody uses gas anymore.

325
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,460
I won't get carbon dioxide poisoning.

326
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,460
Dad, you care that much about me?

327
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,130
Aren't you speaking nonsense?

328
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,800
Is it still itchy?

329
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,480
I am itchy to death. When Grandma is not home, there's no one to put the ointment on for me.

330
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,700
Tell me. Did I inherit urticaria from you?

331
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,500
You can't blame this on me. It's your mom.

332
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,650
As expected. I knew she wouldn't be able to pass down any good traits to me.

333
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,320
Little Ai.

334
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,100
She's your mom. You can't talk like this.

335
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,180
She only gave birth to me; she didn't raise me.

336
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,990
I'm only calling her mom out of respect for you.

337
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,690
Little Ai, I have something to discuss with you.

338
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,250
Other than moving in with Mom, everything else is negotiable.

339
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,200
You really are my daughter. A little genius.

340
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,070
You're really sending me away?

341
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,060
Dad, she left you back then to leave the country.

342
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,190
I get annoyed whenever I see her.

343
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,640
Silly child,

344
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,600
your mom and I broke up mutually.

345
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,990
No. Don't lie to me.

346
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,890
When have I ever lied to you?

347
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,700
No way. You two have divorce papers. Grandma showed it to me.

348
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,970
Grandma said that you two divorced right after giving birth to me!

349
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,670
And after having me, she left the country. She's the one who left you!

350
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,000
You used to be poor. She didn't want you and didn't want me.

351
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,530
Now that I am grown, she wants me again.

352
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,790
How can she be this horrible?!

353
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,290
Little Ai,

354
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,300
this is all your misunderstanding. When you're older, I'll explain.

355
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,350
I only want you. I don't want her.

356
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,960
Little Ai!

357
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,380
Little Ai!

358
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,900
Open the door, Little Ai.

359
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,840
Didn't we agree on this?

360
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,050
We have three rules. No locking doors when arguing.

361
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,400
<i>Open the door, Little Ai.</i>

362
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,740
<i>Open the door!</i>

363
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,000
I am not wearing my hearing aid! I can't hear you!

364
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,540
Mom, do you have time right now?

365
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,940
I need your help with something.

366
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,510
I need to go to the club this evening.

367
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,100
I am not comfortable leaving Little Ai home alone.

368
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,010
Can you come over?

369
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,920
All right. I will wait for you to come before I leave.

370
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,110
What's wrong with your throat?

371
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,510
- Not sure. Maybe because these past two days the weather has been cold.
- Does it hurt?

372
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,630
Doesn't hurt. Just itchy.

373
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,040
Why did the Little Ancestor come here again?

374
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,330
Why are you here again?

375
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,900
Running away from home.

376
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,800
You're pretty good at memorizing directions, and came directly to our dorm.

377
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,760
Look whose daughter you're talking about.

378
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,200
Yes, yes, yes. You're Solo's daughter. You're especially worthy of praise. You're the best.

379
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,640
You're the best. Now return to the main topic.

380
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,670
Why did you run away from home again? What happened?

381
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,400
I feel, ever since my mom came back,

382
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,200
my dad doesn't love me as much anymore.

383
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,300
What else can I do?

384
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,700
- Let's go inside and talk.
- Come in.

385
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,200
Your luggage.

386
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,800
Don't care about it anymore? I'll bring it in for you.

387
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:58,440

Ripped & Resync By HiDeYuKi KaKaShI</i>

388
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,790
She doesn't want to come out.

389
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,600
Sorry to trouble you again.

390
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,300
It's okay! This is no trouble at all! Yaya and I like her a lot.

391
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,550
We welcome her here. But if she always runs away from home,

392
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,530
I'm afraid that next time she'll go somewhere else instead of here.

393
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,040
That'd be dangerous.

394
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,170
She won't.

395
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,100
- How do you know?
- I know my own daughter.

396
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,320
Little Ai just likes to throw tantrums, but she knows how to protect herself.

397
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,700
She came to find you as a way of demonstration to me.

398
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,360
Tong Nian, this is a girls' dormitory, so it's inconvenient for us two men to go inside.

399
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,140
Can you call Little Ai out here?

400
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,600
I'll wait for her here. I want to talk to her.

401
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,630
Actually, since our dormitory is the postgraduate student dorm, they're not as strict.

402
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,730
I'll ask the auntie if I can let you two inside. Wait for me.

403
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,130
Auntie, these two people are from my family.

404
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,330
They want to come inside to discuss something. They'll leave within 30 minutes. Is that okay?

405
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,400
Go ahead. Just watch the time.

406
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,150
Thank you.

407
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,490
Keep quiet.

408
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,300
Sorry. Wait three minutes for me, it won't take long.

409
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,130
Hurry! Clean up the room. They're outside the door.

410
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:24,210
- Outside the door?
- They came up?

411
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,900
Chun Chun, your undergarments.

412
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,160
This one! This one!

413
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,000
Why are you laughing? This is all your fault.

414
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,330
Yaya, look at the crumbs you dropped.

415
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

416
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,500
- Are we done?
- No, no.

417
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,200
I'll let them inside.

418
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,700
Okay, you can come in.

419
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,860
Yaya! Chun Chun! Don't you two have something to do?

420
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,870
- Oh right!
- Right! Let's go.

421
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,460
Little Ai.

422
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,880
On the way here, I thought about it a lot.

423
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:13,250
Since you have such a deep misunderstanding about what happened between me and your mom,

424
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,890
I should explain it to you.

425
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,140
I hope they can properly talk it out this time, right?

426
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,100
Solo used to be a team captain, and now he's the person-in-charge.

427
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,120
He understands the human heart very well. Don't worry.

428
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,780
Understands the human heart? But he still wasn't able to convince you.

429
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,580
It's so troublesome to have children now, right?

430
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:18,350
You can't just give birth to them. You have to raise them, be responsible for them, and educate them.

431
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,890
Anyway, if I have children in the future,

432
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,490
I'll be a very competent mother.

433
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,450
I know.

434
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,380
You know what?

435
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,800
This is none of your business.

436
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,820
<i>Stop explaining it! I don't want to listen!</i>

437
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,850
Listen to me, Little Ai. Listen to me.

438
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,200
You never wanted to listen to what I had to say.

439
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,990
You never wanted me. You didn't even know I was born.

440
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,480
Since you didn't want me, why did you promise my mom that you'd raise me?

441
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,500
You should have just given me to the orphanage!

442
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,610
Little Ai, things aren't as you think.

443
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,780
In the beginning, I didn't expect it.

444
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,990
But I have to tell you,

445
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,940
I never wanted to abandon you.

446
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,520
I never did!

447
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,390
I...

448
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,900
I don't trust you!

449
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,820
After my mom gave birth to me, she didn't want me.

450
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,200
You never thought that I would exist!

451
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,380
You two are the same! The same!

452
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,550
The both of you don't want me.

453
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:35,560
You wish I didn't exist because that way, I wouldn't have ruined your perfect lives.

454
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,730
Little Ai,

455
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,160
in my life,

456
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,300
all of my suffering and failures

457
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,380
were my own choices.

458
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,620
I really regret them,

459
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,960
but I never regretted

460
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,000
having you as my daughter

461
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,670
because you taught me what it means to treasure someone.

462
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:52,660
Seeing you grow up from a little baby to now,

463
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,300
I walked with you through all the sadness and happiness.

464
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,110
Did you know?

465
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,570
Those are the best memories

466
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,190
of my life.

467
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Are you looking for the hearing aid?

468
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,500
I have it here, but it is damaged.

469
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,000
Help me look after her. I will be back after I fix this.

470
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,100
Solo, how about letting her stay here for a few days?

471
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Come back to talk when she has calmed down. How's that?

472
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,500
All right. Then I will give you some...

473
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,000
No need. She doesn't need money here. We have meal cards for the cafeteria.

474
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The money in the meal card is still money. Here.

475
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,400
Who is that poor? We still have enough money for food.

476
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,800
All right.

477
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:09,700
I won't turn off my phone. Call me anytime there's an issue.

478
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,200
All right.

479
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,300
Little Ai.

480
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Little Ai, it's me.

481
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,400
Don't cry anymore. They are gone.

482
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,300
Here, look at me.

483
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,000
I know that you are not angry at him anymore.

484
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,500
You love your dad a lot. Right?

485
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:09,370
♫ <i>I start to portray an unfamiliar me</i> ♫

486
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:13,080
Don't cry anymore. It's okay, it's okay.

487
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,910
Don't cry, Little Ai.

488
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:33,180
♫ <i>But no matter how much I practiced, I can't act like myself</i> ♫

489
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,200
♫ <i>The me who doesn't care about you</i> ♫

490
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,400
<i> After my mom gave birth to me, she didn't want me.</i>

491
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,600
<i>  You never thought that I would exist!</i>

492
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,700
<i> The two of you are the same. The same!</i>

493
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,000
<i> Both of you don't want me.</i>

494
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,200
<i>You wish I didn't exist because that way, I wouldn't have ruined your perfect lives.</i>

495
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,100
I had to trouble you again.

496
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,700
You are troubling her. Why are you telling me?

497
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,400
I don't feel good inside.

498
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,300
I'll feel better after I apologize to you.

499
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,900
If you can't bear to leave her, why pretend to be a good person?

500
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,800
You did that before and are still doing it now.

501
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,900
On occasion, you should listen to the child's opinion.

502
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,600
I am not pretending to be a good person.

503
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,300
After all, she is a girl.

504
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,700
It's better to be with her mom than with me.

505
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,860
I can't take care of the home all the time.

506
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,600
I have wronged her.

507
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,700
I didn't take good care of her.

508
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,300
She has had uticaria since she was little.

509
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,700
Back then, I was able to put ointment on her.

510
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,600
Now, I can't even do that for her.

511
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,500
But moms are not the same.

512
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,400
It's better with a mom.

513
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,900
When she gets even older,

514
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,700
there will be many more things that as a dad I can't do for her.

515
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,900
Old Han...

516
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,100
Frankly speaking,

517
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,200
I really don't understand how she thinks.

518
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,670
You don't have any children,

519
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,200
so it's probably hard for you to understand.

520
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,600
Sometimes when I look at her,

521
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,100
I am rather satisfied.

522
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,500
But some other times,

523
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,700
I feel like a failure.

524
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,300
The hearing aid is broken. She can't hear anything right now.

525
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,400
Solo wasn't able to get through to her?

526
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,330
She is close to her dad. If Solo can't get through, then we won't have a chance either.

527
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,700
I don't know.

528
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,700
Hello.

529
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
<i>Bring Little Ai out.</i>

530
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,500
Now?

531
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,500
Han Shanyang said he wanted me to bring her out.

532
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,300
- What does he want to do?
- He didn't say.

533
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,800
You didn't ask either.

534
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,700
I didn't.

535
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,200
I need to think of a way to get her out.

536
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,300
<i>[It's okay to be angry, but I am hungry.]</i>

537
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,000
<i> [You are probably hungry, too. Don't hold a grudge against food.]</i>

538
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,500
I lied to get her out.

539
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,800
But I think that even if you see her, you may not be able to take her away.

540
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,900
<i> [I am an old friend of your parents. If you want to hear about their story,]</i>

541
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,700
<i> [then go with me to buy a new hearing aid.] </i>

542
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,280
You are outdated. Hearing aids need to be prescribed.

543
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,500
You think you can buy it anywhere?

544
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,600
I am guessing that you have a backup hearing aid.

545
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,700
How do you know?

546
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,900
If you want to hear their story,

547
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,600
then put your hearing aid back in.

548
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,200
It's in my backpack.

549
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,200
Go get her backpack. I will watch her.

550
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,100
Don't be too mean to her.

551
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,100
Little Ai, I will help you get your hearing aid.

552
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,600
Wait for me.
