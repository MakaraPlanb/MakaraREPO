168
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,620
After following, you can see "activity." It's just like "Moments." <i>(T/N: From WeChat)</i>

169
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,990
"Like," if she posted a new song or traveled somewhere.

170
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,930
She'll post and you can see.

176
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,110
Little Squid followed a new account!

177
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,800
An account with no profile picture?

178
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,900
Little Squid, when can you follow me?

179
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,710
Why? Why would Little Squid follow him?

180
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,810
I also want to be followed by Little Squid!

181
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,570
Little Squid, I've followed you for a long time now. Could you follow me back?

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,410
Little Squid, be careful of bad guys!

183
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,190
Your Highness Squid, they have no profile picture. Be careful!

184
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:34,060
Little Squid followed an account with no profile picture?

185
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,470
This can't do. I have to follow them, too.

186
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,470
I will definitely be able to determine their relationship.

You're already his girlfriend!

188
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,810
Just following and leaving a phone number, are you really that happy?

189
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,290
Hey, don't say that. I already told you I'm not his real girlfriend.

190
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,950
Won't you slowly become a real one?

191
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,510

193
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,450

- Yes!

- We now follow each other, right?
- Great!

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,460
Don't play around! I have to go to the bathroom to make a call.

198
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,600
- Why're you so stingy? Let me listen in!

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,030
<i>And then each time we win,</i>

342
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,460
<i>we'll drink and sing without having to worry about the landlord.</i>

343
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,000
<i>That is the future me.</i>

344
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
<i>Little Mi, are you dumb?</i>

345
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,610
<i>Even if you can buy this roof,</i>

346
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,510
<i>with your loud yelling and calling, the landlord would surely drive you out.</i>

347
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,660
<i>Yeah, Little Mi. You can stop dreaming.</i>

348
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,510
<i>Even if we get the national championship,</i>

349
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,840
<i>that money still isn't enough to buy this house.</i>

350
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:12,590
<i>Then, we have to keep fighting and fighting all the way until we're world champions!</i>

351
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,160
<i>Right!</i>

352
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,980
<i> When we are world champions,</i>

353
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,320
<i>we'll buy this whole patch.</i>

354
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,990
<i>At the time, let's see who thinks we're loud.</i>

355
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,500
<i>Right, we have to be like this! World championship, we're coming!</i>

356
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,860
<i>World champions!</i>

357
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,080
<i>Hey, are you done? Could you be quieter?</i>

358
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,850
<i>If you keep screaming, I'll call the cops!</i>

359
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,390
<i>Old Han, I'm asking you guys.</i>

360
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,720
<i>Say, if we really become world champions one day,</i>

361
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,360
<i>do you still have any other dreams to fulfill?</i>

362
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,980
<i>I'll go first, is that okay?</i>

363
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,320
<i>I want to help my grandma open a large store</i>

364
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,560
<i>and recruit many people to help her maintain the store and work for her.</i>

365
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,220
<i>She just needs to sit and collect the money, that's all.</i>

366
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,280
<i>I just want to be with you all</i>

367
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,800
<i>and travel around the world!</i>

368
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,330
<i>Are you dumb?</i>

369
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:12,690
<i>You just have to practice so that you don't mess up when competing so you can compete in the world competition. Right?</i>

370
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,630
<i>Each time we compete somewhere, just stay for a few extra days, wouldn't that be traveling the world?</i>

371
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,030
<i>Well, I don't care.</i>

372
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,360
<i>With all of you, I'm satisfied.</i>

373
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,140
<i>Ai Qing, how about you?</i>

374
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,210
<i>My dream...</i>

375
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,040
<i>My dream is...</i>

376
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:37,190
<i>The dreams of the people I love can all come true.</i>

377
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,660
<i>The people you love?</i>

378
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,820
<i>Does that include us?</i>

379
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,940
<i>Of course... it does!</i>

380
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,090
<i>No! No! No!</i>

381
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,000
<i>What about you, Old Han?</i>

382
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,140
<i>My dream is very simple.</i>

383
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,200
<i>To become world champion.</i>

384
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,680
<i>Prove to the entire world</i>

385
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,590
<i>that there is nothing that the Chinese cannot do.</i>

386
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,670
<i>That one's amazing, Old Han.</i>

387
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,450
<i>Then, what if you fight till the end but don't find a girlfriend or get a wife?</i>

388
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,850
<i>Don't you think you're losing?</i>

389
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,060
<i> Ou Qiang, you're worried about him? You better take a rest.</i>

390
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,090
<i>His female fans total up to way more than yours, and you're worried about this?</i>

391
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,320
<i>- Right.
- Hey, who're you looking down on, Ai Qing?
- You!</i>

392
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,360
<i>- Say one more line!
- You!</i>

393
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,560
<i>- Say that again!
- Solo, he's bullying me!
- Stop, stop, stop!</i>

394
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,660
<i>- Fight him!
- Stop, stop, stop.</i>

395
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,190
<i>Captain.</i>

396
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,960
<i>Your dream...</i>

397
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,310
<i>As your team captain,</i>

398
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,860
<i>my dream is</i>

399
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,930
<i>to help you all fulfill your dreams, how's that? Is it good?</i>

400
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,500
<i>- Great! Amazing!
- Good Captain!</i>

401
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,110
<i>Cheers to our world championship!</i>

402
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:10,760
<i>- World champions!
- Cheers!</i>

403
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,420
<i>Quiet!</i>

404
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,110
<i>Bottoms up!</i>

405
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,140
<i> Bottoms up.</i>

406
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,570
<i>Drink it all, all of it!</i>

407
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,570
<i>Look at that star.</i>

408
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,430
<i>It's probably a plane.</i>

409
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,400
<i>That's not a plane, it's a star.</i>

410
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,270
<i>When we become world champions,</i>

411
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,000
<i>we'll become the brightest stars in the sky!</i>

412
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,970
<i>- Right?
- Yeah!
- That's right!  We'll be the</i>

413
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,530
<i>brightest stars in the sky!</i>

414
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,850
<i>I'm that one, see?</i>

415
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,880
<i>Little Mi star.</i>

416
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,820
<i>Ai Qing star.</i>

417
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,720
<i> This star.</i>

418
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,630
<i>What's Han Shangyan called? What star?</i>

419
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,790
<i>Han Shangyan is called "sour-face star."</i>

420
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,860
<i>Really, he's always got that face on every day.</i>

421
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,910
<i> Right, he yells at me so harshly.</i>

422
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,660
<i>Our Solo is still the best.</i>

423
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,890
<i> Taken by surprise!</i>

424
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,930
<i>A serving... of dog feed.
(T/N: Slang for public display of affection. The single dog is forced to eat it.)</i>

425
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,450
<i>No! No!</i>

427
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,300
- Hello, Anna, Oliver, long time no see.
- Hello, Gun, welcome back.

428
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,900
Hello!

429
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,340
Hello, nice to meet you.

430
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,260
Nice to meet you.

431
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,870
My name is All.

432
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,540
Hello.

433
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,500
Let's get down to business.

434
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,020
Not bad, Old Han. Had I known earlier, I would've gone to K&K.

435
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,520
Ou Qiang!

436
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,750
Hello, everybody.

437
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,200
- Long time no see!
- Long time no see.

438
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,100
Long time no see.

439
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,440
- Hello! Hello!
- Hi.

440
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

441
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,510
Nan Wei!

442
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,340
Hey!

443
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,430
You haven't died?

444
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,540
- Long time no see.
- Hello, hello.

445
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,290
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Old Han is pretty amazing.

446
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,220
He founded K&K Club from scratch.

447
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,620
You probably suffered a lot, Old Han?

448
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,410
Let me introduce you to my partner, Nan Wei.

449
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:55,260
Hello, everyone. My name is Nan Wei and welcome to Norway.

450
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,690
Lincoln. Katie.

451
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:04,800
You look like you're China's most talented lady geek, right?

452
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,120
Nice to meet you.

453
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,560
Honor to meet you! Honor to meet you!

454
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,970
I used to compete, too. But now I'm retired.

455
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,480
He's our team manager Su Cheng's husband.

456
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,170
They've been married for many years now.

457
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,440
It's okay; whatever.

458
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,090
I know my wife used to be with Solo.

459
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,600
But who hasn't dated before, right?

460
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,100
Yes.

461
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,430
Your team manager is married?

462
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,700
I thought Su Cheng was Gun God's girlfriend.

463
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,620
What're you joking about?

464
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,980
Yeah, what're you joking about?

465
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,580
Didn't Old Han bring his girlfriend last time to watch his competition?

466
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,290
You've got a girlfriend?

467
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,700
Which idiot wants to be with you?

468
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,230
She's not. She's just a friend.

469
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,830
Look at him. Don't play with her feelings!

470
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,660
Scram.

471
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,350
Scram? How about if we scram together. Here, have a seat.

472
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,700
Take a seat everyone. Let me introduce to you the details of the Invitational match this time.

473
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,020
Okay? Here.

474
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,310
This is our training room.

475
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,550
- Hello, welcome.
- Hi, Boss.
- Hi.

476
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,090
- Hello.
- Let's have a look.

477
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:20,180
Thank you! Welcome, everyone.

478
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,600
- Use whichever computer you want. Here, try it out.
- Okay.

479
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

480
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,130
Ou Qiang, study well.

481
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,100
Don't worry.

482
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,720
I really didn't think you'd come here with Han Shangyan.

483
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,660
I thought SP and K&K were like fire and water and couldn't get along.

484
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,770
Of course, it's fire and water.

485
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:46,120
Also, there's only one champion.

486
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,960
Mind your manners for the Invitational match.

487
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,680
No, I think you misunderstood what I said.

488
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,150
What I mean is Han Shangyan and Solo...

489
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,530
I know Han Shangyan; he's not like that.

490
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,490
He wouldn't create a club just because of his own personal grievances,

491
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,300
and then put everyone's dreams on top of such a nonsense reason.

492
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,210
Right, he came for the world championship.

493
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,380
What? We also came for the world championship.

494
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,420
Okay. You can practice. Call me over if you need anything.

495
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,600
- Thank you.
- Okay.

496
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,760
This is only an Invitational match.

497
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,000
You don't have to be so nervous, okay?

498
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,230
Should we go back to the hotel first?

499
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,940
Why? K&K and us are in the same hotel.

500
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,780
We can go back together later.

501
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,400
I think it's so awkward.

502
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,560
Little kids sure have a lot of problems.

503
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,240
Is it necessary for you to worry about these matters?

504
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,020
Hurry and go.

505
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,010
- Nan Wei.
- Hello.

506
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,950
Thank you for welcoming us today.

507
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,890
We'll go back to the hotel first. See you at the arena.

508
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,310
Okay. Forgive me if anything was amiss.

509
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,040
Keep it up.

510
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,610
We'll go back now.

511
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,650
Nice to meet you.

512
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,630
I see that kid is pretty scared of you.

513
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,720
What is there to be scared of?

514
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,190
Boss, your room is so big!

515
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,510
There're flowers and wine!

516
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,560
These flowers smell nice.

517
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,450
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day!

518
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:03,100
Is it because when Sister Cheng made the room reservation, did someone misunderstand us?

519
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,270
Well, you don't have a girlfriend.

520
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,320
Give this to me, okay?

521
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,750
Oh right! Don't you like candy? The chocolates are for you.

522
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,760
I'm leaving.

523
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,000
Is that all right, Boss?

524
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,190
Get out.

525
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,640
I'm going.

526
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,070
Hello?

527
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,780
Ta Da!

528
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:57,210
I wish you a Happy Valentine's Day tomorrow! Happy birthday!

529
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,800
Did you like the surprise I prepared for you?

530
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,660
I loved it.

531
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,570
I called you, <i>but wishing you a happy birthday isn't the most important point.</i>

532
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:11,670
<i>What's most important is that last week I ordered a</i> necklace from my friend.

533
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,870
If you have time, you must pick it up for me.

534
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,460
I don't have time.

535
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,790
Han Shangyan!

536
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,630
<i>Whenever I ask you to do something, </i>you always say you're busy!

537
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,910
Your attitude towards <i>me is getting worse!</i>

538
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,400
I'm here to lead the team and compete,

539
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,920
not your fashion shopper.

540
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,790
<i>I don't have time to go to Norway.</i>

541
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,610
<i>Just help me.</i>

542
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,920
I've already sent the money to your account and I'll send the address to your phone in a bit.

543
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,150
Tonight, you must go get it, or else! <i>They won't store it!</i>

544
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,250
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

545
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,830
<i>I don't care now. I'm leaving this to you.</i>

546
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,440
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

547
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,150
<i>We followed each other!</i>

548
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,150
<i>I'm also the only person he follows.</i>

549
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,580
<i>March 2nd, 4:20 p.m. flight.</i>

550
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,010
<i>Coming back from Norway.</i>

551
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,730
<i>Later, I'll search up the flight number.</i>

552
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,680
<i>Today is February 14th.</i>

553
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,100
<i>So, how many more days until March 2nd?</i>

554
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,860
Isn't today Valentine's Day?

555
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,740
Should I prepare a gift for him?

556
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,770
Although he's a fake lover,

557
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,480
I should still give a present.

558
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,840
What if... I also get a gift.

559
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:54,170
<i>1920, it's an original, all-carved, and was made in Zhejiang province.</i>

560
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,780
<i>Oh, that could be true.</i>

561
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,280
<i>Yeah, yeah exactly.</i>

562
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,990
Welcome.

563
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,920
Wait a moment.

564
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,470
How can I help you, Sir?

565
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,750
I'm here for Han Jiajia's necklace.

566
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,390
- Oh, you must be Mister Han, right?
- Yes.

567
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,450
Okay, wait a moment.

568
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,930
This is the one.

569
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,880
You can have a look.

570
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,150
It has been here for a long time.

571
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,060
I'm glad she can get it now.

572
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,280
Thank you very much.

573
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,330
<i>I really want to know what he's doing.</i>

574
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,760
Nian Nian? Nian Nian!

575
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,660
Could you be more focused when eating breakfast? What're you looking at your phone for?

576
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,910
Why're you so busy?

577
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,580
I'm looking at today's weather.

578
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,580
- I'm full.
- You're not finished.

579
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,500
She really doesn't care about eating breakfast.

580
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,910
<i>Is he sleeping?</i>

581
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,280
Bye-bye.

582
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,950
Can I call him?

583
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,920
<i>The number you have reached is not in service at this time.</i>

584
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,530
<i>Is he still busy?</i>

585
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,750
<i>I shouldn't bother him.</i>

586
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,310
Hello? I got your necklace.

587
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,850
<i>Thank you. I knew you would get it for me.</i>

588
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,740
Anything else?

589
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,260
Later, take a picture and send it to me so I can see.

590
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,460
Remember, you can't lose it!

591
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,800
If you don't believe me, then you should have Little Bai get it for you.

592
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,260
<i>It's not that I don't believe you!</i>

593
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,610
But, growing up, you've never had an honest line.

594
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,540
Listening to your words, shouldn't I...

595
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,410

599
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,960
Are you free?

600
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,790
I want to treat you to drink something.

601
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,220
Where?

602
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,020
Here.

603
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,200
Hello, may I help you?

604
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,360
Two cups of Americano, thank you.

605
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,990
Okay.

606
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,000
Such a pretty box.

607
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,090
Is it for your girlfriend?

608
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,650
Talk business.

609
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,610
Actually, I have no real business.

610
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,160
Isn't today your birthday?

611
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,910
So, I wanted to treat you to drink something and celebrate.

612
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,680
Look! It's just past twelve. I still remember.

613
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,660
Did you know?

614
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,690
When I first met you, I thought your birthday was very romantic.

615
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,790
One year, I was celebrating Valentine's Day with Solo.

616
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,240
You were following us like a tail and insisted we had to treat you to a meal.

617
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,430
I was frustrated to the point where I was about to cry. I thought you were messing with us.

618
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,190
But, finally, you told us Valentine's Day was your birthday.

619
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,660
In the minds of people like you, love is above all.

620
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,180
Friendship isn't worth a dime.

621
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,570
- Han Shangyan–
- What? Am I wrong?

622
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,280
Excuse me. Your two cups of Americano, please.

623
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,860
Thanks.

624
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,910
You two are meeting privately?

625
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,220
Didn't invite me to coffee?

626
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,810
- Excuse me.
- What is it? Go, go.

- Fourteen dollars. Fourteen dollars, please.

00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,440
