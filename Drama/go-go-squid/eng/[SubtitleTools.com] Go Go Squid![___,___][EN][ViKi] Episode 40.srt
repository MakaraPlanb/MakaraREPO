23
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,100
So everyone couldn't sleep?

24
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,300
How can we?

25
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,700
-Weren't you snoring earlier? I heard it
-I faked it.

26
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,550
How could you snore so loudly?

27
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,300
right?

28
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,000
Anyways,

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm super nervous right now.

30
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,600
I feel that even at this age,  I haven't seen such a big scene before.

31
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,100
Say, how many years have the two of us been competing together?

32
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,400
I haven't felt like this before.

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,500
Who told you to idolize Boss?

34
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,300
- Isn't his dream your dream?
- That's true.

35
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,900
But boss never had you in mind.

36
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,300
Watch your mouth.

37
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,700
Nice, I was getting thirsty.

38
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,600
Although I cannot go on stage, but I will be in the audience wishing you guys well.

39
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,700
But really, being with you guys for so long...is quite nice.

40
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,400
Of course!

41
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,100
Come! Let's cheer.

42
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,500
Come!

43
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Be a bit quieter.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let me tell you

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,400
just now, in bed I was researching a new tactics.

46
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,000
super useful.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Really?

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
Look, when we were competing, I researched the opponents in a lot of detail.

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,900
We attack together, find a vulnerability, three people go and attack the vulnerability.

50
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,400
Breakthrough their node.

51
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
- Take them by surprise!
- Yeah!

52
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Because of our forceful attack, at this time all of them will definitely come and defend.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
Right. Demo, remember this.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,200
Deliberately show our vulnerability, then reinforce our server.

55
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,400
Han Shangyan

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,700
Han Shangyan?

57
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm down here.

58
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,000
Couldn't sleep?

59
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,600
When you're excited you can't sleep.

60
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,400
I was afraid to disturb Buff's rest.

61
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,000
Then you're not afraid to disturb my rest?

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,200
You're not competing. You're not worth it.

63
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Honestly, after that competition,

64
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,300
I really hoped that you would make a comeback.

65
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,200
We were lucky that day.

66
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,400
Those five people weren't from the same club and didn't have tacit understanding of each other. We won by a narrow margin.

67
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I can't anymore, Little Mi.

68
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,600
A hero already past his prime!

69
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm past my prime, you're not!

70
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,700
You really don't want to compete anymore?

71
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,600
No.

72
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
You really are stubborn.

73
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
What about doing individual events?

74
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,580
Forget about it.

75
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,700
Such a pity, a pity!

76
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,840
I'm 30 already.

77
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,200
If I compete, the most I can play is two more years.

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,800
Like Buff, won't last long.

79
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,700
But the kids I'm leading

80
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,000
at minimum can compete for another ten years.

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Cool.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,400
Ten years... they could get first place more than ten times, or even as much as a couple hundred.

83
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,250
The past...is the past.

84
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,800
It doesn't matter if people remember Gun God.

85
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Right now I am not trying to myself out to be a hero.

86
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,200
What I care about is the training center's reputation.

87
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,200
You should stop hanging around with me here! Wherever it's nice and cool is where you go and stay.

88
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,260
The chair in the training room is fine too.

89
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,400
The big table in the meeting room is also fine too.

90
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,500
The table is big. Lying down there will be comfortable.

91
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,300
Give me a break. Even if I let you sleep, you won't fall asleep for sure.

92
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,500
I suspect, that in your heart you're definitely worried about Solo's side.

93
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,700
What is there to worry about?

94
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,700
If they can't even get third place, in the future he shouldn't say that he is my bro.

95
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,800
Come! Let's sleep!

96
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,500
Go to my bed and sleep.

97
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,800
It's pretty good here, no need.

98
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,320
Yaya! I can't fall asleep!

99
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,200
Me too!

100
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,000
Just now when I turned over I was afraid I would wake you up. You should have said earlier that you weren't asleep.

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,400
Or... why don't we go over right now?

102
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,300
Right now?

103
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,200
- It's 11p.m.!
- If we go over now, will we disturb their resting?

104
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I know near K&K there is a 24/7 convenience store.

105
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,100
We can wait until morning there.

106
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,800
In any case, we can't fall asleep. What if we fall asleep and we oversleep, what then?

107
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you sure?

108
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sure!

109
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,700
Get up!

110
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,040
Little Mi, get up!

111
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,200
Are you here?

112
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,900
Didn't you set up a facial recognition system for them?

113
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,700
I did!

114
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,400
I think forgot to set it up for myself...

115
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,400
It's fine, it's fine! If I make a few expressions, maybe I will look like someone and it will open up? Right?

116
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
Open.

117
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,200
Didn't I say, that I would go pick you up in the afternoon?

118
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,400
I... last night, the both of us got here. At midnight.

119
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,400
I... I ask for a bed. I need to take a nap for a while.

120
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh, I know! They have an empty space here. I'll bring you there.

121
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,700
I'm bringing her there!

122
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,200
Be more quiet! They haven't woken up yet.

123
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,400

145

Anyways, during winter vacation I was idle and

146
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,200
had nothing to do. So I learned some latte art, and I learned how to do it pretty fast.

Are we?

Of course we are! The first time we saw each other, you were in a bad mood at the time.

155

You just so happened to choose my little brother's internet cafe, resulting in us meeting.

156

The second time, in Guangzhou. You were in Guangzhou. I was also in Guangzhou.

157
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,700
And we met again!

158
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,000
The third time, is just now!

159
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,200

160
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,700

Aren't you sleepy?

165
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm sleepy... last night I didn't sleep the entire night.

166
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
I sat for so long that my back is sore. How can I not be sleepy?

167
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,200
Do you need to go up and sleep? Otherwise, you won't have the energy to watch the competition.

168
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I am going to wait until you finish this coffee and then I'll go up.

169
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,300
Then, I might not finish drinking it.

170

00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,700
I would hate to drink away this heart that you made for me.

172
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,000
Aren't we really fated?

173
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,300
Aren't we really fated? Really fated? Really fated? Really fated?

174
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,400
- It's spilling!
- Answer me!
- It's spilling!

175
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,500
- Just now you didn't tell me!
- It's spilling!

176
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,800
- Aren't we really fated? Are we fated or not?
- Yes, yes, yes.

177
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,200
- Are we fated or not?
- Yes!

178
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,600
Are we or not?

179
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
♫ <i>Quietly saying: I love you</i> ♫

180
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
♫ <i>Let’s go together, let’s go together, holding you in my arms</i> ♫

181
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
♫ <i>Holding hands, holding hands, I'll stay by your side</i> ♫

182
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,600
♫ <i>Time will stop at this moment</i> ♫

183
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,100
♫ <i>Quietly telling you:</i> ♫

184
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,500
♫ <i> I love you</i> ♫
Wake up, wake up!

185
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,400
What time is it?

186
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,000
It's 8 a.m.

187
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,500
Then let's sleep for a while longer.

188
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,600
Why are you here?!

189
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,000
Did you teleport here? Aren't you supposed to be at home?

190
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,400
Besides, isn't Yaya at your house?

191
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,300
I...I...I...

192
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,600
Oh my God. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I forgot that Mi Shaofei was still in my bed! Oh my God.

193
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,800
This is really awkward. I-I am going to the bathroom to brush my teeth and wash my face!

194
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,200
W-w-wait! Where's Yaya? Yaya.

195
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,800
She... s-she came here with me together. S-she's in the other room sleeping, don't worry.

196
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,900
Han Shangyan, you really don't think of me as a man?

197
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,100
If she wanted to sleep, you should've told me and I would have went somewhere else!

198
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,300
I haven't even asked whether you did anything to my girlfriend and you are already acting like you are the master, huh?

199
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,400
I, the master, is leaving.

200
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,300
Mi Shaofei!

201
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,700
Tong Nian, I am sorry.

202
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,900
Last night the two of us drank too much, I really didn't know that he was on my bed. Sorry, sorry.

203
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,800
This time, I'll forgive you. Next time you can't be like this again, understand?

204
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,900
I'll get you a toothbrush.

205
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Why do you have so many one-time use toothbrushes?

206
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,000
I often go on business trips.

207
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,700
So I prepared these so it will be more convenient.

208
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,900
Do you feel that this really doesn't feel like home?

209
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Are you too busy and have no time to pack?

210
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,800
I feel that you should find someone to help you pack.

211
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,650
Then you don't need to use these one-time use toothbrushes again.

212
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
Okay.

213
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,300
Then in the future when I pack, I'll call you over to help me.

214
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,980
Depends on my mood!

215
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,600
Han Shangyan!

216
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
There's an urgent matter.

217
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,000
- How are you feeling?
- It hurts.
-  Do you need to go to the hospital?
- Have some more water!

218
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,200
I want to compete.

219
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
What happened?

220
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,000
Your old sickness is flaring up?

221
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,600
It's not a big deal. I won't die.

222
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,600
You're already eating medicine for stomach ulcers, and that's not serious?

223
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,420
What do you think?

224
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,600
We need to have two strings to one's bow.

225
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,070
You bring Grunt to the hospital. Everyone else come out and for a meeting.

226
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,200
We'll discuss the matter of swapping people.

227
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,230
Boss! It's not like I haven't gone up

228
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,200
while I was sick.

229
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm fine. Once I have some medicine I'll be okay.

230
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,700
You can't have any more medicine! You just took it!

231
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,800
Rest up first. Don't think too much.

232
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,300
Everyone else come out for a meeting.

233
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,900
Boss! Boss!

234
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,300
Boss!

235
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,600
Boss! I want to play in the finals.

236
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,400
I beg you, don't swap me out.

237
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,200
For this day to come, do you know how long I have waited?

238
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,100
Three years. It's been three years!

239
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,500
Just for this one moment. And you want to swap me out?

240
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,600
I can go up even if I'm sick. I can do it, Boss!

241
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,000
Everyday I have been practicing, everyday I have been practicing!

242
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,700
I beg you, Boss! Don't swap me out!

243
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,800
What are you crying for?

244
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,800
Today, in this match whether we win or lose,

245
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,700
we've already got a ticket to the World Finals.

246
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,050
Right now you need to recuperate first.

247
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,400
Once you have recuperated, at that time if you play, isn't it the same?

248
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,600
But this is our home game!

249
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,000
If we lose, what do we do?

250
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,200
Do you really think you are all that? Do you really not trust your teammates at all?

251
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Without you, they will still get first place.

252
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Don't cry anymore.

253
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,600
Little Mi, bring him to the hospital and see.

254
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
Rest well. Everyone else come out for a meeting.

255
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,490
Boss!

256
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,300
- Grunt!
- Grunt!

257
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,800
- 97, call an ambulance.
- Grunt! Grunt!

258
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,600
- Go!
- Okay!

259
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,300
Going down from the stairs in the front will be more convenient. The front.

260
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,200
I think you should go with him. This kid is stubborn and competitive, look after him.

261
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
I'll go.

262
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,000
Where's Wu Bai?

263
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,400
Team Captain and One went out for a morning run.

264
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,800
Call everyone to come back. Holding a meeting.

265
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,740
Okay, I'll go make a call.

266
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,030
Boss. Everyone is here.

267
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,610
You were looking for me, Boss?

268
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,000
Make some preparations. Later on, you will go on stage on behalf of Grunt.

269
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,640
Me?

270
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,100
I-I... but... me and Grunt are apart by quite a few rankings.

271
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,400
Grunt can't go. Other than you, who else is there?

272
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,800
But...

273
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,600
You already played at the national competition, what are you afraid of?

274
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,400
That's... not the same, Boss.

275
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,500
Stop talking nonsense. Sit over there.

276
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,830
Usually we train together,

277
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,620
so I’m not going to say anymore nonsense.

278
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,160
I was just telling Grunt that the result of today's competition is not important,

279
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,660
because we already received the spot to enter the world competition.

280
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,880
But...understand this from today's competition.

281
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,420
For the main competition, you all must get me the championship. There is no other choice. Do you all understand me?

282
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,620
Yes!

283
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,960
Go ahead and open some rounds and do some practice on coordinating.

284
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,140
Today I will be your manager and accompany you for the entire duration.

285
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,010
All right.

286
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,860
Captain, we suddenly have this turn of event.

287
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,970
I hope you will bear with it.

288
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,280
Do as you normally would, I will be here.

289
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,620
Let’s go.

290
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,320
Then we wasted our efforts in changing members before.

291
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,440
If we were to compare this on the national level, then this is similar to as if using Buff to switch out Grunt.

292
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,700
Using a high level player to switch another high level player.

293
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,490
The whole team actual ability didn't get raise up.

294
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,240
Buff rank is #4, he is still stronger than Grunt.

295
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,910
But think about it,

296
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,770
if we were to consider base on age, reflex and tacit understanding.

297
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:35,790
- Nian Nian! Go thing you guys didn’t leave. I thought I overslept.
- How’s that possible?

298
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,910
I didn’t bother you guys, did I?

299
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,070
How could it be?

300
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,000
You guys enjoy yourselves for a bit. Come to the conference room for lunch around 11:30am.

301
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,630
What’s wrong?

302
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,300
Grunt suddenly got sick.

303
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,570
He can't compete, has to be substituted.

304
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,720
Getting sick today?

305
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,360
That's right. They are probably in total chaos now.

306
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,730
Ya Ya, what should we do?

307
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,690
I don’t know.

308
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,580
<i> [Asian Pacific Region Finals Competition. ] <i></i></i>

309
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,200

319

<i>Who says I can’t put it on?</i>

320
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,640
<i> I can put it on my bracelet, or buy another bracelet and hang it there. It's all good. <i></i></i>

342
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,900
<i> Seeing these young people in front of me. <i></i></i>

343
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,830
<i>It’s like that I saw myself ten years ago.</i>

344
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,360
<i> At that time, it seemed the entire world is under my feet. <i></i></i>

345
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,670
<i>In my dictionary, there is no “lose” this word.</i>

346
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,050
<i> You lived for CTF. <i></i></i>

347
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,880
<i> I am a loner by default. <i></i></i>

348
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,950
<i> Even though CTF is stage full of sound and light, <i></i></i>

349
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,630
<i> But seems only when I am here, <i></i></i>

350
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,180
<i> that I can get myself to calm down. <i></i></i>

351
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,000
<i>I said it before. CTF this kind of thing,</i>

352
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,200
<i>Either don’t touch it,</i>

353
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,200
<i>or you must win. It’s that easy.</i>

354
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,350
<i> Yet I gave it up earlier. <i></i></i>

355
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:54,530
<i> Because I was afraid of the unknown future,  of losing, of betrayal. <i></i></i>

356
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,030
<i> Only then I know that, <i></i></i>

357
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,840
<i> I am actually not powerful at all. <i></i></i>

358
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,580
<i> I hid inside my own shell, <i></i></i>

359
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,990
<i> crying all along. <i></i></i>

360
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,490
<i> What is the correct way then? <i></i></i>

361
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,570
<i> If I fail, need to hand over my dream to others, <i></i></i>

362

364
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,300
<i>Thèse bunch of kids has dreams.</i>

365
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,330
<i> Also what is so precious is that they are...<i></i></i>

366
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,720
<i> Maybe only after meeting those weaker, <i></i></i>

367
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,500
<i> then we can become stronger. <i></i></i>

368
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,770

00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,240
Quickly. Quickly.

501
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,900
You called me over here just to make me take off my clothes?

502
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,160
There's no one here, hurry up.

503
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,280
No, no, no! You tell me clearly first. What am I taking my clothes off for?

504
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,900
Later on I need to go to Tong Nian's house. Take your clothes and lend them to me for a few hours.

505
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,400
Your Mother-in-law prepared a celebratory feast for you? Okay.

506
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,520
You should wear something formal to go. Do you want a suit?

507
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,620
It's such a hot day and you brought a suit?

508
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,890
It's because I was worried that there would be a press conference.

509
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:48,400
You don't need it. You don't need to handle these matters.

510
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,830
Hurry up.

511
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,300
Wait.

512
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,180
I cannot take everything off like this and go out! You take your clothes and give them to me!

513
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,340
I'll do it myself.

514
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,030
Hurry.

515
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,880
Hurry up and take it off! I'll help you.

516
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:19,150
- Jia Hao, they are inside, right? Let us in.
- You can't go in.

517
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,990
Why?

518
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,280
Boss is not letting one inside.

519
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,690
What is he doing inside?

520
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,320
I don't know.

521
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,720
- They won't let us in.
- They won't let us in?

522
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,870
Be careful!

523
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,150
Excuse me. Excuse me.

524
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,070
What are you two doing?

525
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,470
If we are brothers, then let's go together.

526
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,170
- We'll be done soon.
- What are you guys... doing in there?

527
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,630
Are you guys playing a game?

528
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,740
- A game?
- What is happening here?

529
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,290
I... I don't know! I don't know.

530
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,640
Boss! Why did you swap clothing with Solo for no reason?

531
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,360
Who are you trying to con this time?

532
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,910
Move aside.

533
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,080
Let's go.

534
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,500
I will talk to you on the phone.

535
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,370
My God! Lan Mei what happened to your husband? Why is he crying like this?

536
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,540
He is too excited. Old boy but young at heart.

537
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,300
That's why I am abusing my rights for private interest. I specially brought him to see his idol.

538
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,580
Gun God, congratulations.

539
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,630
You finally got this champion.

540
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,080
Don't cry. If every time I get first place you need to cry, then you'll never stop crying.

541
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,620
Okay.

542
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,150
Do you have something later? If you're free, go to K&K and join the celebratory feast.

543
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,270
Really?

544
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,800
Of course. We'll meet later.

545
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,770
See you later, see you later!

546
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,860
Later on, can I really go? Later on, can I really go?

547
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,430
Of course you can go! Look, this is Sister-in-law's sister.

548
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,500
You are Sister-in-law's brother-in-law. No matter how you say it, you guys are still relatives! Let's go together!

549
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,400
- Go, go, go!
- Come, let's tidy up and go back to K&K!

550
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,610
W-w-w-wait! Wait a minute!

551
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:29,700
Isn't that a female star? She was in a spy movie, I especially liked it!

552
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,230
- That's right! That's right! It's her!
- Thank you.

553
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,470
Can we take a photo with you?

554
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,890
-Of course.
-Camera!

555
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:40,140
Okay, okay. She isn't here to look for you guys.

556
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,190
97.

557
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,300
97?

558
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,070
Hello.

559
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,010
Come and give your signature to your fan.

560
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,450
M-my fan?

561
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,500
- Of course.
- I am your fan.

562
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,920
Can you give me your signature?

563
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,100
I c-c-can! I can!

564
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,480
Director Xiang, this string is really great.

565
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,470
It's a rare opportunity that I am pulling strings. Let me have some pride.

566
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,120
You guys are Asia's champions. Of course a lot of people like you guys.

567
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,500
Nice, 97!

568
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,860
Then...then... can I also have your signature?

569
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,160
Of course you can.

570
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,010
Please sign one for me.

571
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,150
Grandma, it's Little Mi.

572
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,900
I want to tell you... that I got first place.

573
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,900
Me and Old Han got first place together.

574
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,740
We finally succeeded.

575
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,490
That's great, that's great! Grandma congratulates you!

576
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:41,830
Congratulations to you! All three of us - me, your mom, your grandma congratulate you together!

577
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,600
Yes, yes!

578
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,820
Yes. Grandma, thank you so much. It's just... yes. You've always...

579
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,200
You've always supported me, yes.

580
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,290
Grandma... I-I'll let you listen to

581
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,200
the voice of the girl I like, okay?

582
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,110
- A girl?
- Let me, let me, let me!

583
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,600
A girl? Yes, yes!

584
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,570
It's my grandma.

585
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,080
Me?

586
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,550
Hello.

587
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,710
Hello Grandma, I'm Sun Yaya.

588
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:19,000
Sun Yaya. Hello. Hello.

589
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,230
Hello.

590
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,290
Your voice is so nice to listen to!

591
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,490
- This voice is nice to listen to!
- It's nice to listen to, nice to listen to!

592
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,010
You won't say anything anyways! Let me!

593
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,880
Hello, are you Little Mi's girlfriend?

594
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,390
I...I don't know if I am.

595
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,150
What is it?

596
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,260
They asked if I was your girlfriend.

597
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,920
Just say that you are. Keep talking. Tell them!

598
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,180
Our Little Mi is fortunate to have you take care of him!

599
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,340
That's right, that's right!

600
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,720
No, no. It's what I should do!

601
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,900
When are you coming here?

602
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,340
They asked when are you going back?

603
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,620
Soon.

604
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,100
Very soon, he'll be back very soon.

605
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,160
Me and Little Mi's mom are waiting to see you!

606
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,690
Grandma, and his grandma too!

607
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,570
- Okay.
- That's right, that's right!
