Eat breakfast.

- No, no. Say that you went into the wrong classroom.
- Have you all checked in?

Why did you come here? Did you come to the wrong classroom?!

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,860
I came from far away attracted by the fame of Jiaodong University to visit it.

44
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,240
"Attracted by the fame"? Then you should go see the campus.

Why did you come right here? We just finished an exam here.

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,750
It's already been many years since I've last watched a movie.

58
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,490
Bro, the way you spend your time is really dull.

59
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,550
And just like that, you've snatched away one of our people!

60
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,320
Is it that she hasn't raised any objections?

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,220
Being friends with a person like you is too boring.

62
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,520
Objections? No, she hasn't.

63
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,000
She's obedient.

64
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,410
Little Tong Nian is too pitiful. Running in with this professor!

65
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,400
Say, do you think this handsome guy will have some sort of psychological trauma from this,

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,550
and break up or something?

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,380
"One would rather destroy ten temples than destroy a marriage", Professor!

68
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,630
Yeah, Professor! This kid Tong Nian, other than studying she is stupid in everything else!

69
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,460
Besides, this is her first time bringing a man here.

70
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,390
Say, if this falls through what will she do?

71
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,220
Won't she cry to death?

72
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,530
Alright. Alright. Don't worry.

73

I remember in our first class when I did a self-introduction, I told everyone that

80
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,660
I spent the first part of my life in books. I learned a lot of skills.

81
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,610
One in particular, was industrial design.

82
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,080

00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,830
When I was young, I was also forced to practice writing!

110
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,920
I just haven't written words in a while.

111

This is three times that you have tried to openly steal my girlfriend in front of me.

How much older are you than Tong Nian? Do you understand what Tong Nian likes?

153
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,130
I'm telling you. My grades are as good as Tong Nian.

154
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,960
Our hobbies are also the same.

I'm telling you. Loving a person is different from raising a pet.

157

Mark my words here today: unless Tong Nian tells me,

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,850
if she doesn't tell me herself that the person she likes is you,

159

What's wrong?

168
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,830
Do you know what his nickname is? His nickname is The Big Devil.

169
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,540
He flunks the most students.

170
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,920
He's actually quite interesting.

171
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,970
He taught English until he was forty something years old, and wanted to give himself a long vacation.

172
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,700
So he went for a Master's in industrial design.

173
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,510
Industrial design? But he is teaching us English literature.

174
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,960
Why did he have to go for industrial design?

175
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,060
Probably just as a pastime.

176
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,600
For some people, their pastime might be traveling, for some, it might be learning.

177
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,040
As for me, my pastime is playing on the computer.

178
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,080
If everything has to have a purpose, then that's too boring.

179
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,370
Oh, right.

180
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,020
What's the matter?

181
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,410
Let me ask you. Do you feel that I'm a person who especially doesn't know to date?

182
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,170
If you ask me this question,

183
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,830
I haven't dated anyone before and I don't have much experience, so I don't know either.

184
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,610
But I think that two people, both inexperienced and new, is quite fun too.

185
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,110
Anyways, let's learn together in the future.

186
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,630
I am always keeping a straight face, would I look like I am very mean and hard to approach?

187
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,280
Of course not because I know you're just pretending.

188
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,010
You have to bring around a bunch of young boys, of course you have to pretend a bit.

189
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,020
But I've found out now that they aren't even scared of you at all.

190
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,350
Then should I pretend to be even meaner in the future?

191
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,950
What are you laughing about?

192
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,060
The meaner you are, the cuter I find.

193
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,930
Why do I feel like you're raising me like a pet?

194
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,280
Then I'll spoil you.

195
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,930
What?

196
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,280
Nothing at all.

197
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,500
Why did you suddenly come to our school today? Is something wrong?

198
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,200
How can there be anything for me at your school?

199
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,520
Then you specially came to see me.

200
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:08,230
Mi Shaofei told me that an old man like me dating you put you at a loss.

201
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,950
That's why I was thinking what he said is right.

202
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,560
So I came over to accompany you.

203
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,890
After so many years have passed, I've forgotten the feeling of being a student.

204
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,230
If I were your senior, what do you wish I could do for you?

205
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,380
Follow me.

206
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,920
Do you see that little hotpot?

207
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,120
When we were in school, that hotpot was the most popular.

208
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,070
When I was in undergrad, I really hoped that I had a boyfriend to line up for me.

209
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,250
It's this simple?

210
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,460
This side.

211
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,630
Let me do it.

212
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,860
It's fine. Let's go together.

213
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,940
Go find a place to sit first.

214
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,840
Alright, I'll go find a seat first then.

Does it taste good?

230
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,670
So much better than the lunch boxes at the club.

231
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,870
What are you laughing at? Are you using me as a dish to help with digestion?

232
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,850
I am just happy. Such a rare opportunity that there is someone to line up for me.

233
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,920
Rare opportunity?

234
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,760
Not a rare opportunity, but first time.

235
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,430
First time that someone is lining up for me.

236
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,770
That person named Zheng Hui didn't do that for you?

237
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,840
He is not in the same year as I, so I don't see him often.

238
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,090
Eat more.

239
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,520
This time, our Global Team Tournament Finale is in Norway.

240
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,260
I will bring you along.

241
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,960
Go get a visa when you have time.

242
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,520
Alright.

Wipe your mouth.

245
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,680
You too, wipe your mouth. It's full of oil.

246
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,150
Why do you have tissue with you?

247
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,480
I am very hygienic.

248
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,870
Oh oh oh, eat more.

This time I will give them to you for free.

265

Did you win the lottery?

266
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,370
- So happy!
- Give me two.

267
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,380
Life savior. I have to face the computer every day, my skin is getting so dry!

268
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,650
I don't care, I am taking this. You guys can split the rest.

269
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,430
Split it!

270
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,830
- All are mine!
- Time for food! Extra food today!

271
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,650
What day is today? There are face masks and there are food.

272
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,150
- What's going on?
- Come. Come take a look.

273
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,970

- Where's Boss?
- He's in his room.

275
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,120
Is he not eating with us? There's so much food.

276
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,310
- I'll go get him.
- No no no.

277
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,240
- Keeping his wife company.
- Keeping his wife company.

278
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,910
He doesn't need to eat if he keeps his wife company?

279
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,220
Time to eat.

280
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,230
I'm not eating.

281
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,420
Little Mi, stop bothering me.

282
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,850
Oh right. I asked you to order extra food for those kids, did you?

283
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,880
I've added it.

284
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,420
Did you lose your voice?

285
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,680
Who told you to not eat? And you even said I am Little Mi.

286
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,220
Hold it yourself.

287
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,120
That's right, you have to eat well, understood?

288
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,120
- Is it good?
- Yummy.

289
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,520
<i>His mind is still full if competition. Did not change at all.</i>

290
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,340
<i>And I have become part of his life now.</i>

291
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,330
This one is good.

292
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,460
I'll do it myself.

293
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,630
No, I want to feed you.

294
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,790
Can you let me swallow it first before feeding me?

295
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,890
Keep fighting!

296
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,770
What?

297
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,230
It's the 5th soon. The finals!

298
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,740
You won't understand how I feel.

299
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,410
I am too nervous right now.

300
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,920
How do I not understand? I am nervous too.

301
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,690
This is the most important competition after he became a manager.

302
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,990
It's because of Brother Little Mi that's why you are nervous, right?

You're so awsome!

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,200
Didn't I tell you to come earlier?

307
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,340
Tomorrow I am riding the plane to Beijing.

308
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,620
It's because I wanted to get the discounted plane ticket.

309
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,610
When did you start saving?

310
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,920
Every penny that I save right now is for you to use as bridewealth.

311
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,000
No need.

312
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,080
Whether you need it or not is your business.

313
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,560
Saving money for you is what I want to do.

314
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,590
Hold this.

315
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,710
Son, what you're doing right now,

316
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,590
I think really makes me proud.

317
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:47,880
Tell me. In this field, will you cultivate batches of champions for the country in the future?

318
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,560
Then you would really be the cornerstone and forerunner in this field.

319
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,710
You are too great!

320
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,520
Talk about serious topic.

321
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,540
This is a serious topic.

322
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,540
Is it that you want to talk to me about my future in-laws?

323
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,990
They might not like me very much.

324
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,460
Why?

325
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,980
My son is so outstanding, so capable,

326
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,230
why would they not like you?

327
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,610
Now is a bit better, but their impression of me is not that great.

328
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,780
How about Daughter-in-Law?

329
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,410
Isn't she almost graduate? What career does she do?

330
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,230
This... I'm not so sure about this too.

331
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,410
Not sure?

332
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:56,180
Big Brother, may I ask if she is your girlfriend?

333
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,430
We both experienced something in the past that made us worried a bit.

334
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,080
I won't tell you about it in details.

335
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,420
In short, we know each other for less than 200 days, and there aren't many days that we were actually together.

336
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,200
Then are you sure... she is the one?

337
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,220
Do you know how to be devoted to someone?

338
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:29,050
Son, if you really love someone,

339
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,560
you must devote everything for her.

340
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,540
It's love only if you are devoted to her.

342
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,660
Hello?

343
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,460
<i>After you graduate, what are you going to do?</i>

344
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,200
I was going to work, but my mentor wouldn't let go and wants me to do a Ph. D.

345
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,020
And I was thinking I am young anyway, so I will stay and help my mentor.

346
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,350
But next year, I will officially be studying for a Ph. D. Why?

347
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,000
I understand.

348
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,330
My step-mom came back.

349
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,830
Your step-mom is here?

350
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,200
When did this happen? Why didn't you tell me?

351
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,890
<i>She suddenly came back to the country. Don't be nervous.</i>

352
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,460
Then should I meet your step-mom?

353
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,380
You guys can meet. We are going to your house tonight.

354
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,690
Tonight?

355
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,220
That's right. It's okay if you are busy. I can take care of it.

356
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,400
That's not it. Let me just think and understand things a little.

357
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,910
So you're saying that your step-mom is back in the country.

358
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,570
And that tonight you are coming over to my house to see my parents, is that what it means?

359
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,660
She said she wanted to formally visit your parents.

360
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,420
Formally visit?

361
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,160
But I still have a class tonight.

362
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,320
It's fine, it's fine. I...

363
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,200
I... Let me just arrange things a bit. I will be able to make it in time tonight.

364
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,460
That's it for now.

365
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,900
She said she was going to work, but her mentor wouldn't let go.

366
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,350
She is staying in the lab this year, and will continue as a PhD student next year.

367
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,030
No wonder her parents think you're not worthy.

368
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:29,690
You are dragging down their IQ genes.

369
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,570
This is my first time seeing her parents.

370
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,230
Should I go buy some gifts and get prepared?

371
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,510
Wait for me, I'll go buy some.

372
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,410
We don't have time to prepare. I booked at 6.

373
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:46,780
6? That's so rushed.

374
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,470
The man's side must not be late.

375
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,400
We have to get there at least 30 minutes in advance.

376
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,890
You are not telling me that you are going to wear this to see her parents, right?

377
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,010
First time seeing them must dress formally.

378
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,230
Hurry, go change it.

379
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,050
I'll wait for you at the door.

380
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,220
<i>[Le Méridien]</i>

381
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,590
What is this?

382
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,370
It's already really formal.

383
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,980
- They're here.
- Hello.

384
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,940
Hello, hello.

385
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,700
Hello Auntie and Uncle. Let me introduce to you, this is my mom.

386
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,920
Hello.

387
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,980
Your mom is so young.

388
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,210
Not at all, not at all.

389
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,360
This time, I came back last minute and meeting you so suddenly, I am sorry for that. Please forgive us.

390
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,760
It's okay, it's okay. We also heard that it's a rare opportunity for you to come back.

391
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,730
We didn't really prepare anything.

392
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,090
I prepared something small for you, as long as you don't dislike it.

393
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,100
- Of course not.
- It's all some snacks from Shanghai. I am sorry.

394
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,250
You are too thoughtful. These are all things that I like to eat.

395
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,610
Every time, when I have a friend coming back, I always ask them to bring these back.

396
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,820
That's great.

397
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,850
Let's not stand here, let's go inside.

398
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,560
This way.

399
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,620
This is some wine that I prepared for Tong Nian's dad.

400
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,210
- I don't know if you like it or not.
- Thank you.

401
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,060
Also a set of makeup for you.

402
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,770
Sorry to make you spend. Thank you.

403
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,230
It should be.

404
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,920
- Here, come, come.
- Yes.
- Yes.

405
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,550
Tong Nian's dad, sit here.

406
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,440
- Tong Nian's mom, is this seat okay?
- Sure.

407
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,840
- You should have a seat too.
- Okay. Please.

408
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,530
Sit down.

409
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,740
Besides us, are there other guests today?

410
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,040
I thought Tong Nian would also come.

411
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,160
I don't think she will be joining us.

412
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,430
Let's drink some tea first.

413
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,200
Pour some tea for Uncle and Auntie.

414
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,070
Uncle.

415
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,700
Thank you.

416
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,800
Why is it so blocked?

417
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,390
Right now is when everyone gets off from work.

418
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,890
Little girl, the time you chose is not good.

419
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,960
Mister, could you drive a little faster?

420
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,560
My boyfriend brought his mother to see my parents. I must be there.

421
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,410
He's meeting your parents but he doesn't bring you along.

422
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,690
This boyfriend of yours is so unreliable.

423
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,030
I don't know why he didn't tell me about it earlier.

424
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,660
At any rate, my parents don't like him much.

425
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,040
So I must be there to control the situation.

426
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,860
He's being picked on? No fear.

427
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,330
If a grown man can't handle his future in-laws, he might as well quit.

428
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,150
I remember in my time, my wife's parents didn't like me either.

429
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,860
At the time, I'd go there every day and insist on doing chores for them.

430
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,170
What happens then?

431
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,880
I'd buy groceries, cook dinner, unclog the drain, wipe the walls.

432
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,040
Whatever chores you can think of, I did it all.

433
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,700
In the end, my wife couldn't leave me. She didn't do chores either.

434
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,060
My in-laws' hearts softened and agreed.

435
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,170
This is called hard work makes the world go round.

436
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,150
It can achieve wealth and get you a wife.

437
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:25,070
Some young men these days say they can't get a wife, that means they're lazy!

438
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,560
If they took on all the house chores, they wouldn't have any trouble finding a wife!

439
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,630
My boyfriend is very good to me.

440
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,330
He doesn't let me do anything. He won't even let me wash the cups.

441
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:39,680
Is that so? Then you'd better keep an eye on him. Was he born after 1990?

442
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,580
After 1980.

443
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,950
Doesn't matter if it's after '80 or '90.

444
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,000
Men like that are rare these days.

445
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,780
Once the road clears up, I'll find a short cut for you and see if we can get there sooner.

446
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,240
Thank you, Master.

447
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,900
This child at 19 years old went to Shanghai all by himself.

448
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,420
When I think about it, working hard on his own hasn't been easy.

449
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,690
That time, I did not give him any money.

450
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,570
I wanted to block him from going to Shanghai.

451
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,270
Being used to the comforts of home,

452
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,930
surely he wouldn't be able to last long without any money and come home.

453
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,790
Who would have thought that after a year,

454
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,900
he really didn't come home and I got really worried.

455
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,100
I was so afraid that I wouldn't be able to face his dead father.

456
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,040
So I bought a ticket and rushed to Shanghai.

457
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,370
I wanted to see exactly what he was doing.

458
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:40,650
Some things you don't know until you see it with your own eyes.

459
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:44,210
Just like looking at a person.

460
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,340
In the future, once you are more familiar with our Shangyan,

461
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,450
you'll know that this child is really quite good.

462
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,470
Even though I'm not his real mother,

463
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,910
this whole lifetime,

464
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,410
I only will recognize this one son.

465
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,210
<i>Han Shangyan.</i>

466
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,370
<i>Han Shangyan, come out.</i>

467
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,800
<i>I know you're inside.</i>

468
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,310
<i>I saw you!</i>

469
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,050
<i>Han Shangyan, come down.</i>

470
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,940
<i>I'm telling you, no matter what, I'm bringing you home today!</i>

471
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:44,150
<i>Han Shangyan, is this how you thank me for all these years of caring for you?</i>

472
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,820
<i>I've been taking you since I was twenty.</i>

473
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,530
<i>Raised you till now!</i>

474
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:58,310
<i>With what right? What right?</i>

475
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,790
<i>What right do you have to bully me this way?</i>

476
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,960
<i>Why are you bullying me this way?</i>

477
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,280
<i>Your father left that money for you to use in the future.</i>

478
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,260
<i>Now you're doing this!</i>

479
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,240
<i>How can I face your father?</i>

480
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,590
<i>What is the difference between using it now and in the future?</i>

481
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,600
<i>I switched my nationality and came back so that I can get the championship for China.</i>

482
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,280
<i>If I go back with you now, I would be giving up before I'm done trying.</i>

483
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,810
<i>What championship?</i>

484
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,400
<i>Are you preparing to play this forever?</i>

485
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,890
<i>I'm not playing!</i>

486
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,530
<i>This is a sport that takes skill and intellect.</i>

487
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,640
<i>Though China has just begun,</i>

488
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,850
<i>I believe that one day we will stand at the top of the world.</i>

489
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,240
<i>You— How can you compare to those people?</i>

490
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,330
<i>Why can't I compare? Internationally, we're known as China too.</i>

491
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,920
<i>Oh this mother and son - why are you arguing on the street?</i>

492
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,340
<i>Wang Hao's mom, I really can't take this child anymore!</i>

493
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,370
<i>Han Shangyan, talk less!</i>

494
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,310
<i>Let's go inside, let's not give our neighbors something to laugh at.</i>

495
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,220
<i>I'm not going inside.</i>

496
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,580
<i>Let's go in and I'll show you a video and let you see what it looks like when they win!</i>

497
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,730
<i>Oh it's too cool!</i>

498
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,150
<i>I don't want to look at him!</i>

499
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:25,120
<i>Once you see it, if you still don't like it,</i>

500
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,470
<i>I'll help you chase Han Shangyan back to Norway!</i>

501
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,170
<i>Let's go.</i>

502
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:40,750
After I came back, I slowly understand the birth of a championship is really not easy at all.

503
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,730
These children are gritting their teeth and training.

504
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,450
And they swallow all their difficulties.

505
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,510
They've gone through this since they were younger.

506
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,580
Some people still don't really understand them.

507
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:01,500
And Han Shangyan has never mentioned any of that bitterness.

508
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,710
And suffered all that by himself.

509
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,650
Of course these children have their flaws.

510
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,490
But I think our child, Han Shangyan, is really a good kid.

511
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,000
I remember at the time,

512
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,870
he alone in two and a half years, took up the daily expenses of the whole team.

513
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,760
And now with this club, he is also putting in his all.

514
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,960
He has never made earning money his goal.

515
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,400
Even if he suffers a loss, he still keeps the club going.

516
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,210
He's told me once that before, it was only for his own dream.

517
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,440
But now he is doing it for the sake of dreams of even more people.

518
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,000
From the standpoint of a mother,

519
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,410
I feel that this son of mine is pretty great.

520
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,480
Look at me rattling on by myself, how embarrassing.

521
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,210
Maybe I've exaggerated a little bit. I feel like I'm selling something.

522
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,290
Oh no, no. We're all here together to talk about family after all.

523
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,460
Yes.

524
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,110
As Nian Nian's parents, we can especially understand how you feel.

525
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,670
Any time one talks about their own children, it is with this type of view.

526
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,310
We're all the same, and all say our children are the best.

527
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,390
That's true, that's true.
<i>[Tong Nian]</i>

528
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:27,650
This time, I came back because I wanted to represent my son.

529
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,820
To sincerely ask you, if you don't object,

530
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,350
would it be possible to let them get engaged as soon as possible?

531
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,980
Get engaged?

532
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,940
I even brought the betrothal gift!

533
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,060
This... let's not talk about this.

534
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,080
I feel like we don't need to talk about this at all.

535
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,370
You should know a little about our family.

536
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:59,450
We don't really care about things such as engagements.

537
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:04,810
But her father and I feel that they haven't been together for very long.

538
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:11,160
- And now suddenly you say you'd like to get engaged, it really is kind of too fast.
- Yes.

539
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,880
To be honest, this is too early. I think it is too fast, too.

540
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,990
It is a little soon.

541
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:23,330
I rushed here from Norway for this to have a talk with you face-to-face.

542
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,060
I wanted to show you our sincerity.

543
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,640
I understand.

544
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,720
How about we let them talk about this and see how things progress.

545
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,400
Also right now, engagements aren't really the trend anymore, don't you think?

546
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,950
I think that too.

547
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,220
Why don't we just get straight to a wedding?

548
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,660
<i>Don't change the order.</i>

549
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,570
<i>You've been beating around the bush all day instead of getting to the point.</i>

550
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,090
<i>These are battle tactics, don't you get it?</i>

551
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:03,440
<i>A quick battle is the winning path to the throne, don't you know?</i>

552
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,120
Our Shangyan's feelings run too deep,

553
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,540
he has no filter.

554
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,520
Please forgive him.

555
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,290
Here, let's eat while we talk.

556
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,300
Eat while we talk.

557
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,900
Little Han, I remember this restaurant has a few small desserts.

558
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,390
Nian Nian especially likes them, I'd like to pick a few to go.

559
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,500
- Ah, alright, let me call the server for you.
- Server!

560
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,750
No need, no need. You don't know what she likes.

561
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,720
I'd like to go myself. Why don't you go with me?

562
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,130
Go accompany Auntie.

563
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,600
Nian Nian's dad, here here, see how this fish tastes.

564
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,790
Little Han, come here, I have something to say.

565
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:09,970
What are you doing? You think if you bring out your stepmother, uncle and I will agree to you and Nian Nian?

566
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:14,890
Not at all. I brought my stepmother because I hoped to officially

567
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,660
solemnly have a relationship with Nian Nian, with no childish games at all.

568
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,150
You bring up getting married to Nian Nian so suddenly.

569
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,770
Why do I feel a little bit like you're trying to force something that isn't going to work?

570
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,800
Of course not.

571
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,740
It's because... I noticed that I love Nian Nian more and more.

572
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:36,390
I wish that I can see her every day. And I wish these days can continue forever.

573
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,780
That's why I brought it up.

574
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,240
Then how about Nian Nian? Not right...

575
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,130
The of you can't be...

576
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,550
I'm going to say it directly now. Nian Nian's not pregnant, is she?

577
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,800
Is that why the two of you are rushing to get married?

578
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,020
O-o-of course not, of course not Auntie! I promised you before.

579
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,980
Before we are married, I absolutely draw the line at a respectable place.

580
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,500
Then how about Nian Nian? She really likes you too?

581
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,770
Why did I ask you that? I can she Nian Nian really likes you.

582
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,920
I believe that we really love each other.

583
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,830
Just like you and Uncle.

584
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,890
You just don't see that Uncle and I argue quite often.

585
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,640
But you both protect this family and love each other.

586
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,590
And cherish Nian Nian's heart, I can see that.

587
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,540
And that's what I've been working hard to do.

588
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,450
Auntie, please believe me and give me a chance.

589
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:44,520
If Nian Nian does not agree, I will for sure not force her.

590
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,980
And I will leave automatically. Okay?

591
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,060
I'm telling you. This is Nian Nian's first time in love.

592
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:02,510
So I hope that you will love and cherish her, alright?

593
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,920
No, you must guarantee it to me right now.

594
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,270
Please don't worry.

595
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,590
I will for sure do it.

596
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,650
Thank you guys.

597
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,950
You're too polite, you are perfectly welcome!

598
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,680
Auntie, what I told you today, I wish you can help me keep it a secret.

599
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,260
I want to give Nian Nian a surprise.

600
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,530
Okay.

601
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,890
- We're leaving.
- Okay, bye.

602
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,950
Bye. Take care.

603
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,140
By the way, Uncle and Auntie, I will be bringing the team to the final competition.

604
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,110
And so I also want to bring Tong Nian to Beijing.

605
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,740
But please don't worry. Even though it's in the same hotel, I will book two rooms.

606
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,080
I just wanted to get your opinion.

607
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,420
Nian Nian has already completed her postgraduate studies, she's a grown-up now.

608
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,000
Little Han, how about this?

609
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,670
Why don't you just date Nian Nian like normal?

610
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:15,830
You don't have to report things like this to us.

611
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,960
Thank you for Uncle and Auntie's understanding.

612
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,070
- All right, we're off.
- Please take your time on the road.

613
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,110
- Bye.
- Bye.

614
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,200
Thank you for today.

615
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,140
If you want to thank me, come with me to a place.

616
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,420
You don't even have any friends in the country.

617
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,280
Who says I don't?

618
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,380
Since the sky is not dark yet, let's hurry and go.
