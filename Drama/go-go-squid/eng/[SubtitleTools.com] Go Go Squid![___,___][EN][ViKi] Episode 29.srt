93
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,570

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,840
Thank you.

103
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Something urgent? Is it Solo or Han Shangyan?

104
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,760
Don't be nervous. It has nothing to do with those two.

105
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,930
We are not that close to each other. We haven't talked much.

106
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,010
The situation wasn't that good either.

107
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,620
The last time we spoke in private was when your team was about to disband,

108
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,060
and you came to find me because of Solo.

109
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,930
You wanted to ask me to go persuade Solo not to disband.

110
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,780
I remember.

111
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,530
But that time I was in a mess, so how could I have persuaded him?

112
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,400
Okay, let's not mention the past.

113
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,540
I came for a business matter.

114
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,090
My flight is at 4:00 p.m., so I can't stay too long.

115
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,300
Han Shangyan had a big disagreement with me before, when he wanted to bring you on board.

116
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,820
He even wanted to establish a secondary team for you without considering K&K's capability.

117
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,780
I know of that, but you probably didn't come for that.

118
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,730
I already retired. I will never make another comeback.

119
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,930
They are my good brothers, not my money tree or protection.

120
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,550
Therefore, you don't need to worry, I will definitely not ruin my own brother.

121
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,090
It's about you, but not to bring you on the team.

122
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,610
I am getting transferred back to headquarters. Right now, K&K is missing a manager.

123
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,580
Are you interested?

124
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,940
You want me to be the manager?

125
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,790
But I just retired from SP.

126
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,370
That is quite normal. You wouldn't think it's betraying SP, would you?

127
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,400
You've already retired.

128
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,580
Wait a second. You are really confusing me.

129
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,870
I think something is amiss in what you just said.

130
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,500
But I can't figure out where at the moment.

131
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,710
K&K was established by Han Shangyan and my husband,

132
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,870
and Han Shangyan and myself worked hard to establish the Chinese region.

133
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,900
To me, K&K is like my child.

134
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,640
I want to find a suitable person to take my place and work together with Han Shangyan.

135
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,930
Of course, he is still the boss. I am only responsible for headhunting.

136
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,820
- I know. This is Han Shangyan's idea again, isn't it?
- Of course not.

137
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,940
You and I don't have any king of friendship, Mi Shaofei.

138
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,500
In my eyes, you are also not an old friend. Just a suitable candidate.

139
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,270
But right now, I really don't have that ability anymore.

140
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,800
The year that you won the national championship, I had already retired.

141
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,410
Before I retired, my best achievement was first place in Chengdu.

142
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,370
In terms of achievements, you are miles ahead of me. You have the necessary skills.

143
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,640
Besides, I am looking for a team manager, not a player.

144
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,440
A lot of people don't even know what CTF is.

145
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,290
But you know.

146
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,720
You know the pressures that players feel from their families,

147
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,620
as well as the difficulties they must overcome when they compete.

148
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,980
You've put your best years into CTF.

149
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,500
Don't you hope for the future players to become even better?

150
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,340
I can't win this argument against you.

151
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,560
You know how to deal with Han Shangyan's bad temper.

152
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,600
That is the most important thing.

153
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,070
Sometimes, even I want to take a blackboard eraser and knock him out.

154
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,580
He is actually very simple. You only need to go with his flow, that's it.

155
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,840
Is it really that simple?

156
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,200
It really is that simple! That year, it was because of our construction

157
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,930
that we changed him from a rebellious kid into a master of housework.

158
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,090
The easiest people to deal with in the world are people who value relationships.

159
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,340
Aren't you the same?

160
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,620
You are a very interesting person on the competition stage.

161
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,200
It's a pity that I've only met you now.

162
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,840
I have to go now.

163
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,800
I hope you can give us a chance, and come and help us.

164
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,920
Have a safe trip.

165
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,630
Are you still hesitating?

166
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,700
It would be more strange if I agreed to it right away. We are all adults.

167
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,820
We are not adults.

168

170
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,770
<i>A lot of people don't even know what CTF is.</i>

171
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,620
<i>But you know.</i>

172
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,000
<i>You know the pressures that players feel from their families.</i>

173
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,950
<i>As well as the difficulties they must overcome when they compete.</i>

174
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,320
<i> You've spent your best years at CTF.</i>

175
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,860
<i>Don't you hope for the future players to become even better?</i>

176
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,150
Hello, Dad?

177
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,730
<i>You still remember this dad of yours?</i>

178
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,920
I'm telling you!  Don't think that just because your mom agreed that you can continue to muddle on in Shanghai.

179
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,500
Hurry up and scram back here.

180
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,220
Didn't I tell Mom to give me half a year of time?

181
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,600
<i>Half a year? Hurry up and get back here to intern at the sub-district office.</i>

182
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,250
I worked so hard to get you a spot in there!

183
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,680
Just do it first.

184
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,000
Next year, you can take your civil service exam. If you pass, you can turn full-time, you know?

185
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,850
<i>Okay, okay! Give it to me!</i>

186
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,550
<i>Here.</i>

187
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,600
<i>Little Fei! Do you have enough money?</i>

188
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,710
<i>Shanghai's rent must be expensive. Don't blame your dad.</i>

189
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,370
Your mom's old sickness has come back is these past few days.

190
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,010
She can't even straighten her back, so she can't take care of the store.

191
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,300
Your dad is busy with things inside and outside, <i>and still has to look for a job for you.</i>

192
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,710
<i>It's not easy.</i>

193
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:42,520
<i>Although your dad's mouth is criticizing you, he holds you in his heart.</i>

194
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,750
<i>You are his only son, so he is worried.</i>

195
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,750
I know.

196
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,500
<i>It's not easy for you to go over there. If you want to stay for half a year, then stay for half a year!</i>

197
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,600
<i>Play more!</i>

198
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,850
<i>Once you come home, who knows how long you'll have to wait before you can go back!</i>

199
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,980
Everyone likes the places they lived in when they were young.

200
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,070
Look at your dad!

201
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,870
He still always wants to go to the countryside to take a look.

202
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,690
Grandma, I still have some business to attend to. After I'm done with it, I'll go back to take care of you. Okay?

203
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,410
<i>Take care of me?</i>

204
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,950
My health is even better than yours.

205
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,300
I know. I know.

206
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,320
I miss you.

207
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,780
I miss you, too.

208
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,270
<i>I really, really want to win the championship.</i>

209
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,700
<i>I really, really want to win the championship.</i>

210
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,270
<i>Who doesn't understand you? Do you understand me?</i>

211
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,320
<i>Don't hang up on me! Get back here and speak clearly with me.</i>

212
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,500
<i>Han Shangyan, don't go. Please.</i>

213
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,720
<i>Team Solo really can't lose you.</i>

214
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,220
<i>Please. If you leave, we will need to... we will have to disband!</i>

215
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,340
<i>You are not young anymore.</i>

216
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,640
<i> From now on, do some reliable things. </i>

217
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,010
<i>Don't worry, Grandma. This time I will definitely win the championship and come back.</i>

218
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,500
<i>Okay. I will wait for you!</i>

219
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:27,750
<i>Today... is my lifetime's last professional competition.</i>

220
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:34,860
<i> My life, these years, has been filled with ups and downs,</i>

221
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:43,020
<i>I always believed that as long as I worked hard and put in more effort, I will get a good result.</i>

222
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,460
<i>But in reality, it isn't like that.</i>

223
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,260
<i>My rhythm and strength can't keep up with these young people. I can't help it.</i>

224
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,930
<i>I've tried my best.</i>

225
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,740
♫ <i>Perhaps very tiresome, in an entirely pathetic state</i> ♫

226
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,990
♫ <i>Perhaps lowly with nothing to show for my life</i> ♫

227
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,900
<i> Give me a perfect curtain call, okay? </i>

228
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,130
<i>Regret it. I regret it!</i>

229
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,400
<i>But what can I do?</i>

230
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,500
<i>If I hadn't retired back then, my current results would have definitely been better than they were before.</i>

231
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,550
<i>But what can I do? What now?</i>

232
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,460
<i>Now... N–</i>

233
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,140
<i>That's enough.</i>

234
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,540
<i>Han Shangyan, why?!</i>

235
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,430
♫ <i>Pretending to be the shackle of freedom</i> ♫

236
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:45,060
♫ <i>What did you become at the end?</i> ♫

237
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,880
♫ <i>The smoke and fire that ignited glamour</i> ♫

238
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:55,420
♫ <i>One burst forth is enough, what else to seek?</i> ♫

239
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,390
97.

240
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,220
Boss.

241
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,020
Tell me how you feel about our semifinals opponent.

242
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,690
You mean Team Buff?

243
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,320
Yes.

244
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,200
I know Su Cheng just left, so all of you are feeling a bit nervous.

245
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,290
A veteran team; unfathomable.

246
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,520
You feel pressure?

247
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,540
Of course. Buff was your opponent back then, Boss.

248
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,680
Losing confidence?

249
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,950
You can't say it like that.

250
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,480
That year I could win.

251
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,070
Today, you guys can also win.

252
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,690
Do your best.

253
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,010
I'll do my best, Boss!

254
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,800
This...

255
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,660
Of these four teams, not a single one is a weakling.

256
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,060
I don't even need to tell you about K&K and SP, right?

257
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,920
No need. Talk about the remaining two.

258
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,000
The remaining two. One is Team Buff, one is CL Team.

259
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,440
The first one is K&K's semifinals opponent.

260
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,180
The last one is SP's.

261
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,050
Then, first, talk about Team Buff.

262
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,400
How do I say it? In the circle, there is a saying.

263
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,290
They say, "Solo created the industry, Buff dominated it."

264
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,740
Why do they say that?

265
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,460
Because Solo's team started it all, they set the lay of the field.

266
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,800
Besides, before Team Solo disbanded, Team Buff was always their strongest opponent.

267
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,390
They were complementary to each other, and they would always win or lose to each other.

268
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:52,370
At the national competition where Han Shangyan retired, first place was Team Solo and second place was Team Buff.

269
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,890
Besides, Buff has even beat Han Shangyan before.

270
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,780
Really?

271
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,700
<i>That was a sensational legendary competition in the CTF circle.
[Trigger Pulled Battle SMELT]</i>

272
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,250
<i>Team Solo defeated in one sweep a bunch of top teams in the country.</i>

273
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,680
<i>With Team Buff, that was lording over the country, they battled for the title of champion.</i>

274
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,300
<i>At the start, Team Buff didn't think highly of them.</i>

275
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,300
<i>But once Team Solo got through to the finals, defeating all opponents,</i>

276
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,420
<i>everyone was interested. They thought Buff's dominion was over,</i>

277
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,400
<i>that Gun God, Han Shangyan, would certainly slaughter them.</i>

278
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,540
<i>Against expectations, on the day of the final round, Gun God played below his standards</i>

279
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,130
<i>and lost that most important game. Everyone was dumbfounded.</i>

280
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,300
<i> They actually said that God Gun wasn't that great. </i>

281
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,090
<i> Won! We won! </i>

282
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,320
<i>In the end, we won!</i>

283
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,300
<i>Buff! Buff! Buff!</i>

284
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,990
<i> - Congratulations on winning the championship.
- Thank you! To our surprise, </i>

285
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,400
<i>this time we defeated Gun God, Han Shangyan!</i>

286
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,790
<i>Gun God! I'm too excited!</i>

287
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,700
<i> What goals and plans do you guys have for the future? </i>

288
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,750
<i> Not only this one time, but in the 10 years to come, </i>

289
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,670
<i> we will get the championship as well!  Right?! </i>

290
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,630
<i>Yes!</i>

291
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:08,700
<i>Champions! Champions! Champions!</i>

292
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,260
But Han Shangyan is still the best.

293
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,510
Their rate in matches is currently 8 to 2.

294
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,860
8 to 2.

295
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,800
Only after Han  Shangyan retired and Team Solo disbanded, did Buff have the opportunity

296
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,580
to completely dominate the arena.

297
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,200
Have they gotten the international championship before?

298
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,500
No. Right now, the Chinese teams haven't entered the top three in the international rankings yet.

299
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,370
However, Buff's individual ranking has forced its way into the top three before.

300
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,140
That great?

301
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,680
If Han Shangyan hadn't retired,

302
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,800
Team Solo would have definitely gotten it.

303
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,920
That's for sure.

304
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,590
But this time the pressure on K&K is really big.

305
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,870
For the finals of the Asian division, there are only two spots.

306
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,760
If they lose to Buff, they'll be out.

307
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,300
In addition, if they actually lose to Team Buff,

308
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,650
Han Shangyan will certainly take it badly.

309
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,330
They won't. Han Shangyan won't lose.

310
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,420
You have this much confidence?

311
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,380
Of course. Who do you think Han Shangyan is?

312
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,700
- Within CTF, he's number one.
- Number one!

313
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,460
Number One! My Prince Charming!

314
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,240
I'm still a little worried.

315
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,800
Don't worry! You and I together, we'll cheer them on.

316
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,940
Cheer them on!

317
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,600
Let's keep watching.

318
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,910
Little Han, do you want me to order takeout for you?

319
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,250
No thanks. I'm going out to eat later.

320
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,210
- Then, don't forget to eat.
- Okay.

321
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,420
Auntie, this is next month's menu. It's confirmed.

322
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,620
After Little Su left, you even have to worry about these?

323
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,810
Yeah.

324
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,590
Oh, also... Their blankets, bedsheets and pillow covers all need to be changed.

325
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,290
Okay.

326
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,440
When she was here, I didn't realize. This is the work that kindergarten teachers do.

327
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,980
These menus are all confirmed?

328
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,770
Didn't you recommend them? It's settled.

329
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,170
Say it.

330
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,120
<i>Shangyan, someone is looking for you at the front desk.</i>

331
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,560
- Shangyan.
- Who is looking for me?

332
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,450
Your friend.

333
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,790
One never goes to the temple for no reason.

334
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,400
Tell me. Why are you looking for me?

335
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,650
Nothing. I just saw Auntie Zhao. She said you haven't eaten yet.

336
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,380
Let's go together.

337
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,910
I didn't bring my wallet. I'll go up and get it.

338
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,720
I'll treat you.

339
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,010
Let's go.

340
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,640
Do you know why I used to like gathering everyone together to eat ground pot chicken?

341
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,600
Because you like to eat it.

342
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,190
What other reasons could it be?

343
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:06,820
In the past, people from Hongze Lake of Xuzhou would all gather around a stove for dinner.

344
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,350
I like the feeling of reunion.

345
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:14,040
<i> I'll give the drumstick to our Main Offense Goddess Ai Qing. </i>

346
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,130
<i>Thank you, Captain Solo!</i>

347
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,860
<i> The second chicken drumstick is to welcome our new member, Han Shangyan, for joining us.</i>

348
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,150
<i>Here's your reward. </i>

349
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,360
<i>Welcome!</i>

350
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:34,170
<i>In the future, we will enjoy the good times and endure the hardships together.</i>

351
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,680
<i>If there are drumsticks, we'll eat together.</i>

352
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,420
<i> Come, come, come. Serving the next dish. Try my cooking. </i>

353
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,330
<i> I learned it last time from my mom. </i>

354
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,500
<i>Here.</i>

355
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,720
<i>Come on.</i>

356
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,030
♫ <i>You found another way</i> ♫

357
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,150
<i>Today is our second time spending the New Year, together.</i>

358
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,200
<i> Let us start anew in Shanghai! </i>

359
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,680
<i>- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!</i>

360
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,860
<i>Cheers!</i>

361
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,130
<i>Here.</i>

362
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,780
<i> I will always remember the scene of us eating together.</i>

363
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,140
♫ <i>Nothing to hide, not be afraid</i> ♫

364
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,530
You're nostalgic to a paranoid extent.

365
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,490
I'm just too lazy to change to new things.

366
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,500
Say it. What do you want to do?

367
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,250
I came to apply for a job.

368
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,290
Apply for a job?

369
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,660
Apply for what? Don't tell me that you finally decided to make a comeback.

370
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,550
Not happy about it?

371
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,270
I know you don't want to do this.

372
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,850
So what's to be happy about?

373
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,190
So annoying, you understand me too well.

374
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,330
Stop joking around. Get to the point.

375
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,780
I heard your manager left. I came to apply for the team manager position.

376
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,710
You came to find me three times. This time I came myself.

377
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,170
I'm experienced in this field.

378
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,140
I was once a competitive player for a top-ranked club.

379
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,680
I fought in a full group match.

380
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,300
I'm also familiar with this circle even though I've been retired for many years.

381
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,150
Although I purposely stopped paying attention to the news in this circle,

382
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,630
I think I should be more familiar with it than Su Cheng, who used to live overseas.

383
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:33,760
The focal point is that your team members are all opponents that I've competed against before.

384
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,660
I have researched in-depth each of their styles and personalities.

385
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,580
Also, Han Shangyan,

386
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,150
I'm familiar with you.

387
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,930
Su Cheng told me that this was really important.

388
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,670
Su Cheng went to find you?

389
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,060
I thought you would not like this position.

390
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,460
I thought you enjoyed the feeling of being in the arena more.

391
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,780
How could I have never have thought of it?

392
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,770
Owner, another ten orders of potsticker cakes.

393
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,040
- Come.
- Got it. Ten more potsticker cakes.

394
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,400
Cheers for the future.

395
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,900

396
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,600
No one?

397
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,660
They just finished the quarterfinals. I gave them half a day off.

398
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,410
How is it, compared to your last visit?

399
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,160
- Feels like I'm betraying SP.
- Get out.

400
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,900
This here is the official team players' training room.

401
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,950
Over there is the break room.

402
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,970
In front of you, the doors with the numbers are the dorms.

403
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,940
It's only this big. Of course, it can't compare to your SP, which is a big company.

404
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,660
It's good enough. You created something like this in just a few years.

405
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,790
Only you, Han Shangyan, can do it.

406
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,590
You have a broadcasting studio here?

407
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,700
I want them to feel like they're in a competition even when they're practicing here.

408
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,120
How about that small one?

409
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,650
Self-reflection room.

410
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,520
If any member makes a mistake, I make him go inside and reflect on it.

411
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,370
You're still the same. Haven't changed.

412
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,400
I was at this one.

413
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,200
You spent a lot of years to build this, right?

414
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,810
I didn't keep count. In any case, I spent quite a lot of time.

415
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:03,320
I didn't have patience in the past and couldn't sit still. I got into it in these recent years.

416
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,810
What is it? Didn't drink enough? Drink a bit more?

417
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,580
Come on! I'm not scared of you.

418
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,560
Catch it.

419
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,390
Are you not rejecting me now?

420
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,200
I already retired anyway.

421
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,930
It's okay to get drunk occasionally. Cheers.

422
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,550
Drink slower. We just finished eating.

423
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:38,190
What are you worried about? Take your time. We have the whole night.

424
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,250
Han Shangyan, you really are getting old.

425
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,560
Your wrinkles are appearing.

426
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,100
The pot calling the kettle black.

427
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,530
Come on. Let's toast to our last bit of youth.

428
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,100
Little Mi!

429
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,750
Come on and drink!

430
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,770
A toast to invite the moon.

431
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,450

Not right, there's only us two.

433
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,770
Enjoy and maximize all the pleasures which life affords.

434
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:30,590
Never leave your wine cup empty to the moon.

436
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,570
Han Shangyan?

437
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,360
Han Shangyan?

438
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,670
I couldn't find you. I thought something happened to you.

439
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,790
I was worried.

440
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,820
Are you okay?

441
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,620
Are you upset because of Buff?

442
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,980
Actually, yesterday, I watched a few public videos of the team's old competitions and the contents on the forums.

443
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,840
If I were you, I would be upset, too.

444
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,250
Previously, Buff had never won against you most of the time.

445
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,730
If you hadn't retired, they definitely wouldn't have been able to win the national championship.

446
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,330
You've been thinking about the past, right?

447
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,270
What is it?

448
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,260
Are you okay? Are you crying?

449
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,560
Don't be upset. Don't be upset.

450
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,770
Little Bai plays so well. He definitely will be able to help you win the competition. Don't be sad anymore.

451
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,940
How much longer are you going to pretend?

452
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,380
I already couldn't pretend anymore.

453
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,550
Annoying!

454
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,380
The two of you... Why didn't the two of you say something?

455
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,740
Kept listening. Just wanted to laugh at me, right?

456
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,490
Of course, he wasn't prepared to tell you. He was waiting to see a good show.

457
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,550
- Mi Shaofei, you're so mean!
- Sorry. Sorry.

458
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,570
I was just really curious.

459
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,600
- Han Shangyan, not bad.
- Quickly, go take a shower. You reek of alcohol.

460
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,570
I won't shower here. I'll go back and pack.

461
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,690
6:00 p.m. Be on time for the meeting.

462
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,200
You guys chat, Little Squid.

463
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,760
What's up?

464
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,740
Nothing.

465
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,760
Are you angry?

466
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,010
- Take it easy.
- Don't touch me.

467
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,730
Don't be angry.

468
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,220
You're so annoying.

469
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,650
Did you two drink all these?

470
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,580
Help me clean it up so we can avoid having Auntie cleaning it.

471
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,470
You even want me to clean it for you? You drank 'em, you clean 'em. I'm not helping you.

472
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,840
So ferocious.

473
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,000
So lazy. Hurry, go clean.

474
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,920
Fine, fine. Since I don't have anything else to do, I'll help clean with you.

475
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,600
I'm just too kind.

476
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:21,500
How much did you guys drink?

477
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,660
- Was Mi Shaofei in a bad mood?
- No.

478
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,450
Then, why were you guys drinking?

479
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:28,040
Why is a kid asking about trade secrets?

480
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,680
Tell me about it.

481
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,870
You will know soon.

482
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,440
Tell me now so I'll know it even sooner.

483
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,850
Was your curiosity always this strong?

484
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,990
Stop beating around the bush. Where are you going?

485
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,820
Mop the floor.

486
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,450
- I'll help you.
- No need.

487
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,500
Who told you about Buff? Yaya?

488
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,050
Did she make our past sound really tragic again?

489
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,900
No, no.

490
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,970
Just a bit sad.

491
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,890
Pick up your foot.

492
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,620
The other one.

493
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,320
What a waste of my mopping.

494
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,470
Then... Then, I'll have to hold onto this pole.

495
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,940
You go ahead and mop.

496
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,710
Here, come here. Come here.

497
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,650
- What is it?
- Sit here.

498
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,260
Don't move, okay?

499
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,960
Why are you looking at me?

500
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,990
I think you're handsome.

501
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,950
Men who do housework are handsome.

502
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,000
I'll help you clean up.

503
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,210
I just mopped and you've already left footprints.

504
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,460
Enough, enough.

505
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
No... No footprints. Look.

506
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,280
Go downstairs. There are things to eat, drink, and play. Don't stay here.

507
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,920
Besides the floor is wet, what if you slip and hurt yourself?

508
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,160
- I want to accompany you.
- I don't need you to accompany me.

509
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,730
- Hey, that's mine!
- That's mine!

510
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,070
- Stop right there!
- I bought that...

511
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,910
- Sister-in-Law!
- You came for a date with Boss?

512
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,780
You guys chat, we won't bother you.

513
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,070
- We won't bother you.
- Let's go.

514
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,050
So you guys are free. Demo, come here.

515
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,610
Play with her.

516
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,470
Why me?

517
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,950
- Shouldn't you be the one playing with Sister-in-Law?
- Right.

518
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:33,100
Even though I don't have anything to do, I can't help you with this.

519
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,330
- That's right.
- Isn't that so, Sister-in-Law?

520
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:39,330
Since you guys are free, how about we clean after eating?

521
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,550
97, you're also free.

522
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,310
I'm super busy, Boss. Look!

523
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,450
- In a bit, go scrub the keyboards in the training room.
- No...

524
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,710
One... You're so tall, you can take care of wiping down the club's windows.

525
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,400
Boss!

526
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,460
Don't be like this, Boss.

527
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,560
Sister-in-Law!

528
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,650
Little Demo got it so bad this time...

529
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,900
Is it really funny?

530
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,920
Go down and play.

531
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,460
<i>[NetEase Music]</i>

532
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,770
<i>Fill in all those.</i>

533
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,670
If you have any questions, ask me.

534
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,980
You came back?

535
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,050
- No questions?
- No questions.

536
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,030
What are you guys doing? Is today International Workers' Day?

537
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,570
- You ask him!
- What is it?

538
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,230
What does it have to do with me? You can't blame me.

539
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,210
You're still spouting nonsense?

540
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,830
Brothers, come on!

541
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,390
- Wait! Wait!
- Lift him up!

542
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,090
- Catch him! Catch him!
- Don't touch me!

543
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,880
- Brothers! A life is at stake!
- Here, here, here!

544
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,260
3, 2, 1!

545
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,830
- Catch him!
- Don't touch me!

546
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,890
Okay, okay! Let him go, let him go!

547
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,190
Boss said the meeting is at 6:00 p.m.

548
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,090
Let's clean up.

549
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,930
What meeting?

550
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,340
Boss didn't say why. He just said we're having a meeting.

551
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,950
I just saw Mi Shaofei.

552
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,090
Isn't that pretty normal? It's not his first time coming.

553
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:03,140
No! He was filling an employment application form.

554
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,350
What? Did Boss sign him?

555
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,370
Evidently!

556
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,150
Is Demon King crazy?

557
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,200
As soon as he meets anything related to his past brothers, he doesn't care about anything.

558
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,810
Don't say that about to Boss.

559
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,620
Then, how should I say it?

560
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,680
In the ranking, he's below the Top 100!

561
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,660
And he signed him into our K&K?

562
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,720
Does he think we're trash?

563
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,160
Really? Did you really see Mi Shaofei?

564
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,540
Why would I lie to you guys?

565
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,820
Where is he right now?

566
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,260
Still at the front desk.

567
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,980
Everyone, gather together.

568
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,560
Let me introduce you guys a new member.

569
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,550
New member?

570
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,040
This person... I think you guys are familiar with. An old opponent.

571
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,740
Little Mi? Didn't he retire?

572
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,120
Yes, he did retire.

573
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,710
Today, I discussed with people at headquarters. We unanimously decided

574
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,470
that Mi Shaofei will be our new team manager.

575
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,440
K&K's team manager?

576
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:15,150
Grunt, Wu Bai isn't here. As the vice-captain,

577
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,150
introduce him to everyone.

578
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,670
- Why do I have to?
- Why don't we wait until Captain returns.

579
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,770
Right.

580
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,670
Why wait for him?

581
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,290
You can familiarize yourself with everyone.

582
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,290
I'll make arrangements for everyone to go out on a meal together.

583
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,510
No need, Boss. We've all eaten.

584
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,860
No worries, I also ate before I came here.

585
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,210
Okay. Then you guys chat first.

586
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,480
Okay, let's clean up, everyone! Clean up and practice.

587
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,570
Come on, let's do work.

588
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,080
Don't worry about it. You go do your business first.

589
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,740
I can handle it. Go on.

590
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,550
Little Bai.

591
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,820
Little Bai!

592
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,080
What is it?

593
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,870
Help me.

594
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,640
I want Mi Shaofei to be the team manager, but everyone's unaccepting.

595
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,080
Help me change their mindset.

596
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,910
Why do I feel like everyone is ignoring Mi Shaofei?

597
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,690
Do you think it's easy to be the team manager?

598
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,750
These kids came from various regions and family backgrounds.

599
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:24,890
Each of them has their own temper. They don't comply so easily.

600
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:28,680
If you're so worried, why don't you go down and help him?

601
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,300
They already think I'm playing favoritism.

602
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,510
It's easy for me to hold a welcome party for him.

603
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,630
But the harder I pressure them,

604
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,060
the bigger the revolt will be.

605
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,310
Mi Shaofei must be able to gain the respect of these little monsters himself.

606
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:51,880
Otherwise, he won't be able to do his job and I can't help with that.

607
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,840
Come! Team DT, come to the meeting room with me.

608
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,490
Everyone else, keep training!

609
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,620
- Okay!
- Got it.

610
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,180
Coming!

611
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,990
Let's go. We have a meeting.

612
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,770
Meeting.

613
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,540
Did you all not hear it's time for the meeting? Why are you guys so slow!

614
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,990
Team Captain spoke! Meeting time! Meeting! Let's go.

615
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,860
What happens if he isn't able to control them?

616
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,170
If Ai Qing can hold down that bunch of grown men in SP,

617
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,630
I believe Little Mi can do it, too.

618
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,690
Let's wait and see.
