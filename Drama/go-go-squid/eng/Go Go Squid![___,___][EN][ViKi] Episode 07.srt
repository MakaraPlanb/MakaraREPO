 - Can't I make up characters?

168
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,770
It doesn't look like it. Are you dating?

169
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,900
- You're the one who's dating!
 - Are you dating?

170
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,650
- Don't make stuff up!
 - You are dating! Your are dating!

171
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,060
She's dating! She's dating!

172
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,100
- Okay! Okay! Okay!
 - Go away!

173
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,750
- I won't say anymore!
 - So annoying!

174
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,370
I was wrong. I was wrong.

175
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,070
Is it here?

176
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,500
This should be it.

177
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,860
The GPS says that this is the place.

178
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,550
Take it slowly.

179
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,780
Why are you wearing all black?

180
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,200
My wardrobe is filled with the same clothes.

181
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,750
Today, I'm matchmaking for you. Couldn't you have worn something more formal?

182
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,930
How could I have known you were taking me out to a matchmaking date?

183
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,210
I thought you were coming to see an old friend.

184
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:35,310
I'm telling you. Today's matchmaking must be a success, it cannot be a failure.

185
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,660
You're so autocratic. Just give me an arranged marriage then. Why do you even bother with matchmaking?

186
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,000
You go on, I'm going to leave first. Give me a call later!

187
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,830
What now?

188
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,570
My... My chest hurts.

189
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,710
That's enough.

190
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,740
Stop with the idle talk. Let's go!

191
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,400
They're here.

192
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,750
- Uncle Han!
 - You are here.
 - Little Tong. Little Lin. I am bothering you.

193
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,750
What are you saying? We're so happy that you're here, right?

194
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,830
Right! Uncle Han, we haven't seen you in a few years but you're still so high-spirited!

195
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,180
- Yes, yes!
 - In the few years we haven't seen each other, you've gotten taller again!

196
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,540
- How could I have gotten taller? At this age? I'm already old!
 - Greet them!

197
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,240
Uncle. Auntie.

198
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,930
- Uncle Han!
 - Hello, Little Chubby Sis. Where's your daughter?

199
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,130
My daughter is in the house making tea for you!

200
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,280
- Hurry in!
 - Come in, Uncle Han!

201
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,990
Take your time!

202
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,680
- A-jiao.
 - Be careful, Uncle!
 - Uncle Han, come.

203
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,550
- Hello!
 - Hello.
 - Call him "Grandpa Han!"

204
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,470
Hello, Grandpa Han!

205
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,590
Good, good! Is this her?

206
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,540
This is her! This is my daughter.

207
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,980
Grandpa Han, China's weather is rather dry. I especially prepared some fruits for you.

208
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,200
I'm not sure if it will be to your liking.

209
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,170
Come in!

210
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,420
- Say hi!
 - Hello, I am Hu Yuejiao.

211
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,760
Han Shangyan.

212
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,570
- Grandpa Han, quickly come sit!
 - Uncle Han, sit.

213
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,420
You just came back from Norway. I thought that you might not be used to our domestic teas.

214
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,540
I specially prepared a floral tea for you.

215
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,270
I'm not sure if it will be to your taste.

216
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,970
- Your trip must have been tiring.
 - It was all right.

217
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,940
- Please have some tea!
 - Yes, yes.

218
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,570
Try it!

219
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,440
- It is quite fragrant!
 - This was specially prepared by A-jiao.

220
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,710
Hurry up, Nian Nian!

221
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,720
I know.

222
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:14,160

223
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,980
Sis!

224
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,450
Nian Nian, what are you doing? There are so many guests here!

225
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:26,260
Why are you dressed like that? Hurry up and go change. Hurry.

226
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,210
Wait a minute.

227
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,580
<i>This... is your home?</i>

228
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,040
<i>Yes... what a coincidence?</i>

229
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,750
Nian Nian, what are you doing? Where are your manners?

230
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,010
May I ask where the restroom is?

231
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,330
That way. It's over there.

232
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,720
- Thank you.
 - No problem.

233
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,810
Nian Nian, hurry and go change!

234
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,440
Have some fruit!

235
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,530
No thanks.

236
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,610
Have some tea.

237
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,850
- I have juice.
 - You...

238
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,320
Nian Nian. Hurry.

239
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,040
- Hurry and greet Grandpa Han.
 - Hello, Grandpa Han.

240
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,560
- My daughter, she's currently majoring in computers at university.
 - Why is he here?

241
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,980
- I don't know!!
 - I can tell she is a good child.

242
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,360
Oh, right! I have a grandson from my daughter who is very handsome.

243
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,060
He is also studying computers in school.

244
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,600
Later on, you two can get to know each other!

245
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,900
I believe you guys will have a lot of common topics to talk about!

246
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,710
- He is going there later as well?
 - Yes, yes!

247
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,040
You hear that?

248
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,880
Say, do you think her and Little Bai are a good match?

249
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,320
I don't know. If you think they are a good match, then it is a good match.

250
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,180
Psh. Hey, give him a call!

251
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,270
He can't be late for the New Year's Eve dinner.

252
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,640
Got it!

253
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,800
<i>[Happiness]</i>

254
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,510
Uncle Han, slowly.

255
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,050
Uncle Han, let's take this car. It is comfortable!

256
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,410
- This one?
 - Yeah, let's get in this one!

257
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,240
Okay, okay!

258
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:43,670
Later on, find an opportunity to ask that girl about her height, weight, what she likes.

259
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,620
Do you hear me?

260
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,510
Grandpa Han, let's get in the car!

261
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,380
I'll help you.

262
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,290
Be careful.

263
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,970
Oh my God. Sis, what should we do?

264
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,460
I'm going to go over first.

265
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,670
Nian Nian, I'm giving you a task.

266
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,140
We are trying to matchmake your cousin with that big brother over there.

267
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,380
Later on, you sit in their car and listen to what they are saying and act accordingly, got it?

268
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,870
Matchmaking?

269
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,640
What is it?

270
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,140
- Dounan, you go in the other car in the back.
 - Okay.

271
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,460
Tong Nian, hurry up!

272
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,490
I... I won't sit in that car.

273
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:42,250
I'm sorry. They told me to sit in this car.

274
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,820
I don't want to sit in that car.

275
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,360
- Why? Then what? You're going to take a taxi there?
 - I'll just take a taxi.

276
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,350
Why are you taking a taxi? This is also my first time meeting him.

277
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,360
Later on, if there is an awkward silence, we can still chat with each other. Otherwise, it'll be so awkward!

278
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,280
Yeah! Be good, go on!

279
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,120
- We're family, no need to be scared!
 - Go!

280
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,060
<i>Didn't he say that he didn't have any plans to get a girlfriend?</i>

281
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,460
You sit in the back, I'll sit in the front!

282
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,620
<i>Fool. How is he not planning to have a girlfriend?</i>

283
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,450
<i>It's obvious he just doesn't want to deal with you.</i>

284
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,910
Excuse me, your jacket...

285
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,960
Move over!

286
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,950
Understand?

287
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,640
I've gone to matchmaking so many times, met so many men,

288
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,490
but this is the one with the least amount of manners.

289
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,040
Sit tight.

290
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,800
I think we are all adults. It would be better if we were more frank.

291
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,150
Then, I'll introduce myself first.

292
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,860
I am in marketing. Mainly in charge of brand management.

293
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,220
What do you do?

294
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,280
I don't have any decent work.

295
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,650
But you must have a profession.

296
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,520
I heard Aunt say that you are starting your own business.

297
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,220
Profession? Does playing on the computer count?

298
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,770
Playing on the computer?

299
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,160
So, you're someone with no real job who lives off his parents.

300
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,720
I see.

301
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,840
Actually... Actually, his work is a respectable profession.

302
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,760
Playing on the computer can count as a respectable profession?

303
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,310
They are cybersecurity talents. They even win medals at competitions.

304
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,740
It is a new area that is encouraged by the government.

305
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,080
And if they win, they can earn prize money. A lot of prize money.

306
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,980
But they don't do it just for the money, they do it for the honor.

307
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,640
Actually in China, a lot of the internet technologies are at the forefront.

308
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,600
They've received many medals.

309
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,710
Well, there can't be people who spend their whole life playing on the computer!

310
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,800
Are we here? Why are we parking on the side of the road?

311
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,140
I think it will be better if we make things clear.

312
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,700
I don't have any interest in you.

313
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,920
In the future, I, for sure, will have no interest in you either.

314
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,000
Of course, you have no interest in people like me as well.

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,520
We are all grown adults.

316
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,710
Let's cooperate with our elders and finish this meal. What do you think?

317
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,370
Also, you don't need to act like you don't know me.

318
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,390
Are you not tired from acting?

319
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,060
What's happening here?

320
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,380
Nian Nian, you two know each other?

321
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,180
- We just met, not long ago.
 - Didn't he just come back from overseas?

322
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,410
You are always at school and not yet working.

323
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,300
How did you two meet each other?

324
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,040
It's... at the internet cafe.

325
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,970
Online friend?

326
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,740
No. I met him at your family's internet cafe.

327
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,030
Yes. Yes.

328
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,300
Yes, about what?

329
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,060
Something fishy is going on here.

330
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,120
We've finally arrived. That was too stuffy.

331
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,160
- This place doesn't look bad.
 - Yuejiao.

332
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,120
- How was it?
 - Don't even mention it. He is so arrogant.

333
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,080
I just don't get it. He doesn't have a real job.

334
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,230
But yet, he has a sense of superiority.

335
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,140
How would it be like this?

336
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,440
Let me tell you. When we are eating later, just go through the motions.

337
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,470
It's New Year's. Please, don't make the elderly upset.

338
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,250
- I understand, Mom.
 <i>- In a bit when we're about done, bring these two things...</i>

339
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,760
- I think they know each other.
 - They?

340
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,980
Do you know?

341
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,310
<i>- If there is anything, contact me anytime.
 - I've troubled you.</i>

342
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,610
I think they do.

343
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,660
Let's go in first. Everyone is waiting.

344
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,280
<i> [South Wu Grand Feast]</i>

345
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,690
Why aren't you going in?

346
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,150
I saw that they already went in.

347
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,570
I wanted to wait for you. This way is more courteous.

348
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,320
I am not interested in your cousin.

349
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,320
It would be best if she doesn't develop an interest in me.

350
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,630
So, what you said in the car,

351
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,650
is actually helping me in the wrong way.

352
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,530
I do not need an outsider to understand what my profession is like.

353
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,030
Especially someone who I will not have contact with in the future.

354
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,280
Therefore, there is no need to explain anything to her.

355
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,080
Do you understand?

356
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,080
Also, the reason why I exposed the fact that we knew each other is not to make you look bad.

357
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,310
It's because this is a lie that cannot continue on.

358
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,450
My cousin is coming soon. He knows you.

359
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,160
Plus, he would definitely be honest.

360
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,320
So, there is no reason for us to pretend we are strangers.

361
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,910
Do you understand?

362
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,830
I understand. We are not strangers.

363
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,050
Are you feeling better inside?

364
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,060
Let's go in.

365
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,940
Come, come. Come here.

366
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,030
What is it, Aunt?

367
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,310
Let me ask you. You know Han Shangyan?

368
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,220
What kind of person is he?

369
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,410
I've only known him for a week.

370
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,390
I only know that he is very good at the computer.

371
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,970
I just want to know about his character. Does he really not engage in proper work?

372
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,750
Or is he pretending?

373
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,850
Being good at computers doesn't mean improper work, right?

374
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,550
Then, do you think that he and your sister...

375
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,240
Aunt, my phone is vibrating.

376
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,990
A phone call. My classmate called, I'm going to pick it up.

377
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,180
Yaya! Yes. I'm having dinner with my family.

378
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,780
Today, sure. After I finished...

379
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,190
Yes, yes. You can speak...

380
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,160
Oh, so that's the situation. Is it okay if I give it to you after I go home?

381
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,720
It is not very convenient right now.

382
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,480
Little Bai, come here. Come here.

383
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,210
- Little Bai. This is my grandson from my daughter.
 - Oh, so this is who you were just talking about.

384
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,050
- Yes, yes, yes. Wu Bai.
 - Wow, he's grown so much.

385
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,730
So attractive. Do you have a girlfriend?

386
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,850
Not yet. We were waiting for you to introduce you to someone.

387
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,110
This is the present that he got for you.

388
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,600
Thank you.

389
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,480
I will put them here for you.

390
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,720
- Thank you!
 - Thank you! You are too polite.

391
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,360
Sit.

392
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,140
What's happening?

393
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,880
- Her?
 <i>- You're already a grown woman.</i>

394
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,490
What is the girl that likes you doing here?

395
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,400
- We are family friends,
<i> - ...his temper is not good.</i>

396
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,330
Grandpa wants to match you up with her.

397
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,750
Are you joking?

398
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,750
I already said. When Grandpa comes back, nothing good will come of it.

399
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,450
Well, even if there was a match to be made, it's for you. What does this have to do with me?

400
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,940
I did get matched. It was quickly taken care of.

401
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,100
Your problem... Take care of it on your own.

402
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,250
I can't help you.

403
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,910
Nian Nian, come here.

404
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,310
Come here. I will introduce you.

405
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,720
I forgot to introduce you earlier.

406
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,630
This is my grandson, Wu Bai. This is Nian Nian.

407
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,110
Your parents saw him when he was still little.

408
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,050
Go, go! You two go sit over there!

409
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,300
Go over there!

410
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,460
You two, talk more.

411
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,340
My grandson is also studying computers.

412
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,710
Yeah, Nian Nian, you two are in the same major.

413
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,720
You guys must have a lot to talk about.

414
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,110
Say hello to her.

415
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,680
I know her.

416
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,950
You two know each other?

417
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,140
I think she is...

418
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,950
my brother's girlfriend.

419
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,670
Little Bai, what nonsense are you saying?

420
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,490
Wait, no, no. Stop, stop.

421
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,910
I will not listen to him. I want to hear from you. Little Bai, you tell us.

422
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,030
I don't know the details,

423
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,640
but all our club members call her "Sister-in-Law."

424
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,870
Sister-in-Law?

425
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,370
No, no.

426
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,770
Nian Nian, aren't you going to explain what's going on?

427
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,000
Nian Nian, come here.

428
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,730
Come here.

429
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,810
What's going on? Why do you suddenly have a boyfriend that we don't even know of?

430
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,680
- I don't know either. He really isn't. That is not the situation.
 - Explain it clearly.

431
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,350
Auntie, you might as well listen to me explain.

432
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,410
Don't talk. You shut up.

433
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,040
If you say more, I'll break your leg!

434
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,830
Grandpa, please don't be mad. Nian Nian also feels wronged.

435
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,810
Do you know what is going on in the middle of all this?

436
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,760
Dounan, when did your sis get a boyfriend?

437
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,550
I don't know the specifics... but my sis does like him.

438
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,500
You're saying nonsense!

439
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,200
I'm speaking the truth. Didn't you fall in love at first sight with him?

440
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,330
Stop talking about it, can you?

441
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,870
Dounan!

442
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:29,810
However, I really don't know when they got so close.

443
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,180
I suppose it was when they were in Guangzhou.

444
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,720
You, shut up!

445
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,020
That's enough. Why don't you sit down?

446
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,330
Our family is open-minded. Dating is not a bad thing.

447
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,180
Little Han, isn't it better to be open?

448
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,170
- Am I right, Brother?
 - Aunt, you guys really all misunderstood.

449
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,710
- He and I really aren't...
 - Please do not interrupt when grown-ups are speaking.

450
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,240
Okay, okay, okay.

451
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,010
Grandpa Han, it's fine.

452
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,650
We are all grown adults, not kids.

453
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,410
Little Han, let's just consider this our formal meeting.

454
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,680
If you have time, come visit us often. All right?

455
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,370
Let me tell you. Mr. Han is very busy.

456
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,380
So don't trouble him, okay?

457
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,020
Actually, this should have been made clear early on.

458
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,090
Explain everything so that we all aren't wasting our efforts.

459
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,720
Isn't that so, Uncle Han?

460
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,650
Right.

461
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,680
Go give greetings to Uncle and Auntie.

462
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,450
Let's just say that this is the first official introduction.

463
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,840
Go over and give your greetings!

464
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,740
<i>Old people are old.</i>

465
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,380
<i>If I do defy him, who knows what's going to happen?</i>

466
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,450
<i>And it's New Year's.</i>

467
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,290
<i> The elders here all think that I've taken advantage of a young lady</i>

468
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,480
<i> and not admitting to it. </i>

469
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,380
Go!

470
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,920
Uncle. Auntie. Hello.

471
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,830
I am Han Shangyan.

472
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,190
Tong Nian and I have been together for only a short period of time.

473
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,540
I didn't get her permission,

474
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,730
so I didn't dare pay a visit rashly.

475
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,020
I hope Uncle and Auntie can forgive me.

476
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,920
Okay. We forgive you. It's fine.

477
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,150
Come on. Go sit.

478
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,850
- Grandpa Han.
 - Okay, okay. Come here.

479
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,380
Today is New Year's Eve, let's all just be happy and merry, all right?

480
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,900
Right! Right!

481
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,130
If there is anything else, let's save it and talk about them next year. Okay?

482
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,630
Okay? Here.

483
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,080
Here, here, here.

484
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,750
Oh right. Let's all be happy today.

485
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,850
Everyone, let's raise our glasses. Okay?

486
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,890
Raise your glasses!

487
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,880
I hope your career goes smoothly.

489
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,420
Waitress!

490
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,590
- Waitress, bring the food!
<i> - Yes, got it.</i>

491
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:15,650
Let me tell you. If he wasn't from the Han family, I would've already...

492
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:19,350
- How much older is he than Nian Nian?
 - Yeah.

493
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,740
- He really is quite a lot older than Nian Nian.
 - Don't copy me!

494
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,850
Little Bai.

495
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,860
The headquarters called saying that they need to speak to you.

496
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,900
Why don't you reply to them? Come outside with me.

497
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,630
Stop eating. Come out.

498
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,500
Do you not want to live anymore?

499
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,940
Who told you to only sit and watch the show?

500
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,910
If the room weren't filled with outsiders, I'd have started a row with you.

501
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,540
- Didn't you accept it?
 - Bull, how could I not?

502
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,810
It's New Year's Eve! Grandpa is getting old.

503
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,400
If something had happened, would you've taken responsibility then?

504
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,680
Well, it's Grandpa, too. He refused to believe anyone but a big tailed wolf like you. <i>(T/N: liar)</i>

505
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,040
Just this once. I won't let it go next time, you hear that.

506
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,960
Brother-in-Law.

507
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,800
I really did not think that you were still my brother-in-law in the end. We must be fated.

508
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,580
Do you have something to say?

509
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,080
Grandpa told you guys to go in and eat.

510
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,680
That temper...

511
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,500
It's really too much for Little Squid.

512
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,240
Time to eat.

513
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,580
Right now, those who are older tend to spoil their wives more.

514
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,180
You see, our Little Han, although he's always got a sour face,

515
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,480
he actually is very responsible.

516
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,780
And also, you see... Little Han's birthday is on February 14.

517
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,720
Nian Nian is March 20. Look how close they are.

518
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,130
Isn't that good? Right?

519
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,870
Uncle, here, have a drumstick.

520
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,080
Okay. Here.

521
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,550
Here, here. Little Bai.

522
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,410
Right, you. Come here.

523
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,670
Sit here.

524
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,910
- Sit. Take something to eat.
 - Okay.

525
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:35,480
Han Shangyan! Just sit there.

526
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,460
Sit there!

527
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,330
Go over there.

528
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,860
Okay, eat.

529
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,910
It's New Year's. Let's be happier.

530
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,610
<i>Why did you tell a lie?</i>

531
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,970
My cousin has a girl that he likes.

532
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,500
So, he asked me to help him avoid this matchmaking at all costs.

533
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,680
It was a sticky situation. We had no other choice but to use this method.

534
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,880
After tonight, we can randomly find a reason to break up.

535
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,330
Not considerate, not gentle.

536
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,840
Not sharing a similar language to understand each other, too old.

537
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,300
Those are all valid reasons.

538
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,480
You can choose the reason for the breakup.

539
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,800
Sorry.

540
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,880
It's fine. It's for helping him, isn't it?

541
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,870
Han Shangyan, serve your girlfriend some food.

542
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,640
It's fine, Grandpa Han. It's okay.

543
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,810
Hurry up.

544
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,980
Thank you.

545
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,860
- Eat.
 - Thank you.

546
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,250
It's... It's enough.

547
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,150
I can't eat that much.

548
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,600
Eat it slowly; you will eventually finish it.

549
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,680
Here, here, here. Give your girlfriend a drink. A drink.

550
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,260
Hurry!

551
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,560
Enough, enough. Enough, enough.

552
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,390
Drink it slowly.

553
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,470
Little Bai, after we finish eating, remember to pack up the rest to-go.

554
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:01,080
Little Han, you are not young anymore. Right?

555
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,510
- You sure have a large appetite.
 - There's a young one at home.

556
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:09,360
You've divorced, and have a child?

557
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,780
No, no, that's not it.

558
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,580
It's his club's kid.

559
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,390
It's New Year's and he didn't go home. So, he's temporarily staying at our house.

560
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,450
Here. Eat.

561

<i>[A Path Among the Clouds]</i>

562
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,450
Take it slow, Grandpa. There is a step here.

563
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,570
Okay, good child.

564
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,630
Nian Nian, hurry and get in the car.

565
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,880
Oh right!

566
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,610
Let Nian Nian ride in my grandson's car.

567
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,290
Your car?

568
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,790
Her parents drove here.

569
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,600
You... say something.

570
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,980
Uncle. Auntie. Let Tong Nian ride my car.

571
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,340
Don't worry. I'll follow behind your car.

572
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,150
Right, allow it for my sake.

573
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,560
- Go, go.
 - Get in the car.

574
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,280
Grandpa Han, let me help you. Be careful, the step is here.

575
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,560

When are we breaking up?

582
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,970
Because we should set a time frame, right?

583
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,770
So that I can tell my parents.

584
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,980

You haven't finished thinking about it?

586
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,300
How about... How about next month?

587
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,660
Breaking up during New Year's is too fast.

588
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,560
It's not really good.

589
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,390
How about this? You can decide.

590
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:32,240
Whenever you decide to break up, just notify me in advance.

591
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,970
Before we break up, you are still my girlfriend.

592

Whatever you want, just say it. I will do my best to make it happen.

593
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,290
I'll keep my word.

594
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,390
Go back. Your mom is waiting for you.

595
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,940
Then... I'll go now.

596
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,200
- See you.
 - See you.

597
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,090
- What were you guys talking about for such a long–
 - Nothing.

598
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,370
Let's go. Let's go inside. Let's go.

599
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,510
Nian Nian is dating for the first time.

600
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,300
I don't want to denigrate her.

601
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:45,030
You're worrying for nothing. It's not like the final word.

602
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,380
I already told you before.

603
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,680
Girls being too pretty is dangerous.

604
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,280
If I knew it earlier, I should have her eat more and get fatter.

605
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,000
There's a sense of security if she's fatter.

606
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,410
There would still be time to lose weight before dating, too.

607
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,190
I'm telling you, that's during middle and high school. Now, Nian Nian is an adult.

608
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,520
If you make her fatter, she may have low self-esteem.

609
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,840
I mean, I dress her up so prettily every day.

610
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,190
Who knew she would find such a boyfriend.

611
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,420
You, let me tell you.

612
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,580
You are being biased, you know that?

613
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,560
Except for his age, there are no other bad things.

614
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:35,270
I see Nian Nian being so happy.

615
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,300
I don't know what I should say.

616
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,820
It's ready!

617
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,850
You, it's best you don't say anything.

618
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,620
Figure out what kind of person he is first.

619
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,470
Smell this. How's my cooking skill?

620
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,970
Okay, okay. Don't burn yourself.

00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,980
- Do you want to have a taste?
 - Hurry and go. Go.

- Go, go.
 - I'll go do some work first.

623
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,390
Okay. Go.
