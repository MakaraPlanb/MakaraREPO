00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,170
- Hello, Sister-in-Law.
 - Hello, Sister-in-Law.

32
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,960
Hello, Sister-in-Law. Nice to meet you.

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,650
Can you tell them not to call me "Sister-in-Law"? Everyone mistook me.

34
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,760
No problem.

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,080
That... Sister-in-Law said for everyone not to call her "Sister-in-Law" anymore, she is embarrassed.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,880
All right, Sister-in-Law.

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,820
"Sister-in-Law," got it!

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,480
Sister-in-Law, take a seat.

39
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,400
Thank you.

When will your boss get in the car?

43
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,730
- Wait a little bit more.
 - Fine.

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,500
Captain, when did your brother get a girlfriend?

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,340
Doesn't he live at the club 24 hours?

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,730
- I don't know.
 - Advancing secretly...

47
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,380
The boss does have it together, playing this kind of game with us.

48
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,330
He is afraid that we'll copy him, get a girlfriend, and interfere with the competitions.

49
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,300
He is not young anymore; dating is a normal necessity.

50
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,260
The Boss is getting old.

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,960
<i> How is he getting old? Clearly he's drop-dead gorgeous.</i>

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,550
<i>Compared to these tender youths, he is much more manly.</i>

53
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,660
Everyone, after we get back to the hotel, go to the first-floor buffet dining hall first.

54
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,030
I reserved a couple of big tables.

55
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,140
Watch yourself. Don't eat any raw cold seafood.

56
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,500
You saw Grunt, how he messed up his body by doing so.

57
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,590
It's competition season. You have to pay more attention to your health, understand?

58
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,990
<i>Understood, Manager!</i>

59
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,670
Sir, you can drive them back first. Boss and I will go back ourselves.

60
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,500
All right.

61
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,380
Moreover, you guys have to take good care of her.

62
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,580
- Don't worry.
 - Don't worry.

Let's talk about business first and anything else later.

66
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,270
Everyone, sit down first.

67
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,890
Tomorrow is when both of our teams will compete with each other.

68
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,830
Then, we will all do our best.

69
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,110
Both sides do their best but there is only one champion. Who gets it?

70
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,920
I'm the last? I'm really sorry.

71
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,630
Both of your teams have too many fans.

72
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,750
I have to make sure they get out safely before I can leave.

73
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,440
Stop the nonsense, let's talk business.

74
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,330
There's no business matter. Today is about old friends getting together.

75
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,320
Isn't it nice to have lunch together?

76
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,480
- You have nothing else to do?
 - That...

77
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,020
It's not like that.

78
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,530
Do you have something important to announce or not?

79
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,930
Eating is very important, Old Han.

80
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,540
I know a very good restaurant in Guangzhou.

81
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,220
I'm leaving.

82
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,860
Old Han, you're not giving me some respect?

83
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,460
You still have to eat after you go to the hotel. Even if it's not to accompany your brother, at least have a chat with me.

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,660
Forget it.

85
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,590
I reserved a 12-people private room.

86
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,950
Now, there's only three of us. Does it make sense?

87
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,920
Forget it, Director Xiang.

88
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,330
It will be a waste for only three of us eating.

89
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,140
Save it for the next time we go. Goodbye.

90
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:30,030
- I called for a car. I figure there is traffic on the road. Wait a little.
 - <i>Director Xiang still doesn't know Han Shangyan's temperament.</i>

91
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,300
We have a car.

92
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,770
Since we happen to stay at the same hotel, why don't we go back together?

93
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,430
No, thank you. We called for a car already.

94
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,890
Don't be upset about little things.

95
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,940
It's us who won the competition today.

96
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,770
I just didn't expect there would be such a day.

97
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,990
We have all succeeded, became wealthy, but it's so hard to get in one car together.

98
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,540
Sorry.

99
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,110
It's all my fault. I ruined you guys.

100

109

<i>- Yes!
 - That's right!</i>

111

Oh, his name is Wu Bai, our Boss's younger cousin. He's our captain.

He's the same as our boss; likes to be by himself. He's probably training by himself right now.

You guys, don't scare her.

 - We're not. We're just chatting.

<i> Her aura is so strong. I am incomparable to her.</i>

00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,730
Are you full?

165
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,780
I just drank... drank some water. I am full already, not hungry.

166
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,680
Come in.

167
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,320
If there's something to discuss, why can't we speak in the dining hall?

168
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:28,320

169
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,610
Do you want me to talk about private matters in public areas?

170
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,070
Don't worry. He won't be mean to girls.

171
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,920
I'm going to take care of the other team members first.

172
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,830
Take your time talking.

173
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,980
I'll give you ten seconds to decide.

174
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,840
Can the two of you... tell the truth now?

175
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,880
How many times do I need to say this, Boss?

176
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,300
You are a big man. Can't you be straight forward?

177
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,820
Just stab me to death already.

178
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,340
- Do you know that he already has a girlfriend?
 - I don't know.

179
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,500
Now that you know. What do you think?

180
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,240
No opinions.

181
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,850
Little sister, come over here. Let me tell you something.

182
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,770
Tell the truth. Why exactly did you seek me out for?

183
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,460
I wasn't looking for you.

184
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,660
It's fine for an autograph.

185
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,170
A photo together is fine, too. Give me any request.

186
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,900
Just tell the truth that the two of us have no relations at all.

187
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,380
Give me any request. As long as you don't want to be my girlfriend.

188
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,540
Who wants to be your girlfriend? I don't even like you.

189
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,090
<i> What is the situation now?</i>

190
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,320
<i> Why isn't he saying anything?</i>

191
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,560
Little Sister, let me ask you something.

192
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,910
Do... you know him?

193
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,890
Then, did you come to the competition because of him?

194
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,380
When you went to the competition site, was it also to look for him?

195
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,550
Y-Yes.

196
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,020
This is from your own love entanglement. Quack!

197
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,870
Trying to put the blame on me. Not possible.

198
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,790
Say that again. What blame?

199
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,660
No... that...

200
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,670
Little Sister, let me tell you. If you like him, just bravely say it out loud.

201
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,490
A man like him... Forget about having women around him, there aren't even female animals around him.

202
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,490
The dog that male security guard outside our area owns is even male.

203
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,080
This item of the highest quality, if you miss him now, you will regret it for life.

204
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,210
Anyways, the person I like is not Grunt. I like...

205
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,790
No...

206
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,340
I came to look for you.

207
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,960
The two of you still refuse to tell the truth, right?

208
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,310
- That is the truth!
 - That is the truth!

209
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,560
Nothing for you here.

210
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,510
Get out.

211
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,070
All right. I am going then.

212
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,110
I am not talking to you.

213
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,640
It's him.

214
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,940
Received, Boss. Then... I'll get going.

215
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,500
Then.. you and the chick.. continue.

216
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,070
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

217
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,660
You like me?

218
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,130
What? Am I misunderstanding?

219
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,920
- No.
 - What do you like about me?

220
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,810
If you don't know how to answer...

221
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,380
All right, I'll ask in another way.

222
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,150
What's there to like about me?

223
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,870
I saw you at the airport. Saw you and a group of people wearing uniforms.

224
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,390
I was very surprised.

225
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,150
Later my friend told me there was a competition.

226
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,760
So I thought if you guys were in the competition, I just thought to come and see you.

227
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,930
About the Grunt matter, I thought you were Grunt.

228
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,310
I thought you were having gastric bleeding, so I just wanted to see if you were all right.

229
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,830
I-I didn't mean to disturb you. I am sorry.

230
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,710
What are you afraid of? Am I that mean?

231
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,680
Your phone.

232
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,310
It's mine!

233
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,400
Can I borrow your bathroom for a little bit?

234
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,740
I have a very important phone call. Is it okay?

235
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,420
Thanks.

236
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,610
- Hello, how are you?
 - <i>Hello! Hello!</i>

237
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,710
This is the 1-2-3 Communication Radio Station. I am the host, Hai Lukong.

238
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,130
How are you!

239
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,180
All right. All right.

240
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,030
<i>Hello to all the audience.</i>

241
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,500
This is the 1-2-3 Communication Radio Station.

242
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,790
We're connected to someone highly popular on the internet here; she has a several hundred thousand fan base.

243
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,610
Network Singer, Little Squid. <i>(T/N: network singers are those who primary sing and upload original or cover songs online)</i>

244
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,330
<i>Let's ask Little Squid,</i>

245
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,960
what lead you to start uploading your songs online in the beginning?

246
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,480
Mainly because it's something I enjoy doing. It is something I am very interested in.

247
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,950
What kind of songs do you usually perform?

248
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:23,100
I like to sing cute, cartoon, anime, and high-pitch songs.

249
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,330
<i>Normally, what colors do you like?</i>

250
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,010
I normally like the color white.

251
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,130
What kind of fruits do you eat?

252
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,760
I like several different kinds of fruits.

253
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,580
Such as apples and cherries; I like them very much.

254
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,210
May I ask... do you have a boyfriend?

255
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,970
I currently don't have a boyfriend. I am still single.

256
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,650
No boyfriend. Then may I ask...

257
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,000
what types of boys you like?

258
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,660
Handsome.

259
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,030
When he is not talking, he is cold and grim;

260
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,630
but once he smiles, he is very warm.

261
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,000
That is my ideal type.

262
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,030
All right, thank you so much for your interview today.

263
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:38,090
While we listen to the last song, I hope you can wish our audience a good afternoon.

264
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,010
All right. Then I hope everyone has a good afternoon.

265
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,830
- See you next time!
 - Okay!

266
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,620
Thank you. See you soon.

267
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,660
Goodbye, everyone.

268
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,090
- Are you done?
 - I am done.

269
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,240
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I disturbed you.

270
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,970
Are you hungry?

271
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,160
Let's go and eat.

272
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,440
The club will be training soon. In twenty minutes, there won't be anything to eat.

273
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,670
I... I actually don't need to eat.

274
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,100
You don't need to invite me...

275
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,150
What is your name?

276
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,700
Tong Nian.

277
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,940
Close the door.

278
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,950
<i> Not right... why are we eating together?</i>

279
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,110
<i> Forget it. We'll see when we get there.</i>

280
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,780
Do you want to eat some?

281
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,380
You don't like this flavor?

282
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,880
Then pick one yourself.

283
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,680
B-Boss.

284
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,580
Have I... interrupted you guys?

285
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,080
Going in and out, what are you doing? Do you need to go up or down?

286
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,290
Down, down, down! Up, up.

287
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,480
I just need to go get something.

288
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,080
You didn't even ask whether we needed to get off.

289
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,180
Sorry, Boss. I didn't know you guys needed to get off.

290
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,480
Do you want to choose one or not?

291
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
<i>Is he not afraid of being misunderstood?</i>

292
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,880
This one. Thank you.

293
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,880
<i>After seeing what I shouldn't see, will I be killed to be silenced?</i>

294
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,980
Boss, I'm here!

295
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,480
S-Sorry. You guys can go down.

296
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,980
<i>After being seen by Demo the bigmouth, this misunderstanding is going to be huge.</i>

297
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,080
Let's go.

298
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,780
That's Sister-in-Law?

299
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,880
Go get food yourself.

300
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,780
Sister-in-Law is so young!

301
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,280
If you don't have feelings for her, why did you bring her for dinner?

302
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,080
I brought the kid here without figuring out the situation, so I bear some responsibility, too.

303
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,480
Even when the deal fell through, the relationship is still there. I will send her back when she has eaten.

304
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,780
Not bad. You're quite a gentleman!

305
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,780
You guys eat first, I'll get the car.

306
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,780
What do you think they went to do?

307
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,580
- Why are you finally here when we're almost finished?
 - I ran into Boss!

308
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,980
His mood is pretty bad.

309
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,280
What's wrong with Boss?

310
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,880
When he eats candy, it means that he is super impatient and has a ton of things on his mind.

311
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,380
Just now in the elevator, he ate some.

312
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,280
- Scared me to death.
 - Do you think they had an argument?

313
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
I don't know!

314
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Anyways, the whole time I was sweating.

315
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,280
I was scared that Boss would toss me out from the elevator.

316
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,480
You're so useless, really!

317
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,980
<i>If I eat shellfish, then wouldn't I have to open my mouth really wide?</i>

318
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,780
<i>If I eat shrimp,</i>

319
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,980
<i>when I'm done peeling the shell, my fingernails will be dirty.</i>

320
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,080
<i>Crab legs.</i>

321
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,280
<i>How will I eat the meat? The shell is too hard.</i>

322
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,170
<i>I'll just have some cake.</i>

323
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,180
<i>Will he think that I really love to eat sweets and think that I am really fat?</i>

324
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,180
<i>No way. I'll just eat some small snacks.</i>

325
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,680
<i>If I eat these, will it make my teeth black?</i>

326
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,380
<i>What should I eat?</i>

327
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,580
That's all you're eating?

328
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,780
I don't have a big appetite in the evenings, I only eat a little.

329
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,380
<i>She's still afraid of me.</i>

330
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,080
The lot of you, send two people over here.

331
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,880
Who is he calling for?

332
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,480
Boss, who are you calling?

What's wrong, Boss?

336
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,190
Are you full?

337
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,180
- I'm not full yet.
 - Wait, wait!

338
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,680
- We're basically full, just waiting for training.
 - If you're full then sit down, be a chat companion.

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,180
Sister-in-Law.

343
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,080
"Sister-in-Law"?

344
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,030
Not call "Sister-in-Law"... then call... call Sister-in-Law... then... then I'll call...

345
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,180
Then, what's your name, Sister-in-Law?

346
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,980
Just call me Tong Nian. Tong Nian.

 - Hi.

You're so pretty! Eat some more, Sister-in-Law!

Yeah!

- This I know!
 - Really?

359
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,380
- My classmate from before was one, too. It is very popular nowadays.
 - Really?

360
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,280
- Sister-in-Law, where can I search for your songs?
 - Yeah.

00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,380
Our boss is eating so calmly.

374
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,680
He doesn't even give Sister-in-Law a look!

Look! Sister-in-Law keeps staring at Boss.

376

379
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,300
Tong Sister-in-Law, I saw in your personal information that

380
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,180
you are majoring in bioengineering and electrical engineering.

381
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,180
Then, did you just start university?

382
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,260
Those are my double-majored Bachelor's degrees.

383
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,380
- I'm a graduate student right now.
 - Double-major?!

384
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,280
Then, when did you start university?

385
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,980
- When I was fifteen.
 - Fifteen?!

386
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,580
How come when I was fifteen I hadn't even graduated from junior high school...

387
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,380
Because universities have junior classes.

388
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,680
- Top student!
 - Top student! <i>
(T/N: literally means scholar tyrant)</i>

389
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,180
- Sister-in-Law, it's my dream to meet a female top student. Can you arrange it?
 - What do you mean?

390
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,380
Introduce one to me!

391
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,380
I can introduce one to you, that's not a problem. But they are all very focused on studying, so...

392
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,080
- Sister-in-Law! You must be great at gaming!
 - Yeah!

393
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,880
I am terrible at games, I don't know it at all.

394
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
How could that be? Boss has never played games with you?

395
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,080
Yeah! Boss?

From now on, you are not allowed to call her "Sister-in-Law" in the future.

403

- Boss, don't be mad. Boss, e-eat some more!
 - Boss.

404
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
- Then, we will leave first.
 - Then...

405
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,580

How did he get such an adorable chick?

430
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Maybe she doesn't like going out on dates and only enjoys going to the library 25/7.

431
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Plus, she went to university at fifteen; she's a super top student.

432
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,380
Maybe she purely likes spiritual love and attractions in personality?

00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,580
<i>At the same time, he used his legendary professional experience</i>

494
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,380
<i> to bear witness to China CTF's progress from nonexistence to prosperity.</i>

495
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,600
<i>Yet just as Team Solo won the CTF National Championship,</i>

496
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,780
<i>he suddenly announced his retirement.</i>

497
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,480
Announced his retirement?

498
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,780
<i> Since Gun's retirement, China's CTF has fallen into it's cold winter season.</i>

499
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,880
<i> Now, he has low-key returned as a top club's founder.</i>

500
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,980
He's so amazing! So amazing!

501
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,760
Lan Mei!

502
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Lan Mei! It's me!

503
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,080
Are you free?

504
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,480
I'm free.

505
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,780
- Oh... I'm sorry.
 - It's nothing!

506
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,100
- What are you doing?
 - Sit, sit!

507
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,080
What's going on?

508
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,580
I have a few questions regarding CTF. Can I ask your husband?

509
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,280
You really are interested in CTF now?

510
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,080
You can't even play Liangliangkan Game.
<i>(T/N: chinese pattern matching game)</i>

511
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,880
This person! Do you guys know this person?

512
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,680
- Husband! Come over quick. Who is this?
 - Coming.

513
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,080
- This person!
 - This person, wait up.

514
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,480
Holy! Isn't this my Gun God?

515
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
He is the male god of my lifetime!

516
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Today, it was only for him that I went to see the competition.

517
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,980
Have you guys seen the picture of him with his medals and trophy?

518
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,180
No, I haven't.

519
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,180
He was so handsome, no one could compare!

520
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,280
Ah yes, here! Let me show you!

521
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,280
There are videos of his legendary moments and exciting highlights of his competitions.

522
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,080
Reverse mining. This is my verifiable Gun God.

523
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,580
- Do you know what this is?
 - I don't know.

524
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,580
This... Once a legendary moment appears in a competition,

525
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,080
the competition's organizer will draw a light halo around the competitor's country on the map.

526
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,980
Isn't Han Shangyan from China?

527
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,580
Look at this map. It represents China's honor.

528
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:14,580
Do you know? All the people in the world can see Gun God's three halos.

529
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,980
Say, isn't my idol super awesome?

530
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,980
Awesome. Very awesome!

531
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,980
Husband, I can't believe you chase stars <i>(celebrities)</i>, too.

532
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,780
Of course. When it comes to my idol, even if I talked the whole night, it wouldn't be enough.

533
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,180
Tell me. What else do you want to know?

534
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,280
I want to ask about his dating experience.

535
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,880
Dating experience?

536
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,980
You want to hear gossip about him?

537
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,500
I want to hear them, too. He is such an amazing person.

538
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,680
His marks are even on the world map.

539
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,280
What type of girl does he like?

540
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,980
Hurry and tell us!

541
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,280
Let me think...

542
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:04,880
I'm not 100% sure about his dating experience.

543
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,980
Just that, back then, the CTF environment was really lacking in our country.

544
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,580
That time, Han Shangyan was the sole investor of Team Solo.

545
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,580
He was also a major player. This info is all on Baidu...

546
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,280
- How about this? I'll talk about stuff you can't find on Baidu.
 - Okay.

547
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,680
Thinking back, Team Solo was at its peak when they suddenly disbanded.

548
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,780
People said it was because the team captain, Solo, had an illegitimate daughter.

549
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,220
Resulting in his and the team's main offense, Appledog's breakup.

550
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,780
And that was why the team disbanded.

551
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,480
And there were people who also said that Han Shangyan was the third party involved in the Team Captain's relationship,

552
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,380
that he fell in love with Appledog, so the team disbanded.

553
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,880
So which saying is true?

554
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,580
I don't know. That's an unresolved matter.

555
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,980
So, there's a possibility that the girl Han Shangyan used to like was Appledog.

556
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,380
Nobody can say for sure.

557
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,780
Were they ever together?

558
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,480
Of course not! If they were together, then the matter wouldn't be considered unresolved.

559
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,180
I have one more question.

560
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,780
Is Appledog pretty?

561
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,780
She's pretty! She is definitely a good match for my male god.

562
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,580
But the most important part isn't whether she is pretty,

563
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,180
it's that her professional experiences are at the Goddess level.

564
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,710
Go search Baidu Baike.

565
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:21,580
You can either search Appledog or her real name Ai Qing.

566
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,780
Back then, there were two main offenses on Team Solo.
<i>[Baidu: Ai Qing]</i>

567
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,980
One man and one woman. The man was my Gun God and the woman was Appledog.
<i>[Ai Qing: Baidu it]</i>

568
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,680
Then they were a match made in heaven.
<i>(T/N: lit. golden boy and jade girl)</i>

569
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,280
That's pretty much the meaning.

570
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:43,280
So, some people say that Han Shangyan created K&K Club now to get back together with Appledog.

571
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,580
Get her back?
