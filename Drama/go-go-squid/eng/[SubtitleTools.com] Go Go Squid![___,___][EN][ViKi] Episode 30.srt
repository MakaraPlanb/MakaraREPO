<i>[Episode 30]</i>

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,250
I think everyone already knows me. We've competed in group matches and exhibition games.

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,050
So, I'll skip the self-introductions and get to business.

24
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,610
Let's talk about Team Buff, our adversary in the next semi-final.

25
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,300
I think you've already done deep research on this guy.

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,610
But point number 1:

27
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,450
you've never competed against each other in group matches.

28
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,440
Point number 2: they've been retired for 5 years,

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,530
and just re-entered the competition this year.

30
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,460
So there isn't much data on them.

31
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,080
But they used to be my opponent.

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,740
And this year, too, I competed against him in the group matches.

33
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,080
Trust me. My experiences can help everyone.

34
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,030
Buff is their assist.

35
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,690
Mina is their main offense.

36
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,810
And the other three assist with offense and defense. And then—

37
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,420
What else? We know all this.

38
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,540
I'm about to tell you something that you don't know.

39
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,670
Buff is actually someone who absolutely cannot lead. Did you know that?

40
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,520
Did you know that?

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,860
Even if he has great technical skills and overall outlook,

42
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,910
he can't handle it when others beat him.

43
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,790
When you beat him in a few problems, he starts to unravel and panic.

44
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,940
His need to win is the biggest downfall that he could never overcome,

45
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,980
especially since they turn 30 this year. They want to win so badly.

46
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,070
That means we already have a winning strategy.

47
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,140
And that is to push him. Pressure him! Pressure him to death!

48
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,670
I want that momentum of when Mars hit Earth!

49
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,890
I want to break his last defense!

50
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,270
Back then, that was your Boss's biggest strength.

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,450
Now, do you see Little Mi's real strength?

52
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,640
Now that we have him, we have the complete intel of all of the Chinese teams that are in his head.

53
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,630
He knows CTF's history of the last 10 years, backwards and forwards.

54
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,990
I know what you're thinking.

55
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,750
If you don't want his help,

56
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,290
then you can continue with your current attitude.

57
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,160
They also have a deadly weakness,

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,790
which is that their way of thinking is old-fashioned, as well as their strategies.

59
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,170
So... So does this mean that they've accepted Mi Shaofei?

60
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,040
This group of kids is pretty easy. They'll accept you as long as you can convince them.

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,870
I haven't asked you yet. Why did you come today?

62
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,410
I came to play with Squiddy! I haven't seen Squiddy for a long time.

63
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,870
Right, Squiddy?

64
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,770
Did you gain weight, Squiddy?

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,880
Did you miss me, Squiddy?

66
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,300
Aren't you about to start the semifinal matches?

67
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,990
Next Wednesday, we'll be in Shanghai, SP will be in Guangzhou.

68
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,200
Two teams in two cities will start battling at the same time.

69
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,620
You want to watch it?

70
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,760
You want tickets?

71
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,240
Do you have tickets?

72
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,150
Of course, I don't. These are really popular tickets.

73
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,150
There are no more tickets?

74
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:49,640
But... if you come with me, why would you need a ticket?

75
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,200
Then, what about Yaya? What if Yaya wants to go, too?

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,570
She can go ask Mi Shaofei.

77
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,390
Then, now are we...

78
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,930
Am I your...

79
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,190
What?

80
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,420
- Girlfriend.
- What else would you be?

81
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,830
Who does it like that?

82
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,220
You easily break up when you want to, and get back together when you want to.

83
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,270
Then, do we need a formal ceremony or something?

84
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,630
Tong Nian, do you want to...

85
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,620
kiss?

86
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,920

114

He's pulling down the average strength of the whole team.

116
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,950
At the moment, all those at the front of the ranking have their own teams.

117
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,170
We need to choose slowly.

118

We can't be slow anymore. You've got to know after I was replaced,

119

SP's average strength has risen a lot since the team tournament.

120
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,760
One step at a time.

121
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,580

What is it?

177
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,310
Sister-in-Law released a new song on NetEase Music.

178
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,760
Seriously?

179
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,600
It's already topping the charts!

180
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,020
It's true. As expected of Sister-in-Law.

181
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,730
It's just as hot here on Weibo.

182
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,620
Boss is getting a lot of shade.

183
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,260
What is the meaning behind this song title?

184
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,950
She's showing her love. Didn't she just come by?

185
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,390
She probably learned the truth about love.

186
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,370
B-Boss.

187
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,280

Why do you pick on me every time?

192
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,200
It's just Sister-in-Law showed off her love and we're happy for her.

Help me register.

199
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,410
Boss, you finally thought it through.

200
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,250
You made a NetEase account and now Weibo for Sister-in-Law?

201
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,290
I'll take care of it immediately.

202
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,230
He's actually going to sign up for Weibo.

203
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,110
No way...

204
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,750
Yaya! Chun Chun!

Come! Come! I have to show you this!

206
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,430

207
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,670
Han Shangyan has a Weibo now.

208
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,830
Wow!

224
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,220
Wow! This is like the industry's revelry!

225
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,540
I never thought he'd do this.

226
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,820
Why do you think he opened a Weibo account?

227
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,190
Was it to promote the club or to recruit people?

228
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,220
I don't know.

229
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,030
Your boyfriend opened a Weibo account and you didn't know about it?

230
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,060
I really didn't know.

231
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,530

Wow, Boss, you're amazing.

It's been three years and I only have 60k.

243
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,430
The king has returned. This amount of fans is considered small.

244
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,050
Just wait a few days and it'll grow to who knows how high.

Didn't you just release a new song?

00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,070
Right? My comments are usually 1k, why 30k+ today?

Wait! I want to say...

306
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,240
For me, you signed up for Weibo,

310
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,330
How about I make something for you?

311
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,360
I will help you put in a facial recognition system.

312
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,630
Then, you don't need a room card to enter or leave the building. Also...

313
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,260
Half of a minute is gone.

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,940
What is the feeling?

319
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,950
You understand.

320
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,240
I understand.

321
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,710
This feeling is... so good.

322
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,070
Let's hang up.

323
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,850
Right now?

324
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,200
Then okay. But you should hang up first.

325
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,190
