26
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,330
Is he all right?

27
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,560
He's still alive.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,380
If your idol's fine, I'm going back to school now.

Han Shangyan's being a jerk again?

30
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,810
Today's special, so Han Shangyan might say a few rude words.

31
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,520
It's because of me. Don't mind it, Tong Nian.

32
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,980
What's this? Let's talk.

33
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,130
All right, all right. Don't cry, don't cry.

34
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,380
Don't cry, okay? Don't cry.

35
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,580
Are you all right?

36
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,660
Are you all right? You...

37
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,380
You take good care of your idol.

38
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,170
I'm going back to school by myself.

39
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,100
Hold on, Idol. Hold on.

40
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,760
Nian Nian!

41
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,630

Nian Nian! Tong Nian!

43
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,300
Slow down!

44
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,050
Okay, okay. Don't run, don't run.

45
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,100
So, what did he tell you?

46
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,050
He said...

47
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,790
He said he went to Norway for matchmaking.

48
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,280
Matchmaking?

49
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,550
- He was teasing you!
- He wasn't!

50
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,130
It's true.

51
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,490
All right, all right. Don't cry, don't cry.

52
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,300
It's true. He went to Norway for matchmaking.

53
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,870
It can't be. He must have been drunk and speaking nonsense, and then...

54
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,380
Don't believe him.

55
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,190
Be good, don't cry.

56
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,350
Are you all right?

57
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,180
Do you need help?

58
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,370
<i>I'm still alive!</i>

59
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,560
You're this drunk, and you're "still alive."

60
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,910
I held it in for half an hour. Now that it's out, I feel much better.

61
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,990
Heartburn.

62
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,000
What were you holding in?

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,040
What a question! Can you throw up in front of a girl?

64
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,520
I didn't know you cared this much about your pride.

65
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,040
Do you think that everyone is like you? With such a pretty face,

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,220
whatever you do, girls will never hate you.

67
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,010
How is it? Did you bully her?

68
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,370
Even if you're in a bad mood, you shouldn't get mad at a girl. Aren't you a man?

69
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,270
It isn't as you think.

70
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,190
Then, talk.

71
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,330
Come on, talk.

72
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,540
Her parents don't like me.

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,350
Our families have a pretty good relationship.

74
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,250
They know about every bad thing I've done since I was little.

75
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,270
I was thinking carefully about it the other day. I did a bunch of bad things.

76
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,560
I can't really blame them for looking down on me.

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,620
You surrendered?

78
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,720
When did you ever see me surrender?

79
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,790
Never.

80
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,380
I just think there's no need.

81
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,580
Their whole family was always in such harmony.

82
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,820
There's no need to make them unhappy because of me.

83
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,780
Just to be with me, it's not worth it.

84
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,510
Who says it's not worth it?

85
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,540
You, Han Shangyan, deserve the best friends and the best wife!

86
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,680
We haven't gotten to that level. Don't keep saying "wife" here and there.

87
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,920
Pretense.

88
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,450
You can't help but miss her?

89
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,410
Substitute driver!

90
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,780
Oh, a substitute driver, a substitute driver.

91
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,640
What is it? How come we aren't going?

92
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,670
How about we stay here and wait for them? They drank too much.

93
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,850
What if they drive under the influence?

94
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,650
All right, then let's wait for them.

95
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,300
Have a good talk with her.

96
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,870
- I'll do it.
- Get in the car.

97
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,930
Why are you two still here?

98
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,420
We're so drunk, we can't take you two home.

99
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,760
There's no need to take us.

100
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,800
We were afraid it wouldn't be safe for you to drive drunk,

101
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,160
This doesn't concern you.

102
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,800
Thank you.

103
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,800
Hello. Excuse me, are you Mr. Han?

104
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,870
Yes.

105
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,050
I am the substitute driver you called.

106
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,270
How about... I wait for a moment?

107
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,810
No need. We're going to Jiaodong University.

108
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,210
No need! I can get a taxi on my own.

109
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,790
Nian Nian! Nian Nian!

110
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,060
Tong Nian! Don't go.

111
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,450
This... is too far out. It isn't easy to get a taxi. Let's go with them.

112
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,930
I don't want to.

113
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,520
You... look, they're drunk.

114
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,590
They're so drunk. What if they meet some bad guys?

115
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,490
Let's go back to town with them. Once we're in the city, there won't be any need to fear bad guys.

116
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,010
The two of them look like that. They're the ones who look like bad guys.

117
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,080
But... what if they fall asleep?

118
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,870
What if they get dragged to a mountain ditch and get robbed and abused?

119
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,350
Come on... Be good. Let's go together. Okay?

120
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,570
Let's go, let's go.

121
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,100
Let's go.

122
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,720
Get in the car.

123
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,850
You sit behind. You sit behind, I'll sit in the front.

124
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,100
Get in the car.

125
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,690
Right now, I'm the only one with a clear head.

126
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,260
Thank you.

127
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,560
Can you stop squeezing Tong Nian?

128
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,200
Don't be sad.

129
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,460
It's not worth it to be sad for me.

130
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,750
A guy like me... I have a bad temper, I yell at people,

131
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,130
I'm not romantic, and I have no time to spend with you.

132
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,000
Never mind all of that.

133
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,300
The most important thing is that I'm fickle.

134
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,900
Someone else called me to a matchmaking date. I couldn't help myself and went.

135
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,110
No need to cling onto a guy like me.

136
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:41,190
Not to mention, is it that in your life, aside from love,

137
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,930
there's nothing else to take seriously?

138
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm leaving. I'm so drunk that my head aches.

Yeah.

161
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,030
Tell me what you need. If there's nothing, I'm going to bed.

162
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,120
There is, and it's very troublesome.

She heard you would come back tomorrow.

167
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,330
So, she said she'd guard this place starting from tomorrow morning and she won't leave no matter what, right?

168

173
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:01,120
No, Boss. Also, Demo, he's been worried all day and has been in your room.

174
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,540
He said he'd beg for your help when you got back.

175
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,800
Boss.

176
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Stop crying now, you've cried all day.

177
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,570
Boss is back, don't cry.

178
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,580
Don't yell at him. He's cried the entire day.

179
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,180
He's a little kid... Just comfort him.

180
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,240
What's there to cry about?

181
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,460
Are you still a man?

182
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,620
I'm so pitiful and you're still yelling at me.

183
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,400
There are way more pitiful people than you today.

184
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,110
No one cried so much like you.

185
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,460
Who else is more pitiful?

186
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,970
An older guy who waited a good portion of his life to finally make his CTF comeback

187
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,890
was forced to retire because his scores weren't good enough.

188
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,970
Tell me. Isn't that pitiful?

189
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,780
Any more?

190
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,990
What is there to cry about?

191
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,730
Boss, I'm really stressed out.

192
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,410
My ranking isn't going up and I'm scared of dragging the team down.

193
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,090
My parents divorced and my mom doesn't support me.

194
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,960
She came today and swore she'd take me back.

195
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,710
Also, she said staying here has no future.

196
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,140
She knows you're coming back tomorrow. She'll definitely cause a ruckus.

197
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,140
You can't bear it?

198
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,190
No...

199
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,560
If you haven't fallen,

200
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,060
then keep bearing it.

201
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,530
Do you hear me?

202
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000

203
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,570
Auntie, drink some water.

204
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,290
- Hello, Auntie.
- Hello, Auntie.

205
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,160
Auntie, I'm on the same team as Dai Feng. I'm the vice captain.

206
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,550
Me, too. Dai Feng usually calls me older brother.

207
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,290
Hurry and say it.

208
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,250
Auntie, Dai Feng mentions you often. He misses home a lot.

209
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,480
Right. Dai Feng is the youngest on our team.

210
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,310
His eyes are filled with tears when you are brought up.

211
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,970
Auntie, you may have a deep misunderstanding towards our profession and club.

212
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,790
Right, right. But that's normal.

213
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,640
Many people misunderstand our profession.

214
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,550
You two, have you graduated from college?

215
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,550
Yes.

216
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,920
Yes. Auntie, I'm part of Project 985.

217
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,520
He's even better. He graduated from a famous college!

218
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,860
So, the two of you can waste your time and play around.

219
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,240
But Dai Feng is not the same. He only graduated from a vocational school.

220
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,530
If he doesn't start working now and gain work experience,

221
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,160
later on, he will have even more bleak prospects.

222
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,130
Auntie, I think you're just quibbling now.

223
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,010
Um... Dai Feng isn't playing.

224
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,880
Right, we're all professionals. This is a proper career.

225
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,630
It's just a little uncommon.

226
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:43,630
However, like swimmers and diving athletes, we have to practice daily and compete.

227
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,240
- Right, Auntie. Winning the competition comes with award money.
- Right.

228
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,520
We get monthly salaries.

229
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,490
I'm asking you. How many years will this last?

230
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,190
- Can you make it until thirty?
- But...

231
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,720
This profession is our dream, right?

232
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,700
Then, can you live off your dream?

233
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,490
Anything works.

234
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,550
- For example, going to an internet company or developing a software.
- Yeah.

235
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,800
Your company has more than twenty kids.

236
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,080
Can you all go to an internet company?

237
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,710
Can you all develop software?

238
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,750
Do you all have a backup plan?

239
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,630
I think that's only a small portion!

240
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,940
Tricking me.

241
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,840
Your honorable mother has outstanding debating abilities.

242
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,090
Her attacking prowess is much too strong.

243
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,790
We couldn't do much. Just wait for Boss.

244
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,010
Little Han.

245
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,700
Little Han.

246
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,140
Mrs. Dai came again.

247
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,950
She has waited for a while.

248
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,190
Are you still feeling unwell? Get up.

249
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,150
Here, have some sugar water and sober up.

250
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,300
Should I tell her to go back?

251
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,970
Auntie, prepare my suit.

252
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,160
Okay.

253
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,160
Mom, just eat some.

254
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,310
Look how well I eat here. My living conditions are great, too.

255
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,660
You really don't have to worry.

256
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,910
Mom.

257
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:21,730
Hello, Auntie. I'm this club's boss, Han Shangyan.

258
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,800
Hello.

259
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,500
Auntie, have you eaten?

260
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,230
I'm not hungry.

261
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,660
It seems the food doesn't suit your taste.

262
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,280
I just came back.

263
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,350
If it's convenient, I can invite you to have a meal and chat.

264
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,750
That... You don't have to spend any money, Mr. Han.

265
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,690
Let's just talk here.

266
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,360
Since this is our first time meeting, please allow me to perform the duties of a host.

267
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,350
Yeah, Mom. Just have a meal.

268
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,860
I'm telling you, Son. You have to come home with me no matter what.

269
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,320
Mom, let's go in and eat first.

270
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,190
Do something normal at a young age!

271
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,630
Don't think because your boss invited me out for a meal that I'm agreeing with you.

272
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,000
No way! I'm not eating.

273
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,640
Mom...

274
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,740
I'm so frustrated.

275
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:17,020
Auntie, the food's here. Let's talk while eating.

276
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,020
Talk while eating... Let's go eat first.

277
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,020
Mister Han, honestly,

278
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,880
this time, I came to take my son away.

279
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,370
Auntie, I understand your request.

280
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,070
This isn't my first time facing this situation, and it won't be my last.

281
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,400
How about letting me speak first?

282
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,130
Okay.

283
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,400
I also started out as a CTF contestant.

284
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,360
I've been in the industry for ten years.

285
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,880
I witnessed the transformation of the industry from a barren beginning to the current flourishing state.

286
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,360
Did you play with computers when you were young, too?

287
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,310
The correct term is "Cybersecurity Competition."

288
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,700
What competition? I don't understand.

289
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,010
We are all government-sanctioned cybersecurity contestants.

290
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,200
This is our profession.

291
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,830
Should I continue?

292
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,200
All right.

293
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,030
Because I was originally a CTF competitor,

294
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,520
I understand your concerns very well.

295
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,930
I am fully in charge of our club's Chinese branch.

296
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:39,800
I personally vetted and signed every contestant, including Dai Feng.

297
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,770
I believe that he has a lot of ability and potential.

298
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,300
I don't just hope he can compete,

299
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,210
but I also hope he can stand on the tallest podium stand,

300
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,240
to put on our country's flag and have the national anthem played for him.

301
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,390
Mister Han, your team manager already told me that this afternoon,

302
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,440
but I need to consider his future.

303
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,120
There's only one world champion. Also, I know my son.

304
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,940
He doesn't have that talent.

305
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,580
No, he does.

306
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,450
His ranking is in the 70s!

307
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,720
But that's his international ranking.

308
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,460
Although he's the youngest, he has a lot of potential.

309
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,100
Our event is team-based.

310
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:31,170
Even though individual ranking is important, we need to look at the entire team's performance.

311
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,240
I really admire this group of kids.

312
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,950
I think the five of them have the ability to win the championship.

313
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:52,060
Okay, Auntie. Let's not talk about dreams. Let's discuss more practical issues.

314
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,940
Let's take stock of this situation from your perspective. Dai Feng graduated from a vocational high school.

315
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,720
Even if he starts working now, he will hit a plateau.

316
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,490
Let's say he starts working now. If he works for thirty years until he's fifty years old,

317
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,960
what do you think his final income will be?

318
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,210
How could I calculate this right now?

319
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,870
I can sign an agreement with you right now.

320
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,970
Before he reaches thirty, if the total sum of his salary, award money, and sponsorship bonuses

321
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,360
can't reach that final income, I'll pay the rest myself.

322
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,340
Boss, I won't sign it.

323
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,040
Even the captain doesn't get this treatment.

324
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,620
If you know your treatment is different, then work hard.

325
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,610
Auntie, it's black words on white paper. I will not and cannot renege.

326
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,220
When we return to the club later, I will ask the manager to write up this contract immediately.

327
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,840
Once signed, you can take that home. How is that?

328
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,400
Mr. Han, can your club make a lot of money from these kids?

329
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,560
The Chinese branch has been established for two years now and is still currently in a deficit.

330
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,140
Then, why are you doing this? My son is not even the best one.

331
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,610
What is the benefit for you to keep him?

332
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,620
There's no benefit to me at all.

333
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,790
But to him, there's a huge benefit.

334
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,000
I once had a best buddy who asked me if I had a dream.

335
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,700
I told him, "Yes. I want to get the championship.

336
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,360
I want to get a world championship for China."

337
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,060
Money is surely important

338
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,640
because it can give you a great lifestyle,

339
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,260
but people become great because of their dreams.

340
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,560
This group of kids has a dream. Also, what is rare is that they are working hard for their dream.

341
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,690
Therefore, my dream still remains the same.

342
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,470

Boss, how was it? How was your discussion with Mrs. Dai?

347
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,310
Have you seen Boss in a suit before?

348
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,960
I don't think I have.

351
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,590
- Boss! Boss!
- What's wrong, Boss?

352
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,510
Are you all right, Boss?

353
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,440
What is bothering you?

354
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,410
I am all right.

355
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,440
Should I call for the doctor?

356
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,350
I am all right. You two go do your drills. Don't bother with me.

357
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,330
How can we practice when you are like this?

358
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,850
If you two have the time to be here, it's better if you go practice. Don't waste time here.

359
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,960
Boss, practicing is not as important as your health.

360
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,760
Scram.

361
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,140
- If you need us, call us, Boss!
- We're just downstairs.

362
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,240
I got it.

363
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,100
Come in.

364
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,200
Boss, why are you up so early?

365
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,010
If you aren't feeling well, you should sleep for a while longer.

366
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,340
I brought this for you. I heard if you rub some on your temples, it will make you feel better.

367
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,470
Do you want to try it out?

368
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,940
No need. I am fine.

369
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,210
I am not that weak.

370
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,590
Then, I'll put it here for you.

371
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,790
When you think of it, you can rub it on.

372
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,530
Boss, thank you.

373
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,180
I didn't think that while you were sick, you would bear with it to go see my mom.

374
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,830
If there's nothing else, go practice; don't waste time here.

375
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,960
Remember to apply this!

376
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,290
The contract with Dai Feng's mom has been signed. Take a look.

377
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,600
No need. Just put it here.

378
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,130
I need to leave, but I'm still worried about you guys.

379
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,000
Just go home if you need to.

00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,780

Hello. This is Han Shangyan. Do you still remember?

388
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,510
Of course, I remember! Gun God!

389
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,100
Of course, I remember you, my male god! Tell me. What's up?

390
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,950
Wife! Wife! When we go in, let's talk nicely, okay? I'm begging you!

391
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,170
Why?

392
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,540
He's here to catch up with me!

393
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,210
If not for Tong Nian, would you have even met him? Catch up with you? What kind of friendship could you two possibly have?

394
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,490
No, no, no! Wife! I beg you! I beg you! Save me some face later, okay?

395
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:43,020
He didn't even tell you to come, and you came anyway. I don't even know how to explain to him later!

396
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,790
I'm telling you. He definitely dumped Tong Nian.

397
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,350
Now he is feeling bored and wants to see how miserable Tong Nian is, you know?

398
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,640
How long have the two of them known each other? Three months?

399
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,360
At most three months, and how many times have they broken up? Twice. How can I not be mad?

400
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,300
Don't be mad. Don't be mad. Let's not be mad! Calm down!

401
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,930
How about this? When we go in later, just pretend like we are spying on the enemy. Okay?

402
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,570
Don't be mad. Let's go! Go. We're going to be late! Go, go, go!

403
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,530
- I'm going to die of anger.
- Don't be mad!

404
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:11,900
Male god, sorry! We're late, we're late. Sorry.

405
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,540
No worries. Besides, I have nothing else today.

406
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,030
Take a look at what you want to drink.

407
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,970
Wife, what do you want to drink?

408
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,780
Whatever tastes bitter, get me one of that.

409
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,230
Waiter! One espresso and one cappuccino.

410
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,210
I'm drinking something bitter and you dare to drink something sweet?

411
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,540
Then... Two cups of espresso.

412
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,290
Right. Male god, you said on the phone that you have a favor to ask of me.

413
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,670
Me and Tong Nian... I'm sure you guys already know.

414
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:52,850
I want to ask you guys to take care of her and spend more time with her.

415
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,140
Us spending time with her is because of our friendship. We don't need you to tell us.

416
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,600
If you feel sorry towards her, then make it up for yourself.

417
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,540
Help me give this to Tong Nian.

418
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,450
What is this?

419
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,720
So little?

420
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,270
There is ¥2,000 <i>(US$290)</i> in there. It's not a lot. Please do not tell her.

421
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:22,910
Whatever she wants to eat, bring her to go eat it. Whatever she wants, buy it for her in your name.

422
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,990
I just want her to be a little happier.

423
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,270
A break-up fee? This is too small of a sum, no?

424
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:33,460
You're the owner of a club. How can you be so stingy?

425
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,120
This is all the savings on my card. Once I have more, I'll give it to you.

426
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,030
Even if it's not a lot of money, it's the thought that counts! Isn't it pretty good to have a meal together? I'll help you give it to her.

427
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:46,300
What are you doing? Does Little Squid need a meal like this?

428
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,680
Your families are close, so you should know that her family's financially well-off.

429
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,700
She also earns a lot on her own. What her lab pays her is a lot more compared to this.

430
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,630
Whether she lacks money is her business, whether I give her money is my business.

431
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,190
Is this how you send away all your girlfriends?

432
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,540
¥2,000 per person?

433
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:09,150
Other than her, I've never had a girlfriend before.

434
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,170
Never? Ask him quick!

435
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,820
Please excuse me for asking...

436
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,210
You've only had one girlfriend? Then, why do you keep breaking up?

437
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,890
The way I see it, it's not good to keep breaking up.

438
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,390
Breaking up damages the relationship.

439
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,280
Or do you have a reason that you can't tell others?

440
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,250
Or... you regret it, and want to get back together with her?

441
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

442
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,710
I don't want to at all.

443
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,870
Hello, here is your coffee.

444
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,910
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

445
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,290
Which game is he playing?

446
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,560
Why don't I get it?

447
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:07,440
Say... does he want to go through you to let Tong Nian know?

448
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,210
Oh right. Did you hear it wrong?

449
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,210
Was it Tong Nian who dumped him?

450
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,780
There's no way I heard that wrong.

451
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,760
- No, I must ask her.
- Wait.

452
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,850
Sit down! Didn't you just agree to not say anything?

453
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,380
It's not like I signed a contract!

454
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,190
I don't care. I'll, of course, tell her.

455
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,990
Hey! Tell the truth! Did you suggest the breakup?

456
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,450
Can I not talk about this?

457
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,890
No!

458
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,910
Quickly, spill. Was it you?

459
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:37,120
I already said I don't want to talk about it.

460
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,110
- Let me show you something.
- What?

461
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,300
This is what Han Shangyan gave you.

462
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,350
- What did he give me?
- Break up fee.

463
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,860
But it's only ¥2,000, not a lot.

464
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,770
Who knows if he's really poor or if he's just pretending.

465
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,380
He gave you money and you accepted it?!

466
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,570
Of course, I accepted it. I needed to show you!

467
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,630
Otherwise, who would believe it?

468
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,930
Has he done something unforgivable to you?

469
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,150
Of course not. I'm going to return it to him.

470
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,360
No! You can't! I agreed to not tell you.

471
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,650
Please! You already accepted the money.

472
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,660
Do you think he's an idiot?

473
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,320
How can he not know that I'd know?

474
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,650
Hey! How would I know?

475
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,650
I'm not as smart as you.

476
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,050
97, I'm coming to your club right now.

477
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,590
Is your boss there?

478
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,090
What?

479
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,920
Boss didn't tell you? We are going to Beijing this afternoon to compete.

480
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,530
We're at the airport checking in right now.

481
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,410
He didn't tell me. Which airport are you guys at right now?

482
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,440
Thank you! Thanks!

483
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,500
Sister-in-Law is here. Sister-in-Law!

484
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,570
Sister-in-Law! Sit!

485
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:10,050
Why are you standing there? Come sit, Sister-in-Law.

486
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,390
Come, sit.

487
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,420
Boss, she's looking for you.

488
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Did you tell her to come?

489
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,610
No, she was looking for you, so I told her we were at the airport.

490
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,960
Can I speak with you alone?

491
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,390
Then, we'll head out first.

492
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,070
No need.

493
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,750
We'll go out.

494
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,990
Why does the atmosphere feel weird?

495
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,610
What is this situation?

496
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,270
Speak.

497
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,290
Why did you give money to Lan Mei and call it a break-up fee?

498
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,480
If that's how you want to think about it, then fine.

499
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,280
Previously, didn't you say that

500
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,280
we were just getting to know each other?

501
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,970
I am a man with morals.

502
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,820
If I should compensate for something, I will.

503
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,130
Then, why didn't you directly give it to me and instead asked Lan Mei to keep it a secret from me?

504
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,860
I think Lan Mei misunderstood.

505
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,010
I originally wanted her to give it to you.

506
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:35,270
Since it's a break-up fee, why shouldn't you know about it?

507
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,840
I also thought it was weird.

508
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:49,540
I think, Lan Mei framed it that way to make you happy.

509
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:54,250
Or perhaps, she misunderstood my intent from the start.

511

What else did Lan Mei tell you?

512
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,650
Nothing.

513
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,120
The misunderstanding is cleared now.

514
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,080
You should go back.

515
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,890

Han Shangyan, although our time together was short,

517
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,260
during this time, I've been very happy.

518
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,930
You are my first boyfriend.

519

Although you say we aren't compatible

520
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,930

521
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:49,380
I think that your attitude regarding relationships is improper,

- No, it's all right, 97.

I can get a ride myself. Don't worry about me.
