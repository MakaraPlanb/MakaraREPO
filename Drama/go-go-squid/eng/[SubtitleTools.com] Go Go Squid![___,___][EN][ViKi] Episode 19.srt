22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,190
I just can't bear to see you get scammed.

23
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,970
Who knows if your boyfriend really knows CTF?

24
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,440
He knows! He is actually a pro at CTF.

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,850
He is especially good at CTF.

26
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,090
How good?

27
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,980
I just know that online he's rated as the Grand Master Level.

28
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,980
Grand... He really can talk big.

29
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,960
But he is.

30
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,420
The Grand Master Level is usually used to address someone who started a trend of the industry,

31
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,380
expanded the CTF market in China, and left behind numerous legendary tournament results.

32
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,550
Only those people can be called that.

33
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,380
In the past ten years, there are only less than twenty people who can be called "Grand Master."

34
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,390
Did you know?

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,930
I know. He's always been really good.

36
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,760
Anyone at the Grand Master Level has gone down in history.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,910
For example, Harekaze and Richard Stallman.
<i>(T/N: Harekaze: Japanese CTF team. Stallman: programmer and founder of the GNU project)</i>

38
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,170
Of course, there are a lot that came from China, too.

39
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,350
It's just that at that time, Europe was stronger.

40
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,170
But we also had really good teams.

41
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,610
They are great; very great.

42
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,370
The most important thing is that their contribution is not limited to a single event,

43
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,150
but they were able to create a sensation for CTF in the country.

44
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,020
Basically, they are the first of their kind.

45
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,120
You are talking about Team Solo, right?

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,340
That's right! It's Team Solo!

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,490
You didn't know, but all of them in the team were my childhood idols.

48
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,950
Little Mi, Gun, Solo, Appledog, and All!

49
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,700
I didn't know that you liked them.

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,380
Nian Nian, in my lifetime, I must be able to see them. I must!

51
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,750
They are the team that lit up my dream.

52
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,130
My boyfriend is Gun.

53
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,010
What did you say?

54
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,550
My boyfriend is Gun.

55
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,470
I didn't know you liked them before, so I never told you.

56
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,200
<i>This old man. Even if you want to talk big, pick someone that's easier to impersonate.</i>

57
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,280
What a coincidence!

58
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,390
<i>Calm down! Calm down! This kid has always been silly.</i>

59
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,540
<i>Besides studying, she is silly at everything else. I can't blame her.</i>

60
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,590
Oh right! That internet cafe old man of yours. No, that's not it.

61
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,700
Gun. When are you meeting him online?

62
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,120
9:00. 9:00 every night is his rest time.

63
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,150
Okay. Let me prepare a bit.

64
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,720
I will accompany you to chat with them online.

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,350
<i>Let me expose you tonight. You imposter old man.</i>

66

67
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,520
Do you think what Boss is doing is considered an abuse of authority?

68
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,540
Come on. Complaining so much just because you have to play with Sister-in-Law a bit?

69
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,690
I don't see you complaining when Boss helps you increase your rank.

70
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,510
Brother 97, I am nervous.

71
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,660
What's there to be nervous about? Let me play you a song to calm you down.

72
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,280
I haven't played with Boss in so long.

73
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,750
You can understand these feelings, right?

74
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,600
Here, have one.

75
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,130
- What song?
- This one.

76
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,360
How is it? I really like this song.

77
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,460
It is quite good.

78
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,920
But I am still nervous.

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,380
Tell me. What if Boss finds out that I didn't improve, but instead got worse?

80
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,460
Did you get worse?

81
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,040
I remember that your rank went up.

82
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,610
- Competing with Boss, everyone is getting worse.
- That's right.

83
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,080
Right, Little Demo?

84
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,260
At a time like this, don't mock me like this. Okay?

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,660
Is Sister-in-Law online?

86
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,060
Go take a look.

87
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,890
I will invite Sister-in-Law to come online.

88
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,580
<i>[Connected to room]

89
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,320
Take a look. I invited you.

90
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,960
Grunt? 97? Demo?

91
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,480
What's wrong? Who are they?

92
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,840
You won't understand even if I tell you.

93
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,700
Nian Nian...

94
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,410
Yaya, remember, if we are playing games later, you must help me. It's like I am handicapped!

95
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,350
I don't know how to play. I am especially nervous!

96
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,270
In front of these few people, everyone is handicapped.

97
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,350
<i>[Lolicat:] You are all here. My roommate wants to play, too. Is that okay?</i>

98
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,910
Sister-in-Law has a roommate who wants to play, too?

99
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,630
No problem. As long as they are beauties, it's okay.

100
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,470
Now you only look at faces and not skills?

101
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,940
<i>[Grunt: No problem, we welcome beauties.]</i>

102
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,250
<i>No problem, we welcome beauties.</i>

103
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,340
Then let me greet Sister-in-Law first.

104
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,050
<i>[Demo:] Hi, Sister-in-Law.</i>

105
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,110
<i>[97:] Just directly voice chat, Sister-in-Law. There is a button for a microphone on the side; turn it on.</i>

106
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,060
Yaya, put your headphones in. They opened a voice chat.

107
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,270
Oh, okay.

108
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,420
<i>Hello.</i>

109
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,970
I already took a look at the strategy guide just now, but I will still play very poorly.

110
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,730
Please don't scorn me.

111
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,890
But don't worry. Even though my roommate is a girl, she is really good at playing.

112
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,230
She started playing when she was in middle school. She might be better than you all.

113
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,110
<i>Please stop complimenting me, okay?</i>

114
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,580
<i>Compared to pro-levels online, especially ones from a top-ranked club like K&K,</i>

115
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,820
<i>I'm the greatest trash ever seen.</i>

116
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,680
Sister-in-Law's classmate, hello.

117
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,530
<i>Hello! Hi....</i>

118
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,480
<i>This is our first time playing together. Please take care of me.</i>

119
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,840
You guys, please take care of me, too.

120
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,000
<i>Sister-in-Law, don't worry. Boss is with us.</i>

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,500
<i>There definitely, absolutely will be no interferences.</i>

122
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,770
That's right. As soon as we ended training, Boss dragged us here.

123
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,050
<i>Then...</i>

124
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,960
You guys are really from K&K?

125
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,580
For now, yes.

126
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,410
But maybe if one day SP offers more money, <i>I will jump ship.</i>

127
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,720
Stop lying. Do you dare jump ship?

128
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
I am just kidding.

129
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,210
Sister-in-Law, Boss is here.

130
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,570
Boss, <i>Sister-in-law is online. She brought a classmate with her.</i>

131
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,200
Is Han Shangyan there?

132
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,960
Who told you guys to turn on the mic?

133
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,560
<i>Sister-in-Law said she wanted to introduce a girlfriend to me, so we opened the mic to chat a bit.</i>

134
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,340
Turn it off.

135
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,140
Old Han is jealous.

136
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,670
Turn it off. Boss, I turned it off.

137
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:45,400
<i>[Steam - Account name: gun]
[Password]</i>

138
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,600
They turned the mic off.

139
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,890
Then let's turn ours off, too.

140
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:58,510
Yaya, did I tell 97 that I wanted to introduce a girl to him as a girlfriend?

141
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,330
No.

142
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,340
That's strange.

143
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,970
Boss, since you are here, I will exit.

144
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,080
You guys enjoy and play.

145
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,980
Enjoy and play.

146
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,120
Boss, I invited you to come online.

147
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,610
Okay.

148
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,020
Hurry! We are entering!

149
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,680
<i>Which gun should I choose?</i>

150
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,320
<i>Whichever.</i>

151
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,580
<i>Which one is good to cooperate with you?</i>

152
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,560
<i>A dagger, to simplify things.</i>

153
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,480
<i>Okay.</i>

154
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,090
Your boyfriend is really Gun?

155
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,390
Of course.

156
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,330
See? I didn't lie to you before.

157
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,580
He is really good at playing on the computer.

158
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,170
How can you describe him as "good"? That adjective is so weak.

159
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,730
How would I know? I've never played these things before.

160
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,780
I don't know which word to use to describe him.

161
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,670
I have always thought that Solo and Appledog were a couple,

162
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,170
and that Gun was the intruder...

163
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,730
Don't say these things in the future anymore. Rumors spread, you know?

164
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,230
If anyone else tells you something like that in the future, explain for me.

165
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,990
No problem.

166
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,720
I have always thought that he would like someone who plays CTF really well.

167
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,850
Turns out, he doesn't care at all if his girlfriend knows how to play CTF.

168
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,040
Wait. How come you didn't buy anything and are just holding a dagger?

169
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,790
What do you know?

170
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,180
This was decided after I asked him about it.

171
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,740
He said that daggers suit me the best.

172
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,870
What kind of gaming method is this?

173
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,640
I don't know either, but it must be a pro-level kind of method.

174
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,190
Let's stop chatting. The game is starting!

175
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,230
Yaya, I'm going to open a private conversation.

176
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,750
Open it, open it. I have no time to listen in on you.

177
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,560
Can you hear me speaking?

178
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,870
I can. Follow my instructions.

179
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,500
How come you're coughing?

180
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,920
It's nothing. I had too many candies.

181
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,500
Can you see the boxes ahead?

182
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,900
I see them.

183
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,970
Go there and practice.

184
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,920
<i>You see those boxes over there?</i>

185
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,040
<i>- Go there and practice.
- Okay.</i>

186
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,490
<i>W is forward, spacebar is jump.</i>

187
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,630
<i>Pressing them together is jump forward.</i>

188
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,560
<i>I'm starting.</i>

189
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,760
<i>Oh right. If I practice like this, won't someone ambush me?</i>

190
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,720
<i>No worries.</i>

191
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,950
<i>I'm watching out for you.</i>

192
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,750
<i>Got it!</i>

193
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,010
<i>The boxes are a little unsteady.</i>

194
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,830
<i>Will you get annoyed that I'm learning so slowly?</i>

195
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,390
<i>I won't.</i>

196
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,170
<i>Really?</i>

197
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,920
<i>Anyway, I never expected you to learn.</i>

198
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,830
<i>Then, why are you teaching me?</i>

199
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,020
<i>Killing time.</i>

200
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,910
<i>Go on.</i>

201
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,930
<i>Got it.</i>

202
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,120
<i>My shoetie got untied. </i>

203
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:34,330
<i> Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki

204
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,320
What's that silly face you're both making?

205
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,570
Even if I told you, you wouldn't get it.

206
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,140
Nian Nian, how did you meet him exactly?

207
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,910
Didn't I just tell you all about it?

208
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,500
You didn't!

209
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,820
What did you tell me?

210
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,550
I just... I just told you!

211
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,340
I said I met him at the internet cafe.

212
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,510
- Internet cafe?
- Yeah.

213
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,080
What year is this?

214
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,740
If he wants to go online, can't he do it in his office? Why would he go to an internet cafe?

215
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,550
You're right. I don't understand it either. It's so weird.

216
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,670
Doesn't matter, it doesn't. Anyway, everything I told you earlier is true, you know?

217
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,600
I know!

218
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,790
I'm telling you! When I first started liking them, I was still in middle school.

219
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,780
I liked them along with my cousin.

220
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,830
CTF isn't the only reason why I like them.

221
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,290
How do I say this...

222
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,770
When I was little, my parents were often away, so I lived at school most of the time.

223
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,210
At that time, I was a little silly.

224
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,880
Even now, you're not that smart either!

225
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,670
No! I mean... I was the kind who wouldn't talk much; very introverted.

226
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,690
And then I was often bullied.

227
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,520
Later on, I watched their matches.

228
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,510
At that time, the environment wasn't good; the world at large didn't understand.

229
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:02,120
It felt like they were lonely soldiers fighting alone.

230
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,530
Do you know that feeling?

231
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,300
I understand that feeling.

232
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,080
Right? Right? You understand?

233
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,510
At that time, I liked them just like how a little girl likes her idol

234
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,320
because they could do something I dared not do or even think of.

235
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,630
At that time, seeing them fight in competitions gave me energy even when I studied because I thought,

236
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,190
"My idols are so formidable, so great! I can't be slacking either!"

237
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,430
So my grades became better and better.

238
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,610
Yaya, you'd matured so early back then!

239
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,690
At that time, I was still little. I had no idea who they were.

240
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,690
You're the one who matured early. But, Nian Nian, it's really a pity.

241
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,690
You didn't get to see Gun God at the top of his glory.

242
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,810
You know, the evening they announced the disbandment, I cried.

243
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,430
Basically, everyone on the forums cried.

244
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,540
An era ended.

245
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,690
Don't be sad.

246
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm not sad, I'm not.

247
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,250
Then, can you tell us the details of how you met him?

248
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,200
- Shouldn't you explain it to us? Talk!
- I want to hear too! Quick!

249
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,700
Quick, talk! Talk!

250
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,380
- Hurry and tell us.
- Our details...

251
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,830
It's just... My boyfriend is Han Shangyan.

252
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,020
You guys know, huh?

253
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,530
- The most handsome in there, right?
- Right!

254
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,460
In the past, there were so many girls going after him.

255
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,930
No, no... In the past! Besides, he never looked at them twice.

256
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,460
- Really?
- Yes.

257
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,960
What are you nodding for? You don't know.

258
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,930
In brief, we met at the internet cafe...

259
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,570
Nian Nian! Nian Nian!

260
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,810
Nian Nian, Nian Nian, Nian Nian!

261
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,720
I'll ask you a question.

262
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,590
Have you met Mi Shaofei?

263
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,780
Have you seen him in person?

264
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,140
He is the one called Mi Shaofei from Team SP.

265
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,730
When I went to Sanya, Team SP was there, too.

266
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,320
I probably saw him.

267
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,620
Really?

268
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,790
How I envy you! I've never had a chance to meet him.

269
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,480
Before, I didn't have the chance to go watch a game.

270
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,300
Later, when their team disbanded, only Han Shangyan and Mi Shaofei retired.

271
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,900
There were even fewer chances to watch a game.

272
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,640
I've been in pain because of it for such a long time.

273
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,100
You know, in their team he was the most versatile.

274
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,420
He could complete any task the strategy required of him.

275
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,170
Look, look! This is all of the information and pictures I'd gathered about him.

276
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,660
See!

277
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,900
When I have nothing to do, I love watching videos of his matches.

278
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,830
Also, later on I even edited collections of the best of his competitions.

279
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,260
You like Mi Shaofei? I thought you liked Solo.

280
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,920
He... Is he a good person?

281
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,990
I didn't talk much with him.

282
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,800
Let me think about it...

283
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,360
He... is...

284
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,820
<i>[Atlantis Sanya]
(Resort in Sanya, China)</i>

285
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,160
Doctor, is he all right?

286
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,820
You have a fever due to tonsillitis; you just need some rest.

287
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,920
This IV drip will take about an hour. Don't run around.

288
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,500
Thank you.

289
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,330
I just heard someone in the staff say you were sick.

290
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,830
After I went back that night, I thought about it carefully.

291
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,450
I was too impatient.

292
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,630
Also, I certainly spoke out of line.

293
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,930
For a professional player, tampering with the ranking, maybe,

294
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,750
you could get some temporary points, but you wouldn't be able to win the real match.

295
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,570
It's been so many days already.

296
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,940
What's the point in talking about this now?

297
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,360
I just don't want you to misunderstand me.

298
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,030
If there's nothing else you two need help with, we'll leave now.

299
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,190
Please, doctors, take her away.

300
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,990
If she's here, I do need some help.

301
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,480
All right, then I'll walk you two out. Thank you.

302
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,380
All right.

303
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,160
<i>Can you do me a favor?</i>

304
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,000
I heard you got sick. Are you all right?

305
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,370
I'm better now. It's nothing.

306
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,280
Don't take in the wind here; go back and rest.

307
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,990
Why were you looking for me?

308
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,400
Do me a favor.

309
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,380
Han Shangyan! I never thought there'd be a day when you'd ask me for help.

310
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,060
What is it?

311
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,290
A favor for Tong Nian.

312
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,410
I have no relationship with her. What favor could I do for her?

313
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,850
But since I call her "sister-in-law," maybe I can help.

314
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,960
Stop being cheeky.

315
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,600
Say, what is it? How can I help?

316
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,000
<i>I'm pushing back my return to Shanghai by a day.</i>

317
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,120
<i>Okay.</i>

318
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,420
<i>[Han Shangyan back to Shanghai. Pick him up from airport]</i>

319
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,300
<i>This is the first time we were on vacation.</i>

320
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,050
<i>Although it was an unplanned vacation,</i>

321
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,550
<i>isn't love just like that?</i>

322
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,560
<i>Brimming with surprises and accidents.</i>

323
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,490
<i>It is in these parts of life that I can see the good in him.</i>

324
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,550
<i>Isn't this look a bit mature? Does it suit me?</i>

325
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,360
<i>But this is what he gave to me.</i>

326
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,740
<i>Who cares! I want to take his love and wear it!</i>

327
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,940
Say, Yu Qingwei from Class 6 is so handsome!

328
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,650
I think he's so-so.

329
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,630
Look! That's my dad! Handsome, isn't he?

330
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,220
- Bye, Uncle Wang!
- Goodbye.

331
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,600
Dad! Next time, don't go on a business trip.

332
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,460
I promise you. In the future, I'll avoid going on business trips where I can.

333
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,120
Pinky swear!

334
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,570
Dad, I missed you to death!

335
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,390
I've invited someone out. Let's eat dinner together in a little bit.

336
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,820
There are tasty things to eat again! Who is it?

Your mom.

- Auntie Zhao.
- Su Cheng.

339
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,350
Just now in my room, I sorted out a pile of magazines and data.

340
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,800
Could I trouble you to clear them out for me? I'm in a hurry to go out.

341
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,170
You just came back and you're going out?

342
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,380
Yeah. I'm going to dinner with my daughter.

343
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,010
I'm not going.

344
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,830
Why aren't you going?

345
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,550
I have a ton of homework; I won't even have time to eat dinner.

346
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,680
Dad, how about I go to your office to do my homework?

347
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,700
You work, I'll accompany you.

348
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,020
Can you not be so headstrong?

349
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,290
Your mom just came back from a business trip and just wanted to have one meal with you.

350
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,140
Be good. Listen.

351
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,680
Get in the car.

352
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,860
Dad,

353
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,430
do you not want me anymore?

354
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,270
Trying to act pitiful?

355
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,010
Definitely not.

356
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,240
If you don't want to go, then don't go.

357
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,480
I'm tired anyway. I don't feel like driving you over.

358
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,380
I guarantee that I will go to your office and do my homework well.

359
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,350
I'll listen to you.

360
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,180

Auntie Zhao,

364
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,420
I can clear out the magazines.

365
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,210

- Okay.

Sit down.

369
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,710
The problem with Mi Shaofei.

370
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,270
These are all the emails between me and all the bosses.

371
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,780
You look at it first, we'll talk after.

372
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,370
Mi Shaofei is your buddy. At the start, you're the one who ensured his contract-signing.

373
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:20,030
So in this matter,  you should make the final decision.

374
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,450
In this competitive season, Mi Shaofei's scores indeed have not been ideal, but...

375
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,460
Look at these first.

I can't take any more pictures. She's here.

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,350
- I'm sorry, Director Xiang.
- No worries.

380
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,570
- I came a bit late.
- No worries!

381
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,480
- I made you rush here from so far away. I should be the one to apologize.
- No worries!

382
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,820
In the future, don't be so polite to me! It's not like it's the first time we've met.

383
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,860

- Okay!

Yes! I started listening to your songs in middle school. I'm definitely a hardcore fan!

412
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:22,150
I hope that in the future you can not only cover songs online, but also release your own singles and your own CDs.

413
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,740
When that happens, I'll definitely buy 100!

- Little girl, you're pretty popular.

How come you came back? Aren't you supposed to be back tomorrow?

423
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,880
Didn't you say that you like me?

424
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,610
How come you agreed so readily to sign your name on someone's chest?

425
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,190
No, no.

426
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,750
He... He said that he was a hardcore fan of mine and liked me for many years.

427

Can I take a picture with you?

435
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,150
Let's not take pictures over here. Thank you.

All genuine fans.

441
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,100
Say, do you think her husband feels a lot of pressure? So many fans!

442
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,310
It's all right. I have a lot of fans, too.

443
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,070
I'm talking about her. Why are you talking about yourself?

Wait! What did you say just now?

445
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,430
Isn't Lan Mei already married?

446
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,640
Her husband isn't you.

447
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,840
Are you two are having an extramarital affair?

448
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,260

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,240
You're so happy that you've become stupid.

508
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,280
I'm stupidly happy.

509
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,840
I'm not Han Shangyan or Solo. Why are so you happy? Am I right?

510
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,770
What do you mean? What are you saying?

511
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,630
You probably don't know how many fans you have!

512
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,520
D-Did you know you have a fan club? We're all veteran fans!

513
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,320
Ever since Team Solo, us veteran fans have been cheering for you!

514
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,340
- Really?
- Really!

515
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,370
I'm heading off!

516
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,970
L-Leaving?

517
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,120
You keep smiling! Why have you gone stupid?

518
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,020
I'm okay. I'm okay. I can't help it.

519
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,770
You wouldn't understand this feeling.

520
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,860
I understand. I understand. He's leaving! Go catch up!

521
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,700
April 1st?

522
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,790
Then this year's April 1st is the first time I met my idol.

523
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,330
No, no! From now on, every April 1st is a memorial day!

524
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,870
Are you stupid?

525
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,340
April 1st is April Fool's Day. Who would make it a memorial day?

526
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,690
April Fool's Day? Was everything today a joke?

527
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,400
It's okay! Even if it's an illusion, I am satisfied!

528
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,140
Look!

529
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:40,160
The feeling of having fans... How is it?

530
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,390
That girl kept crying and laughing at me.

531
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,390
I didn't know what to say in the end.

532
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,690
It has made you become cocky.

533
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,760
Sorry, sorry. Greet them.

534
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,300
Gun God! Ou-Ou-Ou Qiang!

535
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,340
This is my friend, Yaya.

536
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,910
Hello, I'm Han Shangyan.

537
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,970
Can you stop pretending to be a respectable person?

538
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,740
Childish!

539
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,200
- Hello!
- Hello!

540
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,580
I am the most gentlemanly, Ou Qiang.

541
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,280
It's our first time meeting. Let's hug.

542
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,210
You... Don't scare off my fan!

543
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,940
My bro is just like this. Sorry about that.

544
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,760
How old are you guys? Can't you be more serious?

545
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,700
Han Shangyan! Don't pretend to be respectable!

546
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,590
Enough! Today is our team's ten year anniversary.

547
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,290
Everyone is almost present. Why don't we celebrate?

548
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,580
Sounds good!

549
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,610
C-Can I join, too?

550
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,640
Of course.

551
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:58,690
- Nian Nian! Nian Nian! Nian Nian! Then am I⁠— am I also a member of Team Solo now?
- Yes.

552
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,260
- I feel like all my happiness for today is used up!
- Let's go.

553
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,590
This is really my best April Fool's Day ever!

554
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,190
- Do you know? I'm really so happy!
- I know, I know.

555
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,190
If you don't start walking, they'll really disappear.

556
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,420
Go!

557
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,130
<i> You almost killed me earlier! </i>

558
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,840
Look around at will. Don't be shy.

559
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,290
- We'll go get some food to bring to our picnic later.
- Sounds good!

560
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,760
Where's Grandpa?

561
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,260
I sent him to a relative's house.

562
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,060
I was worried he'd be bored at home by himself, and nobody's here to care for him.

563
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,570
We should bring Grandpa with us to the picnic.

564
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,660
This house is really impressive.

565
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,020
Old Han has made a comeback and established K&K.

566
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,010
This achievement is much better than the past Team Solo.

567
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,100
Even though we were poor back then, we will never forget those relationships.

568
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,940
If Solo were here, that'd be great.

569
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,360
What are you doing?

570
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,380
It's not that. You must not mention that name here.

571
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,100
Or else, all of today's happiness will go down the drain.

572
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,690
Move over a bit more.

573
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,960
Do you really have to move that far away from me?

574
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,400
Thank you for today. Yaya is very happy.

575
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,000
What does your classmate want to drink? I'll make some tea.

576
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,270
No need! No need!

577
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,400
She's already met her idol. What would she drink?

578
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,950
She could become an immortal now.

579
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:44,300
Oh right! This is for Grandpa.

580
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,120
How did you know he loves drinking tea?

581
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,910
You have to be attentive to get doted on.

582
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,820
Don't mind me.

583
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,830
Go chase your idol if you want. Go date if you want.

584
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,560
Don't waste this wonderful time!

585
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,900
- Are you bored?
- I was wrong!

586
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,170
Little Mi!

587
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,480
Yaya, let me tell you. Give me ten minutes.

588
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,670
Let me tell you about all the annoying things Mi Shaofei has done in the past 10 years.

589
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,140
Then, you will no longer adore him!

590
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,550
Seeing them gathered together like this is so nice.

591
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,700
<i> Five to ten bowls of rice!</i>

592
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,610
You're actually very happy that they came over, right?

593
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,760
Why are you always looking at me?

594
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,390
Am I that good-looking?

595
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,230
Yep... I'll go wash the teacups.

596
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,130
<i>I was wrong! Brother Mi, I was wrong!</i>

597
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,480
<i>I surrender!</i>

598
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,420
Leave them, I'll do it. Go hang out with them.

599
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,890
It's no problem! I can wash teacups!

600
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,550
If you don't listen, I'll kiss you in front of them.

601
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,310
<i> When he first met that girl, his face became red like a monkey's butt!</i>

602
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,390
<i> If you took a closer look, it was like a red light! </i>

603
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,890
Are you going down to swim?

604
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,820
This place is quite nice.

605
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,050
If I could buy a house here, that'd be nice.

606
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,250
I believe in you! I know you can do it!

607
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,820
What are you majoring in?

608
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,710
Computer science. I'm a postgraduate student now.

609
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,760
Top student.

610
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,090
Oh, I'm not the top student! Tong Nian is!

611
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,540
You're also doing computers! Just a different area than us!

612
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:34,560
I can't compare with you guys. You guys will become scientists. I...

613
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,320
Can I ask you a question?

614
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,190
I'm asking for the fans in my group.

615
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,510
This is just a conversation. Don't be so nervous!

616
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,630
But... don't share our conversation with others

617
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,310
because our club has a rule to not carelessly share information.

618
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:54,300
I know! I know! SP has a lot of rules. You guys can't even date!

619
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,660
Cruel, right?

620
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,390
So... after the team disbanded, where did you go?

621
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,520
If you aren't comfortable, you don't have to reply.

622
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,990
I-I'm just really concerned because you suddenly disappeared like Han Shangyan.

623
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,340
You don't need to be nervous or explain yourself.

624
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,120
There isn't anything that can't be said.
