39
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:19,990
I didn't. But we had over twenty member on our school's S&M Computer competition team, we also went thru this kind of elimination process.

40
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:25,980
Of course, for us, it was because of the difference between our grades.

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,660
-Slowly!
-Sister-in-law

174
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,330
The thing you bought is way too heavy!

175
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,920
It's a coffee maker

176
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,610
Bingo, it's a coffee machine.

177
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,630
Move the box over here.

178
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,930
How thoughtful! We needed a coffee machine this good.

179
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,360
Sister-in-law, you are so warm!

180
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,410
It's alright.

181
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,630
How much was this?

182
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,080
This... well, anyway, it's quite a waste of wealth,

183
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,940
but I bought it with my own money.

184
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,280
Where should we put it?

185
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,660
Put it...

186
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,430
This table is a bit small. How about we bring a bigger one?

187
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,320
-Okay!
-Okay.

188
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,960
I'll go with you.

189
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,990
Let's go.

190
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,580
Wait and see the powerful coffee machine!

191
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,070
Little Han, Did you set a date yet?

192
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,350
This Miss is really good. You got a good catch.

193
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,500
Auntie, in your eyes, do I seem unable to take care of my girlfriend?

194
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,460
Auntie is afraid your temper will scare away Miss.

195
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,470
Hurry and decide okay?

196
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:51,740

197
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
You've brought all this, what do you want?

198
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,110
You'll know in a bit.

199
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,760
Help me grind some coffee beans.

200
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,210
Enough! Enough It's too much!

201
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,150
Leaving coffee beans out for too long will make it stale.

202
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,320
No worries, these kids can drink a jar.

203
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,680
-We can?!
<i>It won't do.</i>

204
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,100
-When do we drink that much?
<i>-Let's see if this is enough.</i>

205
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,350
It's enough for now.

206
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,370
Okay. Then I'll start grinding the beans.

207
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,410
No problem.

208
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,770
I'm about to show you something cool.

209
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,990
You got scared. This is used to aerate the milk.

210
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,770
Watch closely.

211
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,850
Afterwards is the last step.

212
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,920
Tada! Latte Art.

213
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,660
Cool?

214
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,780
Sister-in-law, can you give that cup of coffee to me?

215
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,360
This cup...?

216
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,120
Okay. Here you go.

217
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,770
Slowly! It's full.

218
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,410
Thanks Sister-in-law

219
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,850
Do you want some brown sugar?

220
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,080
No No, it'll ruin the art.

221
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,280
I'll say, this art is pretty.

222
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,650
You're just going to give it to him?

223
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,570
Yep, you didn't say you wanted it.

224
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,730
He wanted it, so I gave it to him.

225
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,210
-Sister-in-law.
-Sister-in-law!

226
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,790
I want one!
Me too!

227
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,010
I want one too!

228
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,320
Okay.

229
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,190
Sister-in-law, this latte art looks so good.

230
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,580
-You know everything!
-It's okay. Not really.

231
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,830
I want a pretty one!

232
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,320
Pretty one?

233
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,840
Okay, I'll make a few different styles.

234
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,600
Thanks Sister-in-law!

235
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,520
Sister-in-law I'm so jealous.

236
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,450
Wow! Sister-in-law. You got skills!

237
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,230
You're skilled!

238
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,200
So pretty.

239
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,220
-I want this one.
- this one.
- Take whichever you like.

240
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,310
This one is good.

241
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,570
-Thanks Sister-in-law!
-Thanks!
-You're welcome!

242
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,710
Then we'll enjoy it!

243
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,450
Okay. Come back if you want more.

244
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,330
Okay!

245
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,840
-Bye Bye!
-So fragrant.

246
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,600
This taste is good!

247
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,420
Do you want a cup?

248
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,750
If you're not tired, then make one for me.

249
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,230
Okay, then I'll make one for you.

250
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,670
Wait a moment!

251
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,790
It's done

252
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,430
Tong Nian

253
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,010
hello.

254
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,440
Wait! Why did you drink me!

255
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,480
You drank me already?!

256
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,920
WAIT! It's not me. I'm not a pig.

257
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,310
That pig is you. You drank yourself.

258
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,840
Tastes pretty good.

259
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,750
Stop drinking! The pig is deformed now.

260
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,180
What happens when you drink it all? The art will be gone.

261
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,310
After I drink it, you can make another one.

262
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,220
Then I'll make another one.

263
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,520
Don't drink anymore.

264
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,500
Make another one of yourself.

265
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,910
That's you!

266
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,570
Pig is you! Pig is Han Shangyan. Scowling Han Shangyan.

267
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,220
Do you consider this as Sister-in-law's confession?

268
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,560
All I can say is Sister-in-law's skills is too good.

269
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,890
In order to confess, she bought a coffee machine.

270
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,500
Sister-in-law is so romantic.

271
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,560
Do you want some?

272
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,690
-Thanks.
-No problem.

273
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,630
To everyone in our audience, Team SP,

274
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,010
about one minute ago has successfully defeated

275
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,900
Team LP from Australia.

276
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,350
Then, with this match victory, they have successfully advanced into our semifinals.

277
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,670
- Yes.
- Then this Saturday, which is tomorrow afternoon,

278
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,920
in Shanghai the semifinals will be underway.

279
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,690
Yes. Out of four teams, there are two teams from China.

280
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,150
Actually, the draw result we are most afraid of would be a meeting between K&K and SP.

281
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,190
Right, because that way it will lead to a national derby.

282
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,950
For the final seeing SP and K&K would be a fierce match of mighty opponents.

283
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,410
That's to say,

284
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,080
if the result of the draw leads to a match between them in the semifinal,

285
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,110
for us in the audience it would be very hard to take.

286
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,220
- To find out what will happen we still need to watch our follow-up with the situation of the draw.
- Right.

287
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,910
Let us look forward together to the follow-up of this draw result.

288
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,090
<i>[PL 58 Asia Pacific semi-finals]</i>

289
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,960
Look the drawing's started.
<i>[K&K

290
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,790
<i>[SP

291
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,920
<i>[PL 58 Asia Pacific first semi-final]</i>

292
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,560
<i>[1. K&K]</i>

293
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,290
<i>[4. VIPO]</i>

294
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,670
<i>[3. SP]</i>
<i>[K&K v SP, VIPO vs GEAR]</i>

295
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,790
So the drawings for the match ups is revealed.

296
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,090
It is Team SP VS Team K&K, and on this side it is Australia VS Thailand.

297
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,730
My Lord. So it's actually as we were saying before:

298
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,380
our stars will collide first.

299
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,960
It is equivalent to turning this semi-final into a early final.

300
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,160
I believe that the Chinese netizens are surely feeling that it is a great pity,

301
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,920
because both teams are the top strongest teams in China.

302
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,310
This way they'll have to battle first.

303
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,590
No matter which team in the end advances into the finals,

304
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,170
our Chinese netizens will feel it is a great pity for the other team that is eliminated.

305
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,830
If that's the case, anyway, we hope that our Teams SP and K&K

306
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,530
will give our audience a match to make history.

307
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,190
Let's see how it turns out.

308
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,500
Ah, this is too sad.

309
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,800
Semi-finals and it's China vs China.

310
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,200
Okay, enough.

311
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,660
Let's pack up and continue training.

312
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,340
I thought first and second place could be both China's.

313
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,730
Isn't there no show now?

314
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,990
Right?

315
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,630
Everyone just do your best. Don't forget that last time we lost to SP.

316
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,210
We are no longer what we were before.

317
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,040
Our team has new blood now. (T/N: New members who bring fresh ideas/ways of doing things)

318
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,160
Right, Buff?

319
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,210
That's right! Let's eat.

320
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,510
After we eat, we can train.

321
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,330
Then I'm done!
I'm full!

322
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,530
I don't have an appetite anymore.

323
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,270
Let's go!

324
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,640
Any thoughts?

325
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,270
-Yes.
-What thoughts?

326
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,110
Must win.

327
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,010
Don't you know the weather's colder now?

328
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,850
You still wore a shorts.

329
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,480
What is it? Not happy?

330
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,260
Are you feeling unwell or

331
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,430
do you blame me for sending you to Norway with your mom?

332
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,030
I wanted to find her myself.

333
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,510
Not that you gave me away.

334
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,520
Then why the long face?

335
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,450
I just don't understand.

336
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,190
The Chinese Regional Semi-finals are about to begin.

337
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,810
You're clearly busy, yet you're here with me to find Mom.

338
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,060
You're always putting others first.

339
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,880
When is someone going to put you first?

340
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:31,910
So many years, I haven't noticed

341
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,040
you've also grown.

342
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,020
You know how to take care of others now.

343
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,300
Maybe one day...

344
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,490
you will be so grown that you can take care of yourself

345
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,490
and secretly find a boyfriend.

346
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,540
Then seriously love a person.

347
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:11,330
You and him holding hands and enter church.

348
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,340
Do you know?

349
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,260
This is a happiness in my life.

350
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:27,090
Dad hopes that everyone I love

351
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,890
can be happy,

352
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,550
very happy.

353
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,500
I don't want to grow up.

354
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,680
I don't want to find Mom.

355
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,400
Time is merciless.

356
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,740
It never waits for anyone.

357
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,960
Go and accompany your mom.

358
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,330
She needs you more.

359
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,520
Study well there.

360
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,540
After the competition,

361
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,150
I'll go find you.

362
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,290
Dad, promise me.

363
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,790
You have to beat KK and take the championship.

364
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,660
You want to make it hard for Uncle Han?

365
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,480
No.

366
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,840
Only I hope that you can get the championship.

367
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,540
You're the world's best dad.

368
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,480
You're the first place dad.

369
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,680
You can handle and win anything and any situation.

<i>-Take a bite.</i>

371
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,920
<i>I don't want to eat.</i>

372
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,150
<i>-Just one.
-No.</i>

373
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,100

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,640
<i>I don't want to.</i>

375
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,530
<i>You don't want to give me face? Not even a little?</i>

376
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,750
<i>After you eat, Dad will play a game with you okay?</i>

377
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,730
<i>I don't want to play a game.</i>

378
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,030
<i>You don't want to play a game? Then what do you want to do?</i>

379
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,910
<i>I want to ... to find Mom.</i>

380
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,650
<i>You want to find Mom?</i>

381
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,710
<i>Then...after you eat, Dad will look for Mom with you okay?</i>

382
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,590
<i>I don't want to eat.</i>

383
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,670
<i>Then why do you want to find Mom?</i>

384
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,080
<i>I miss her.</i>

385
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,040
Boss, time to eat.

386
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,330
Don't want to.

387
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,880
Boss, it's okay. Don't worry. We can beat SP.

388
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,100
Where did you see my worry?

389
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,820
Uh...I didn't say you were worried Boss.

390
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,590
I was talking about the little kitty! Look, how scared it is.

391
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,080
Kitty. Don't be scared.

392
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,300
How cute. Look Boss.

393
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,070
Time to eat Han Shangyan.

394
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,920
He says he doesn't want to.

395
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:44,000
Can you guys not all come tell me to eat?

396
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,240
I'm the manager.

397
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,660
I'm not an animal, what is there to worry about?

398
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,260
Go.

399
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,400
Sooner or later, we have to face it. It's the same.

400
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,940
I just didn't think it would be this fast.

401
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,780
Originally, first and second place could have been ours.

402
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,490
Kid, you're so arrogant.

403
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,870
We're finally on.

<i>[SP Gaming]</i>

406
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,070
Didn't think we'd run into each other that fast.

407
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,980
I had hoped to and not hoped to run into them.

408
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,690
It's unfortunate.

409
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,050
Otherwise first and second place should have been China's teams.

410
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:52,000
I find the way you speak is more and more like Little Han.

411
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,340
Solo, I have a matter to speak to you about.

412
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,770
Then I'll head out first.

413
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,900
What is it?

414
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,420
There was a call from headquarters earlier.

415
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,100
What did they say?

416
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,730
You are the best captain in China.

417
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,870
You probably wouldn't lose right?

418
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,310
If you lose, then you aren't a good captain.

419
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,430
In other words, if this outcome is true,

420
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,840
you'll be changed for a better captain

421
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,770
to lead China's SP team.

424
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,530
I'm here.

425
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,970
What are you doing?

426
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,320
Yaya, my heart is beating so fast. I'm so nervous.

427
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,470
Actually mine is too. I'm really nervous.

428
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,040
- I'm asking you. Are you supporting K&K or SP?
- K&K.

429
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,960
Is your position firm?

430
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,020
Say this together with me.

431
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,500
K&K up in the sky and on the ground as one dragon (i.e. as one in coordination).

432
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,410
Thousands of troops and ten thousand horses rushing forward (i.e. a mighty force rushing forward).

433
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,830
K&K up in the sky and on the ground as one dragon.

434
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,420
A mighty force rushing forward.

435
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,140
Before, I was Team Solo's old fan. I liked Solo the best.

436
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:20,050
Did you know? Ten years ago, the way he led his team was so handsome!

437
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:24,300
As for Han Shangyan, he's on his own.

438
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,010
I'm Appledog's fan.

439
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,640
Wherever she is, is what I will support.

440
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,750
Agree.

441
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:43,310
SP Fighing! SP Fighing! SP Fighing! SP Fighing! SP Fighing!

442
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:47,150
K&K up in the sky and on the ground as one dragon.

443
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:53,950
- A mighty force rushing forward. K&K up in the sky...
- SP Fighing! SP Fighing! SP Fighing! SP Fighing! SP...

444
00:29:53,990 --> 00:30:00,110
K&K up in the sky and on the ground as one dragon. A might force rushing forward.

445
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,510
Let me tell you girls. If SP loses today,

446
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,000
then I will swallow both of your cheering sticks, okay? Thank You!

447
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,950
You're welcome.

448
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,040
She wants to swallow our cheering sticks, why did I say "you're welcome" to her?

449
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,400
Ugh, really.

450
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,750
Yaya. Give me your lipstick for a second.

451
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,670
Today's condition is pretty stable.

452
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,650
Sister-in-law why are you walking backwards?

453
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,510
One, two, three.

454
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,680
KK Fighting!

455
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,970
Tong Nian made me draw it.

456
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,110
We almost rapped in the bathroom in competition.

457
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,020
So we could only draw this.

458
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,620
I'm just happy you guys are here.

459
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,510
Take it off, what if you get allergies?

460
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:01,450
No way. My lipstick is good, we won't get allergies.

461
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,060
Why are you smiling? Aren't I cool with this?

462
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,130
Hard-core fan at a glance.

463
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,210
Whatever you like.

464
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,750
You're going into the stands and not to the VIP seats?

465
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,350
Of course I'm not going! The atmosphere is good, I want to stay there.

466
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,500
As long as you're happy.

467
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,780
You guys do well too! KK can do it! Fighting!

468
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,600
We'll win for sure! We'll win for sure!

469
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,230
Have to win!

470
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,370
Sister-in-law, if we win, what will you treat us to?

471
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,670
After winning? After winning, you can eat whatever you want.

472
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:38,030
Can you see? This is 6 year's savings.

473
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,340
Six?! Six?

474
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:44,140
Wait, we can't spend all her savings. Can't be that greedy.

475
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,120
In two more years, Boss will become an old idle uncle.

476
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,250
Our idle uncle has all grown up, too. (second part to what he said that's not spoken is should get married soon)

477
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,040
He's more anxious then us.

478
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,430
You gang of brats!

479
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,640
See how I will straighten you all up, one by one.

480
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,150
Okay. Come. We'll be playing in five minutes. Fighting! Cheer!

481
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,020
Fighting! Fighting!

482
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,850
Listen to me.

483
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,330
Although before, I once thought your way of celebrating

484
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,520
was very childish.

485
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,680
But today, I hope that I can help you guys.

486
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,060
Come. One, two, three!

487
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:36,910
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

488
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,710
Actually, every time I see them fight, my feelings are especially complicated.

489
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,330
I want K&K to win, but I also want SP to win.

490
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,140
I know that kind of feeling.

491
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,790
Now Ou Qiang is the one of the only ones competing of the founding members of Team Solo.

492
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,980
Say, if he does not get first place,

493
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,600
doesn't that indicate that the former Team Solo lost?

494
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,280
Yeah.

495
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,240
We're about to start today's semi-final competition.

496
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,210
That's right. As the Asia-Pacific host for this competition,

497
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,340
we finally get to welcome the day where both sides are China teams.

498
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,460
I hope that Team SP and Team K&K can bring us

499
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,110
a wonderful match.

500
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,880
Alright, everybody. Give our two clubs some time,

501
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,950
and we will be back soon.

502
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,200
Are you good?

503
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,380
What are you referring to?

504
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,930
Whoever loses in this competition will be a heartache.

505
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,130
SP and K&K are both teams I like,

506
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,680
but only one can go to the finals.

507
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,530
This is practically battle royale.

508
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,660
Let's give them our blessings.

509
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,430
Do you want SP or K&K to win?

510
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,130
No matter who wins

511
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,440
its for the country's glory.

512
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,320
These two brothers, don't be nervous, I've prepared drinks for you guys.

513
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,700
Let the skills of the players decide the match.

514
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,800
-Shut up.
-Shut up.

515
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,760
I'm here.

516
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,990
Han Shangyan.

517
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,050
God Gun.

518
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,950
Fighting!

519
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,640
Alright, welcome back, everyone.

520
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,900
Here it is the CTF Asia-Pacific Competition, and we are broadcasting live on site.

521
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,190
We want to thank Eastroc Super Drink for supplying our players with energy supplements.

522
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,520
Half an hour ago, the first semi-finals competition ended.

523
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,210
The winner from the other match was Australia's VIPO.

524
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,840
Now it's time to see who will represent China

525
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,710
Team K&K and Team SP.

526
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,200
Brothers, it's the last game

527
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,560
Let's show them what we got!

528
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,230
Listen to the team captain!

529
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,760
I would like to point out that this time K&K's team has a line up change.

530
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,310
They've added a rank 4 player called Buff.

531
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,130
After Buff joined the team, he gave Team K&K

532
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,100
a huge increase in combat power.

533
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,210
Exactly. So compared to the previous month's

534
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,880
national finals

535
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,060
these are two comparable teams.

536
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,910
Come on!

537
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,790
Excuse me! Excuse me!

538
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,330
Husband, what did you go to do? Why are you only here now?

539
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,430
W-Who won?

540
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,270
It hasn't ended yet. Hurry.

541
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,170
I'm telling you, that client was annoying me to death.

542
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,860
If it wasn't for my coworker lending me this bike, I would've been late for sure!

543
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,570
-Quickly!
-Put it here?

544
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:28,070
It's so difficult to see this competition. Shouldn't have waited for you.

545
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,500
Let's go.

546
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,340
Hurry up.

547
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,450
What are you guys doing?!

548
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,440
-This is a public area!
-I don't care anymore!

549
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,660
The current results of the CTF Semi-final match between KK and SP is 1:1.

550
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,990
This next match will decide the game.

551
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:51,480
The last four nodes! There is still the last four nodes!

552
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,980
They've lost one! SP lost one node! DT has circumvented Hua Ti!

553
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,530
Beautiful! Lnin has also been blocked.

554
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,490
No, it's a trap! Bug has sacrificed Lnin!

555
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,590
For himself, he has blocked Grunt's seizure!

556
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,080
Bug has entered!

557
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,880
This is dangerous for K&K! Demo has found Bug's infiltration!

558
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,210
Bug is still hiding, he is still looking for vulnerabilities!

559
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,790
He has circumvented Demo too! Bug!

560
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,720
A pity, DT has seized him out!

561
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,230
It's the last node!

562
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,050
Four members of K&K are all defending!

563
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,870
Are they planning to let DT fight one VS five?

564
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,240
He’s passed! Three people were not able to capture DT!

565
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,810
Hua Ti has also been circumvented!

566
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:30,150
There's only All left! Beautiful! DT has ended the match!

567
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,360
Wow! Congratulations to KK for winning the Semi-finals!

568
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,860
WOW! WOO!

569
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,310
It's already ended.

570
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,840
Bro, bro who won?

571
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,430
K&K! K&K won!

572
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,570
K&K won! K&K won!

573
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,980
I want to see them cheer on the winners!

574
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:56,050
Wait for me!

575
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,430
Sorry.

576
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,130
-Yay!
-K&K.

It's okay. We still have the opportunity to get third place.

Right.

I willingly admit defeat. Give it your all in the finals.

You too! Let's meet up again at the World's Finals competition.

594
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,500
Don't worry. Third place is definitely ours!

595

Yes! Good! Woo!

601
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:21,310
Congrats KK and hope that they can fulfill China's wish

602
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:25,350
and expectations. At the Asia-Pacific finals tomorrow,

603
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:28,470
get a trophy for us!

604
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,970
Let's go! Go!

605
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,960
Let's go. Let's go. Hurry.

Hey Shu!

607
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,800
Han Shangyan, old friend.

608
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,620
On our turf, the trophy is ours.

609
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:55,540
After the competition, stay for a few days and relax. I'll host.

610
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,390
Still the same. So confident.

611
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,670
-See you at the competition.
-See you at the competition.

612
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,160
You guys know each other?

613
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,250
Over ten years ago, when we hadn't met,

614
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,680
I was already competing against him.

615
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,220
your Boss, me, has never lost to him.

616
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,540
You can't lose face, understood?!

617
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,970
Don't worry Boss.

618
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,240
Let's go.

619
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,550
<i>[Love luck: 1 star. Work luck: 1 star.]</i>

620
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,000
<i>What should I do?</i>

621
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,260
The few people in K&K, in this period of time their horoscopes are all not very good.

622
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:48,020
Especially Han Shangyan. Looks like we don't have the opportunity of good luck to match.

623
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,380
What are you looking at?

624
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,110
I'm looking at horoscopes.

625
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,780
I looked up everyone on KK's team.

626
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,640
Everyone? The five team members, Han Shangyan and my Xiao mi's?

627
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,480
All seven?

628
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,930
What does it say?

629
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,990
I don't know. I was just checking.

630
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,630
I remember my tarot cards came.

631
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,130
Let's see what the cards say.

632
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,620
I don't understand that.

633
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,820
I know a little.

634
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,260
Where are my tarot cards?

635
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,530
Can you not be so anxious?

636
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,230
Oh you don't know.

637
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,440
I saw the news.

638
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,020
K&K's competitor is the favorite team to win the championship.

639
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,600
Can't be relaxed.

640
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,390
I'm so nervous.

641
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,580
Don't be, think of it this way.

642
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,640
The front three can all enter the World Competition.

643
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,110
KK's already gotten the ticket to enter

644
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,840
nothing to worry about.

645
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,880
On the flip side,

646
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,900
SP is going to be on the line.

647
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,270
If they lose, then they won't have the chance to go to Worlds

648
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,920
I hope SP can enter Worlds.

649
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,740
If SP can't enter, Han Shangyan will be unhappy.

650
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,770
Right.

651
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,720
How am I going to sleep tonight?

652
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,700
Right? I can't sleep either.

653
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,810
So nervous.
