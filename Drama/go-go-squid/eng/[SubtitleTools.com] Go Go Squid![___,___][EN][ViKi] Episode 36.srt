00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,690
Wipe yourself off.

25
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,870
Your whole head is wet.

26
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,190
Have you paid for it yet, giving it to me?

27
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,270
I'll go pay for it in a little bit.

28
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,660
Don't drink cold things. With you like this, you'll catch a cold!

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,440
I am buying it for the group of kids.

30
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,420
Okay, then I'm going to pay.

31
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,070
Here, drink some. It's warm.

32
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,350
Sorry. I was out of control today.

33
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,190
No, I think that you guys drinking a little is pretty good.

34
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,280
Why?

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,530
Because... you can finally speak straight from the heart.

36
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,770
Say all the things that you want to say.

37
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,290
You've probably kept those words in for a long time, haven't you?

38
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:48,130
Han Shangyan, I told you before that I have bank savings.

39
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,250
In here, there is my red envelope money, the money I got from performing.

40
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,140
The money from my scholarship and my money from signings and selling music.

41
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,490
Together, that's 67,952 yuan.
<i>(T/N: ~9,857 USD)</i>

42
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,330
Now, I'm going to give the card to you.

43
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,510
That's quite a lot.

44
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,910
Every day you have to dress yourself up and look pretty,

45
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,830
and you still could save so much money - it's really not easy.

46
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,020
I want to tell you that no matter if Grandpa supports you or not,

47
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,330
if Auntie supports you or not,

48
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,820
I will always support you.

49
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,920
<i>I've done something with such absolute devotion, too.</i>

50
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,650
<i>This kind of thing is simple to say, but few people can actually do it.</i>

51
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,240
<i>Leaving some margin for each other is the true safety distance.</i>

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,490
<i>Doesn't matter if it is friendship, or love.</i>

53
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,550
Are you looking for candy?

54
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,580
I'll go buy it for you!

55
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,040
Don't go.

56
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,030
Sit down.

57
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,640
What's wrong?

58
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,330
Forget about the money.

59
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,200
Just give yourself to me.

60
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,450
When you want to marry, just give me a hint.

61
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,570
This is not my marriage proposal,

62
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,590
it is just that I want to tell you

63
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,800
having you with me is so nice.

64
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,900
I really hope that in my days in the future,

65
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,210
that you can be there.

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,160
Boss.

67
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,470
Why are you guys here?

68
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,780
The manager said that you were looking for us to say a few things before the competition.

69
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,850
This is water we just bought, you guys can drink it if you want!

70
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,980
Thank you, Sister-in-Law!

71
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,160
Then you guys talk first, I'm going in first.

72
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,260
If you need me, you can call me.

73
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,850
Where's Wu Bai?

74
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,080
Team Captain said to not rush you while you are dating and then went back to his room.

75
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,510
So... should the few of us be waiting here,

76
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,590
or not?

77
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,430
War is upon us. How do you feel?

78
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
Of course we've got to give it our all! K&K must win.

79
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,210
Sit, sit, sit!

80
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,350
Shout less slogans.

81
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,550
The old single deity has changed his status today.

82
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,580
He even met with us to have a heart-to-heart before the battle. No wonder Team Captain didn't come.

83
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,780
It's rare, so don't cut it short for us.

84
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,310
Thanks, Boss.

85
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,640
I'm starting now.

86
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,840
Just tell us directly. We're all ears.

87
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,950
First, congratulations to you guys for making it here.

88
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,890
With honor, and with pressure.

89
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,560
To get to the national finals, it is really not easy.

90
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,920
To be honest,

91
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,900
what I wanted to say today is not a lot.

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
As a professional player,

93
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,520
I have obtained results that are not bad.

94
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,520
But I cannot be considered as successful.

95
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,240
Because I gave up.

96
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,750
So I sincerely hope that you guys do not give up halfway.

97
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,630
No matter what competition you are facing in your life,

98
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,450
you must go and give it your all.

99
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:10,070
In the CTF circle, every few years people are replaced.

100
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:15,050
Regarding hand speed, age, and also the brain, the requirements are extremely rigorous.

101
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,680
Look around.

102
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,480
Generation after generation of champions were rid of.

103
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
No one wanted to leave.

104
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,190
All the choices made were forced and they were helpless.

105
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,830
The cruelest fate of heroes.

106
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,280
Therefore, I hope that at your best age, you all go all out.

107
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,440
Go all out and wherever you end up is wherever you end up. And that is how you will have no regrets in this lifetime.

108
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,700
- Go all out.
- Go all out!
- Go all out.
- Go all out!

109
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,620
- You can do it!
- We can do it!

110
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,440
What are you eavesdropping for?

111
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,790
Listening to your vehement declaration.

112
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,780
They haven't left yet?

113
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,940
They probably don't feel at ease and want to sit at my place for a while.

114
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,440
How come I feel like you are really similar to my mom?

115
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,190
Like a kindergarten teacher guiding a bunch of little brats.

116
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,080
Probably about the same meaning.

117
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,210
Right. Tomorrow, I have something to talk to you about.

118
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,670
Why tomorrow? Can't you just say it today?

119
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,680
I already said tomorrow!

120
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,310
Then why did you tell me now?

121
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,910
You said that and won't tell me, tonight I basically won't be able to sleep!

122
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,750
Where are you going?

123
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,970
Tell me, tell me, tell me!

124
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,790
What?

125
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,940
If you don't behave, I'll punish you right here.

126
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,500
Boss. That–

127

♫<i> I think I've seen you in my dream before </i>♫

128
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,080
Nothing. You guys continue.

129
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,010
I said that it wouldn't be that fast, what did you guys rush me for?

130
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,470
♫<i> I don't want to wake up </i>♫

131
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,510
♫<i> Getting ready, taking deep breaths </i>♫

132
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,490
♫<i> I want to climb to the mountain peak with you </i>♫

133

135

♫ <i>Let’s go together, let’s go together, we won’t worry regardless of how far</i> ♫

136
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,380
Be good.

137
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,620
Tonight, just concentrate on preparing for the competition.

138
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,400
Don't go thinking about this and that.

139
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,630
Then tonight you definitely won't be able to fall asleep, will you?

140
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,750
In your eyes, am I that fragile?

141
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,950
No!

142
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,780
It's because in the past, I went abroad to an international ACM competition.

143
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,520
On the first night, I, too, was so excited that I couldn't sleep at all.

144
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,720
So your feelings right now, I 100% understand!

145
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,780
How about this? I'll go back to my room, get my laptop and come accompany you, okay? Wait for me!

146
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,570
The two of them aren't...

147
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,940
They won't...

148
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,300
Ever since there's Sister-in-Law, Boss has become more human.

149
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,950
- In what does he look like a human being?
- Details! You don't understand.

150
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,880
You, the Forever single... you're the one who understands the least.

151
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,520
You kid dare laugh at your elder!

152
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,830
Who's the elder?

153
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,220
You two, enough.

154
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,810
- It seems a bit like it is, but also a bit like it isn't.
- Does it or does it not?

155
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,980
- It seems... wrong. Hey, Miss?
- Yes?

156
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,440
Hello. Is this a place where the people in the competition are staying?

157
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,480
The CTF competition.

158
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,200
Yes. Who are you looking for?

159
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,210
- Han Shangyan, the K&K boss, we're looking for him.
- Right.

160
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,790
Does he... owe you money?

161
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,350
- No, no, of course not.
- How's that possible?

162
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,190
We're his friends.

163
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,700
Really? Great! It's that way, I'll take you there.

164
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,190
- Thank you!
- Fine, thank you.

165
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,660
Someone's looking for you.

166
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,800
Old Han! Old Han!

167
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,670
Missed you so much!

168
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,470
How did you two find this place?

169
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,880
Appledog called. Who'd dare not come?

170
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,100
I asked for a special leave just to come watch your game.

171
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,840
- Come on in! Come on in!
-  Coming, coming.

172
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,690
Hello.

173
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,380
Let me introduce you. My previous team mates: Little You, Yi Qian.

174
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,040
From before...

175
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,900
Not really, not really. We were substitutes in Team Solo. We never played in a match.

176
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,930
It's the same.

177
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,280
Hello, elder generation, I'm 97.
<i>(T/N respectful address for a senior)</i>

178
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,440
- I'm Grunt.
- I'm Demo.
- One.

179
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,430
We know, we know, you're all very famous.

180
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,210
- With long-standing fame.
- That's an overpraise...

181
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,980
- Have a seat, on the sofa, sit.
- All right.

182
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,780
Boss, then we're going back to our rooms to get ready.

183
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,260
Don't be nervous. Cramming up at the last moment is no use.

184
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,800
Today's task for you is to have a good rest.

185
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,630
- All right! Bye bye! Sister-in-Law, bye bye! Boss, bye bye.
- Keep fighting!

186
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,110
Then... then I'll go, too.

187
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,060
Can't you just sit there?

188
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,860
Little Sister-in-law? Hello, Sister-in-Law.

189
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

190
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
Have a seat.

191
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,210
When did you get here? All of a sudden?

192
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,820
Just to give you a surprise, isn't that right?

193
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,850
We got here in the afternoon, not long before you did.

194
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,300
I told my subordinates that I was coming to watch a match.

195
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,680
That bunch of brats kept pestering me to know what I used to play at.

196
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,330
As soon as I mentioned Team Solo, they froze on the spot.

197
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,660
What a boaster you are, a lousy substitute.

198
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,600
What about being a substitute? A substitute can help train, okay?

199
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,370
Who dares spar with Han Shangyan? Who can do it?

200
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,030
These words... it sounds quite odd.

201
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,420
How did I treat you two before? Have I ever touched even your finger or abused you in any way?

202
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,400
You can't talk like that. At that time it was emotional torture.

203
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,340
That's right, Old Han, hasn't it changed? Kids' heart nowadays is as frail as glass.

204
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,990
No one can stand your kind of scolding.

205
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,750
Changed my food. If they can stand it, let them; if they can't, they can get lost.

206
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,600
And you've still got this bad temper?

207
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,220
- Has Sister-in-Law teach you a lesson.
- Sister-in-Law, do your best!

208
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,720
What are you eavesdropping?

209
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,910
We're not saying bad things about you.

210
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,090
- Have some fruits.
- No need.

211
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,590
Brother Little Mi!

212
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,420
So, you're back?

213
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,870
How's it going? Done fawning?

214
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,700
Who's fawning? We went to get a boost, okay?

215
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,740
Boost up! All right, come here, sit down.

216
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,950
Captain, you're here so early today, that's rare.

217
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,050
Here, have a look, have a look.

218
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,000
SP are old enemies.

219
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,920
Even though we're all very familiar with them, as a Team Manager, my work ethics demand that, in the end,

220
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,630
I still must give you some slides.

221
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,530
Thank you, Brother Little Mi.

222
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,860
Then I'll just start.

223
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,800
SP's Captain: Hua Ti.

224
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,320
At the age you are now, he was already in the CTF circle.

225
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,810
Twelve years ago, as a captain,

226
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,030
he won the Asian Championship in the team tournament.

227
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,600
Hua Ti is best at finding bugs. He finds a bunch every time.

228
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,500
I remember that he recently fell out of love. Could that affect his game?

229
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,360
It should, his mood won't be too good.

230
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,540
It's nothing. I'm evil, I promise I can get rid of him.

231
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,100
All right, all right, come back.

232
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,950
Okay. Next: Ou Qiang.

233
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,580
Member of the original Team Solo.
<i>[Id: All]</i>

234
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,070
Ten years ago he won the CTF National Championship.

235
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,600
Even before then, he'd been a captain.

236
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,060
I'm especially scared of him. He attacks like a lion.

237
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,140
Have some confidence.

238
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,220
This time you have to do your best, get rid of him, okay?

239
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,910
O..okay...?

240
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,900
Next, next, next. Inin.

241
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,710
We should know him, we went to Norway together and fought in the individual tournament.

242
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,110
But I want to say one thing: before he was in SP,

243
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,000
he'd also been a team captain.

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,930
Okay?

245
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,790
He plays very meticulously.

246
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,660
Did you hear? Even Wu Bai said so.

247
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,000
All right; moving on: on these two I don't want to say much more; just that they've been captains, too.

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,140
But there's one thing I want to stress on:

249
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,690
The captain of SP Team Two. The one who pushed me out.

250
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,780
<i>[Introduction: Username: Bug - Nationality: Chinese - Position: Side defense - Title: World Elite - SP Team Two ex-Captain]</i>

251
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,780
Brother Little Mi, don't worry. I'll get rid of him for you.

252
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,980
SP Captain, and also Ou Qiang,

253
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,300
they are both guys about to retire.

254
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,730
So, this championship, as far as they're concerned,

255
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,890
must be won.

256
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,170
No matter if the adversary is at their first battle, or at their last,

257
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,900
for us keeping steady and doing our best is the right thing to do.

258
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,870
Right you are!

259
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,340
Keep fighting.

260
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,540
- All right.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

261
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,780
Fine, then we're leaving now.

262
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,830
- See you.
- Bye-bye! Bye-bye.

267
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,780
What time did you set the alarm for? It's so early!

268
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,220
7 a.m.

269
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,460
The match is in the afternoon. Why did you set it so early?

270
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,830
Sleep some more.

271
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,590
I'm not sleeping anymore.

272
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,760
- Why's your face so red–
- It's not! It isn't!

273
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,380
Actually, in your heart, you're thinking again to take advantage of me.

274
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,280
Not at all!

275
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,700
Yesterday I fell asleep, why didn't you wake me up?

276
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,620
I called you!

277
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,200
But you held me for dear life and just wouldn't let go.

278
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,180
- Me?
- Huh.

279
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,060
Liar! You're lying for sure, Han Shangyan!

280
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,730
- Why didn't you call me? Why?
- All right!

281
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,060
What's the rush?

282
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,630
I'm yours.

283
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,980
Sooner or later I will be.

284
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,310
Except you,

285
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,200

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,720
Sister-in-Law, you got it? Then now let's do it once more, officially.

336
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,290
- Let's go.
- Let's go, let's go.

337
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,660
Go!

338
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,460
<i>[Beijing - National Final]</i>

339
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,340
How is your preparation?

340
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,220
To beat your team, probably will be quick.

341
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,310
Oh my God, Little Mi, how long have you been with K&K, you are already completely on K&K's side?

342
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,500
I've taken a salary, right?

343
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,620
Then Jia You to you.

344
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,770
Good luck to you too.

345
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,420
- We shall see.
- We shall see!

346
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,900
Do you remember this athletic building is the same one we took the championship in.

347
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,850
What coincidence.

348
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,900
<i> We are now the national champion.</i>

349
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,940
<i> Team Solo can be disbanded, I will bear responsibility, but you are MVP.</i>

350
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,530
<i> You can start a new team.</i>

351
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,490
<i> You can change your name or be the Captain.</i>

352
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,360
<i> You have a bright future.</i>

353
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,680
<i> Don't be hasty and retire. Can you?</i>

354
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,300
<i> That's right.</i>

355
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,030
Forget it. Can't chat anymore.

356
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:02,220
Today is my first time commentating, I am going to check my makeup.

357
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,700
Let me remind you, first time commentating, open your blouse lower.

358
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,420
Then no one will notice when you say something wrong.

359
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,130
Scram!

360
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,420
Ai Qing, hurry up, it's almost time.

361
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,760
I am going to be commentating today, I need to have a good appearance.

362
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,000
You are already very beautiful. You don't need to do so much.

363
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,200
What is that lipstick color?

364
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,780
Western red. Is it suitable for me?

365
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,640
I will give you a set.

366
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,020
Don't brownnose me.

367
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,860
Hope this color will bring me good luck today.

368
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,470
You better go. This is the ladies' bathroom.

369
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,140
Then you hurry up.

370
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,980
I will be right there.

371
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,730
Elder generation.

372
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,540
- Hello.
- Hello, Elder Generation, hello.

373
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,490
Today, please, look out for me.

374
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,370
Y-You look out for me, because...

375
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:27,700
I entered this circle after watching your games.

376
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,600
And then I got to this position.

377
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,020
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

378
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,830
Elder Generation, today you emanate an extraordinary energy and are really fascinating.

379
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,460
Really?

380
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,100
Can I know what the reason is?

381
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,990
Women’s secret weapon.

382
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,120
This... what is this?

383
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,800
You don’t even know what a lipstick is?

384
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,560
Ooh... then...

385
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,790
Then can I use this to chase girls?

386
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,660
Of course you can.

387
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,320
<i>Little Mai, Little Mai! Don't lose it! Collaborate with the Elder Generation, you must sit still.</i>

388
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,280
<i>She's from an Elder Generation, don't blush so much.</i>

389
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,800
Enough, enough. I understand.

390
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,340
Hey, I say, you guys, can you please not call me "Elder Generation"?

391
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,620
He's clearly older than me. This way you're calling me old.

392
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,840
Okay, okay. You are a Goddess.

393
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,600
<i>If you have no problem there, I'll tell them to come out.</i>

394
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,110
- Okay!
- Okay!

395
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,690
Don't feel pressured.

396
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,830
Whether it's the first or the second place,

397
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,230
we'll still represent China and keep battling.

398
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,430
What kind of boss are you? You should demand the title of champions!

399
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,430
You all are the best. You don't need me to press you.

400
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,800
Enjoy to the best every game in your career

401
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,000
because for you each game is a countdown:

402
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,460
every match is one game less.

403
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,300
You all know: I retired three times.

404
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,430
This time, I came back to give it all once more.

405
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:10,300
Brothers, I'm counting on you.

406
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,450
C-captain, wait till we win the championship before you cry.

407
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,830
Don't worry, Captain: we'll get the title for sure!

408
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,700
- Right!
- Right.

409
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,260
- Come on! Brothers-in-arms! Do your best!
- Here!

410
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,870
Get the title of champions! SP!

411
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,490
Boss.

412
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,920
If you can't win the title, come back with your head held high.

413
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:49,100
Don't put pressure on them, how can you still be such a coach of steel with torturing training methods?

414
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,440
Go out and see for yourself: who in this society has no pressure at all?

415
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,100
This is their career, their profession.

416
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,570
I said everything I had to say last night.

417
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,300
Go get some results, for yourselves.

418
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,750
Yes!

419
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,100
Looks like Demo is the most confident.

420
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,600
Let's look forward to his performance.

421
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
N-no... Captain...

422
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,370
Don't lose it out there.  Hold steady!

423
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,140
Do your best!

424
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,480
<i>Dear spectators in the arena, the CTF National Championship Final is about to begin!</i>

425
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,590
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

426
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,940
- Old Han, good luck.
- Old Han, good luck.

427
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,680
- Sister-in-Law!
- Hello, Sister-in-Law.

428
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,740
They all came?

429
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,750
<i>Let's welcome SP to the arena!</i>

430
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,700
SP!

431
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,060
<i>Next, welcome K&K in the arena!</i>

432
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,520
K&K! K&K! K&K!

433
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,510
<i>Let's welcome with an applause our host, Little Mai!</i>

434
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,630
Dear audience members in the arena, hello!

435
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,550
Welcome to the Final match of China's CTF National Championship!

436
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,040
So now please let me introduce my commentary partner:

437
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,450
Appledog!

438
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,780
Currently our most fiery host and also the Team Manager of our Team SP.

439
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,200
Now, I believe you also hold an especially deep knowledge of our two teams.

440
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,250
Before the game, the CTF organization sent out a poll. What was the content of the poll?

441
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,200
And what was the status of the ranking? Please look on the wide screen.

442
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,750
"In a CTF China celebrity tournament, who would you most like to see play?"

443
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,850
With the names on this list you should be more familiar than me, right?

444
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,860
<i>[1. GUN 20% - 2. SOLO 18% - 3. Appledog 10%
4. All 10% - 5. Little Mi 9% 6. Dt 8%
7. Grunt 5% - 8. 97 5% - 9. Inin 5% - 10. Buff 4%]</i>

445
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,900
<i>The list includes all the members of the main team from the original Team Solo back in the day.</i>

446
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,580
<i>From the moment the voting started on the platform until now, we've already broken through one million</i>

447
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,700
<i>and at the moment the trend is still rising.</i>

448
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:54,530
<i>As the first team created at the origin of CTF, Team Solo has left a deep mark in everyone's memory.</i>

449
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:59,940
The 5 of them have surpassed any newcomer, and at the same time they've also surpassed our most popular figure, Wu Bai.

450
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,300
- Everyone, do you wish to see them play again?
- Yes!

451
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,110
Thank you guys!

452
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,770
Thank you guys for still remembering us.

453
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,060
Well, then, let's not say anymore. Back to our CTF China Championship Final.

454
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,800
We'll give the players 5 more minutes to warm up.

455
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,950
Please, let's look on screen, the countdown is going to begin:

456
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,500
let us wait and see!

457
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:44,390
<i> Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki
Ripped & Resync By HiDeYuKi KaKaShI</i>

458
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,010
I’m going out to get some fresh air.

459
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,300
Why did Old Han leave?

460
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,900
Go accompany him.

461
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,700
How are you? You accept it?

462
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,020
You've already announced it to the world. How can I not accept?

463
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,700
Though, to be held in heart by a crowd like this,

464
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,820
it is a happy thing.

465
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,250
Terrific!

466
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,030
Hey, I'll go smooth it out with Han Shangyan.

467
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,820
- Thank you.
- Here.

468
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,730
Elder, I get the feeling that you're a little nervous.

469
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,730
This... good or bad, amongst so many of us computer boys,

470
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,940
you're the first female geek in the Country.

471
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,260
You won't be afraid of one celebrity match, will you?

472
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,390
I just feel like this came all of a sudden. You guys didn’t tell me earlier.

473
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,610
A moment ago I almost cried, even.

474
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:53,220
They deliberately told us to do it.

475
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,410
It was just... to give you all a surprise.

476
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,290
Don’t worry.

477
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,700
Blood fight to the end.

478
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,950
Of course K&K must win!

479
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,300
Demo, don't be too agitated.

480
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,800
- Keep fighting!
- Keep fighting!

481
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,010
- How are you feeling?
- Status off the chart.

482
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,980
- No problem!
- Safe bet.

483
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,000
Captain, after we've won, how about we go for hot pot?

484
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,830
It's a must!

485
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,620
- Captain!
- Captain!

486
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,660
- Keep fighting!
- Keep fighting! Keep fighting!

487
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,900
Did you really not know it in advance?

488
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,220
Surprise!

489
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,370
Wasn't it a hit? Wasn't it emotional?

490
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,600
How old are you? You're still playing these games.

491
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,580
Hey, this time I didn't rig your ballots.

492
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,620
It was the genuine poll by the fans.

493
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,840
Anyway in a bit, it will be a public announcement. No matter what, you have to play.

494
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,900
You really think that I’m scared of you?

495
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,440
Old Han, it’s not that you are scared.

496
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,130
I want to see your competition. Everyone wants to see your competition.

497
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,040
Take it as making our dream come true. And yours, too.

498
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,480
Old Han.

499
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,200
Please. Please.

500
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,670
Since you’re not talking, I’ll take it as you agreed.

501
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,030
I’ll leave now.

502
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,050
What are you laughing at?

503
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,120
Laughing at you acting cool. Doesn’t matter if you act cool, I’m not scared of you.

504
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,000
Do you know how much I envy Yaya?

505
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,290
I want to watch you have a competition too.

506
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,350
Didn't I play once for you when we were in Sanya?

507
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,870
That time doesn’t count. Right now here is the stadium.

508
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,800
It's the stadium where you won the championship that year.

509
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,250
I’m old.

510
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,850
What old? You are in your prime now, okay?

511
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,000
In your prime!

512
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,780
<i>The players on both sides have concluded the warm-up.</i>

513
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,400
- It's starting. Let's hurry back in!
- <i>The official competition is about to begin.</i>

- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- <i>All the audience in the arena, get ready!</i>

Congratulations.

00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,470
You guys were great too.

533
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,530
Still not here.

534
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,060
Finally came.

535
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,370
Welcome. Welcome.

536
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,340
One, two, three.

537
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,630
Welcome.

538
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,850
- Why are you standing?
- Let's drink up.

539
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,690
- Let's go, let's go.
- Don't be polite.

540
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,970
Sit there.

541
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,480
I seem to be seeing someone brining a family member.

542
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,790
Old Han, I even have a child but I am not so obvious as you.

543
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,840
That's right. It's only that someone finally wants you.

544
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,330
Is it necessary that you need to bring her to the pre competition gathering?

545
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,420
Are you all done yet?

546
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,230
Don't mind this group of old gansters.

547
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,150
What are you saying?

548
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,960
Who is the gangster?

549
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,020

That's right. Let's eat.

552
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,000
Ou Qiang, don't just sit there. Have a beer.

553
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,160
I won't have the beer, it's carbonated.

554
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,110
I don't want to burp in the competition.

555
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:18,290
You are the only left still competing. Let me message you here.

556
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:21,520
- Massage the back, the back!
- This hand, this hand?
- That hurts!

557
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,080
That hurts! Little Mi! Why did you put all your strength into it?

558
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,780
Oh right, who can help me analyze the opposition? I didn't pay attention to the voting result just now.

559
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,160
There's nothing to really analyze. The first five on the ranking list are our opponents.

560
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,260
Look. After all these years, you five are still at the top.

572

Did you realize that in these ten years, this old alleyway has changed a lot?

573
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,080
Yeah.

Do you still remember ten years ago, when the two of us fought here?

576
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,120
You still have the nerve to mention it?

577
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,730
The two of us, can it be called fighting?

578
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,450
Obviously it was me being hit by you like a sandbag.

579
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,360
- I really miss it.
- What do you miss?

580
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,600
- You miss the days that you got hit by me?
- You're the one who needs to get hit.

581
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,340
What I miss is ten years ago, when we were in this alleyway.

582
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,330
Those happy days.

583
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,810
Last night I drank too much, and did not have time to say...

584
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,480
You, a poor boy,

585
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,250
shouldering up SP's China region, is really not easy.

586
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,140
You haven't lost face for your bros.

587
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,590
It is especially not easy.

588
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:21,580
You're the same. Team K&K is also one of the top teams in the country.

589
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,470
Starting a business was hard, wasn't it?

590
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,300
It's alright.

591
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,140
But it was Nanwei who had to shoulder a lot, made him suffer quite a bit.

592
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,620
Don't you harm Su Cheng's husband!

593
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,100
You still care a lot about an old relationship.

594
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,080
Of course!

595
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,420
Does Old Han treat you well?

596
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,600
He treats me well.

597
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,700
- Really?
- Yup.

598
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,600
What is this? A pair here and a pair there.

599
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,000
Can you guys consider my feelings?

600
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,250
What are you laughing at?

601
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,340
If we're asking who is the most despicable, you would win without a doubt!

602
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,610
You guys don't know, do you? Little Mi has a hardcore fan. So beautiful.

603
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,830
She likes Little Mi so much.

604
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,900
You, take your time eating.

605
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,110
Where are you going, Little Mi?

606
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,540
What are you up to?

607
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,560
I really don't know what that female fan likes in Little Mi.

608
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,160
I reckon... it's to get rid of evil for the people.

609
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,760
- That fan is my classmate, she especially likes Little Mi.
- Really?

610
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,250
Talk less about others, and hurry up with your own!

611
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,280
What do I have to be anxious about? I'm so handsome.

612
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,010
Sister-in-Law, a toast to you.

613
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,790
No need to call me Sister-in-Law, just call me Tong Nian.

614
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,690
How did you and Han Shangyan meet?

615
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,670
Is he a ten thousand-year-old bachelor?

616
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,290
How come when everyone sees me, they always ask me this?

617
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,030
True statement there.

618
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:03,170
He found a girlfriend with the same momentum of Mars hitting Earth.

619
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,820
That's right!

620
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,930
Say, you men are especially uninteresting.

621
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,760
Incessantly asking a young lady this one question.

622
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,580
Then if you are capable, why don't you go and ask Han Shangyan?

623
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,240
- Right now I'll–
- You'll go?

624
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,120
I... don't dare.

625
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,390
We're already thirty something, who would go to get scolded for no reason.

626
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,000
Honestly, these years for us bros,

627
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,980
we feel the most sorry to him and Solo.

628
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,770
That year, everyone disbanded and everyone had left.

629
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,380
So we ask after him a lot, don't be too annoyed.

630
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,940
I won't.

631
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,290
That's right. Back then we were all too young.

632
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,500
Yeah.

633
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,390
Solo and Old Han.

634
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,050
Honestly,

635
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:53,520
if it wasn't for Solo, everyone here, including Old Han,

636
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,480
there'd be no way that all of us from all over the country would come together and create a team.

637
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,470
If it wasn't for Han Shangyan, we wouldn't have been able to get food.

638
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,560
We wouldn't have made it either.

639
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,370
I knew long ago that they would bury the hatchet.

640
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,980
Who hasn't been young before?

641
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,710
A bunch of jerks! But once they are done being jerks–

642
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,600
They are still bros.

643
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,370
Look at the two of them.

644
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,960
Getting teary eyed just talking about it.

645
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,390
Come.

646
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,630
Come!

647
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,110
I am about to start the match.

648
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,410
I've been waiting for you guys to go up!

649
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,500
All of our fan group is watching the live broadcast. Everyone is crazy excited.

650
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,430
D-did you receive the masks?

651
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,280
I received it! I'm opening it now.

652
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,740
<i>My friend gave me two boxes of masks.</i>

653
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:58,720
There're so many masks!

654
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,280
Then 97 and the group of kids, while I wasn't paying attention, they took one box.

655
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,930
So, it wasn't easy for me to keep the one box. I'm giving it to you.

656
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,830
You should've just left it for yourself to use!

657
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:15,090
<i>What does a grown man need with face masks?</i>

658
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,700
<i>When I got this box of things, the first person I thought of was you.</i>

659
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,040
<i>I don't know why. Do you know why?</i>

660
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,200
Why aren't you saying anything?

661
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,880
Nothing! Just that your writing is pretty nice.

662
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,550
<i>Really?</i>

663
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,700
My handwriting is a bit ugly.

664
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,740
<i>Did you eat yet?</i>

665
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,420
<i>They are still eating upstairs.</i>

666
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,850
- I'm so stuffed.
- Here they come. Yes.

667
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,570
On the phone for so long, aren't you afraid–

668
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,680
afraid that the phone will explode?

669
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,850
Can't chat anymore, we are heading out.

670
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:02,110
Okay, go then my idol! You mustn't lose face for us old fans!

671
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,690
You can do it!

672
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,510
Wow...
