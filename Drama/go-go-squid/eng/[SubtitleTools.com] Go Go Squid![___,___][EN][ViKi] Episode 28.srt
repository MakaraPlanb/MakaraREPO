22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,100
I didn't expect your room to be so clean.

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,300
Because I have it cleaned regularly.

24
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,200
Don't you have cleaning ladies at your club?

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
Can't they clean for you?

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,800
The lady is getting older. Also, she's One's mother.

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,000
Their family needs this job.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Besides, I'm away from my room for set intervals. It's pretty clean and easy to tidy up.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Who'd have thought that you were actually a conscientious employer.

30
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,700
I don't like people to consider me an employer, so they all call me "boss."

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,600
How come all your clothes are black?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,300
In truth, you might look good in white, as well.

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,800
I'm not a little girl.

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,200
What's the use of looking good?

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,200
W-Why are you packing?

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,700
The team manager is going back to Norway.

38
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,500
This season I have to set the games myself.

39
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,600
Also, I'm not going to come back often to this house.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,900
Then, what about Grandpa?

41
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,700
Grandpa is going back home in two days. Little Bai is going to accompany him.

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,300
What are you looking at me for?

43
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,500
Do you need any help?

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,000
No need.

45
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,400
Grandpa! I'll peel it for you.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,500
Give it to me, Grandpa.

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,400
- You'll peel it?
- Yes, I'll do it for you.

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
All right, all right.

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
Enough, enough.

50
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,600
Give it to me.

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,080
Then... Then peel it for Grandpa.

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,700
Right, he'll peel it.

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Did you watch any movie upstairs?

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,600
We didn't watch anything, we were just chatting.

55
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,300
Good, good.

56
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,300
Eat.

57
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,400
Grandpa, have a taste.

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,700
- I won't. Did you wash your hands?
- I did.

59
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,500
Then I'll have a taste.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,600
How sweet!

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
It's so sweet, Grandpa. Won't you try a piece? If you don't try it, you may regret it.

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,000
Have one.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,500
If you give it to me, I'll have it.

64
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,800
It's so good.

65
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,400
Nian Nian, this time going back, I'm afraid it will be hard for me to come back.

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,700
See, these long haul flights... for an old man are hard to withstand.

67
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,100
Say, if Grandpa misses you, what should he do?

68
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,800
This way, Grandpa, if you want to–

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,200
When we have time, I'll take her to see you.

70
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,400
R-R-Really? Kid, don't go back on your word!

71
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
Well, you also have to wait for her to have time. She's still studying–

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,700
I have time! I have time at any moment!

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,900
All right.

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,300
Did you hear that?

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,100
Grandpa, eat.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,200
Very sweet!

77
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,600
Thank you for coming today. Grandpa was very happy.

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,000
You're too polite.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,600
I like chatting with Grandpa, too.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
Where should I take you? Back home or to the university?

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,400
To the university.

82
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,200
When are we going to see the cat?

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,800
You're a very strange person.

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,100
How come you keep missing something you gave away? What is it, do you want it back?

85
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,380
Look at you! You're always distorting what I say.

86
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,700
I didn't mean it like that.

87
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,100
In two days. As soon as I've packed up for Squiddy, I'll take you to see it.

88
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,300
Wait a moment! What did you say?

89
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,600
You called it "Squiddy"?

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Yes.

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
Th-That's my Internet name!

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,600
How could you give it my Internet name?

93
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,100
Your name is "Little Squid," its name is "Squiddy." How's that the same?

94
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,600
Little Squid gave me Squiddy.

95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Did you say a tongue twister? Was it on purpose?

96
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
Yeah, on purpose.

97
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,800
And no need to choose a name; it comes rather easily.

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,600
Wait... You called it "Squiddy."

99
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,600
But it's a cat! Cats eat fish!

100
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
That's so twisted!

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Is it?

102
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Anyway, it has not grown used to it yet.

103
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,900
You can change its name.

104
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,000
Can you change a name so easily?

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,400
If I called you "Tong Shangyan," would you like that?

106
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,600
"Tong Shangyan"?

107
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,400
I like it.

108
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,900
"Tong - Shang - yan"...

109
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,240
Han Nian!

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Seatbelt!

111
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,600
Nian Nian! Constantly smiling even while you're programming?

112
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
What's making you so happy?

113
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Do you have any software that needs to be debugged? I'll do it for you.

114
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,800
When you cry you debug, when you smile you debug, too?

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,400
Anyway, I have nothing to do. I'll do some work for you...

116
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,800
Are you so good?

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Of course!

118
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,100
Yaya, say, the two of us have already broken up twice.

119
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,800
Can we get back together?

120
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,500
The two of you... You two, can you call that a "breakup"?

121
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
That's called "playing house."

122
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,160
But my mother super-dislikes him.

123
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,200
I don't even dare tell my mom the truth.

124
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,800
Han Shangyan is not bad!

125
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,000
I look at it from the side. Next to you, there's no better guy than him.

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,700
Really?

127
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,900
Maybe it's because my mom's a teacher, so she just doesn't like Han Shangyan's type.

128
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,400
It's not that... I think it's because they haven't had enough interaction.

129
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
You have to create a chance for them to be more in touch.

130
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,500
A guy like Han Shangyan... his good aspects are all hidden away.

131
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,300
You need to go deep in the relationship to be clear on them.

132
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't worry.

133
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,100
<i>So, you've lived with your mother since you were little.</i>

134
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,600
<i>My father passed early on. So ever since I was little, my mother and I have been relying on each other.</i>

135
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,200
<i>This was my responsibility to begin with.</i>

136
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,900
Your mother really loves you.

137
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,800
Look, your family conditions are not so good, yet she didn't make you go look for a job as soon as you graduated.

138
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,000
Right. My mother always says that studying is more important.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,100
"Knowledge can change fate."

140
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,600
- Mom! Aunt!
- Hey, you're back.

141
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,000
- Tong Nian!
- Zheng Hui, how come you're here?

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,700
The lab sent a little bonus, so I just came to bring some gifts to Uncle and Auntie.

143
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,000
Mom! What's this? He hasn't even graduated, how can you take presents from him?

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Auntie didn't take them!

145
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,700
Look at that! You got the kid scared. Have a seat, don't mind her.

146
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Sit.

147
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,700
Look, Zheng Hui's so capable. He can even help me pick the beans.

148
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,000
Can you do that?

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,500
You usually don't even let me do that. Isn't that right, Summer?

150
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,300
With housework, it's enough that one can do it.

151
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,400
As I see it, our Nian Nian is naturally blessed with good fortune.

152
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,400
That is true, too. Anyway, I'll always have someone to do it for me.

153
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,200
Auntie, I'll take this to the kitchen for you.

154
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,500
No need, no need! You're a guest! We'll take care of it. It doesn't matter.

155
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300
- It's nothing!  Don't take me for an outsider...
- Sit down, sit down. Have a talk with Auntie.

156
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
- Go.
- All right, I'll take it for you.

157
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,400
All right.

158
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
- Sit there.
- Fine.

159
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,100
Here. Let's have a chat.

160
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,600
Mom! Mom...

161
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,500
That...

162
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,900
Just say it.

163
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,500
Mom, you know? Grandpa Han is going back home.

164
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Back to Norway?

165
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,500
That... how come I haven't heard of it?

166
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,800
How do you know?

167
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,400
I...? I just...

168
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,500
Was it Han Shangyan who told you?

169
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,200
How come you're still in touch with him even now? "Ssh" what?

170
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,300
Lower your voice... We're just friends. Really, just friends.

171
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Wait... I wasn't talking to you about that.

172
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,100
I wanted to say... Look, Grandpa Han is getting on with age.

173
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Going back this time, he doesn't know when he can come again.

174
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,700
If you don't go and visit him, isn't that inappropriate?

175
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,000
Visit whom?

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,700
You... You... who do you want to visit? Tell the truth?

177
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,400
- Of course, I mean Grandpa Han!
- Grandpa Han... Grandpa Han...

178
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,800
There's no time like the present.

179
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,400
How about we go visit Grandpa Han this afternoon, how's that?

180
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,300
You're even more in a rush than us. Are you that anxious?

181
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,600
Rush? How am I rushing? But Grandpa Han is in a rush!

182
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,100
Look. His age is so advanced... can he not rush it?

183
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,000
Mom, you don't know how pitiful Grandpa Han is.

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,400
Ever since he came back to China, he hasn't even been once to see the old village.

185
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,300
There's no one to take him.

186
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,500
He doesn't even know what his old village has turned into.

187
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,900
How about... we take him to see the old town? How about it?

188
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,600
- To Suzhou?
- Yes, Suzhou!

189
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,200
That's true, too. Your grandfather and he were both from there.

190
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,700
Look! Isn't that destiny?

191
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,900
With such a strong bound, let's just take him back to see the town.

192
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,200
But in any case, this thing needs to be talked over with him. He needs to agree first.

193
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Fine, fine. Then I'll go ask. I'll go ask.

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Come back! Come back!

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,400
I'm telling you! You don't need to look into this matter. I'll take care of it.

196
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
Wash the green beans for me.

197
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Okay.

198
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,200
Going this weekend?

199
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,500
All right! pYes, yes, no problem.

200
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't worry! I'll organize it.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,200
Right! Going with two cars.

202
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,500
Little Han doesn't know the road? Doesn't matter, then our car will take the lead.

203
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,400
- Nian Nian, have this yogurt.
- Yes, don't worry.

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,400
What are you watching on TV to make you so happy?

205
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,600
Isn't this ad very funny?

206
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,000
- Is it?
- It is!

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,700
- What's so funny?
- It's very funny!

208
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,000
What's to laugh about this ad?

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Look at you! Brought you happiness...

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,700
What is it?

212
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Grandpa, I am going to go say hello.

213
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,170
Wait, wait! They have a lot of people over there.

214
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,400
Go tell Nian Nian to sit in our car!

215
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,120
Little Han.

216
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,720
Hello Uncle and Auntie. Hello, everybody.

217
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,160
Your car looks pretty crowded.

218
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,810
Do you want to let someone go and sit in our car?

219
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,060
Okay! Then I'll go.

220
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,330
Dounan, why don't you go sit over there?

221
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,890
Okay!

222
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,260
Little Han, you don't know the road to Suzhou too well. Do you?

223
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,220
That's okay, we have a navigation system.

224
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,790
No need for navigation. You guys can just follow behind my car!

225
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,530
Okay. Then, since it's a rainy day, drive slowly!

226
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:00,000
It's nothing! I looked at the weather report. It's raining here but it is sunny in Suzhou.

227
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,410
Okay.

228
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,510
- Nian Nian!
- You drive slowly, too!

229
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,950
- Hurry and get in the car!
- Get in the car.

230
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,070
Hello, Grandpa.

231
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,690
I didn't realize last time but Little Han is pretty well-mannered.

232
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,250
Drive.

233
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,310
Everyone, quickly go to the restroom! I'll stay here to watch the cars.

234
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,630
- Uncle, it must've been hard for you on the road. Are you tired?
- Not tired, not tired.

235
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,160
I'll go and buy everyone some water.

236
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,030
Go! Then you guys can go first, too. I'll accompany Uncle and walk slowly.

237
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,400
- Okay!
- Go!

238
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,290
Uncle, look how interesting it is! The moment we leave Shanghai, it is so sunny!

239
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,580
No matter how sunny or how tired I am,

240
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,640
I should still return to my old home and take a look.

241
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,160
They say "Fallen leaves return to the roots."
<i>(T/N: going back to one's origin.)</i>

242
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,910
My funeral matters will have to be handed over to my grandson.

243
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,080
At that time, he can bring me back here.

244
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,050
You guys can help me find a piece of land that will be closer to Old Tong.

245
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,010
The things you are saying! Your body is still so healthy. You're thinking too much.

246
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,100
Once you are at my age, you start counting down.

247
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,790
No skirting around it.

248
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,980
Look. My grandson really is pitiful.

249
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,430
His dad and mom died early. His stepmom has re-married.

250
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,510
If I am gone too,

251
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,440
he really will be an orphan.

252
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,160
Take it slowly!

253
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,520
Nian Nian, you're back?

254
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,700
This is water, and these are popsicles.

255
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,140
- Then, Uncle, we're going over first.
- Okay, okay!

256
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,740
Grandpa, this is a room temperature one for you! Cold ones aren't good for your health.

257
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,890
I steeped some tea for you. Get in the car and drink it!

258
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,190
It's rare that you are so filial.

259
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,430
You scolded it into me.

260
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,080
No, I will drink this one. She was filial, too.

261
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,100
- I'll drink this one!
- Okay!

262
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,590
- Thank you!
- You're welcome, Grandpa.

263
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,220
I bought this one for you!

264
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,930
For you.

265
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,200
A popsicle!

266
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,230
What are you doing? Did I say I was giving it to you?

267
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,760
- Then I'll give it back to you!
- You've already eaten it, how can I eat it now?

268
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,090
I'm your younger brother! This...
<i>(T/N: Cousin and sibling are akin)</i>

269
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,260
Even if you're my younger brother, once you've eaten it, can I still eat it? You're too disgusting!

270
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,820
- Dounan! Dounan! Come, come.
- Grandpa.

271
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,660
The weather is hot. I want to go wash my hands again.

272
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,290
- I'll go to the car and get you a towel!
- No, no! Don't go!

273
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,460
I'm going to wash my hands. Help me go!

274
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,640
He is really so annoying, right?

275
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,130
But I still have other ones here. Which do you want to eat?

276
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,820

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,870
Anxious. I am so anxious!

336
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,950
Right, right! I am also anxious!

337
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,430
Then, everyone, keep chatting. I'm going to go see if there is anything they need help with.

338
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,960
Then I... Then I will go see, too!

339
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,420
Why are you going? Why are you going?

340
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,740
I'm going to go see if he has something he needs help with.

341
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,030
I'm afraid that he won't be able to do it alone.

342
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,670
- I'm going!
- Mom, then I'll go, too!

343
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,360
You don't go! Sit here.

344
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,190
Stay with the elders to chat. Be good.

345
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,800
- What is this?
- Green dumplings.

346
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,170
Look!

347
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,570
Do you need me to help?

348
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,870
No need, no need. Go take a stroll around!

349
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,560
- You really don't need help?
- No need!

350
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,240
What is so fragrant?

351
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,410
Green dumplings. Don't touch them. These are very hot.

352
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,320
When are we going to eat dinner?

353
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,010
Soon!

354
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,290
- You made it so tasty!
- Really?

355
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,220
Have you been here before?

356
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,720
Probably when I was younger.

357
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,160
But I can't really remember clearly anymore.

358
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,350
If it wasn't for my mom telling me, I wouldn't even know!

359
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,460
Our families came from the same place.

360
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,140
What are you trying to express? That we are fated?

361
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,980
Those fated will meet from afar.

362
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,050
- Do you know what the next line is?
- What?

363
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,560
You don't even know that?

364
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,780
If not fated, even being face-to-face will be for naught.

365
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,640
That's an interesting pun. Interesting.

366
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,660
Let's go over there and look around!

367
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,860
Young man, do you know how to play chess?

368
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,940
A little bit.

369
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,660
Why don't you play a game?

370
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,540
- Come, come!
- Thank you.

371
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,520
Come! Don't be polite!

372
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,900
Come.

373
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,310
Young man, can you do it?

374
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,570
I'll try.

375
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,800
If you win today, whatever you want to eat or drink, just take it!

376
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,740
- Okay!
- Let's play!

377
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,170
Head gun. <i>(T/N: a common opening move in Chinese chess where the cannon is moved to the central column)</i>

378
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,900
Move the chariot.

379
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,990
No check. No check.

380
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,600
You know how to play chess, too?

381
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,760
I know a little bit of the four arts.
<i>(T/N: i.e. zither, chess, calligraphy and painting)</i>

382
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,840
Young man, you're so smart!

383
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,800
That's right.

384
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,290
I'll take your cannon and check your chariot.

385
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,480
Old Wei, you should move your horse up and battle the cannon.

386
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,670
All you do is talk. You play with him.

387
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,540
No more. Nope. No more.

388
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,330
Not playing!

389
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,070
Look at you. Since you lost, treat them.

390
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,210
All right, I'll treat. Take whatever you want to eat or drink. Get it yourself.

391
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,590
Take whatever you want to drink.

392
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,630
What do you want to drink?

393
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,640
The one on the top shelf.

394
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,620
- This one.
- No, on the left.

395
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,750
Then I will just take a bottle of Vitamin C.

396
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,040
Take more. I am not that cheap.

397
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,100
It's okay. This one is fine.

398
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,490
Young fellow, one more round.

399
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,590
Go ahead.

400
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,750
I played chess for forty years already.

401
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,510
Will I lose to a young fellow like you?

402
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,240
Go ahead.

403
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,070
Han Shanyang, have some juice.

404
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,160
What did you take?

405
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,220
Why do you keep photographing me?

406
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,600
To get the shot of you winning.

407
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,070
Drink more. One bottle of this every day and you'll be healthy.

408
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,800
Beat him a couple more times and get more bottles.

409
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,180
All right. I'll win over him.

410
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,400
How is that possible?

411
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,870
What photos did you take before?

412
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,300
I am not telling you.

413
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,050
Show me.

414
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,450
What is this? You made me look so ugly.

415
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,600

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,240
A decade ago, we even went to his home to play.

Three. Halfway one of them quit, so that left us with two.

Did they ever have the opportunity to compete?

437
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,150
Actually, they didn't.

438
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,130
Originally, we wanted to wait for their skills to improve a bit more and help them create a team, too.

439

We didn't expect that we would disband first.

Why?

461
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,210
I'm afraid that the elders will misunderstand.

00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,970
Besides, I still have to go return the guitar.

463
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,150
Okay. Then... I'll go back first.

What happened? Where did you go?

472
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,660
I went out to look for a bathroom.

473
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,590
Looking for a bathroom? And you looked for the whole afternoon?

474
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:14,480
No, I was just walking around nearby. Maybe you just didn't notice me.

475
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,190
Don't you feel ashamed to make so many adults wait for you?

476
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,490
Okay, okay. Here, Big Sister, I'll give this to you.

477
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,710

00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,250
Okay! Eat, eat!

00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,300

480
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,040
I-I don't know.

481
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,380
Don't bother with him! That child, he likes to play.

482
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,790
Let's eat first. We still need to rush back.

483
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,140
- Don't wait!
- He's already thirty!

484
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,980
And he still likes to play this much? What's with him?

485
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,600
- Don't bother with him!
- Eat, eat!

486
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,660
- It's tasty!
- It is.

487
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,430

Sorry, everyone. I was a little delayed due to something to settle with work.

Where did you go? At your age!

491
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,290

At the village entrance, there is a little boy who plays guitar particularly well.

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,830
His love songs got me inebriated, so I was delayed for a while.

00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,190
You've had a long day, you should get some rest.

504
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,380
If there's anything, just press the button near the bed to call me.

505
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,100
Wait, wait.

506
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,480
Sit down and chat.

507
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,680
It's already 10:00 p.m., what do you want to chat about?

508
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,450
Yeah, it's already 10:00 p.m.!

509
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,960
And you're still going to start working?

510
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,240
No, no.

511
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,400
What are you doing sitting over there? Are you a judge?

512
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,960
Come over here. Sit on the bed.

513
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,480
I still have some work matters to handle.

514
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,120
In fact, most of them are matters abroad so there is a time difference.

515
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,290
I want to talk to you about that.

516
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,450
You can't keep enduring like this.

517
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,590
You need to think about how to cherish your health.

518
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,190
Yes.

519
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,510
Say, when I'm over there, I still have someone to take care of me.

520
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,840
You are here, and you have to rely on yourself.

521
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,300
Yes.

522
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,700
Also,

523
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:23,020
if you don't have enough money, tell me. Okay?

524
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,270
I'm not short on money.

525
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,190
In a couple of years,

526
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,910
if you are willing to part with your friends in Norway, I'll bring you back to live here.

527
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,680
Bring me over to live?

528
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,970
Then the two of us will be fighting all day.

529
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,160
If I'm not angered to death, then you will be angered to death!

530
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,510
And you're still laughing?

531
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,780
Get some rest. Goodnight.

532
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,080
Eat some vitamin C.

533
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,690
Got it!

534
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,570
Drink more water!

535
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,210
Okay!

536
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,940
Grandpa is asleep?

537
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,730
Rubbish. Of course, what time is it?

538
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,530
When you take Grandpa back to Norway, don't talk about me too much.

539
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,420
I don't want to make him worry.

540
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,210
And you, within three days, get back here and train.

541
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,910
You talk about me. It's so late, where are you going?

542
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,140
Tomorrow, Su Cheng is going back to Norway.

543
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,430
No one is taking care of the kids at the club.

544
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,190
If I don't go back, who will take care of them?

In the future, help your cousin out.

Do you think in the past I didn't really understand him?

557
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,070
A little.

558
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,670
Then, why didn't you say anything to me?

559
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,470
I use my actions to support him, isn't that a message to you?

560
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,220
That's true.

561

- Let's go.
- Go, go.

00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,510
I want to ask you. Do you really want to chase me out that badly?

563

I don't mean that.

564
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,400
Go, go. Make me a cup of the tea Nian Nian gave to me.

Reluctant to leave this place?

569
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,070
There's nothing I hate to part with here.

570
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,680
I hate to part with the people here.

571

I want to. I want to! Okay?

Your grandpa has most of his life; I've seen a lot of people.

Okay. I can go in myself. You don't need to accompany me.

How can I not worry?

00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,080
It's because...

617
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,410
I know that I need to go back.

618
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,120
I got too emotional today.

619
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,750
All right. As long as it's not a new illness, then it is okay.

620
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,870
Even though you like to pretend in front of me every time,

621
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:50,030
in reality, you actually have angina. Don't you?

622
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,750
I have been taking care of myself.

623
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,070
Once I am free, I'll arrange for you to get a full body checkup.

624

Don't be so temperamental in the future.

Aren't you the same?

626
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,710
You have it so hard here!

I miss you! I miss Little Bai!

633
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,510
So what if I have to fly back and forth? Do you even have to care about that?

634
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,600
How old are you already?

635
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,760
Your temper is still so bad.

636
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,640
It's because we care about you.

when you are my age,

640
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,350
if I can see you guys one more time, it is one more time.

641
00:42:53,830 --> 00:43:00,500
Because... if I see you one time, it is one time less.

642

You will definitely live to be a hundred!
