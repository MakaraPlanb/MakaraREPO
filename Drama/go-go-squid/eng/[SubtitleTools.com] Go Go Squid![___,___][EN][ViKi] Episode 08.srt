47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,700
No, Captain brought back many tasty foods for me.

48
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,520
This is round two; I've already eaten.

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,810

126
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,260
Grandpa, you really like to watch the New Year's Gala?

You watch the replay right as you wake up.

128

130

134
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,370
It's good. The aftertaste is kind of sweet.

135

136
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,290

137
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,190

- Right?
- Yes.

142
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,740
Tea leaves are important, but water is too.

143
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,760
I understand.

144
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,260
Quality water for brewing quality tea.

145
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,710
Boss, you're back!

146
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,450
Slow down. You just finished running and you're sneaking back to your room to sleep?

147
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,260
Did you die from sleepiness in your previous life?

148
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,610
Grandpa, don't get angry. I'll pour you some more tea.

149
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,810
- Okay.
- I'll fill the cup.

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,750
Nope. Yesterday, Grandpa told me not to cook today.

153
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,570
What are you going to do again?

154
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,430
Today is the first day of the New Year.

155
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,190
Of course, I want my granddaughter-in-law to come make dumplings for me.

157

You're dating?

158
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,010
Don't dump it on me.

159
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,840
Fine, fine, fine. Don't be so flippant now.

160

164
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,410
Then, who's picking up Nian Nian?

165
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,960
I'll go pick her up for you.

166
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,140
Then Grandpa, I'll be going.

167
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,540

Boss, Boss! Going empty-handed on New Year's isn't really good.

175
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,900
Aren't you going to buy something?

176
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,030
Buy what?

177
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,050
New Year's treats, of course! Like peanuts, sunflower seeds, snacks like that.

178
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,290
Does Sister-in-Law's family have any kids? Buy them some snacks, too.

179
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,230
If that doesn't work, you can spare a bit.

180
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,900
Go to the seafood market and buy some fish or shrimp.

181
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,970
At least it's better than going empty-handed.

182
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,640
Anyways, my mom brings gifts like that.

183
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,690
Also, me following you in there isn't the best.

184
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,000
Wait for me in the car.

185
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,790
Okay!

186
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,960
This melon is sweet, want one? The flavor is especially good.

187
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,200
And this mango, want it?

188
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,860
This is imported from Japan, it's very sweet.

189
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,460
Take one.

190
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,840
Gifting tangerines on New Year's, it's good luck.

191
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,740
- Just take whatever, as long as it looks nice.
- Okay, okay.

192
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,920
Should I use a gift box and wrap it?

193
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,210
Young man, are you visiting relatives?

194
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,970
Is he wishing a Happy New Year or collecting a debt? Dressed all in black...

195
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,800
Coming.

196
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,960
Who is it?

197
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,960
Who is it?

198
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,000
Little Han?

199
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,220
Auntie, I'm... here to wish you a Happy New Year.

200
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,160
Come in.

201
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,670
Who is it?

202
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,860
I'll move here.

203
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,980
Right.

204
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,570
I'll move...

205
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,480
What is it? Who came?

206
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,570
Woah, who's this?

207
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,310
Little Han? Why're you here?

208
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,190
Hello, everyone.

209
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,930
We just ate New Year's Eve dinner last night,

210
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,740
you don't have to specially come and wish a Happy New Year today.

211
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,110
Well, since Grandpa really likes Tong Nian,

212
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,950
he wanted me to invite her to come and have a meal.

213
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,440
Then, does Tong Nian know about this?

214
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,140
No.

215
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,390
Here, here, Little Han.

216
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,400
That must be heavy. Put it down.

217
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,860
Little Han. Come and sit.

218
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,160
Sit. Get Nian Nian, quickly.

219
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,550
You came from so far, why are you gifting fruits? You could just come.

220
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,310
Little Han, sit for a bit.

221
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,920
I'll go upstairs and call Nian Nian down for you.

222
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,990
Doesn't that fruit basket look familiar?

223
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,890
How could it not look familiar?

224
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,770
He bought it from the fruit shop at the head of the street.

225
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,780
Seems that Nian Nian has it very tough with him.

226
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,580
Our Nian Nian is so well-behaved, of course, she'll have it tough.

227
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,110
Look how old he is. He's still playing games!

228
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,960
Aren't you two also playing?

229
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,370
What?

230
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,790
How could there be a person like that?

231
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,870
Keep playing! I'll move here.

232
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,090
- Han Shangyan is here?
- Yeah.

233
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,500
He said he's taking you out for a meal.

234
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,270
I don't know if his grandpa wants to or if he does.

235
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,500
This hairstyle will not work! It's all flat! I need to go wash my hair!

236
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,150
Didn't you just wash your hair last night?

237
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,200
It's not the same. All the girls are like this.

238
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,300
Okay, okay.

239
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,570
Dad, does this look good on me? The jacket.

240
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,870
- It's okay.
- Never mind, you don't understand.

241
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,770
- Dad, go outside. I have to change!
- What?

242
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,830
- I've never seen you panic like this for your tests before.
- Get out, get out.

243
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,570
Hurry up!

244
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,390
Hi, you're here?

245
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,010
Grandpa said he missed you. If it's convenient, come and have a meal with us.

246
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,800
I'm free!

247
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,400
I'm free, I'm free. Of course, I can.

248
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,250
Uncle, Auntie. Then, I'll take Tong Nian along.

249
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,160
I'll bring her back after dinner.

250
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,150
I'm telling you! You must be back before seven.

251
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,290
Seven? Look what time it is already!

252
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,770
Don't worry about the time. Have fun.

253
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,920
Thanks, Daddy.

254
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,470
We're leaving.

255
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,200
Sister-in-Law!

256
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,530
Why is there another person in the car?

257
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,320
Hi, Sister-in-Law. I'm...

258
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,330
Demo!

259
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,870
I just said my name once and you remembered?

260
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,300
- Yeah...
- Your memory is great.

261
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,870
Sister-in-Law, let me tell you,

262
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,600
Boss has never let anyone else sit in the front-passenger seat aside from you.

263
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,860
You can see how important you are to him.

264
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,990
You two, what're you chattering about?

265
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,710
Nothing.

266
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,810
Sister-in-Law, the vegetables are here.

267
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,860
How many fillings will there be?

268
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,830
Cabbage and pork, chives and egg, fennel. Some of each.

269
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,610
I love eating this Chinese cabbage!

270
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,580
Its name is "green cabbage."

271
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,720
Chinese cabbage looks like this.

272
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,080
Really?

273
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,010
I'll pick one.

274
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,610
How about this one? Petite and pretty.

275
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,770
You have a good eye! I think it's the one.

276
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,230
Does it look good?

277
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,930
What good?

278
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,590
There're so many folds. The smaller it is, the less water it contains.

279
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,090
If you are going to choose, pick a big one. There's more water. Got it?

280
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,820
A big one... The big ones have more water.

281
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,280
- Do you like eating that?
- Yeah.

282
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,160
- Take it.
- Okay.

283
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,590
This one?

284
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,220
Okay.

285
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,940
I saw all the members eating this; it's probably good.

286
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,720
Okay, okay.

287
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,250
Boss!

288
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,000
Why didn't you ask me?

289
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,070
Men don't eat snacks.

290
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,780
Men are people, too.

291
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,570
I want to eat this, is that okay? I want to.

292
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,200
Hurry and take what you want.

293
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,740
Okay.

294
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,950
Sister-in-Law, you're amazing.

295
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:07,700
Sister-in-Law, has Boss ever yelled at you?

296
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Indeed.

297
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,920
Indeed what?

298
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,700
It is said that men: if they are mean to outsiders, they are gentle to family.

299
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,980
Men who are mean to family, are a wuss to outsiders.

300
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,580
There's such a saying?

301
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,670
- He's really never been mean to you?
- No.

302
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,350
He's never been mean; he's pretty good to me.

303
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,850
What're you two chattering about?

304
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,820
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

305
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,490
Look at this difference in treatment.

306
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,230
He would usually scold me.

307
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,010
Really?

308
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,360
How about I carry some for you?

Boss, you're going to the market?

328
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,560
Boss, this stand has a lot of vegetables.

329
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,510
Which one is fennel?

330
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,500
Young man, this is fennel.

331
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,830
Boss, how much is it per catty?
<i>(1 catty is approx. 500g)</i>

332
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,130
¥10 per catty.
<i>(T/N: $1.45 per catty)</i>

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,750
¥10? Didn't it use to be ¥8?

334
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,360
These were picked today; they're fresh.

335
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,770
Not fresh; aren't these wilting?

336
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,520
I'll take one catty. Here.

337
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,600
These bell peppers look fresher than the ones in the store.

338
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,270
They're bigger, too. Boss, do you want to buy some?

339
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,870
Those are withered now, can't you tell?

340
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,030
How much?

341
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,770
- Sister-in-Law, hop in.
- Thank you.

Today, I want to eat fifty!

347
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,580
Fifty? You're so small but have such a large appetite.

348
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,390
You'll finish all of them before I even finish making them.

349
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,360
This... Do we make the filling first?

350
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,640
Machine-made wrappers don't taste good, didn't you know?

351
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,820
But machine-made wrappers are convenient.

352
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,190
Didn't we buy flour?

353
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,690
This, it's right here.

354
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,080
How do we do this?

355
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
Baidu it.
<i>(T/N: Search it up on Baidu, the "Chinese Google")</i>

356
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,730
- You two, get out.
- It's fine, we'll help–

357
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,890
Get out! Go chat with my grandpa. Quickly, quickly.

358
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,030
We really aren't helping him?

359
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,130
Team Captain.

360
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,990
He's over there.

361
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,710
We're eating dumplings today?

362
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,400
Two children don't know how to make dumplings.

363
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,050
Go and chop up the cabbage.

364
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,390
Why aren't you calling for take-out?

365
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,070
We've already bought everything, it'd be a waste not to make them.

366
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,670
And who'd deliver on New Year's?

367
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,690
Don't blabber; hurry and go.

368
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:13,980

369
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,010
What're you doing? Assessing the cabbage's physiognomy?

370
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,910
Weren't you the best at meticulous work?

371
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,000
How is this the same? This is harder than I imagined.

372
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,060
Next time we extend practice, I really have to teach you all how to cook.

373
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,720
Move.

374
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,010
- Come, come, come.
- Grandpa, have some fruits.

375
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,610
Thank you. Sit.

376
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,380
Thank you.

377
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,270
Sister-in-Law, there are so many ways to make dumplings on the web.

378
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,740
Just how should we wrap them?

379
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,890
People without skill can't wrap them.

380
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,750
Right, right.

381
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:27,760
Nian Nian, what do you like to do when you aren't studying?

382
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,700
I like singing and putting my recordings online.

383
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,340
- Really?
- Yes.

384
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,840
I love hearing singing the most!

385
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,030
Then what songs do you like? I can sing them for you.

386
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,210
Do you like listening to Cai Qin, Fei Yu Qing...
<i>(T/N: 1970s singers)</i>

387
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,670
No, no!

388
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:48,380
Grandpa likes to listen to The Legend of the Red Lantern. It's the one that goes like,
<i>(T/N: opera published in 1958)</i>

389
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,850
♪ Grandma, listen to me! ♪

390
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,060
Haven't heard it?

391
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,350
This used to be your grandpa's favorite song.

392
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,880
Oh, then.

393
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,720
"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy".
<i>(T/N: opera, 1958)</i>

394
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,070
You haven't heard that either?

395
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,020
No.

396
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,500
Grandpa, I've never heard of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy,"

397
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,580
but I've heard a small part of "The Legend of the Red Lantern." Do you want to listen to it?

398
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,560
Really? Sing a line! Sing a line!

399
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,600
Then, I'll start Grandpa.

400
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,680

00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,400

<i>Pour a cup of water.</i>

411
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,020
They're almost done; don't be impatient.

412
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,620
In a bit, wrap this in as well.

413
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,360
This is Nian Nian's New Year's present.

414
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,350
I purposely didn't let her see.

415
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,940
Later, it'll be a surprise for her.

416
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,700
Isn't that unsanitary?

417
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,290
It's been sterilized.

418
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,400
Take it.

419
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,920
You're going to throw a tantrum on New Year's?

420
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,640
Don't take this too seriously. What if we break up?

421
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,100
Say that again?

422
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,130
Go watch television, okay?

423
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,110
- Remember to put it in.
- I know, I know.

424
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,480
Did you hear anything?

425
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,460
What're you laughing about? Didn't you cause all of this?

426
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,450
Hurry and wrap it inside.

427
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,550
Demo, Demo! Go in and lend a hand.

428
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,960
Go, go help!

429
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,150
- Then I'll go, too!
- Oh, no-no-no!

430
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,850
Girls have to enjoy.

431
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,850
Let the boys do the work.

432
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,110
Here, sit, sit.

433
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,220
Eat some fruits with me.

434
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,240
Okay, Grandpa, what would you like to eat?

435
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,070
- The orange.
- Okay, I'll peel it.

436
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,970
Here.

437
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,460
This plate is for you.

438
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,350
Does Sister-in-Law avoid some foods or the filling was made especially for her?

439
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,750
I don't avoid any foods.

440
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,220
Then, that's fine. Just eat.

441
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,520
Han Shangyan made them specifically for her,

442
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,340
do you dare eat it?

443
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:30,420
- I dare not. Sister-in-Law, you eat.
- Thank you.

444
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,820
- I didn't make them that well. Just casually eat.
- It's no problem.

445
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,090
Good?

446
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,760
It's tasty.

447
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,620
Eat, eat up.

448
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,570
Nian Nian,

449
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:19,600
did you taste anything?

450
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,870
- Chives and egg.
- No, not that.

451
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:29,180
Like... like did you chew upon something that's a bit different?

452
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,530
What's happening?

453
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,630
This is for you.

454
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,920
For me?

455
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,930
New Year's gift.

456
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:53,130
Oh my... This young one, you didn't learn what I taught you.

457
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,610
Originally, I told him to take your present and wrap it inside a dumpling. Hurry and open it.

458
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,340
Thank you, Grandpa. I'll open it.

459
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,160
It's the initial letter of Boss's name!

460
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,510
Do you like it?

461
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,120
I like it, thank you.

462
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,990
I didn't buy it, Grandpa did.

463
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,230
Th-This...

464
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,220
Seriously.

465
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,740
- Put it somewhere safe.
- Okay.

466
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,950
Give it to me.

467
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,790
I'll wash the dishes. You made all the food.

468
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,970
Have you ever done chores at home?

469
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,770
A bit. But I know how to wash dishes.

470
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,880
Sit and watch television.

471
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,620
If Grandpa knows you're working, he'll yell at me to death.

472
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,810
Then, thanks for your hard work.

473
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,650
How is it?

474
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,470
He doesn't need me to wash dishes.

475
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,140
It's all right. He's like this at the club, too.

476
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,110
He washes his own dishes.

477
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:13,680
Sister-in-Law, during dinner, you talked quite a bit with the Ice King.

478
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,060
Ice King, who's that?

479
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,680
Our team captain, Wu Bai.

480
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,040
In our club, there are three people who cannot be provoked.

481
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,910
Hasn't Boss told you?

482
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,840
One is Grunt. The king of sarcasm.

483
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,410
Another is the one I told you about: Team Captain Wu Bai, Ice King. These two are easy to understand, right?

484
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,080
And the last one?

485
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,560
The last one...

486
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,360
What're you doing?

487
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:48,380
And our boss. He's seriously a Demon King. A great trickster.

488
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,580
Why didn't you go back home for the New Year?

489
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,820
My parents divorced; they've been fighting over the house.

490
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,920
If I go back, I don't know where to stay, so I didn't feel like going home.

491
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,310
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

492
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,390
Don't worry, it's okay. It's really okay.

493
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,920
Actually, Boss is always alone, too.

494
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,550
Probably because of this, he's learned to do everything.

495
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,810
You two... what're you chattering about?

496
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,260
We're cleaning up. Are you done? I'll bring it over.

497
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,210
Thanks, Sister-in-Law.

498
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,750
Put it here.

499
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,700
On the third, I have to go to the club so I won't have time to come see you.

500
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,240
Okay.

501
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,550
It's still early.

502
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,730
Do you want to listen to some songs?

503
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,810
♫ <i>There are some reasons that are difficult to explain</i> ♫

I heard you were coming today, so I came specifically.

511
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,170
Come in and have some tea!

512
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,460
Don't worry, ignore him. You can go.

513
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,770
Go away!

00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,700
♫<i> All the things you’ve said flash past my ears</i> ♫

518
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,320
See you.

519
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,870
♫<i> ...there are so many gates to cross</i> ♫

520
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,760
♫<i> Just to run into your embrace </i>♫

522
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,950

523
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,920
Good morning. Happy New Year.

524
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,120
How was your New Year's?

525
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,060
It was pretty good.

526
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,460
Hello, everybody! Happy New Year!

527
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,210
Happy New Year!

528
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,900
You got more handsome.

529
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,030
Happy New Year!

530
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,010
- G Shuai.
- Hello.

531
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,820
<i>- You got fatter.
- Who got fatter?</i>

532
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,800
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

533
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,450
Move over a little.

534
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,410
<i>Got it?</i>

535
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,540
<i>That's good.</i>

536
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,900
Everyone! New year, new atmosphere!

537
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,030
How many championships are we going to win this year?

538
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,560
All of them, of course.

539
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,000
In order to win championships,

540
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,400
I prayed to get blessed a keyboard and mouse when I went to my hometown for New Year's.

541
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,180
You have some pretty good ideas.

542
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,360
97, you didn't gain any abilities after the new year,

543
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,960
but you did get more tricks. Even put on a face mask.

544
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,590
What do you know? A new year, a new beginning.

545
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,640
I'm using Jayjun face masks (shui guang) to add luminosity (kai guang). <i>(T/N: Has two meanings - "I'm using the shining (shui guang) mask to bless my face (kai guang).")</i>

546
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,190
I guarantee that I'll win every battle and look radiant doing it.

547
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,680
Let's not even talk about results,finding a girlfriend can happen at any moment.

548
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,140
Here. I'll give you one.

549
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,820
Thank you. Let me see.

550
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,690
Slowly. How is it?

551
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,700
Your skin did become a lot shinier.

552
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,170
But I don't see a girlfriend anywhere!

553
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,850
Who says I don't have any? I'm not bragging.

554
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,330
For New Years, the girls showing up at my door for engagement proposals broke the threshold!

555
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,120
Okay, that's enough! Stop showing off!

556
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,830
Hurry. Call Boss for a meeting.

557
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,640
Why do I have to go?

558
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,050
Where's Demo?

559
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,730
Demo spent New Year at Boss' house.

560
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,570
My guess is that he was tormented the whole time.

561
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,780
He's hiding in the washroom crying!

562
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,580
He's singing!

563
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,550
Let's go.

564
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,150
Little Demo!

565
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,300
- Oh, he's shy.
- What are you doing?

566
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,770
Speak. How were you tormented at Boss's house during New Year's?

567
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,070
What do you mean "torment"?

568
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:37,180
Let me tell you guys, Boss, deep down, is very gentle.

569
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,610
He didn't even let Sister-in-Law do household chores.

570
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:44,230
From buying groceries, to mixing the filling, to wrapping dumplings, and in the end...

571
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,740
And in the end, cleaning the dishes.

572
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,610
He didn't let Sister-in-Law touch a single drop of water.

573
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:55,360
I was thinking, even if I had a girlfriend, it would be hard to reach that level.

574
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,400
But I need to get a girlfriend first.

575
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,040
Boss knows how to cook?

576
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,350
And it's really tasty!

577
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,560
Are you being serious?

578
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,210
You have a big heart. Even if Boss cooked for you, would you have the guts to eat it?

579
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,960
I won't hide it from you: I ate a lot, the food was really good.

580
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,950
Are you for real?

581
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,720
I'm not going to talk to you guys anymore! Leave quickly! I'm taking a shower!

582
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,240
<i>Let's go!</i>

583
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,920
Let's go.

584
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,580
Boss, the cleaning is almost done. We can get ready for the meeting.

585
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,230
I got it.

586
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,420
Boss... I heard that Demo stayed at your house for New Year's.

587
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,970
You even made food for him. Is it true?

588
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,630
Do you want to eat as well?

589
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,580
I-I don't want to eat.

590
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,840
This time, CTF's international competition is an individual players competition.

591
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,150
Grunt and 97 are the members of our team who are participating.

592
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,330
Boss will take them, I will stay here and watch you guys.

593
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,430
What about Team Captain?

594
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,250
He has his own training strategy.

595
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,360
After we leave, the members who are staying behind cannot slack off.

596
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,670
I will watch all the security footage from beginning to end. You guys got it?

597
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,270
We got it, Boss.

598
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:21,970
Grunt and 97, you two stay behind. Everyone else can go train.

599
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:36,720
This time in Norway, other than our team, there will also be people from SP.

600
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,130
There are four people from SP. The first person is their team manager, Ai Qing.

601
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,560
The others are Little Mi, All, and Lnin.

602
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,840
Because there aren't many people, I arranged for all of us to take the same flight.

603
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,750
Are there any problems?

604
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:54,460
If Boss doesn't have any problem with it, then, of course, we don't either!

605
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,130
This is the itinerary; take a look.

606
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,890
Do you want me to bring anything for your husband?

607
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,130
No need.

608
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,230
Since you and Wu Bai are going to be training,

609
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,100
do you need me to help take care of Grandpa?

610
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,420
He's even busier than me. He's going to visit relatives and friends.

611
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:21,540
Oh right. You're a single bachelor, there is no need to give anyone explanations before leaving.

612
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,980
What are you thinking about?

613
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,120
Nothing.
