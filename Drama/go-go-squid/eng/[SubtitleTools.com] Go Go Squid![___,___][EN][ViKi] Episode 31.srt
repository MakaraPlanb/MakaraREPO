00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,720
If you have work this morning, go take care of it. I'll be fine.

170
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,390
What's the rush? I already paid his salary.

171
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,220
You are a very inauthentic boss.

172
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,140
How am I not authentic?

173
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,960
Tell me.

174
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,100
Weren't your stomach hurting?

175
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,950
Go play for a bit. I have to take care of business.

176
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,340
We'll continue when I'm back.

177
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,330
Continue what?

178
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,390
What is it?

179
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,650
Let's discuss some matters.

180
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,440
You are my boss, do you still need to discuss it with me?

181
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,030
We can't casually chat?

182
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,930
Fine.

183
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,320
Top ten on the rankings... What's the situation?

184
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,630
Your younger cousin Wu Bai is still at the top.

185
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,070
Grunt is tied with an SP member for fifth place.

186
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,890
97 is probably at number 9.

187
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,740
How about Buff?

188
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
Buff?

189
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,630
Buff is number 4.

190
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,410
What is it? Have a thought?

191
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,070
You guessed it right.

192
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,660
Do you think I don't know you?

193
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,280
You want to invite him over to replace our weakest team member.

194
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,360
Would that work?

195
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,840
In terms of rank, it should be okay.

196
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,940
Because... our members should be convinced.

197
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,160
Except for Wu Bai, since he's ranked the highest.

198
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,140
Do you have any concerns?

199
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,200
Yes.

200
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,600
The first is that he is already thirty years old.

201
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,180
How many more years can he compete? This I don't know.

202
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,280
If he comes, he is an uncle.

203
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,740
- That's true.
- The second is that he and you have never gotten along.

204
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,560
This time we also beat him in competition. Do you think you can convince him?

205
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,650
No one likes to make life difficult for themselves.

206
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,580
He wants to compete. Coming to us is the easiest solution.

207
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,260
True. What about his buddies?

208
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,900
I only want to see him.

209
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,800
What are you worried about?

210
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,870
I am just a bit concerned.

211
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:33,550
If I really get him to join us, would I have to replace someone on our team?

212
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,410
Can't bear to?

213
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,800
After all, we are a team that has to stand on the World's stage.

214
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,670
If their skills are not as good as the others, even if they are not eliminated by us...

215
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,010
We would be eliminated by the competition.

216
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,160
Do you need me to contact him?

217
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,260
I'll do it. Help me inquire about where he lives.

218
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,320
Sure, I'll go and do it.

219
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,750
In case he soon plans to leave Shanghai.

220
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,840
DT.

221
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,500
Grunt.

222
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,520
97.

223
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,550
Demo.

224
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,160
One.

225
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,060
You want to play by yourself, is it?

226
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,550
Okay, I'll let you play by yourself, okay?

227
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,100
Go and play.

228
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:42,120
You should know that somewhat large clubs all have more than one team.

229
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,560
We still have to prepare for other competitions. Am I right?

230
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,610
Right, so it's only logical that

231
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,700
we look for highly-ranked good competitors.

232
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,790
I understand.

233
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,650
Sure. If you have any news of Buff, call me anytime.

234
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,810
Okay, that's it. Bye-bye.

235
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,760
- No budget. Oh, Han Shangyan.
-  This one...

236
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,430
- Han Shangyan?
<i>- Hello, are you busy?</i>

237
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,360
- It's all right. We're having a meeting.
- Do you guys have enough money?

238
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,340
<i> In my opinion, there shouldn't be a problem. </i>

239
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,740
<i> From the team's perspective, there isn't a problem either. </i>

240
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,090
<i>But the problem is...</i>

241
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,130
Boss, you've already exceeded the budget.

242
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,060
- Yes. That's the biggest problem.
- Boss.

243
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,120
We have other competitions too. Not just in China. <i>You are too biased.</i>

244
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,920
<i> Last time you came, you used an ace of spades and used up all of the budget. </i>

245
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,060
<i>You say what I should do.</i>

246
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,800
Okay. I will think of a way myself.

247
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,290
<i>No, how are you going to solve it yourself? Do you have money? Do you have a budget?</i>

248
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,910
Doesn't matter if I have a budget or not. I will solve it myself.

249
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,690
Bro, don't make yourself so short of money.

250
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,030
<i>I understand. Hanging up.</i>

251
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,350
You don't have money?

252
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,120
Eavesdropping on my phone?

253
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,370
This doesn't count as eavesdropping. You put it on speaker.

254
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,690
How much money do you still need? I have some.

255
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,160
It's just some that I saved up. It's not much. I don't know if it's enough.

256
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,430
What's this bumpy thing?

257
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,480
You gave it to me.

258
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,400
You don't think it's old-fashioned?

259
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,800
No. I think it looks pretty.

260
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,730
Not bad. You haven't started working, but you're already making money.

261
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,570
Don't I sing? It's just some small cash.

262
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,400
No need.

263
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,200
Thank you.

264
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,230
Say it.

265
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,320
<i>Han Shangyan. </i>The more I think, the stranger it seems.

266
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,430
What is it?

267
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,080
<i> You little rascal. </i>

268
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,150
<i> Are you going to put in all of your fortune? </i>

269
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,490
Can't you give yourself some leeway?

270
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,840
Can't you save some money for when you get married?

271
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,150
Don't make yourself so poor like when you couldn't even afford pants.

272
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,960
Which girl is willing to be with you?

273
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,280
If I don't have money anymore, are you still willing to stay with me?

274
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,890
I'm willing.

275
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,270
<i> Oh my god! You're with your wife right now? </i>

276
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,150
So awkward. I'm hanging up.

277
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,400
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

278
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,130
He's with his wife.

279
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,540
Crazy!

280
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,220
Unbelievable.

281
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,370
Han Shangyan? I'll raise you.

282
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm saying if one day you really have no money, I can raise you.

283
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,070
I can probably make a lot in the future.

284
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,940
I know it now. I'll send you home.

285
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,880
Really! People in my profession can make a lot!

286
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,000
I know you'll one day be little rich wife, okay?

287
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,100
- But—
- Okay, I know.

288
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,100
I'm a grown adult man. Being raised by you...

289
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,530
What words are those? Give me some face.

290
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,320
Go up and take your bag. I'm going to send you home.

291
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,250
Little Mi, what are you doing?

292
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,650
I did not eavesdrop.

293
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,750
I'm here to tell you, I got news about Buff. His train is tomorrow in the morning.

294
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,080
So tomorrow morning, if you go quickly, you still have a chance to encounter him at his hotel.

295
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,110
Okay. Send me the hotel address on my phone.

296
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,750
- Hurry and go.
- We're leaving.

297
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,360
Bye-bye.

298
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,300
Then I'll leave first.

299
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,590
I see that your brows are furrowed again.

300
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,120
Do you know? I often see you with furrowed brows.

301
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,930
Whenever you furrow your brows, my heart hurts.

302
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:17,000
In the future, can you not put so many things in your heart?

303
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,730
Okay.

304
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,720
Then I'll let go of the things that I worry about the most.

305
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,350
But... what are you most worried about?

306
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,180
What do you think?

307
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,700
Nothing.

308
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,860
No matter how many things there are, if I resolve them one by one I will feel more relaxed.

309
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,940
Besides, I have you by my side to accompany me, don't I?

310
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,420
I'm leaving.

311
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,240
Young man. You're here again?

312
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
How come in three days you've fought twice?

313
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,700
It'll hurt the relationship if you argue too much.

314
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,930
We did not fight.

315
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,650
Then what happened?

316
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,460
Sitting here waiting in infatuation?

317
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,140
Last time I saw you, I told my wife after getting home

318
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,260
about the infatuated young man who was standing guard at the complex in the middle of the night.

319
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,730
My wife even blamed me for not encouraging you more.

320
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,990
What were the exact words...?

321
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,090
Oh right! As long as the person is handsome, then just persevere.
<i>(TN: swear to death to stick with it)</i>

322
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,360
There won't be a girl that you can't get back.

323
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,430
Oh? Looks like the perseverance worked.

324
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,820
Look at the happiness written all over your face.

325
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,480
If I didn't drive today,

326
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,960
I really want to have a drink with you.

327
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,350
Even if you didn't drive, I'm working all night.

328
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,960
Okay okay, you stand guard over your girl. I'll stand guard over my area.

329
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,730
Leaving. Keep fighting.

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,060
<i>Good, good. Let's play again.</i>

341
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,180
<i>Don't move, don't move.</i>

342
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,410
<i>Don't move.</i>

343
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,850
You are so good at jumping. It's a waste that you didn't do high-jump (<i>the sport).</i>

344
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,840
You didn't leave the whole night?

345
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,650
There was nothing else to do. It was nice listening to music here outside your building.

346
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,930
Besides, the surroundings are not bad here.

347
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,830
Some peace in the hustle-bustle. And the greenification is nice.

348
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,960
- What are you taking a picture at?
- Sorry, I felt that you guys were really sweet.

349
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,140
I still have ten more minutes, then I have to leave. How about sit on the car for a bit?

350
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,750
Why are you blushing?

351
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,820
No, no. I'm not blushing.

352
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,450
In the morning the temperature is low, cover up and don't catch a cold.

353
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,320
Did you not sleep the whole night?

354
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,380
Pretty much.

355
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,320
Then are you sleepy?

356
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:58,400
No. Usually when training and discussing battle strategies before competitions, I often stay up all night.

357
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,090
Do you have time to make up for the lost sleep?

358
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,960
When I see you smile, I feel a hundred times more awake.

359
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,590
Are you hungry? Do you want me to get some food for you?

360
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,840
Don't waste the short time we have together.

361
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,690
It's been four months.

362
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,600
What gift do you want?

363
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,880
I don't want anything.

364
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,020
Think of one now.

365
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,480
You still haven't thought of one?

366
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,750
I want...

367
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:53,140
I want us to never break up.

368
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,030
Never?

369
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,570
What is it?

370
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,040
What you mean is... you want to get married?

371
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,090
Isn't it too early to marry right now? Are you really rushed?

372
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,120
I'm not rushed. What I mean is—

373
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,990
It's a bit troublesome on your dad and mom's end.

374
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,650
Because the time we've been together is still too short, and you still haven't graduated yet.

375
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,970
You might not be very clear on this, your mom has some opinions towards me. I haven't thought through how to resolve this yet.

376
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,260
If I go and mention marriage to her right now,

377
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,510
I'm afraid... she will come find me with a kitchen knife in her hands.

378
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,390
My mom is prejudiced towards you? How do you know that?

379
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,660
I guessed it.

380
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,230
I thought you don't know.

381
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:47,550
The matter of marriage, let's put it off for now. I can fulfill your other terms.

382
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,780
I think you kind of misunderstood.

383
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,540
I am not saying that I want to get married now.

384
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,790
What...

385
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,500
W-what's wrong?

386
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,870
- Your dad came out.
- My dad?

387
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:05,260
Every morning he goes to walk the dog. We can't let him find us! If he finds out, I'm dead!

388
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,630
Easy there, don't hit anything.

389
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,770
How about this. I'll go lead away your dad, and then we will make a feint to the east and attack in the west. <i>(T/N: Create a diversion)</i>

390
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,420
When you don't hear anything, then sneak back in.

391
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,380
Then first, move away your head.

392
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,700
Let's go, Summer! Slow down, slow down!

393
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,410
Go.

394
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,770
That's right. It's me. That's right, yes.

395
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,980
- Don't reveal any leverage.
- Xiao Han?

396
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,740
Uncle Tong? Wait a moment.

397
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,040
Okay. Let's end it here for today!

398
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,290
- Uncle Tong!
- Why are you here so early in the morning?

399
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,500
I was... just passing by here.

400
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,270
And came to look around.

401
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,330
Just passing by and came to look around?

402
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,770
You tell me the truth.

403
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,000
Is it that in your heart you still cannot forget Nian Nian?

404
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,980
Uncle, don't misunderstand.

405
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,950
I... really was just driving by. I thought...

406
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:24,050
I suddenly thought of when I sent Nian Nian home before, and it brought back memories.

407
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,090
Uncle, you need to believe me.

408
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,130
My feelings towards Nian Nian are really more serious than what you guys think.

409
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,850
Actually, you two haven't known each other for that long.

410
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,760
Once time passes, you will definitely be able to forget her.

411
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,470
But in this day and age, kids like you who value relationships this much are pretty rare.

412
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,220
<i>Dad... hurry and leave!</i>

413
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,550
<i>Uncle here is speaking from the heart. I know, Uncle.</i>

414
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:51,420
I'm telling you, last time when I went with your Grandpa to visit his old home, I could already tell.

415
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,810
You sincerely like my daughter!

416
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,820
Relationship can only work if both sides want it to work.

417
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,890
- You know?
- You're right. Yes.

418
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,850
When you two broke up, my Nian Nian cried so much.

419
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,020
In any case, this matter can be considered a thing of the past.

420
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,570
But you need to understand, my frame of mind being a father. What's wrong?

421
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,180
- What happened?
- Nothing! Uncle, tell me.

422
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,830
It can't be helped, from the standpoint of being a parent.

423
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,500
You tell me!

424
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,370
You tell me how I'm suppose to feel.

425
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,750
If she is sad, then what do I do? I love her dearly!

426
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,830
I am her dad! Right?

427
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,660
Be more understanding, child.

428
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,420
It's nothing, it's nothing. It will pass. Okay?

429
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,260
It will pass.

430
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,840
What's wrong with your hand? Why does your hand keep trembling?

431
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,830
It's fine, Uncle. It's from playing with computers.

432
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,430
It's harmful to your health! It is especially harmful to your eyes.

433
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,270
You need to change that in the future, you hear? You're so handsome!
- Yes, Uncle.

434
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,110
I'm telling you, I hope that my words have reached you.

435
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:59,830
- My heart feels much better. Thank you Uncle, for enlightening me.
- That's good, that's good.

436
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,800
- Look, my phone is ringing again! Really...
- Pick it up!

437
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,530
- Okay. Then I will leave first, Uncle. I will leave first!
- Okay!

438
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,700
Okay, I'll come over now. Okay.

439
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,940
If your heart feels unwell, call me at anytime, okay?

440
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,840
Okay, okay!

441
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,300
Bye Uncle!

442
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,180
Nian Nian.

443
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,290
It's so early, are you going out?

444
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,630
No. I just woke up!

445
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,590
I'm so sleepy. Good morning, Mom.

446
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,390
If you're not going out, why did you change into your sneakers?

447
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,540
I... I wanted to accompany dad to go walk the dog!

448
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,430
Accompany Dad to go walk Summer.

449
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,300
Your dad? Your dad went out early!

450
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,170
Really? That unlucky?

451
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,060
That's too regretful. Then there's no way for me to accompany Dad to walk Summer.

452
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:05,600
What's happening with you today? Usually if it's not past noon, you won't get up.

453
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,380
What's up with you today?

454
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,720
I've thought it through. From today onward, I need to sleep early and wake up early.

455
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,210
Strive for a better future. Rise at the rooster's crow <i>(T/N: be diligent in studies)</i>. Be a good person. Yeah!

456
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,720
Don't give me that.

457
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,670
Why are you so strange today?

458
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,970
Am I? Where am I strange? Is my hairstyle strange?

459
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,270
It's alright, isn't it?

460
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:38,890
But you having this spirit to strive upwards is still worth praising.

461
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,330
Thank you, Mom.

462
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,120
- Okay, then I'll going to go take care of things.
- Go, go!

463
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,090
Oh yeah. Later on, can you water your dad's flowers?

464
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,830
You hear?

465
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,390
Flowers... Should water flowers.

466
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,820
What did you think I was going to say?

467
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,700
No problem! Leave it to me! Don't worry!

468
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,420
Scared me to death.

469
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,990
Why are you so kind today to help me water the flowers?

470
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,730
Why is she sleeping here?

471
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:30,160
Early in the morning she got up and said she wanted to accompany you to walk the dog.

472
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,200
Luckily she didn't go.

473
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,470
What happened?

474
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,840
Little Han came.

475
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,050
Why did he come?

476
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,290
Come, come over here. I'll tell you, I'll tell you!

477
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,460
Say, Little Han and Nian Nian...

478
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,110
how exactly did the two break up?

479
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,330
I'm telling you, for this matter you cannot ask Nian Nian.

480
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:04,130
Last time she cried so sadly, it's not like you didn't see!

481
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,570
Anyway, no matter what, it is his fault. Got it?

482
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,380
Okay. I got it.

483
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:16,670
But just now when I was outside and I met Little Han, I exchanged a few words with him.

484
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:22,080
I feel that this child, is more mature than I imagined.

485
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,560
Also, I asked him.

486
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,330
I said, "It's so early, why are you in front of our house?"

487
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,780
And he said that he was just passing by, and just came to casually look around.

488
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,330
Isn't that obvious? In his heart, he can't let go of Nian Nian.

489
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:40,260
I'm telling you, this matter of you meeting him you absolutely cannot tell Nian Nian, okay?

490
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,590
I know, I know, I know.

491
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,870
But this matter...

492
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,050
Wife.

493
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,140
Why don't you go sound her out?

494
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:57,190
Last time when we went back to the countryside, I kept feeling like the two of them weren't all that distant.

495
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,950
Maybe the two of them still have a chance–

496
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,640
Maybe what? You feel Zhenghui isn't good, is that it?

497
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,780
That child, Zhenghui is very good.

498
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,360
- It's just that–
- Got it, stop being so long-winded.

499
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,250
Hurry up and go buy breakfast. Hurry, go!

500
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,980
- Don't you feel that child is very boring?
- Okay, okay I'm going!
- You're so longwinded!

501
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,280
<i>You are so good at jumping. It's a pity that you didn't do high-jump.</i>

502
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,510
<i>You didn't leave the whole time?</i>

503
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,930
If you're going to eat, then eat properly. What are you smiling about?

504
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,330
Looking at her, I feel like she has something on her mind.

505
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,980
- What's on her mind?
- I'll go ask!

506
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,100
Nian Nian. Why aren't you eating your breakfast?

507
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,470
- Do you feel unwell somewhere?
- No! No.

508
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,300
Then do you have something on your mind?

509
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:14,310
It's nothing, Summer. I am very strong. I'm fine.

510
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,220
Are you thinking about the past again?

511
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,330
- Don't ask me anymore, Dad.
- Daughter! Be good.

512
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,220
Whatever happened, it will all pass.

513
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,410
What's the big deal?

514
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,420
- It's nothing.
- Come here.

515
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,930
Be good.

516
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,030
Alright, stop asking.

517
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,490
Looks like she broke up.

518
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,780
- What kind of mom are you?
- What do you mean?

519
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,970
Usually whenever she has an issue, she always talks to you not me.

520
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,340
Over time she will be fine. I understand her. It's fine, don't worry.

521
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,220
Eat fruits. Eat fruits! Go eat your fruits.

522
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,070
- You guys bought your tickets?
- We are about to disperse, don't be sad.

523
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,440
- We still have opportunities to see each other again.
- Buff.

524
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,830
You guys are all here?

525
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:05,430
Why the rush? We haven't had a chance to hang out a little.

526
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,840
My son gave me a call, and said he missed me.

527
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,850
I have to go back quickly.

528
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,290
Oh right, if you go to Jinan, remember to look me up.

529
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,860
I'll treat you to stewed meat.

530
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,920
Don't worry, if we go to Jinan, you won't be able to escape.

531
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,640
- Take care.
- Take care!

532
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,340
- Take care.
- Take care!

533
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,870
Take care!
