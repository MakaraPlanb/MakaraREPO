<i>[Episode 17]</i>

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,510
Do you want to know about Han Shangyan's past?

23
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,550
I do. Especially what's not on the web.

24
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,540
Let me think...

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,920
When we were on Team Solo, we raised a cat.

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,290
The cat was always taken care of by Han Shangyan.

27
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,310
Then, the cat passed away.

28
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,570
He wouldn't let us mention it, so Solo and I deduced that in terms of his feelings,

29
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,960
he definitely has a first-love complex.

30
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,210
He has a really strong sense of possession and gets jealous often.

31
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,730
But also, because of something small, he'll get happy like a child.

32
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,010
But in love, because of some things,

33
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,750
he'll become very confused and unsure.

34
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,340
He has a first-love complex?

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,150
Hard to imagine, right?

36
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,700
Then, who was his first love?

37
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,350
His first love?

38
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,300
I'm guessing...

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,170
It is you.

40
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,340
- Me?
- Right.

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,210
Because there's never been news about him having a girlfriend.

42
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,360
Also, the way he looks at you is like looking at that cherished cat.

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,030
Are you serious?

44
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,160
I think it's 90% true. You can ask him for the last 10%.

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,820
These two beauties are chatting?

46
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,210
We should chat together.

47
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,090
Ou Qiang, what're you doing?

48
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,830
Usually, Old Han watches you too closely.

49
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,770
I've never dared to carefully look at Sister-in-Law.

50
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,370
You're scaring her.

51
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,030
Right, Solo is asking for you. Go and talk to him.

52
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, got it. Let's go.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,490
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

54
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,420
Ai Qing, thanks for telling me about this today.

55
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,860
Actually, I should thank you.

56
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,620
Han Shangyan doesn't have his family's support,

57
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,750
and he's in China alone all because he wanted to help China get the gold medal.

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,710
He doesn't have a family or a girlfriend.

59
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:50,370
He only wanted to win, to continue winning on and on, to use his Chinese citizenship to bring the grand slam.

60
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,580
So, we were really worried that no one would be able to take his bad temper and dedication towards CTF.

61
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,350
But look now. How great it is.

62
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,950
Let's go.

63
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,200
Your work badge.

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,280
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

<i>So, is this why Grandpa always dislikes him?</i>

67
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,090
<i>He's so successful at his job, has won so many championships, and has suffered so many hardships. </i>

68
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,190
<i>Can his family still not understand him?</i>

69
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,490
It has been very hard for you, right?

70
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,690
<i>It's too hot, and you have a heat stroke?</i>

71
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,040

72
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,630
Han Sh–

73
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,570
Shangyan...

74
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,880
- Oh my god?
- Jeez!

75
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,560
- Train!
- Train, guys!

76
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,110
I didn't mean to call you loudly on purpose.

77
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,970
When I called you earlier, you didn't hear, so I had to yell.

78
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,950
What were you gesturing down there? I didn't understand at all.

79
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,810
I was saying, "It has been very hard for you and to wait for me up here."

80
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,710
Look!

81
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,730
Listen to me.

82
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,620
I don't mind any private affection, but in public, you have to be careful of our influence.

83
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,690
What if people see and laugh?

84
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,310
I understand. Taste some.

85
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,090
Hey, let me finish.

86
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,770
I'm a man, so I'm not scared of suffering losses. In the end, you're the one at a disadvantage, understand?

87
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,550
Yes, yes. Open up!

88
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,090
Is it good?

89
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,530
- It's okay.
- Have some more.

90
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,980
<i>What in the world?</i>

91
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,170
<i>I let the little kid out for ten minutes and she's back like this?</i>

92
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,690
Little Mi, come with me. Ai Qing, keep practicing with everyone.

93
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,850
Lost my footing.

94
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,830
What are you doing?

95
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,620
Will you be bored?

96
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,470
No, it's very fun here.

97
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:50,720
Actually, if you go out the back door from the lobby, there's a beach. You can go stroll around.

98
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,280
If you want to eat or drink anything, just put it on the tab for your room.

99
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,600
The beach is connected to a few hotels, don't get lost.

100
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,410
I won't.

101
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,240
- Does your phone still have power?
- Yes, a lot.

102
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,580
If you lose your phone, then–

103
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,230
Why're you nagging like a monk? Talking so much.

104
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,230
I'm not a little kid, I won't get lost. Don't worry.

105
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,570
I brought some fruit for everyone; bring it inside.

106
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,720
I only bought one coconut water for you.

107
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,890
- Bye-bye.
- I'm going.

108
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,550
I'll find you later.

109
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,060
Well, someone bought you all some fruit.

110
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,390
Who is "someone"?

111
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,090
"Someone"? It's Sister-in-Law!

112
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,950
Pass the ball!

113
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,090
Pass the ball! Here!

114
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

115
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,770
Why're you here yourself? You aren't playing with them?

116
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,480
I didn't bring a bikini.

117
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,080
- Hello, I'm Mi Shaofei.
- Hello, hello.

118
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,030
- Old Han's good friend.
- I know you.

119
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,350
You read CTF Weekly?

120
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,020
No. After I met him, I collected a lot of information on him.

121
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,330
So, I know both of you.

122
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,390
Wow, so thoughtful.

123
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,360
- I'll go buy some beverages.
- Sure, let's have some.

124
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,820
- No need!
- It's fine, you're one of us.

125
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,080
- Hurry and come back.
- Okay!
- Thanks.

126
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,390
He's too polite.

127
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,640
- Chat a bit?
- Okay.

128
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:53,220
That day, I listened to you sing "Little Donkey" very sorrowfully.

129
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,890
Did something happen with Old Han?

130
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,530
Sorry, I have no intention to probe into your privacy.

131
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,070
I used to be a team captain. Now, I'm in charge of competing teams.

132
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,270
I'm very good at reading people, so I was able to tell.

133
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,530
Han Shangyan used to live in Norway. How did you meet him?

134
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:20,360
I just knew you were going to ask about him. We met each other through online chatting.

135
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,130
Then, what year did you know each other?

136
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,560
About 2005? We were close through online chatting.

137
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,000
So, he came to find me from Norway.

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,950
Just because you were close online, he came to find you?

139
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,920
Old Han has a weird personality.

140
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,730
You can't use a normal person's logic to think about him.

141
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,290
Aquariuses are indeed kind of weird.

142
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,710
He's weird and you still like him?

143
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,250
I'm back!

144
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,490
Thanks.

145
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,110
- Can you have cold drinks?
- I can, I can. No problem.

146
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,140
Here, this is for you.

147
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,190
Oh, thank you.

148
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,550
Welcome!

149
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,200
You're done? Have some.

150
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,490
What's in the cup?

151
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,810
Mi Shaofei gave it to me.

152
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,860
This is alcohol. Why is a child drinking alcohol?

153
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,870
Old Han, it's fine. This isn't much.

154
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,270
It's peach flavored. Add a bit of ice to the drink and it's so refreshing.

155
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,430
Thanks for taking care of my kid.

156
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,770
We're brothers; you're welcome.

157
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,800
If you're free later on, I need to talk to you.

158
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,710
You are welcome, too!

159
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,540
I'm leaving.

160
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,120
Bye-bye.

161
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,790
Cheers.

162
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,660
<i>I cannot annoy him or always find him to come and play.</i>

163
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,300
<i>He's too busy; I can't bother him.</i>

164
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,590
<i>I can be by myself!</i>

165
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,550
Tong Nian? You're alone?

166
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,420
I guess that's right. They're all training and are very busy.

167
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,000
How about I hang out with you?

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,980
- It's fine. I can–
- Don't worry, I've got nothing to do.

169
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,230
Also, I haven't eaten. I'll take you to have a seafood feast.

170
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,780
No need, really.

171
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,190
We have to eat anyway.

172
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,430
I'll take you to Sanya's fun places and have some delicious seafood.

173
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,630
We're here.

174
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,220
Thanks.

175
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,250
Careful.

176
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,950
Thanks.

177
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,500
I'm very close to the boss here. The seafood is amazing.

178
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,960
- Do you have anything you really want to eat?
- No, I'm fine with anything.
- Okay.

179
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,300
- Then, I'll order what's most popular here.
- Okay.

181
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,600
There are only ten minutes before practice, what is it?

182
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,430
The last time we met, it was quite rushed. I had no time to catch up with you.

183
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,870
Between us brothers, what need is there to catch up on?

184
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,190
The relationship is always here.

185
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,130
Little Mi, come join K&K.

186
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,630
Han Shangyan...

187
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,180
I don't have that worth.

188
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,020
Why would you repeatedly scout over a person like me?

189
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,400
You all are priceless in my heart.

190
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,040
I know you take feelings and friends very seriously,

191
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,430
but the worth of a player can be calculated.

192
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,050
My scores are really bad.

193
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,500
If I join, won't I be dragging you down?

194
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,530
Solo works for other people.

195
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,160
No matter how well he's doing, he can't take care of you.

196
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,830
You're finally back. I don't wish you to leave like this.

197
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,180
If there wasn't training, I would've had a few drinks with you.

198
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,280
Changing the topic?

199
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,740
Spare me, Bro.

200
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,550
Because of this last time, I almost had a huge fight with you.

201
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,140
I can't convince you. Whatever.

202
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,520
Scram! Go back to training.

203
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,400
I'm leaving.

- Hello.
- Hello.

207
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,790
How do I get to the location on the map?

208
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,090
Walk this way and you'll be there in about three kilometers; it's a seafood restaurant.

209
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,410
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

210
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,390
Do you need an umbrella? It seems it's about to rain.

211
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,990
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

212
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,700
You ordered so much, I'm kind of embarrassed.

213
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,020
Don't worry. I'm close with the boss here. Eat a lot; the pricing is good.

214
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,860
Thanks.

215
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,620
This one is good. Here.

216
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,080
- It's fine. I can do it myself.
- Have a lot.

217
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,570
- And this.
- Thank you.

218
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,130
Why aren't you eating?

219
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,150
Don't worry. I eat here often.

220
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,840
You've been staring at me a lot. It's kind of weird.

221
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,670
I'm embarrassed to eat by myself. Shouldn't we eat together?

222
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,900
No, you eat.

223
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,550
Is there something you have to ask me?

224
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,240
No, nothing special.

225
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,590
I just rarely see

226
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,210
someone walking with <i>my</i> Shangyan.

227
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,560
I'm just slightly curious.

228
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,500
Oh, that's it?

229
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,990
- Are you his girlfriend?
- Yep.

230
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,290
Right, I am his girlfriend.

231
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,600
Our parents have eaten together and met already.

232
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,260
It was during the new year, they had dinner together.

233
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,740
Eating New Year's Eve dinner isn't much.

234
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,360
I think you're just too young.

235
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,610
You aren't too clear about some things.

236
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:26,310
You may not be compatible with someone like Shangyan.

237
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,700
When Han Shangyan just joined CTF, I was his fan.

238
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,670
Back then, I didn't understand it, either.

239
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,120
But my older brother liked coding, so I learned along with him. Then, I got into CTF.

240
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,650
Later, I started watching him. I liked our Shangyan so much.

241
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,960
Then, he suddenly retired.

242
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,320
But did you know? Tong Nian. Tong Nian!

243
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,320
Did you know? I took this career because of Shangyan!

244
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,540
I know. Earlier, Ai Qing told me he has a lot of fans, so I can understand your feelings–

245
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,760
I'm not just some fan!

246
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,210
If I had joined Shangyan earlier,

247
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,730
he wouldn't have retired so early.

248
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,870
And with my skills, in less than three years,

249
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:16,130
he would have been the world's number one, China's top.

250
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,500
You seem young.

251
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,350
There is quite a difference between your age and Shangyan's age, right?

252
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,780
Have you graduated from college?

253
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,200
I'm graduating from postgraduate this year.

254
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,380
You don't seem like it at all!

255
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,540
<i>I'm not going to tell you I took junior classes. </i>

256
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,370
<i>What's wrong with being young? Old lady.</i>

257
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:52,740
A successful man always has an important woman behind him.

258
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,500
I know. I understand him a lot and support him, so you don't have to worry.

259
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,760
That isn't enough. Men care a lot about their careers.

260
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,490
A woman who can help him succeed in his career is the one who can stay by his side in the end.

261
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:12,270
But those young and pretty people who interfere with his career...

262
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:20,790
That is just a short-lived fate; like a fleeting, glimmering boat floating across the water.

263
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,920
Why're there so many flies? Flying here and there.

264
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,220
They're buzzing and buzzing, so annoying.

265
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,130
Don't move, there's one. I'll hit it.

266
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,280
So, what's the purpose of you telling me all this?

267
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,350
Nothing, no other purpose.

268
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,870
I saw that you're young, so I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

269
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,080
You might not understand someone like Shangyan.

270
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,810
He might not suit you.

271
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,250
If she doesn't suit me, then who does?

272
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,600
- Shangyan!
- Shangyan!

273
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,760
How'd you know I was here?

274
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,260
If I want to know, I'll know naturally.

275
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,900
Shangyan, we were just talking about you.

276
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,990
Here! Have some, too.

277
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,170
Here.

278
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,850
I just thought you were busy.

279
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,690
And it's a pity she was alone, so I brought her here to have some fun.

280
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,250
At the same time, I got her to try Sanya's delicacies. You try some, too.

281
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,820
- Is it good?
- Is it good?

282
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,130
No one would enjoy eating this kind of feast.

283
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,590
If you eat in this direction, you should feel happier.

284
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,350
Here.

285
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,910
Can you reach?

286
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,780
Oh right, Grandpa just called saying he misses you.

287
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,560
Really? Then, I'll call him back. I also miss him.

288
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,040
Okay.

289
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,780
You two seem pretty happy.

290
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,870
I have something to do, so I'll be going.

291
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,800
Go ahead.

292
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,350
I'm really leaving.

293
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,020
Bye-bye. We won't see you out.

294
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,930
Okay.

295
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,270
Is Grandpa home? I'll call him now.

296
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,850
- No need. He didn't ask for you.
- What?

297
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,800
Weren't you jealous of her earlier?

298
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,790
I was going along with you to make you happy.

299
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,960
Look at your sad expression. What did she say?

300
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,530
She said she is your fan.

301
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,930
Did you know her in the past?

302
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,880
She's just a fanatic fan who just wants to enter the CTF circle.

303
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,280
She said she joined CTF a long time ago.

304
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,990
So amazing, unlike me.

305
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,550
What use is that? I don't like her, right?

306
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,380
Why's your shirt wet?

307
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,950
The sky was all clear, but it suddenly started raining.

308
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,760
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

309
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,970
I was worried and came in a rush.

310
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,280
Is it good?

311
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,040
It's pretty good.

312
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,520
She's not a great person, but her choice in restaurants and food is pretty good.

313
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,770
Eat more.

314
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,360
She kept talking earlier, so I ate a lot.

315
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,330
This is really good. Open up!

316
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,560
- Does it taste good?
- It's not bad.

317
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,010
Do you have something to say?

318
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,070
I don't have anything to say.

319
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,130
You have to start a new life.

320
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,420
With a child around, it'll be hard to even get married.

321
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,000
I didn't plan on marrying. She's enough.

322
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,170
Solo, I really miss my daughter.

323
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,230
She's also my daughter.

324
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,350
What's going on between them?

325
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:06,050
Did you know that you are my first love?

326
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,090
The first person I loved.

327
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,490
I don't regret being with you.

328
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,350
If I could redo everything, I wouldn't have given birth to her behind your back.

329
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,760
I loved you too much after breaking up, so I gave birth to her.

330
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,170
What's in the past is in the past. No need to talk too much about it.

331
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,920
Solo, I want my daughter.

332
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,250
Give me a chance.

333
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,140
Seeing that I bore her for ten months,

334
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,450
give me a chance.

335
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,510
You know that there are many things where you can't interfere, right?

336
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:21,710
For example, I remember when I graduated from elementary school,

337
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,740
when I first started my menstrual cycle, I freaked out.

338
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,110
It was my mom who looked after me.

339
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,410
If you asked me to talk to my dad, I wouldn't have done it.

340
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,780
This is just a small thing. There are more.

341
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,660
Girls have all sorts of bodily experiences during puberty.

342
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,280
You can't say anything about it.

343
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,700
Have you not experienced it yourself?

344
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,570
Are you done talking?

345
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,740
Let me carefully consider it.

346
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,690
What are you doing?

347
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,970
What's wrong?

348
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,620
- What are you doing? You scared me.
- What's up with you?

349
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,170
I'm perfectly fine. If you have something to say, say it.

350
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,670
Old Han and I met today.

351
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,290
What did he say?

352
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,850
He wanted me to join K&K.

353
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,810
Join K&K...

354
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,470
He still hasn't changed. Still so blinded by emotions.

355
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,870
What did you say?

356
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,660
Joining K&K at a crucial time, isn't that like escaping?

357
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,660
You know I'm not someone who flees.

358
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:09,150
Although I'm unsatisfied about many things, I...

359
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,670
What? We are brothers; I understand you.

360
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,960
Even if I'm unsatisfied, I need to recognize reality.

361
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,350
I will work harder.

362
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,450
If I can't increase my scores, I will give you an answer.

363
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,060
You're the most awesome.

364
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,550
Little white whale. So cute.

365
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,130
These days, when I'm really tired from training,

366
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,050
I will come here to look around.

367
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:54,620
I wish that I can be like a forgetful fish.

368
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,360
Forget about all the troubles in life.

369
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,120
Yeah! They seem so happy, swimming around freely.

370
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,090
I haven't asked you yet. What happened with Little Ai's parents?

371
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,880
I pity her.

372
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,180
They were first-loves, but they broke up later on.

373
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,870
Then... Little Ai is...

374
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,460
Born after breaking up, so Solo didn't know about her.

375
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,030
Solo didn't know about Little Ai?

376
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,870
That time, Su Cheng couldn't afford to raise her, so she went to find Solo.

377
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,840
Then they got married on paper,

378
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,780
got Little Ai her birth certificate and citizenship, and then divorced.

379
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,160
From then on, Solo raised Little Ai by himself.

380
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,120
They even got married?

381
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,720
At the time, it was just to get Little Ai's birth certificate and citizenship. They divorced very soon after.

382
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,780
Then... Little Ai...

383
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,780
You're a child, stop inquiring about other people's matters.

384
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,890
What's wrong? Do you not feel well?

385
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,970
My head hurts a bit. It could be because Zhou Shan has been annoying me.

386
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,680
Do you want to go back and rest a bit?

387
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,220
It's nothing.

388
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,200
It's not easy to find time to spend with you. Let's walk a bit more.

420

No problem. Of course, it's no problem.

421
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,530
Then, you rest first.

422
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,230

436

437

00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,790
Honestly, I've always wanted to ask you something.

506
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,390
Say it.

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,550

00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,440
I hope all your decisions consider K&K's ranking,

511
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,020
and not your past friendships.

512
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,760
When did you start giving advice to me?

513
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,930
Also, do you not know me?

514
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,760
Go to sleep.

515
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,470
I'm sleeping.

516
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,980
One two, one two, K&K champion!
♫ <i>Who was forgotten? It matters no more</i> ♫

517
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:24,370
One two, one two, K&K champion!
♫ <i>Who didn’t do their utmost and walk to life’s final stage?</i> ♫

518
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,870
One two, one two, K&K champion!
♫ <i>Perhaps very tiresome, in an entirely pathetic state</i> ♫

519
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,350
Do they do this every day?

520
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,300
Pretty much.

521
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,990
Then, what about in the past? Did you all do this, too?

522
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,490
Us?

523
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,010
We weren't as professional. We trained day and night.

524
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,510
Stomach aches and sleep deprivation; we were all used to it.

525
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,360
Indeed. When I was younger, I didn't like gym class.

526
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,660
When I was tired, I avoided it, but my body wasn't very healthy.

527
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,990
Later, I realized that exercise is very important to a person.

528
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,850
Look. Am I healthy?

529
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,690
Also, I used to be really short.

530
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,080
Thanks to exercise, I grew a bit.

531
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,270
How long does it take you to run 800 meters?

532
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,780
Two minutes and thirty seconds.

533
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,200
Is that good or bad?

534
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,770
Better than a full score!

535
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,390
Hurry up!

536
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:21,230
K&K champion! One two, one two, K&K champion! One two, one two,

537
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:27,080
- K&K champion!
- K&K champion! One two, one two, K&K champion!

538
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,490
K&K champion! One two, one two, K&K champion!

539
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,130
Demo! Demo! Give me a sip.

540
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:52,330
- This is pretty amazing, it doesn't spill!
- Neat, right?

541
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:55,940
Pretty neat. Advancement in technology and times have developed.

542
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,930
Wow, even water has evolved.

543
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,960
It seems that it's just you guys who haven't evolved.
