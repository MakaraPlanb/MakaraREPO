174
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,630
I said, I don't want to break up.

175
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,780
<i>I didn't mean to invade your privacy.</i>

176

there are a lot of times that I am more childish than you.

193

I hope that in the future we can swap.

194

You don't need to accommodate me with everything.

I ... only have this daughter.

204
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,320
From when she was young, I have never let her suffer hardships.

205
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,090
Don't worry. I will definitely not let her suffer.

206
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:24,170
People always say that daughters are daddy's girls, daddy's heart.

207
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,380
I will love her like you do - but double it and double it in loving her.

208

Silly child, don't cry.

Our age gap... I cannot change it.

214
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,650
But in future days, I will do my utmost to love her.

So, since we have made this decision,

220
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,680
I want to go and get our marriage certificate and bring it back.

221
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,170
This time I came to ask you both for Nian Nian's residence permit.
<i>(TN necessary for marriage registration)</i>

222
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,040
Say, this kid. How is it that when you talk, it is always things that are so unexpected!

223
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,870
Are you that impatient?

224
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,460
I-I know that me standing here now and saying these kinds of things to you is something I shouldn't do.

225
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,870
But I wanted to take this Asian championship title as an opportunity.

226
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,270
Go, go. Get Nian Nian's residence permit.

227
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,130
Weren't you the one to store the residence permits away? You ask me? Go look for it.

228
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,700
Let me think... I know where it is. I know where it is.

229
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,170
What's with all the sensation? Why didn't you tell me in advance?

230
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,640
Before the finals, who was it that told me she wanted to get married?

231
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,980
You think these words are said just for fun?

232
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,840
As soon as you mentioned marriage to me I agreed and immediately took you back to get your residence permit.

233
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,120
Have you ever seen anyone so sincere after receiving a proposal?

234
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,490
This time the Asia-Pacific Competition prize money is quite a lot. Where do you want to go for a honeymoon?

235
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,280
Honeymoon?

236
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,590
After getting married the next step... isn't it a honeymoon? Is there a problem?

237
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,930
Say... my daughter...

238
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,320
she's getting married to you in such a hurry...

239
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,750
Little Han. Remember, in the future if there are any difficult matters,

240
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,690
you need to come and find the two of us.

241
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,410
We are a family.

242
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,230
Do you hear? Don't be polite.

243
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,800
No problem.

244
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,900
Then... remember.

245
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,610
Every week, come back three times to eat dinner together!

246
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,650
We know, mom.

247
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,390
Don't worry, Auntie. I often pick up Nian Nian from school and bring her back.

248
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,430
Give it to him.

249
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,430
Little Han, once you take this residence permit

250
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,490
and register for marriage with Nian Nian, she will be your wife.

251
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,490
You must treat her well. Do you hear me?

252
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,480
Dad, mom, what are you guys doing?

253
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,750
I'm your daughter forever!

254
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,330
Don't be sad, it's not like I'm not coming back!

255
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,220
I don't even have the time to be so happy.

256
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,950
What are you standing there for? Come here!

257
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,630
Don't cry anymore.

258
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,600
Bye-bye, Summer!

259
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,510

260
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,650
I've forgotten something.

261
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,470
What thing? I'll go back inside to get it for you!

262
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,990
- I've forgotten a matter.
- What matter?

263
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,060
Don't be like this! There's a lot of people over there who can see!

264
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,950
Then treat it as our wedding rehearsal!

265
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,390

It's definitely a new style. Old Han is here.

You close buddies have occupied the bridal chamber, ruining their joyous occasion.

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,040
Old Han!

313
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,570
So the cheering downstairs wasn't

314
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,900
for entering the global competition, but rather Old Han actually—

315
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,890
It's the one

316
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,760
with the most sour face and worst temper,

317
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,450
who isn't attracted to women,

318
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,010
and even invests all his money into his career until he's a penniless peasant,

319
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,750
that actually found a partner!

320
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,810
He even got married before us!

321
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,250
What kind of natural order is this? I'll go die!

322
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,660
- Go. Fall down, fall down.
- Hey!

323
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,100
I was joking, okay?

324
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,450
- It's okay.
- Stop fooling around.

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,040

when we were in Shanghai on that beat-up rooftop.

328
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,250
Talking about our dreams as time flew by.

329
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,560
We were able to fight together for our dreams.

330
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,900
It was great!

331
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,940
We were able to pass on our dreams to the next generation.

332
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,960
I believe, no matter if it's SP or K&K,

333
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,580
they will bring our dreams

334
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,430
and work hard towards the world championship!

335
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,250
That's true. For that flame of victory!

336
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,750

I won't accompany you guys to drink.

338
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,580
I have to drive and take Tong Nian somewhere.

339
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,590
But, I still wholeheartedly

340
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,020
hope my brothers and sisters can find their own happiness.

341
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,850
No...

342
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,240
- Take one sip.
- I'll toast with some juice.

- I'm leaving!

I'll have a beer!

423
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,650
Okay! Then that's it. We'll talk next time!

443
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,540
Stupid. The engagement ring is for the middle finger.

444
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,230
This time, it should be the ring finger.

445
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,960
It's a bit big.

446
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,100

I do! Thank you!

452
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,520
This is my first and only championship ring that I have kept.

453
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,990
Before, when I was with team Solo,

454
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,380
I won a national championship ring.

455
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,320
But, I threw it away. I only have this one left.

00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,020
I'm sorry.

457
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,290
I retired too early.

458
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,330

I'm done saying it!

473
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,450
When? I didn't hear you say anything!

474
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,510
Silly.

475
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,410
You're the one who is silly! Let's go!

476
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,970

Let's line up here! We need to be number one, you know?

478
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,080
After getting married, where will I live?

479
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,070
You... live wherever you should be living.

480
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,400
Then... where will you live?

481
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,720
I... What do you think?

482
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:44,320
If you live at the club, then I will take the double bed and change it to a bigger double bed.

483
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,790
If you live at my house, it has a double bed that is already ready for you.

484
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,100
You can directly move in.

485
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,210
At that time, I won't need to feed Squiddy anymore.

486
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,660
I will leave it to you to feed Squiddy.

487
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,880
If we move to your house, it does not matter to me either.

488
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,980
Even if we are living under someone else's roof, it doesn't matter.

489
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,700
Because our two families are old friends.

490
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,820
I still have to study for my PhD.

491
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,300
Now, this is a problem.

492
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,300
Then I will move into your dormitory to live.

493
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,770
You're going to move into our dormitory? It's a girls' dormitory. How are you going to come in?

494
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,080
If I need to climb the building, I'll climb the building. It'll be a cinch.

495
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,760
You've only thought about the problem of  marriage but you haven't thought about the problem of where we are going to live?

496
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,180
Then you should... you should give me some time to let me be mentally prepared!

497
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,780
Okay. I'll give you time.

498
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,200
How much time?

499
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,750
Is two hours enough?

500
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,890
Two hours? How can I be mentally prepared?

501
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:39,040
In two hours you'll be my officially certificated wife.

502
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,550
You won't be able to escape anymore.

503
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,620
Who's ever acted like you?

504
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,020
I'm joking with you! Look at how scared you are.

505
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,300
First, wait for me to lead the team to play at the World Finals.

00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,020
Then, wait for us to have the wedding.

507
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,270
Then at the end, we'll consider this problem again, okay?

508
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,930
Now that's about it. I was joking, too.

509
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,890
Rest for a while first!

510
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,010
How can I rest here?

511
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,480
What are you doing?

512
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,570
Sit.

513
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,900

514
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,460
Sit!

515
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,070
Thank you! Then I won't stand on cerimonies.

516
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,500
It's pretty comfortable!

517
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,400
Later on when people come and see the two of us like this,

518
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,930
will they think that we are crazy?

519
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,920
No! For the purpose of being first, waiting the entire night is pretty normal.

520
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,660
<i>Thank you for taking this road with me until today.</i>

521
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,490

523
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,710
<i>no matter what small thing it is, it can be very sweet.</i>

524
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,360
<i>They can feel happiness from the bottom of their heart.</i>

525
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,500
<i>Even if they bicker all their life, they're still happy.</i>

526
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,440
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

527
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,030
<i>Why aren't they sweet everyday, but bicker all the time?</i>

528
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,090
<i>Anyways, no matter what we do together</i>

529
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:31,100
