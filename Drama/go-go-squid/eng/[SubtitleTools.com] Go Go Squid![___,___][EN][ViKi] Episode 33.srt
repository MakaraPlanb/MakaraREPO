22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,300
Okay.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,800
Also another thing, I am actually not good at cheering girls up.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,000
In the past, when Solo earned money, he would go buy something good for his girlfriend to eat.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,300
I think a girl like you would also like eating.

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,600
That's why I got you strawberries, strawberry cake and strawberry macaron.

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,600
The employee even said that the strawberry cake should be consumed shortly after buying, or else it won't be good if it melts.

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,100
Or if you want anything to eat in the future, write them down on a list. And I will go buy them according to the list. Is that good?

29
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,000
I want to eat it right now.

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Then I will go get it for you.

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,000
What are you doing, Tong Nian?

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Strawberry.

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Eating strawberries.

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,700
Did you drink alcohol?

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,900
Look! I drank an entire bottle of alcohol. Am I great?

Don't talk first. Answer me a question.

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,100
Am I really your first girlfriend?

40
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,600
Yes.

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Han Shangyan.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,200
You are mine. Mine.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
Tong Nian, stop messing around.

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,200
Han Shangyan, do you know? I really like you.

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,600
Do you know that you are really cute?

46
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,800
How can you be so cute? Little piggy.

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,600
I like you so much that I wish I could be with you twenty five hours a day.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,200
I like you when you're angry.

49
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,400
I like you when you're serious.

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
In short, I really like you. I really like you.

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,200
I like you so much.

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
Stop messing around, Tong Nian. Stop messing around.

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,200
Tong Nian.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,100
Tong Nian.

55
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,000
I really, really do really like you, Han Shangyan.

56
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,000
So cute. You are so cute.

57
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,500
Boss, we are ordering lunch. Do you want one?

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,400
No need.

59
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,700
Then, should we order one for Sister-In-Law?

60
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,380
She is still sleeping. There is no need.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
Wait a second.

62
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,300
Order one.

63
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
No problem, Boss. You've worked hard.

64
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,900
Your mom's health... She just had surgery.

65
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,700
She must remember to take a good rest from now on.

66
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,200
You should frequently get your mom supplements.

67
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,400
So that her body can recover sooner. Okay?

68
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

69
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,600
Are you two hungry?

70
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,800
- I am hungry.
- I am okay.

71
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,500
You must be hungry. Why don't I go to the kitchen and ask Nian Nian's mom and see...

72
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,800
What we should eat for dinner, is that okay?

73
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,600
That's not good. Zheng Hui and I should leave—

74
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,300
Have a seat. Have a seat.

75
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't be so polite.

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,500
Why don't you keep your mom company and chat with her?

77
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,400
- Okay.
- I will go take a look.

78
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,800
Then, sorry to bother.

79
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,500
Don't be so polite.

80
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,700
Thank you, Uncle.

81
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,600
Mom, it's fine. Let's sit for a bit.

82
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,800
It's bad to bother other people.

83
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,100
We're all family.

84
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,400
What's wrong? She still hasn't called back?

85
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,400
I am calling her friend, Lan Mei, right now and see if they are together.

86
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,000
Let me answer my phone.

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,200
Hello?

88
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,600
Lan Mei, it's me.

89
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,500
Is Nian Nian with you?

90
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,000
She is not. She is not.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,300
Oh, it's like this. I kept calling Nian Nian but she wouldn't pick up. I am a bit worried.

92
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,600
Auntie, don't worry.

93
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,000
It might be that she has bad signal and didn't hear.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,400
Thank you, then. Goodbye.

95
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,200
Call Nian Nian again. Call again.

96
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,300
Who is it?

97
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,400
Tong Nian's mom can't reach her.

98
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,400
She wouldn't be staying with your idol, right?

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,900
Probably not?

100
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,600
It's hard to say. Let me call and ask.

101
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,300
- Mom, this tastes really good.
- You eat some too.

102
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,200
Have more.

103
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,400
Here. Try this one.

104
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,000
Who is Lan Mei?

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
How would I know?

106
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
Hello?

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,900
<i>Hello? Is Tong Nian with you?</i>

108
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,900
She drank too much last night. She is still sleeping.

109
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,800
<i>What? She drank alcohol?</i>

110
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,400
Her mom has been looking for her everywhere. If she finds out, she will definitely be angry.

111
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,400
You must not let her answer her phone and it will be okay.

112
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you for warning me. I understand.

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
- She drank alcohol?
- That's right.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But that's good too. Faster progress.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,690
That's good too.

116
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,100
Tong Nian! Don't answer your phone!

117
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Hello?

118
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,800
Don't. Don't.

119
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,400
<i>Nian Nian, what's going on?</i>

120
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,200
<i>Your mom called you so many times and yet you still wouldn't pick up.</i>

121
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,100
<i>I am asking you, where are you now?</i>

122
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,400
I am...

123
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,200
I am at Han Shangyan's.

124
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,600
He is beside me right now.

125
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,800
What?!

126
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,000
You... You slept at his place?

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,800
<i>How can a girl act like this?</i>

128
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,900
I am sleepy. Let me sleep a bit longer.

129
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,800
<i>I am telling you. Come back right now! Did you hear me?</i>

130
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
<i>- Hello? </i>
- Hello?

131
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,000
Auntie, I am Han Shangyan.

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
<i>She doesn't feel well right now. She will sleep for a bit at my place and I will bring her back.</i>

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,900
I will come back with her and I will explain to you in person what happened.

134
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
That's all. Bye bye, Auntie.

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,600
Yummy.

136
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,300
Yummy what?

137
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,400
Hello? Hello?

138
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,200
Where is she sleeping?

139
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,800
Say something. Where is she sleeping?

140
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,700
Han Shangyan!

141
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,900
Han Shangyan?

142
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,800
They got back together again?

143
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,000
Nian Nian changed her mind again?

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,600
What change her mind. She must have been conned to go there.

145
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,200
Han Shangyan said Nian Nian isn't feeling well and is sleeping at his place.

146
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,400
And will come back tonight and explain to us about this.

147
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,200
Actually, that kid is quite infatuated with Nian Nian.

148
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,400
Now that I think about it, he is not bad.

149
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
At least he puts his whole heart on Nian Nian. What do you think?

150
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,900
What's wrong with you?

151
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,800
As a father, your girl is sleeping at his place, aren't you worried?

152
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,500
Of course I am worried. But it's not as serious as you think.

153
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,000
Wife, there are still guests at home. Let's discuss this after the guests have left.

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
No, this won't do. Go and get Nian Nian back right now. Hurry. Hurry.

155
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
What are you doing? Why are you being like this?

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Nian Nian is not a little kid anymore. She is an adult.

157
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,000
Whatever you do, you must respect your child, okay?

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Furthermore, what era are we in now?

159
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,600
We are not in the ancient times anymore. Look at your feudal-time thoughts.

160
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,100
Let me tell you.

161
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,500
Nian Nian sleeping at Han Shangyan, as a mother, I can't feel at ease at all.

162
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,600
Hurry and go!

163
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,400
Wife, listen to me. I talked with Little Han before.

164
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,200
Little Han, that kid, knows the proper limits in whatever he does.

165
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Don't worry.

166
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,400
Nothing will happen. Whatever he does, he would have the adults of the two families in mind.

167
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,000
- Don't worry. Don't worry.
- All right.

168
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,100
What do you think happened with Nian Nian? Zheng Hui, that kid is so great.

169
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,800
Every day, he would go to the hospital and take care of his mom. You could tell right away he is such a filial kid.

170
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,000
Why is Nian Nian not meant to be with him?

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,200
I am so angry.

172
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,800
Actually, Little Han that kid is not bad either.

173
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,000
At least he is patient with the elderly. So great.

174
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,600
What's wrong with you? Why does it sound like you are changing your mind?

175
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,000
Changing my mind?

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,600
Let me ask you. Whose side are you on?

177
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,000
Whose side can I be on? Of course I am on the same side as yours.

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,600
I am just expressing my own opinion.

179
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,600
But you are the head of the family. You are the core of this family.

180
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Your opinion matters most. We all listen to you, right?

181
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,000
That's enough, you!

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
There are still guests here. Let's go.

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
Go. Go.

184
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,400
You're awake?

185
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Your mom called you 47 times.

186
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,800
But I didn't pick up.

187
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,100
But you picked it up.

188
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,000
Where's my phone?

189
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
Do you know what you told your mom?

190
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,400
What did I say? The words I used were quite pure, right?

191
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,300
You said you are sleeping here, and beside me also laid Han Shangyan.

192
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,200
How could I say this kind of nonsense?!

193
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,000
Hurry and go wash up. I'll go home with you later.

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Why are you coming home with me?

195
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,700
In the phone, your mom is almost going crazy, she almost ate me.

196
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,200
I must go and explain it to her.

197
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh no, oh no! I'm so dead!

198
00:13:52,930 --> 00:14:03,070

199
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,630
What are you looking at?

200
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,800
Looking at you wearing a shirt, so handsome.

201
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
Why are you wearing a suit?

202
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,800
Are you hungry?

203
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,410
Since you're not hungry, let's first solve the problem with your parents then.

204
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,010
My bag!

205
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,700
Wait.

206
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,390
Let me help you.

207
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,200
How about... How about you don't go inside.

208
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,600
In the phone, my mom is pretty angry.

209
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
I'm afraid when you go inside, you'll be scolded.

210
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
You know you did something wrong?

211
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,100
I didn't do it on purpose.

212
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,870
I think you did it on purpose.

213
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,100
Don't be scared.

214
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,490
Dad. Mom.

215
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,400
What happened? Why would you be sleeping at his place?

216
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,800
Didn't you two broke up?

217
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,700
What in the world happened? Explain it to me clearly.

218
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
Nian Nian, go upstairs.

219
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,200
<i>After I go upstairs, what do I do if they make it difficult for him?</i>

220
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,400
<i> Originally, he's already not welcome at home. </i>

221
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,600
Go upstairs! Did you hear me?

222
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,300
<i>No way. I can't leave.</i>

223
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,100
I'm not going to talk or do anything. I'm just going to sit here and listen to you guys, can I?

224
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,500
Uncle, Auntie, I'm very sorry.

225
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,400
Let me talk first. Please take a seat.

226
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,840
Summer, get off.

227
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Both are you elders might have some misunderstandings concerning things between Tong Nian and I.

228
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,100
Two years, not long after I founded K&K club,

229
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,000
at the first exhibition, it was the first time I met Tong Nian.

230
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,300
Having met once, I was incapable of forgetting it since.

231
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,000
<i> Didn't we only meet before Chinese New Year? I was also the one pursuing you. </i>

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,800
I originally thought in a vast sea of people, that we would not have the chance to meet again.

233
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,300
Fortunately, this year I brought the team to participate in a competition.

234
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,390
And she just happened to be in the same place for an event.

235
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,500
And it could be considered when we formally met each other.

236
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,600
I was especially excited then.

237
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:45,300
Maybe I felt that I went overboard. Me, a guy who's almost 30, how could I be acting like a young lad?

238
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,900
But please think about it. What I said is true.

239
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,600
<i> Clearly, it was me who was very excited. You didn't even pay attention to me. </i>

240
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,400
In the beginning, since I'm so much older than her, Nian Nian probably doesn't approve my age.

241
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,600
So that's why the situation on the evening of the New Year's Eve Dinner happened.

242
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm very sorry. For concealing things from you two, I feel very guilty.

243
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,800
At that time, Nian Nian wasn't willing to acknowledege my existence.

244
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,900
Therefore, I did not dare to pay a visit without permission.

245
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,600
<i>What in the world is he talking about?</i>

246
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,800
As a man, I think the most important career

247
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,410
I think one should first be successful in his career before he starts a family.

248
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,000
But ever since I met Nian Nian,

249
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,500
I feel like everything is not important.

250
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,600
After we made up not very long ago, she mentioned wanting to break up with me again.

251
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,200
I was crushed and I came back here.

252
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,600
So there's the situation today. I brought Nian Nian to the club.

253
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
I asked her, "If you really can't accept how busy I am right now,

254
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,000
then I will discard all my stocks and completely change careers."

255
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,800
For you, I am willing to give up the K&K club that I created with my own two hands.

256
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,600
Nian Nian is still young.

257
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
To her, maybe I'm just part of her feelings.

258
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,410
But to me, she is already part of my life.

259
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,500
So today I brought her here to boldly visit you two in hopes that you can give me a chance.

260
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,400
If Nian Nian is not willing to be with me, really want to break up,

261
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,600
then I'll turn around immediately and disappear from your sight.

262
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,200
If she is willing to be with me,

263
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,900
I wish both of you can be relieved and put her in my hands.

264
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,600
Let me care for her forever.

265
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Actually, it is not easy for this young man.

266
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,400
Not easy?

267
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,400
He's actually quite charismatic.

268
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,200
Little Han, although Nian Nian's mother and I don't really understand

269
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,590
that playing with computers can be done as a career, I heard that your career is advancing pretty well, right?

270
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:26,700
It's an emerging industry. For sure you'll need to put in more time and energy into it than other businesses.

271
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,700
I only want to ask you one question.

272
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,400
In the future, where will you be developing the majority of your work?

273
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,800
I heard that your company's headquarters is in Norway?

274
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,300
China. Uncle, please don't worry.

275
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,800
Most of my time, I'll be in the country.

276
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,400
Then that's good.

277
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,420
Long distance relationships gets very complicated.

278
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,200
Little Han, you've been talking for so long, you still haven't explained it clearly to me.

279
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,900
Why is Nian Nian sleeping at your place?

280
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,400
Uncle, Auntie, please don't worry.

281
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,600
My intentions towards Nian Nian are sincere.

282
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,300
So before I get your approval, I won't cross the line.

283
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,200
Let me tell you, I don't care if you are sincere or not. All I know is that Nian Nian was never like this before.

284
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,400
After she met you, she plays the computer, and follows you around constantly. And now?

285
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Now she is already sleeping at your place!

286
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,000
Let me tell you, I almost don't know this daughter!

287
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,800
Nian Nian, go upstairs.

288
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,700
This is absurd. Go upstairs and pull yourself together.

289
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,600
Go! Go!

290
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,400
Hurry up and go in, and really reflect on yourself.

291
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,700
Say, are you being proper?

292
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,500
You're not even married and you easily went to a man's place and stayed overnight.

293
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,800
What will people think if the word gets out?

294
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't even know how to scold you. Angered me to death.

295
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,900
Little Han,

296
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,600
Nian Nian's mom has never said heavy words to Nian Nian.

297
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,800
She has also never had such an attitude towards Nian Nian.

298
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,800
Nian Nian must be very sad. Go up and advise her.

299
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,960
Go ahead.

300
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,500
I believe you.

301
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,780
What do you want, Mom?

302
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,160
Why is it you?

303
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,620
Your dad let me up to advise you.

304
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,370
Come in!

305
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,490
That's not appropriate.

306
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,400
My mom is next door. Don't let her hear you.

307
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,460
How do you know this is my room?

308
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,080
I guessed it.

309
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,190
This style of decorations...

310
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,470
Do your eyes not hurt?

311
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,660
Not really.

312
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,360
I think it's pretty fine.

313
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,490
Why are you standing there? Have a seat. Sit down anywhere you want.

314
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,010
Never mind. I don't even know where would it be appropriate for me to sit.

315
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,940
Looks like your mom doesn't really like me.

316
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,330
That's not it. It's just that my mom had me when she was 36.

317
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,040
That's why she is especially fond of me and has more expectations of me.

318
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,220
Can I ask you a question now?

319
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,080
Go ahead.

320
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,560
You said you saw me two years ago.

321
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,140
Fake.

322
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,540
Then what about falling in love with me at first sight in Guangzhou?

323
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,300
Fake.

324
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,860
And when you said during New Year's Eve dinner,

325
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,450
it's because of Wu Bai that you asked me to pretend to your girlfriend.

326
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,990
That's also fake. That was a special circumstance.

327
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,640
If I didn't acknowledge our relationship, with just what my little brother said alone,

328
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,850
it is very likely that people would misunderstand as an adult male playing around with a young girl.

329
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,880
Playing and then abandoning a girl, refusing to admit their relationship.

330
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,990
Then, I am sure that your parents would give me a even harder time.

331
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,480
What you said is right.

332
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,460
Why do I feel like everything is fake? Did you make all of these up?

333
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,600
I...

334
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,850
I still have something very important that I need to ask you.

335
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,490
All that I said about taking responsibilities for you?

336
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,570
<i>I like this, it's so pretty.</i>

337
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,110
<i>Thank you.</i>

338
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,000
<i>Tong Nian.</i>

339
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:26,350

00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,440

you would be holding Snow White.

438
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,060
In the library, whispering to each other by the ear.

439
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,440
Or going to the cafeteria together, exchanging glances.

440
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,200

Did any of that happen? You never got to enjoy any of those, right?

Tong Nian, Professor was saying earlier that where should we wait for him again?

510
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,630
Wait for him in this classroom.

511
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,460
This... In this classroom.

512
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,900
Tell me. The guy just now, which department is he from?

513
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,110
Our class president will be heartbroken. She already has a boyfriend.

514
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,170
- That's right.
- He is here to declare his sovereignty.

515
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,150
Let me take a picture and send it to the class president later and shatter his young boy heart.

516
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,760
Not only the class president, there's also Zheng Hui.

517
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,780
That's right. What is Zheng Hui going to do?

518
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,230
You may have to wait for a bit longer. Because Professor is coming in a bit, I have to hand him the exams.

519
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,770
Okay, then I will just wait.

520
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,450
I'm going inside.

521
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,750
Can I also go inside?

522
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:45,080
You should be able to. It's not class time now, you should be able to enter the classroom.

523
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,870
Then let's go.

524
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,560
Hi.

525
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,720
Sit over here.

526
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,760
Sit here, sit here.

527
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,130
You came to find me today, is it because there's something going on?

528
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,810
I can't come find you even if nothing's up?

529
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,520
That's not it. Of course you can. You can.

530
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,960
Tong Nian, I'm here.

531
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,310
Why are you here?

532
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,170
Why is he here?

533
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,430
Professor is here. Professor is here.

534
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,530
You were so flustered just now.

535
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,360
You were late again? Did you oversleep again?

536
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,460
No... After proctoring, I went and ate breakfast.

537
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,250
Ate breakfast.

538
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,110
All right, hand in the exams.

539
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,920
Just say you're my brother and here to pick me up from school.

540
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,240
- No, that won't do. Just say you entered the wrong classroom.
- Everyone signed in, right?

541
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,190
Just make something up. Make up a reason.

542
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,210
Professor.

543
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,300
Who are you?

544
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,940
Why did you come here? Did you enter the wrong classroom?
