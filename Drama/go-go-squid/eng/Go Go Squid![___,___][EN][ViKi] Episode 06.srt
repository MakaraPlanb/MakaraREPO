I want to thank everyone. Thank you, thank you.

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,060
He is my senior.

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,250
His name is Zheng Hui. He is mainly responsible for areas regarding the medical aspect.

26
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,100
He is currently working with the radiology department of many top tier domestic hospitals.

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,900
In December of 2017, he was invited to the annual European Congress of Radiology.

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,420
Let's give him a round of applause!

29
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,200
Everyone, please study hard and come hang out with me later on.

30
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,060
What about criminal investigations? Who is responsible for that?

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,630
That... I need to introduce to you in detail.

32
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,860
Criminal investigations are by Sun Yaya and myself...

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,110
You two are so pretty, then we will come and hang out with you guys later on.

34
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,760
Actually, Sun Yaya and I are responsible for Portrait Gantry.

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,740
It's... the facial recognition system.

36
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,050
Everyone might've seen the earlier Euro-American movies, right?

37
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,440
Don't they have traffic hubs?

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,430
Then, you can find the criminal suspect that you are looking for.

39
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,730
Senior, don't we have that already? Mission Impossible?

40
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,130
That's correct. The movie you mentioned, Mission Impossible.

41
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,300
But the technology back then was imaginary.

42
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,520
It did not actually exist.

43
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,630
And now this kind of technology really does exist.

44
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,470
In addition, in China, it is developing very well.

45
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,170
How great is it?

46
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,500
This is America's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

47
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,540
In 2017, these two countries organized a facial recognition competition.

48
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:12,180
In this competition, China received first place among global competitors.

49
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,150
I also want to say something from my heart that is not related to artificial intelligence.

50
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,700
These few years, my biggest experience was... I used to often travel overseas for competitions.

51
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,780
One time, I was in England, and, at that time, I felt very envious of them.

52
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,660
Why?

53
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,560
They use one credit card to accomplish many things.

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,770
At that time, I was thinking when will we be able to do that?

55
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,770
But unexpectedly, just a few years later,

56
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:47,300
in China, we only need a cell phone to do all the things you want to do.

57
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,970
We can use it to go out for a meal, have a cup of coffee,

58
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,550
even go to the hospital and all will be taken care of just by scanning a QR code.

59
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,900
The earliest to popularize this lifestyle is China.

60
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,640
I feel extremely proud. Do you feel proud, my fellow classmates?

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,570

- It will be here soon.
 - What is after Six? Six Six <i>(liù liù)</i> all in order?
<i>(T/N: Another saying that people usually say in New Year's greetings: liù liù dà shùn - "Everything goes smoothly.")</i>

171
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,690
- Six Six <i>(liù liù)</i> to your head!
 - Hurry up, I want to see it.

172
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,820
I want to write a specially creative one.

173
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,140
An especially handsome one. You wouldn't know how to appreciate it.

174
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,250
Clean up! Clean up!

175
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,340
What are you all doing?

176
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,400
Nothing.

177
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,110
I told them that they could write the New Year's couplets here.
<i>(T/N: two lines of verse, usually in the same meter and joined by rhyme, that form a unit.)</i>

178
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,120
It's almost vacation time anyway. Don't scare everybody anymore.

179
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,280
Aren't you going to give out red envelopes?

180
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,380
I am going to give out red envelopes. I don't know why they are all so nervous for.

181
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,700
Boss, when did you become so generous?

182
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,550
Long live the Boss! Mighty powerful Boss!

183
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,380
- Happy New Year.
 - Thank you, Boss.

184
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,410
Can our ranking go up into the Top 20?

185
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,540
Yes, it can.

186
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,400
Even though the club doesn't permit dating publicly, if you need to date then do it.

187
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,590
Or else, your mom will come and look for me again.

188
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,400
Boss, you should give me an introduction. I would like to go for an arranged marriage.

189
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,680
I already take care of your housing and meals. Do I need to manage your love life, too?

190
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,670
Thank you, Boss.

191
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,270
Boss.

192
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,120
Happy New Year. You should speak more harshly.

193
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,940
No problem. I will.

194
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,100
Happy New Year.

195
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,530
Please hand out the rest to everyone. One per person.

196
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,310
All right, Boss.

197
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,880
So good?

198
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,080
I didn't prepare one for you.

199
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,350
You must be joking. I actually guessed it already.

200
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,520
I'll go get the car. I'll come and pick you up later.

201
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,040
If you are going to write the couplets, write them well.

202
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,980
Your handwriting is so ugly, aren't you embarrassed to put these up?

203
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,960
Yes. Got it.

204
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,890
Thank you, Boss.

205
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,520
Bye, Boss.

206
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,250
<i> [Six beasts will prosper]</i>

207
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,960
It's too high. Go lower.

208
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,130
- Too high?
 - Yes.

209
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,440
- Then here.
 - Here. In the middle.

210
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,330
- Here.
 - Right. That's good here.

211
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,800
Why are you putting that on Boss's door?

212
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,740
Do you mean this one? I wanted to wish him well with this.

213
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,440
Right, doesn't Boss have Sister-in-Law now?

214
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,290
During the New Year's break, I hope the two of them will strike the iron while it is hot.

215
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,640
Get married and have a baby next year.

216
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,810
What is that called? Many kids, many grandkids, more fortune and longevity!

217
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,910
You are good. Let us have some fun.

218
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,710
Let's take a picture then we can tear it down.

219
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,250
Come... One, two, three.

220
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,590
- Aren't you in a hurry to get home for the New Year's?
 - H-Hurry.

221
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,860
There's going to be traffic later. If you miss your train,

222
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,810
don't expect me to take care of you.

223
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,890
Then... Boss, can we go now?

224
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,500
- Scram.
 - All right.

225
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,310
- We're going, Boss.
 - Happy New Year, Boss.

226
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,340
All of you, hurry up. Don't be dawdling.

227
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,140
Hurry home for New Year's.

228
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,260
Come back on the 6th. Got it?

229
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,710
We heard you, Boss.

230
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,200
<i> [Six beasts will prosper]</i>

231
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,230
Auntie Zhao, don't do that anymore. Hurry and pack up. Go home for New Year's.

232
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,070
Only a little bit left. I'll be done once this is finished.

233
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,660
Auntie Zhao, a New Year's red envelope.

234
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,110
Thanks, Little Han. I appreciate the gesture.

235
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,740
One envelope for my son Zhou Yi and myself is enough.

236
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,210
Besides, I should be the one giving it to you.

237
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,680
You are the younger generation. You even call me "Auntie."

238
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,730
Auntie Zhao, listen to me.

239
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,240
Even though the two of you are from one family, each person has one job, getting two envelopes is proper.

240
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,210
- Accept it.
 - No need.

241
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,480
- Accept it. Don't be polite with me. Here.
 - No need.

242
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,030
Accept it. Don't be polite with me.

243
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,350
Child, you are too polite.

244
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,780
Thank you.

245
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,240
I'll do it. Leave the rest to me.

246
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,680
You have to let me finish wiping it. I have OCD, I'm not comfortable if I don't complete a task.
<i>(T/N: OCD: obsessive compulsive disorder)</i>

247
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,370
It's so good that this bunch of K&K kids have you here to take care of them.

248
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,690
That's because you are a good person.

249
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,620
I'm going, Auntie Zhao.

250
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,330
- See you soon.
 - See you, bye-bye.

251
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,840
Boss.

252
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,000
Happy New Year. Much prosperity to you.

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,560
Wish you good health. All goes as wished.

254
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,880
All right. Get going now.

255
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,070
See you next year, Boss.

256
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,310
G Shuai, hurry up. We are going to miss the car.

257
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,360
<i>Stop rushing me!</i>

258
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,810
Boss, Happy New Year.

259
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,600
- See you after the Spring Festival.
 - So noisy.

260
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,420
Boss, you will have peach blossom luck during the Spring Festival. Cherish the opportunity.
<i>(T/N: "peach blossom luck" -  luck with romance)</i>

261
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,890
- When we return, we will appraise for you.
 - Appraise what? He is already a mature-aged youth, and still needs appraisal?

262
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,840
If the two of you are not in a hurry to leave, the vacation can be canceled.

263
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,510
Don't. We are going now.

264
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,080
Wait a second.

265
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Boss, we were wrong. I will apologize for him.

266
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,610
Please let us go this time. I haven't gone home for an entire year.

267
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,010
Is someone not going home this time?

268
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,550
- Only Demo.
 - Why?

269
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,070
He said that his parents are divorced. He doesn't have a place to stay.

270
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,310
He said he will go back after the May 1st holiday. Right?
<i>(T/N: May 1st - International Workers' Day)</i>

271
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,300
That's about right.

272
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,850
- Boss, we really can't talk anymore. Our car is waiting.
 - Don't pull me!

273
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,030
Boss, your fortune will be as vast as the sea. See you after the holiday!

274
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,130
<i>Stop pulling me! You are ruining my clothes!</i>

275

276
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,840
B-Boss.

277
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,610
Did you forget our rule?

278
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,110
I d-didn't forget.

279
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,290
Say it once for me.

280
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,480
All the computers inside the training room are not allowed to be used for watching films.

281
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,270
Your memory is fine.

282
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,630
Aren't w-we on holiday?

283
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,280
I thought you already left.

284
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,150
So if I leave, you can watch films in the training room. Is that it?

285
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,110
I was wrong. I am going to start independent training right now.

286
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,350
Get up.

287
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,420
Boss,

288
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,700
let's not do corporeal punishment.

289
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,980
- Pack your things .
 - Pack what?

290
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,720
Pack some clothes and necessities. Don't expect me to prepare them for you.

291
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,470
Go back with me for New Year's. Don't be wasting utilities here.

292
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,050
Go home with you?

293
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,430
For New Year's?

294
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,490
Still not going to hurry and pack?

295
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,340
- Captain.
 - Demo,

296
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,400
put your luggage in the trunk.

297
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,880
All right.

298
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,920
Taking him home with us?

299
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,730
It's a waste of utilities for him to stay here by himself. It's better off for him to go back with us for New Year's.

300
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,070
Besides Grandpa is back.

301
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,400
You don't like to talk. I always get yelled at.

302
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,830
Better to bring a nice one back and humor him. Save you and I some trouble.

303
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,800
Boss, I always thought you didn't have a home in Shanghai and only had the club.

304
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,140
He has a house; it's used to deceive people.

305
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,760
Deceive people?

306
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,080
He bought the house and told his family that he would get married;

307
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,550
otherwise, why would his family allow him to come to Shanghai and start the K&K Club?

308
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,070
So that's the situation.

309
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,670
Boss, you are so amazing.

310
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,760
Boss, thanks for taking me home with you.

311
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,750
Do you think I am going to let you stay for free?

312
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,890
It's so amazing to stay here for New Year's!

313
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,460
They have this, too. I loved playing this when I was young.

314
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,170
The third-floor room is mine.

315
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,130
The second floor has two rooms.

316
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,030
That one is Wu Bai's.

317
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,600
That empty one is yours.

318
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,400
Grandpa is living in the first-floor guest room.

319
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,860
Can you cook?

320
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,690
A little. I've been assisting my mom since I was young.

321
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,930
Then don't be too idle during the New Year's holiday, either. How about doing the cooking and cleaning up?

322
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,670
No problem!

323
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,370
Do you know how to humor the elderly?

324
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,800
What kind of humor are you talking about?

325
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,930
Just need to speak more than Wu Bai and be better than me at making other people feel happy.

326
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,630
That's way too easy!

327
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,740
Okay, then you can tidy up; I'm going up now.

328
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,650
Boss! Does the fridge have food?

329
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,120
Is two day's worth enough?

330
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,900
That's plenty! Then you and Captain should rest first.

331
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,640
We'll have dinner at 6:00 sharp.

332
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,780
Let's go.

333
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,980
It's really like you; you can never say anything good.

334
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,010
What do you mean?

335
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,760
You can clearly cook, why are you making Demo do it?

336
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,510
I can't just let him stay at our house for free, right?

337
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,440
Then, why don't you just directly ask him to pay rent?

338
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,910
Actually, you want to strengthen his ability of self-reliance, right?

339
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,220
When did you start having so much to say?

340
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,820
Boss, Captain. Come here.

341
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,500
How is it? Not bad, right?

342
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,240
Pretty good.

343
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,930
Please sit.

344
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,190
While it's hot, you both get a chicken leg.

345
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,440
Captain, try some, too.

346
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,560
Boss! Boss!

347
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,690
Captain, what did I do?

348
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,210
It's okay. Eat.

349
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,480
Did I make something that Boss really hates?

350
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,940
Not eating is not okay.

351
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,930
If anything, I'll pack him some dishes and bring them upstairs to him.

352
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,830
If you're not scared of being yelled at, then go ahead.

353
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,620
Is it because Boss doesn't like to eat these dishes?

354
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,460
What if I make some new dishes for him?

355
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,830
You eat first. I'll be quick.

356
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,960
<i>It's so enchanting...</i>

357
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,390
<i>Si Si, have you noticed that there have been more and more blue skies above our heads in the last two years?</i>

358
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,670
<i>The rivers are becoming clearer. The plants on the mountain are becoming greener.</i>

359
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,930
<i>Even the air that we breath has become fresher.</i>

360
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,630

 - You are the one who said it.</i>

<i>Only his face is sour but he is still very kind-hearted.</i>

377
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,610
<i>Wang Hao, you could not find any more people so you chose an annoying kid to fill-in?</i>

378
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,640
<i>Then, you can try her skills later.</i>

379
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,680

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,580
<i>Captain, you don't have to make it hard on yourself every time.</i>

498
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,130
<i>Old Han, you're tall and the couch is so small.</i>

499
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:03,460
<i>Trust me. If you slept on the sofa, your back would hurt more than mine.</i>

500
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,440
<i>Does it feel packed?</i>

501
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,210
<i>It's not that it feels packed.</i>

502
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,450
<i>It's just that you guys are able to tolerate Ou Qiang's Lion-Roaring Sound every day?</i>

503
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,080
<i>Just bear with it for now.</i>

504
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,190
<i>When the sponsors give us another sum of money,</i>

505
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,910
<i>I promise to switch to a bigger bed for you guys.</i>

506
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:27,000
<i>Also, Little Mi, don't cram into Old Han's space in the future.</i>

507
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,920
<i>I never crammed into his space! Why is it packed?</i>

508
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,160
<i>Don't get irritated right when you wake up!</i>

509
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,350
<i>Earthquake! Earthquake!</i>

510
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,180
<i>If you keep on being like this, I don't believe any girl would want to sleep with you.</i>

511
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,050
<i>Old Han, let me just gossip a bit. Do you have a girlfriend?</i>

512
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,700
<i>Don't talk about love before becoming successful.</i>

513
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,590
<i>Han Shangyan, should I introduce a girlfriend to you?</i>

514
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,300
<i>I have no interest.</i>

515
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,700
<i>What do I care if you have an interest or not?</i>

516
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:12,020
<i>I just don't want the two of us going out on dates every day and we still have to bring you along, okay? Especially today.</i>

517
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,800
<i>You two just go on your date. I don't have anything to do, I'll go look at real estate.</i>

518
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,060
<i>- Real estate?
 - Look at what kind of real estate?</i>

519
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,640
<i>Looking at real estates, buying a place, establishing a club.</i>

520
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,600
<i>A club?</i>

521
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,070
<i>In the future, we want to establish a huge club.</i>

522
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,390
<i>We want to have tens of people, or even hundreds of people together.</i>

523
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,770
<i>To eat, to train.</i>

524
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,800
<i>Not only do we want to play CTF (Capture The Flag, a computer security competition where you protect your network and attack your opponent's),</i>

525
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,680
<i>we want everyone in the country to know about this industry, to accept it and support it.</i>

526
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,260
<i>What do you think?</i>

527
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,600
<i>You two really like to daydream.</i>

528
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,910
<i>Nevertheless, I hope your dream comes true soon.</i>

529
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,290
<i>Okay! Wash your face, brush your teeth. Let's go eat!</i>

530
00:33:55,290 --> 00:34:00,400
<i>Yay! Go-go-go!</i>

531
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,230
<i>Little Mi, you're wearing my slippers again.</i>

532
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,400
<i>Your smelly feet!</i>

533
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,760
<i>Over here, Little Mi!</i>

534
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,730
<i>Where is my cat?</i>

535
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,570
<i>Team Captain, about the CTF,</i>

536
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:23,200
<i>is it really as great as you described to be?</i>

537
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,060
<i>Believe me, you can do it for sure.</i>

538
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:34,100
<i>Then do you guys think that I can become China's number one female geek in the future?</i>

539
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,670
<i>- No problem!
 - Really?</i>

540
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,720
<i>You guys!</i>

541
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,500
<i>Can you stop having such big movements?</i>

542
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,550
<i>Little paws.</i>

543
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,870
<i>Hey. Slow down.</i>

544
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,520
<i>You got the water dirty. How should other people wash now, Little Mi?</i>

545
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,040
<i>Little Mi!</i>

546
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,620
<i>It's dirty!</i>

547
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,800
<i>Ou Qiang, in a bit, go to the end of the block.</i>

548
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,380
<i>Buy some soybean milk and fried breadsticks.</i>

549
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,830
<i>I want to eat a big lanlong.
(T/N: A type of meat bun)</i>

550
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,200
<i>Eat what?</i>

551
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,020
<i> - Big lanlong.
 - Go get a few big lanlongs for him.</i>

552
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,160
<i>No problem.</i>

553
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,380
<i>You finished brushing your teeth that quickly? Did you brush your teeth well?</i>

554
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,350
<i>I brushed them extremely clean.</i>

555
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,840
<i>- Did you bring money?
 - Did you bring money?</i>

556
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,320
<i>I can just swipe with my face. I am so handsome.</i>

557
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,260
<i>- Little Mi, take the money with you.
 - You're relying on your face?</i>

558
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,400
<i>Money... Where's the money?</i>

559
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,230
<i>Is he putting purchases on credit every day there?
(T/N: she's asking if he has a tab or outstanding balance there)</i>

560
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,170
<i>That's right.</i>

561
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,500
<i>- Team Solo lost again. What a pity.
 - Yes. That's what I think, too.</i>

562
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,000
<i>They seem to have some problems with their tactics.</i>

563
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,660
<i>Gun was attacking too aggressively this time. His four teammates couldn't keep up with him at all.</i>

564
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,160
<i>That's right. This resulted in their vulnerability being discovered very easily by Team Buff.</i>

565
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,360
<i>Especially in server number two. There was a big mistake in Gun's analysis there.</i>

566
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,600
<i>Team Buff's main offense bypassed Gun to get three nodes. Say, how do you continue the game after that?</i>

567
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,580
<i>[Trigger Pulled Battle:SMELT]</i>

568
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,760
<i>Come tell us about it.</i>

569
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,650
<i>- Let's go.
 - It's like this...</i>

570
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,890
<i>- How do you feel after beating the Gun God?
 - Thank you, everyone.</i>

571
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,010
<i>Scram, go home!</i>

572
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,330
<i>Team Solo, what were you playing?</i>

573
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,210
<i>I came all the way from Guangdong to watch you compete.</i>

574
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,650
<i>I am really disappointed in you guys!</i>

575
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,760
<i>- Let's go.
 - Team Solo?</i>

576
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,300
<i>I think it should be Team Rancid. Just with those skills and you want to compete?
(T/N: Chinese pronunciation for rancid is similar to Solo)</i>

577
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,440
<i>Go back to farming instead!</i>

578
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,320
<i>If you are so good, why don't you compete instead?</i>

579
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,690
<i>If I can do it, why would we still need you?</i>

580
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,970
<i>Please don't talk like that to my teammates.</i>

581
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,310
<i>I am responsible for losing the competition.</i>

582
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:36,400
<i>If you guys didn't eat or sleep well, you wouldn't have the energy to compete either. </i>

583
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,210
<i>Especially this Han Shangyan.</i>

584
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,230
<i>Even calling himself Gun God? Even I can kick his ass.</i>

585
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,400
<i>- Since you lost the competition, hurry and leave!
 - Hurry back to farm!</i>

586
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,480
<i>- I want a refund for my tickets!
 - That's right! I want a refund, too!</i>

587
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,600
<i>Then go get a refund!</i>

588
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,820
<i>Why are you still playing CTF!</i>

589
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,530
<i>- Go! Go and get a refund!
 - Let's go, Little Mi.</i>

590
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,110
<i>- Go!
 - Don't talk anymore, Little Mi.</i>

591
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,580
<i>- Don't talk anymore, let's go!
 - Don't argue with him anymore!</i>

592
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,390
<i>- Go get a refund!
 - If you're so capable, then win!</i>

593
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,750
<i>I already said it, I have no money for you this year.</i>

594
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:31,400
<i>Director Lin, you see, we already signed a contract.</i>

595
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,730
<i>Furthermore, Team Solo will definitely be able to get the national champion this year.</i>

596
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,920
<i>Your sponsorship money still hasn't been implemented yet.</i>

597
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,060
<i>You see perhaps–</i>

598
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,770
<i>Director Lin, fruits for the guests are ready.</i>

599
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,160
<i>Secretary Liu, bring all of them out.</i>

600
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,460
<i>Also, I want to take back all of their dorms.</i>

601
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:06,300
<i>Director Lin, cybersecurity is a rising field and Team Solo is the strongest team in the nation.</i>

602
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,820
<i>This is also an opportunity for you. Please think it over.</i>

603
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,080
<i>- Scram!
 - Just leave.</i>

604
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,900
<i>Director Lin is busy. He doesn't have the time for you guys who play with computers. Leave!</i>

605
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,820
<i>Director Lin, we signed a contract.</i>

606
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,670
<i>If this really won't work, we will file a lawsuit against you!</i>

607
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,930
<i>Find a lawyer and file a lawsuit? Do you have money for a lawyer?</i>

608
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,870
<i>- Why are you doing this?
 - Old Han! Old Han!</i>

609
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,060
<i>Calm down! Old Han! Old Han!</i>

610
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,510
<i>Don't say anything. Let's go.</i>

611
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,310
<i>You will regret this.</i>

612
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,190
<i>I just can't bear to see you beg other people. It's just money.</i>

613
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,200
<i>It's not as easy as you think.</i>

614
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,480
<i>Our team has so many people, so many mouths to feed.</i>

615
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,840
<i>Think about it. We have rent,</i>

616
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,340
<i>water bills, electric bills, gas bills, registration fees, and transportation fees.</i>

617
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,900
<i>These are a large number of expenses. If I don't beg them, who will?</i>

618
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,360
<i>I'll help you think of a solution.</i>

619
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,850
<i>What kind of solutions can you come up with? Don't try to be a hero.</i>

620
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,260
<i>I can actually allocate at will the the education fund that my dad saved up for me before he died.</i>

621
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,380
<i>Old Han, I understand your intentions.</i>

622
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,920
<i>In the future, when our team accomplishes good results and earns money,</i>

623
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,990
<i>I will definitely pay you back.</i>

624
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,130
<i>Why don't we go to Shanghai?</i>

625
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,020
<i>There're more people there and more teams.</i>

626
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,540
<i>Let's start over in Shanghai. Let's fight for it again!</i>

627
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,830
<i>- Let us welcome our new members, Little You and Yiqian, for joining.
 - Welcome!</i>

628
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,520
<i>- Thank you. Thank you, everyone.
 - Welcome! Welcome!</i>

629
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,310
<i>Not bad, Team Captain.</i>

630
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,300
<i>Did you become rich?</i>

631
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,080
<i>Living so well in Shanghai with such a big house.</i>

632
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:30,190
<i>After all, I can't just let multiple grown men crammed into a small house.</i>

633
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,700
<i>Also, Ai Qing is a girl.</i>

634
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,070
<i>I can't let her suffer.</i>

635
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:39,190
<i>Did you not eat well again today?</i>

636
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,360
<i>Old Han,</i>

637
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,370
<i>I initially thought you would like big dogs,</i>

638
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,200
<i>like a Tibetan Mastiff or something.</i>

639
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,500
<i>But in reality, you like the kind that sticks to you for twenty-five hours,</i>

640
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,440
<i>that frequently will cling on to you,</i>

641
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,110
<i>and even use their little paws to tightly hold onto you; those kinds of little animals.</i>

642
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,090
<i>You all don't understand.</i>

643
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:08,930
<i>Old Han is called contrast lovely.</i>

644
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,600
<i>I really could have never imagined it, Han Shangyan.</i>

645
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,820
<i>You big boy treat little kitties so gently.</i>

646
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,370
<i>Come on! Come on! The food is here.</i>

647
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,700
<i>Come and try the food that I made.</i>

648
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,750
<i>- I learned from my mom last time.
 - Smells so good.</i>

649
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,500
<i>Okay, everyone.</i>

650
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:33,220
<i>Today is our second time celebrating New Year's together.</i>

651
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,800
<i>This time, we especially need to thank Han Shangyan.</i>

652
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,880
<i>If it weren't for his generosity, our team would have been disbanded long ago.</i>

653
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,900
<i>There wouldn't be today.</i>

654
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,280
<i> Thank you, Old Han.</i>
