23
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,690
Why'd you bring a kid to come and play?

24
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,650
Isn't having a kid nice? It's like missing a person.

25
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,160
Four against five, isn't that pretty exciting?

26
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,110
Bro, did you know?

27
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,460
I haven't watched you play games in a while.

28
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,470
You look quite handsome.

29
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,230
<i>You still haven't slept? Your parents won't spank you?</i>

30

<i>It's fine. School's on break, my parents won't care.</i>

31
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,280
<i>G Shuai! G Shuai! Disconnected? What a pity.
 (T/N: Shuai means handsome.)</i>

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
<i>Grunt's finally online!</i>

33
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,180
<i> Yeah! Dang it.</i>

34
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,490
<i> It's not easy to bump into G Shuai. Dang it.</i>

35
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,430
<i>I'm back.</i>

36
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,090
<i>I'll take responsibility of my kid.</i>

37
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,330
<i>Take care of yourselves.</i>

38
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,630
<i>All is well. G Shuai, it's your peeps. It's understandable then. </i>

39
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,400
<i>- Please accept my knees.
 - Hi, little kid!</i>

40
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,160
<i>Little Squid here! Please look after me!</i>

41
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,890
<i>Is my ID name bad?</i>

42
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,710
<i>It feels kind of strange.</i>

43
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,820
<i>Should I register a new account?</i>

44
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,250
<i>How about I register a new one next round?</i>

45
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,910
<i>Protect me. Talk less.</i>

46
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,870
<i>Okay! I promise to complete my mission.</i>

47
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,980
So, you really stayed up all night to play the game with him?

48
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,640
Of course.

49
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,900
He knew I didn't know how to play so he was very protective of me.

50
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,710
He told me to hide inside the door.

51
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,290
Then did you set up another date with him?

52
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,970
I didn't have time to and he went offline.

53
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,360
He must've figured out your ability and wanted to toss you aside.

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,120
Shut up will you! You came for a free meal, so stop blabbering.

55
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,940
Oh right! I didn't have time to ask him for a day off.

56
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,420
What day off?

57
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,530
I mean I am going to Guangzhou for a promotional event.

58
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,410
I'm telling Dounan that I won't be able to watch the internet cafe for him. Right?

59
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,080
Yes.

60
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,260
- Then is your flight in the afternoon?
 - Yeah.

61
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,840
- Are you done packing?
 - I finished packing yesterday.

62
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,920
I really don't understand what event she's participating in.

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,660
I'm participating in an off-line music event.

64
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,190
It's... never mind. You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

65
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,710
- Stop showing off! You get to earn extra money every day!
 - Shush!

66
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,140
- How many do you want?
 - Two.

67
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,370
Two, right?
<i>[Jinyun Flatbread]</i>

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,430
Here.

69
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,670
<i>- How many do you want?
 - Two flatbreads.</i>

70
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,790
Two flatbreads, right?

71
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,060
- Boss, two flatbreads please.
 - ¥8 <i>(~$1)</i>.

72
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,430
You raised the prices this much?

73
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,500
No. We haven't raised the prices in two years.

74
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,580
Before, weren't they ¥1.30 each?
<i>(~$0.19)</i>

75
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,390
You don't look familiar.

76
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,330
I used to come here with friends often. It's been 10 years already.

77
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,860
I still think of this flavor the most.

78
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,760
<i>¥1.30, tasty and cheap! Smells good.</i>

79
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,660
<i>Amazing!</i>

80
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,760
<i> - Ai Qing, later, take fifty of these to go.
 - Fifty? </i>

81
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,130
<i>Brother, fifty? We will be eating this for the next three days?</i>

82
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,710
<i> Didn't Ou Qiang say "Smells good, tasty, amazing!" </i>

83
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,460
<i>I want to put more on the side for you guys. You can eat them whenever you want to!</i>

84
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,670
<i>Don't worry. Following me, I won't let you go hungry.</i>

85
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,940
<i> I thought our team was poor and didn't have money for food.  </i>

86
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,110
<i> We could only eat flatbread to live.</i>

87
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,740
<i>Little Mi.</i>

88
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,370
<i>I'm going to go buy more now!</i>

89
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,760
<i> - I'll go, too!
 - Let's go!</i>

90
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,020
<i>Then I'll go choose different flavors.</i>

91
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,090
<i> - Fifty flatbreads.
 - Get in line, Ou Qiang. </i>

92
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,240
<i> Boss, fifty flatbreads, please.</i>

93
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,310
<i> Wang Hao, I was thinking. Should I find a way to borrow some money to help our club?</i>

94
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,950
<i>Don't. It wasn't easy for me to save money. What is it for?</i>

95
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,950
<i>So that you all can train properly.</i>

96
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,270
<i>And I believe that very soon,</i>

97
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,570
<i>there'll be good results.</i>

98
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,300
<i>Do you have a dream?</i>

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,280
<i>I do. To be the champion.</i>

100
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,570
<i>And you?</i>

101
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,440
<i>I want to become the cornerstone of this industry.</i>

102
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,450
<i> I want CTF to be like ping pong.
(Capture The Flag, a computer security competition where you protect your network and attack your opponent's)</i>

103
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,550
<i> I want more people to accept it.
(Capture The Flag, a computer security competition where you protect your network and attack your opponent's)</i>

104
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,050
<i>You have some ambition.</i>

105
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,720
<i> We must have confidence!</i>

106
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,430
<i>Also, I think that we should first get a world champion.</i>

107
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,000
<i>Then, we can have more swaying power.</i>

108
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,270
<i>You're right! Be World champions!</i>

109
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,910
<i>- Be World champions!
 - Get fifty flatbreads!</i>

110
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,150
<i>Fifty flatbreads! World champion!</i>

111
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,940
Come by often.

112
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
- Thanks.
 - All right.

113
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,610
- Boss, two flatbreads.
 - All right.

114
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,000
Wake up! Wake up you all!

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,460
Wake up! Stop sleeping! What time is it?

116
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,940
The sun is out! Wake up! I bought food for you all! Hurry up!

117
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,300
Han Shangyan, stop knocking.

118
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,020
The last time, you knocked a hole. Stop making me pay out money.

119
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,630
Boss, why'd you wake us up so early?

120
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,870
Eat flatbreads! Hurry and go wash up.

121
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,680
Okay...

122
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,010
Have some energy!

123
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,930
Do you guys want to become champions or losers?

124
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,510
Next time we partner to fight, I definitely will not be a pig teammate anymore.

125
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,180
<i> Why haven't you come online yet? </i>

126
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,470
<i> I want to say goodbye to you.</i>

127
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,630
<i> I'm going to Guangzhou for a few days. I won't be online to play with you.  </i>

128
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,710
<i>I'll find you when I come back.</i>

129
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,660
Wait until I transform!
<i>(T/N: to cast off one's old self and take on new self)</i>

130
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,510
Right now, the members of the SP first team have already been confirmed. They are these five people.

131
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,100
97, you introduce each person.

132
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,540
All right.

133
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
To introduce SP's first team, we should start with the legendary Team Solo.

134
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,180
Team Solo could be called the pioneers of CTF.
<i>[Han Shangyan, ID: Gun God] [Ou Qiang, ID: All] [Wang Hao, ID: Solo]
[Ai Qing, ID: Appledog] [Mi Shaofei, ID: Little Mi] </i>

135
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,980
<i>[Wang Hao, ID: Solo]
[Best commander / assist]
The team leader is Solo. His real name is Wang Hao.</i>

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,190
He has a reputation as the best commander. He is the best candidate to become captain.

137
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,360
However, after Team Solo disbanded, he only participated in individual projects.

138
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,600
But even after all these years, he never left the Chinese CTF circle

139
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,640
and made many immeasurable contributions to this circle.

140
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,570
<i> [Han Shangyan, ID: Gun God]
[Trump Card Main Offense]
Gun God. His real name is Han Shangyan. Also our Boss.</i>

141
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,460
His personal abilities exceeds Solo greatly.

142
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,900
Also, he is the team's sword. A guaranteed win once unsheathed.

143
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,170
- Our Boss is considered a genius. You guys know geniuses. They don't have good temperaments.
 - True.

144
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,110
Do you know why our Boss has a lot of female fans?

145
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,480
- He's handsome.
 - That's right.

146
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,700
<i>  [Ai Qing, ID: Appledog]
[Main Offense]
Appledog. Her real name is Ai Qing.</i>

147
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,660
Team Solo had two, male and female, main offense, one is our Boss and the other is Ai Qing.

148
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,410
Appledog can also be considered our captain, Wu Bai's, enlightenment mentor when he first entered the industry.

149
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,280
<i>[Ou Qiang, ID: All]
[Secondary Offense]
All. His real name is Ou Qiang. Main Defense and Secondary Offense.</i>

150
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,970
<i>There are no vulnerabilities he can't patch.</i>

151
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,910
He used to be Boss's most useful assistant.

152
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,200
<i>[Li Shaofei, ID: Little Mi]
[Side Defense]
Little Mi. His real name is Li Shaofei.</i>

153
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,180
Side Defense. Don't underestimate him.

154
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,770
He is an expert at analyzing and operating. He can attack, as well as defend.

155
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,440
As long as the tactic is needed, there is no position he can't fill.

156
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,180
Here is the main point.

157
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,590
All four of these people are on Team SP.

158
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,530
created our Team K&K, a few years ago.

159
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:27,080
Our poor boss. He was abandoned and is alone at K&K.

160
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,800

 - You're right.

Hello. I wanted to ask if you saw a group of people wearing black team uniforms walk out here.

176
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,190
I think they went to the parking lot.

177
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,680
- Is it over there?
 - Yes, yes. The parking lot over there.

 - No problem.

- Who is this girl?
 - Must be a fan.

180
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,120
What fan? They researched so much that they even know our flight schedule.

181
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,040
She's not looking at you.

 - Are you Little Squid from Weibo?

Yes, just call me Tong Nian. I am sorry, my plane was delayed today,

195
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,250
so I was delayed. If anything, you don't have to pay me the promotional fee, everyone waited for a long time.

This ice cold distant thing of yours has reached a new level.

212
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,900
I'll stop teasing you. The last time you were reciting words, you forgot to stand up and thank your fans and got criticized, did you forget?

213
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,190
How is that possible? I secretly cried at home for two days.

214
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:54,380
Do you know if there is competition close by?

215
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,360
For example, a basketball competition or soccer competition?

216
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,700
Don't they have training? Do you know where they would go for training?

217
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,190
Are you all right? Why do you all of a sudden care about basketball games?

218
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,960
No reason. I'm just randomly asking.

219
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,590
I think the CTF competition that my husband is obsessed with is holding a competition nearby too.

220
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,210
Really? When?

221
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,900
Today. My husband is a CTF fan.

222
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,560
He heard that my promotions for NetEase Music were also in Guangzhou.

223
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,120
He came to Guangzhou with me just to watch the competition.

224
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,320
He said it's at 3:00. It should've already started by now.

225
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,660
Right... CTF contestants are like athletes.

226
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,930
They all wear team uniforms, right?

227
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,590
Hi, I want to ask you if you know among those participating in the CTF Competition today,

228
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,200
which team is the one with the black team uniform?

229
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,070
I think it's K&K. Their team uniform is black.

230
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,670
Then, do you know where they are?

231
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,720
Probably the sports arena in the back. It started a while ago. They should be done by now.

232
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,340
- Thank you, thank you!
 - What's up?

233
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,640
- Let's go watch the competition.
 - I'm not going. I still have to collect money. You go.

234
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,550
- I think you can make it before it ends.
 - Help me to collect money, too. I'm going now. / - No!

235
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,330
- Help me collect it.
 - Got it.

236
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,290
Are you all right?

237
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,730
I'm fine.

238
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,000
The captain... The captain went to the infirmary to help me find some medication already.

239
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,940
But you can't go on like this.

240
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,660
- He's sick?
 - He said he has a terrible stomach pain.

241
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,880
Can you continue?

242
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,040
No problem.

243
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,670
Boss, don't worry. I won't embarass you.

244
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:44,230
If you can hang on, do it. The competition stage is like a battlefield.

245
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,930
I think... how about if we let the backup go?

246
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,890
What? What backup?

247
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,970
I'm G Shuai. Do I look like someone who needs backup?

248
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,870
Even if I die from the pain, I'll do it on the battlefield!

249
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,380
Let's go!

250
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,840
- Don't force yourself! Grunt, how about if we take you to the hospital?
 - I'm fine.

251
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,880
Look after him.

252
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,160
Don't worry. I will look after him. I also called the doctor.

253
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,080
Excuse me, where is your ticket?

254
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,150
Ticket? Where do I buy a ticket?

255
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,650
We already stopped selling tickets.

256
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,780
I can't buy any?

257
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,870
Little girl, do you need tickets? I have cheap ones here.

258
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,890
- You must be a scalper.
 - Yup!

259
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,010
What? Are you scared these are fake?

260
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,560
Don't worry, I'll sell them right here so you can pay me right in front of the staff.

261
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,720
No need. I never buy scalped tickets. Thank you.

262
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,710
Sister, are there still any e-tickets online or if you have extra tickets?

263
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,010
I can buy it now. I'll give you the money.

264
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,770
How about if you wait a bit. Maybe someone will refund their tickets.

265
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,880
No, the competition has already started; no one is going to ask for a refund.

266
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,980
Please. Please!

267
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:42,420
Clear the path by the road. Our team members will get on the bus here. Please arrange that.

268
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,920
- Please let me see Grunt!
 - Asking me is no use.

269
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,800
Please.

273
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,410
Yes. You... Do you know him?

274

275

No, I'm a staff here.

276

Being a competitor is in the past. I've retired.

277
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,800
Oh right, the competition is about to end. Do you still want to go in?

278
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,630
Yes. It would be all right even if I only take one look at Grunt.

00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,730
Was I kicked in the head by a donkey?

327
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,730
How is it?

328
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,430
He collapsed right after he left the stage.

329
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,710
I'm fine. Just pour me a cup of warm water.

330
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,130
You don't need to look for a doctor.

331
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,730
You dying in Guangzhou doesn't count as a work injury!

332
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,780
Boss, I am already like this.

333
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,430
Please don't torment me any further.

334
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,430
Demo, hurry and go pour some hot water. Hurry, hurry!

335
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,330
I think the situation is especially not good.

336
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,130
He has been throwing up since this morning.

337
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,130
He threw up everything until his stomach was empty and he is still throwing up.

338
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,330
He is very weak. This is a symptom of gastric bleeding.

339
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,130
Where is the doctor and nurse you looked for?

340
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,730
I think they are on their way. I will go take a look.

341
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,430
They're okay...

342
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,830
<i>Team K&K, because they have enough main players...</i>

343
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,530
<i>Then the opposing team... the one from before...</i>

344
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,630
<i>They are still lacking a bit  in control.</i>

345
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,130
Excuse me. I want to ask about something.

346
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,930
The team on the left was Team K&K.

347
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,870
How are they?

348
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,330
- Amazing.
 - K&K? They are one of the top two clubs in the nation.

349
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,330
Their Boss just came back from overseas to start the China branch.

350
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,230
They immediately wiped out all the other teams.

351
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,930
Currently, it seems like every other team besides SP is scared of them.

352
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,330
There's a teammate named Grunt. Do you guys know him?

353
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,030
- Grunt?
 - How is he?

354
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:14,330
Of course, Grunt is amazing. He is a major player on Team K&K. You tell me if that is amazing or not?

355
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,430
I specially came here from Suzhou for him.

356
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,330
- Really? Then are they coming back later?
 - Come back?

357
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,730
They just won a double-elimination match. They left already.

358
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,430
They left and aren't coming back?

359
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,730
Of course. Usually, after competing, they go straight back to the hotel.

360
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,830
We're here to wait for the next competition to start.

361
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,530
- Thank you, guys.
 - You're welcome.

362
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,530
So, I think that one bit is still missing.

363
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,650
<i>So I think Team K&K will lose this time.</i>

364
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,000
I heard that Grunt had a stomachache today.

365
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,730
He continued playing and they actually won.

366
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,830
I want to ask, what did you just say? Grunt has a stomachache?

367
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,230
Yes.

368
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,330
- What are you doing? Get out.
 - No.

369
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,630
Security Brother,  I was just inside watching the match. I only came out for one minute.

370
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,030
You can not do that! As long as you leave, you have used your ticket and can not enter again.

371
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,430
I can leave my luggage with you, okay?

372
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,830
- You cannot do that. Hurry up and leave
 - I will be really quick.

373
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,830
Security Brother, I'm asking this of you. I like Grun!

374
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,330
I heard that he has a stomachache. Can you please let me see how he's doing?

375
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,130
What does his stomachache have to do with you? Hurry up and leave.

376
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,730
I left my stuff in there. I need to go in to get it.

377
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:29,230
Your stuff is right in front of you! Don't try to trick me! Hurry up and leave, don't make trouble.

378
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,930
What are you doing? Why are you doing that to her?

379
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,030
No, I didn't. I am working.

380
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,330
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. They all saw you push her.

381
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,430
Hurry and leave.

382
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,030
Do you like Grunt, too?

383
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,730
- This is the sign I made. I am giving it to you.
 - Thank you.

384
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,530
We should go and watch the competition together next time. Just ignore him.

385
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,730
- Okay.
 - Bye-bye.

386
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,130
Stop messing around. Hurry and leave.

Remember to get him to take the medicine on time.

I will get him to take the medicine on time. Don't worry.

409
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,330
- He must take it on time.
 - All right.

410
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,930
- Bye-bye.
 - Bye-bye.

411
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,630
Why are you here?

412
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,730
I saw you while I was coming down.

413
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,430
- You were with our Boss.
 - <i>He's talking about Han Shangyan?</i>

414
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,030
Although you two kept a low profile but I still saw.

415
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,930
- You are for sure looking for our Boss, right?
 - Yes.

416
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,930
Our Boss must be waiting for you then.

417
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,230
Hurry. Come in, come in!

418
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,930
- Can I?
 - Yes, yes!

419
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,930
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

420
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,530
Boss didn't prepare a staff pass for you?

421
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,230
Prepare one for me? This doesn't seem suitable.

422
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,430
That's nothing. Boss is not being proper. He should get you a staff pass.

423
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,430
But that's how he is. Once there's a competition, he doesn't bother with anything else.

424
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:31,130
No need. I want to buy tickets to your competitions to support you guys.

425
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,430
Wait for me. Let me ask for you.

426
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,930
Jia Hao, where is Boss?

427
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,630
I don't know. Wasn't Boss just here?

428
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,780
Who is the girl out there? So pretty.

429
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,830
She is... Sister-in-Law.

430
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,730
Sister-in-Law?

431
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,230
- I couldn't even tell.
 - Tell her to come in and sit!

432
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,730
- Come in and wait.
 - Thank you.

433
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,530
Do you still want the hot water?

434
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,430
Hello, Grunt.

435
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,730
I didn't mean to disturb you.

436
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:17,130
I actually already left, then I heard the staff outside say that your stomach hurt.

437
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,530
So I wanted to come back to see how your stomach was.

438
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,630
Are you fine now?

439
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,530
- Who are you?
 - Who are you?

440
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,330
- Who are you?
 - I'm the one asking you who you are, okay?

441
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,630
He... He is Grunt.

442
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,330
Grunt, she is Sister-in-Law.

443
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,830
Hold on.

444
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,330
<i>What is going on? Who has gastric bleeding?</i>

445
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,130
Sister-in-Law was out there so I brought her in.

446
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,930
She was out there waiting for you, did you not know?

447
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,230
Why didn't you give her a staff pass? It's not very thoughtful.

448
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,830
What did you call her?

449
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,730
Sister-in-Law.

450
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,310
Why is he calling you "Sister-in-Law?"

451
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,300
I don't know.

452
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,780
You know her?

453
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,480
- I don't know her.
 - Tell the truth.

454
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,880
I am telling the truth!

455
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,280
Boss, my stomach is already in pain; stop forcing me.

456
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,800
- You know him?
 - I don't know him.

457
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,630
Go on, I'm listening.

458
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,570
Sister-in-Law is so obedient!

459
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,510
He said to go out and she went out.

460
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,290
It's my job.

461
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,130
I got it.

462
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,330
<i>It's all Dounan's fault. He is so unreliable.</i>

463
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,230
<i>He put the boot on the wrong foot and gave me the wrong name.</i>

464
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:18,300
<i>Grunt is clearly the one with glasses and has a girly tone; not him!</i>

465
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:34,580
I'm asking you, out of the entire Team K&K, who else do you know other than me?

466
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,330
Nobody.

467
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,440
So, at the competition, you only knew me?

468
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,510
So, you came to look for me?

469
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,060
<i>What else can I say? That a few days ago, I fell in love with you at first sight,</i>

470
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:02,450
<i>saw you in the airport in the morning, got excited and immediately looked for news about you everywhere,</i>

471
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,620
<i>and chased you from the exhibition hall all the way to the CTF competition? </i>

472
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,520
<i>Of course not!</i>

473
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,970
No, I didn't come to look for you.

474
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,680
Now that's odd. I am the only one you know here, yet you aren't here for me?

475
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,270
Why did you insist on going into Team K&K's resting area,

476
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,760
and why are you holding a sign with Grunt's name on it?

477
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,040
It's all a misunderstanding! It's really just a misunderstanding.

478
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,720
I just accidentally found out that you guys had a competition.

479
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,270
I was passing by, so I just came to see the fun!

480
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,180
Accidentally?

481
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,330
See the fun?

482
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,630
You got on an airplane and came all the way here.

483
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,140
You happened to pass by the competition and thought it would be fun.

484
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,780
So, you bought a ticket to come in and "see the fun"?

485
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,910
And then you suddenly heard that a player named Grunt had a stomachache and felt that unlucky fella was so pitiful,

486
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,630
so you came into Team K&K's resting lounge to see this unlucky fella.

487
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,250
Oh right, I forgot to say that this unlucky fella...

488
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,690
is someone you don't even know.

489
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,140
If I said that I really don't know him,

490
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,850
I only knew him after I saw him today, would you think that I am just trying to quibble?

491
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,810
You know that you are quibbling?

492
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,280
Speak the truth.

493
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:39,310
<i>If I said that I had mistaken him for someone else, would he chase me out?</i>

494
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,730
<i>I still want to get to know him more.</i>

495
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,230
You have a question for me?

496
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,880
Can I ask you a question?

497
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,420
There is give and take.

498
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,460
Are you also a professional player?

499
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,190
Me?

500
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,780
I don't count.

501
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,580
Then, why do they call you "Boss?"

502
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,400
This question... I've never discussed it with outsiders.

503
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,020
<i>- Go and tell the boss!</i>
 - I'm hungry...

504
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,960
Hurry and tell him.

505
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,050
They're in charge of competing. I'm in charge of their housing and food.

506
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,350
Then, I know. It's very similar to...

507
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,380
It's similar to an event planner, right?

508
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:37,770
They're in charge of the guests' housing and food, and responsible for their schedule.

509
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,190
It must be hard work for you, right?

510
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,490
That said... it's pretty much like that.

511
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,660
Then, I als–

512
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,820
Um... Boss, have you finished chatting?

513
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,370
What is it?

514
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,590
Nothing, they're just hungry.

515
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,880
Yeah, hungry.

516
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,070
Tell everyone to get in the car.

517
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,750
Okay.

518
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,520
97.

519
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,880
Later, take the kid outside to the hotel first.

520
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,050
Oh... okay.

521
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,400
One.

522
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,510
Boss, 97 forced me. I heard nothing, seriously.

523
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,880
Go find the manager. Tell her I need to see her.

524
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,550
Oh, okay.

525
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,410
<i>Bros! Let's go, get in the car. We're going to eat.</i>

526
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,100
Sister-in-Law, I got your suitcase. Let's go.

527
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,120
- No, no. I can do it myself.
 - Why are you being so polite for? Let's go.

528
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,110
- To where?
 - To eat.

529
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,250
Huh? What food?

530
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,370
Boss told me to take you to the car. We're going back to eat the celebratory meal.

531
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,440
I have to go, too?

532
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,120
Of course. You'll have to meet us sooner or later. Let's go.

533
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,050
Don't be scared. We're easy to approach. Let's go.

534
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,660
I want to ask. Did Han Shangyan want me to go?

535
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,170
Of course, Boss specifically said to take you. Let's go.

536
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,000
Okay.

537
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,260
Han Shangyan.

538
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,270
I heard your girlfriend came.

539
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,600
Nonsense.

540
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,670
Oh right. I have something to ask.

541
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,640
Did Grunt get a girlfriend?

542
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,500
His emotional life is pretty complicated.

543
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,670
I can't tell. Sometimes he has one, sometimes he doesn't.

544
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,860
Mysterious.

545
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,850
The girl is here.

546
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,280
No way.

547
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,510
I figure it's a love affair.

548
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,430
The little girl wouldn't say anything because she wanted to protect him. I asked her for a long time but didn't get any useful information.

549
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,730
She's scared of you and definitely won't admit it.

550
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,830
Scared of me so I take the blame?

551
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,350
Take what blame?

552
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,110
97 calls her "Sister-in-Law."

553
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,450
Sister-in-Law?

554
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,920
He even said she was my wife.

555
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,360
That's way too outrageous.

556
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,890
We should handle the kid's affairs privately.

557
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,360
So, I'm very grateful and appreciative.

558
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,120
Of course, our industry is very young.

559
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,230
During this trial and error process, we will continue growing.

560
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,960
I hope that CTF becomes better and better.

561
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,760
Thank you.

562
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,360
Thank you! Very nicely said.

563
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,030
Thank you, Solo, for the interview.

564
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,530
And thank you all for coming here. You worked hard.

565
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,560
Thank you for your hard work.

566
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,030
Oh right, Grunt always having stomach issues is a problem.

567
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,640
When there's time, take him to get a comprehensive physical done.

568
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,230
Fine. You look mean on the surface but you do care behind people's backs.

569
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,920
You don't even know how to be a good guy.

570
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,680
- I'll leave you to be the good guy. Isn't that better?
 - Of course.

571
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,480
Oh, also, take charge of these kids' diet.

572
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,860
Grunt is an example. Take good care of their stomachs.

573
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,150
Understood. Anything else?

574
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:33,790
Also, other than Monday to Friday training,

575
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,530
they must rest on the weekends.

576
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,690
Even if they read, play sports outside, go watch a movie, it's all good.

577
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:44,240
Don't always be in anxious mode for the competition. It's not good for them.

578
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,990
They've already become multi-talented through training.

579
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,680
Anything else, mom-of-the-group?

580
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,130
Don't joke around.

581
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,980
- Then, I'm leaving.
 - What's the rush?

582
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,090
I'm in a hurry to see someone.

583
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,050
Who?

584
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,720
The beautiful sister-in-law who fell from the sky.

585
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,110
First, get the kids in the car and send them to the hotel to eat.

586
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:10,370
- The organizing party's Director Xiang is looking for us; you come with me in a few minutes.
 - Yes.
