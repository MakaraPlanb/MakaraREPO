Hey, don't be crazy and fall down!

63
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,700
I'm not a child, don't worry.

64
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,100
I'm not like you, gosh.

65
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,500
Always moody and scowling.

66
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,400
It's so beautiful here; of course, I have to be hype and happy.

67
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,900
Old Han,

68
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,900
how'd you find this place?

69
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,600
When I left Team Solo, I came to Norway to study.

70
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,600
But I was studying very unhappily.

71
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,900
One day, Nan Wei brought me here.

72
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,100
He wanted me to see how big this world was

73
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,600
and not to give up on my dreams so easily.

74
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,400
I know that if you didn't compete, you'd be pained to death.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,500
So I was thinking,

76
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,500
why should I have to stay away from CTF or competitions just because of Solo?

77
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,200
Then, I returned to Norway and established the headquarters for K&K.

78
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,040
Although Solo agreed not to become the captain of any other team,

79
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,300
he started SP.

80
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,400
So what's the meaning of this?

81
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,900
He just wants to give China's CTF a better environment.

82
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,200
The bloodline of China's CTF can't be cut down. Only this way we can get better and better.

83
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Old Han, why can't you just let it go?

84
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,400
But it still shouldn't be him!

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,300
He betrayed us all.

86
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,500
Does that mean he should leave all of CTF?

87
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,400
Little Ai is all grown-up now.

88
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,200
If he wants to come back and give his contribution, what's wrong with that?

89
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,400
He's not worthy!

90
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,500
Okay, you two, stop.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,300
Do you guys know why back then, dead or alive, I wouldn't go back home to farming?

92
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,600
I wanted to stay here and compete at all costs.

93
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,500
It was because I believed that I, Ou Qiang, shouldn't be so ordinary.

94
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,000
There are so many good farmers in the world.

95
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,000
But in this area, I am not inferior to anyone!

96
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,490
Only CTF... could let my life light up!

97
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,300
It could make me feel alive!

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,600
So, even if you, the people that I trust and love, all leave, I will still stay here.

99
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,900
Old Han, I know you hate Solo and are mad at Ai Qing,

100
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,900
but we're just as mad at you!

101
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,200
- Have you ever considered our feelings?
- Stop.

102
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,600

Hey, Manager, I saw how Gun God was so fierce and vicious today.

127
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,300
He's completely different from our boss.

128
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,600
When you were on the same team back then, did you guys argue a lot?

129
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,700
Actually, Han Shangyan is the kind of person who that the more he cares about you, the fiercer he is to you.

130
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,500
But this type of caring, I can't stomach.

131
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,200
Maybe each person's growth environment is different.

132
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,600
When Han Shangyan's mother was giving birth to him, she had major bleeding and passed away.

133
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Not much time later, his father got sick and also passed away.

134
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,800
When he was young, he lived with his stepmother.

135
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,000
This may be why he doesn't know how to express himself.

136
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,840
Is the candy that good?

137
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,630
Every time I see you, you eat a piece.

138
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:57,320
Everyone thinks that I eat candy because I'm angry, but that's not it.

139
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,040
Then, why do you?

140
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,130
It's just because when you eat candy, it's harder to speak.

141
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,230
So if you want to insult someone, you can't.

142
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,430
Also, candy is sweet.

143
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,960
So you think, "Why do my words have to be so sour?"

144
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,760
In return, my mood gets a bit better.

145
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,640
You don't believe me?

146
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,440
If you don't, eat a piece each.

147
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,950
Have a candy in your mouth and try to insult me.

148
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,430
- I'll try.
- You have to eat three.

149
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,990

plus, it's raining. Of course, there'll be traffic.

168
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,650
I see you're so anxious but didn't bring any luggage.

169
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,730
I'm guessing you're going to pick up your boyfriend.

170
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,460
Thinking back to when I secretly came to pick up my wife,

171
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,990
she was so happy that she gave me a big hug.

172
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,390
Being young is so nice.

173
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,890
My boyfriend probably won't be like that.

174
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,430
He's someone who keeps everything in his heart.

175
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,410
He isn't romantic or a sweet talker.

176
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,180
But his love for me is all in his heart.

177
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,050
I can tell from his eyes.

178
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,780
The rain is really heavy today.

179
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,930
Sir, in a safe way, can you go a little faster?

180
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,550
- Okay.
- Thank you.

181
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,590
Wu Bai being your younger cousin, what can you say about him?

182
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,330
The last time China had a world champion in the individual competition was already many years ago.

183
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,890
So this time that Wu Bai represented China and got first place, I'm very happy.

184
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,780
Furthermore, his score this time has ascended even higher

185
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,190
and has solidified his place as the world's number one.

186
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,970
Okay, thank you.

187
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,390
Wu Bai!

188
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,880
- Why're you here?
- Congrats on getting first place!

189
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,520
Thank you.

190
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,430
Where's Han Shangyan?

191
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,350
He got on the bus first.

192
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,590
Then, why are you here?

193
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,360
I don't like being surrounded by reporters so I came out later.

194
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,700
So, I can't see him today?

195
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,040
Do you want to see him?

196
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,520
Yes.

197
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,470
I want to see him.

198
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,090
Then, come with me.

199
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,820
Thanks.

200
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,830
Thank you, what you said was awesome.

201
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,190
Gun God, can I take a picture of you?

202
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,900
That isn't necessary.

203
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,070
Okay, I understand that you never allow pictures.

204
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,340
Then I'll leave first and show you the draft once it's complete.

205
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,750
All right.

206
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,630
Your girlfriend is here.

207
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,500
Boss, Sister-in-Law is here.

208
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,490
Sister-in-Law.

209
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,510
<i>[Welcome to Han Shangyan bringing his team home!]</i>

210
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,470
A green hat, what kind of taste do you have?
<i>(T/N "green hat" also means "cuckold")</i>

211
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,240
It matches my scarf and dress.

212
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,260
Do you need me for something?

213
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,370
I'm here to pick you up from the airport.

214
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,390
Get on. If you wait for him to call you up, you'll freeze to death.

215
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,610
Get on.

216
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,060
Aren't you cold?

217
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,590
No.

218
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,700
I've got a coat to cover me and this scarf. They all block the wind.

219
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,220
Don't dress like that in the future, you'll catch a cold.

220
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,220
You don't like me dressing this way?

221
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,310
Well, no. Dress however you like.

222
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,260
Then whatever way you'd like for me to dress next time, just tell me.

223
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,780
I'll dress that way for you.

224
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,450
"Then whatever way you'd like for me to dress next time, just tell me. I'll dress that way for you, okay?"

225
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,030
"Okay."

226
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,940
Do you know that such words can easily be misunderstood?

227
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,030
Misunderstand what?

228
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,790
You don't understand?

229
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,070
Don't discuss these problems with other people, especially men.

230
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,620
Understood?

231
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,860
It's better if I go sit in the back.

232
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,090
Little Ai.

233
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,430
Little Ai, why aren't you greeting her?

234
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,110
It's fine.

235
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,380
Hello, what would you like to order?

236
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,800
Thank you.

237
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,490
One glass of juice.

238
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,940
One Americano with no cream. Thanks.

239
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,740
Okay.

240
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,050
I'd also like an Americano without cream.

241
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,930
Okay, please wait.

242
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,460
Congrats to you guys, for first place in the individual competition.

243
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,160
Thank you.

244
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,440
Little Ai, your dad sends your pictures to me every year.

245
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,030
Next time, don't do it.

246
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,310
Talk nicely.

247
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,620
I have the right to show my pictures or not show them to anyone.

248
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,960
But you don't have the right not to show your mom, do you?

249
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,490
Excuse me.

250
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,820
Thank you.

251
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,580
You're welcome.

252
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,990
Where are you going?

253
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,430
I want this.

254
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,800
This. This too.

255
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,140
I want to take her to another doctor.

256
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,540
See if there are other ways to improve her hearing.

257
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,740
Why'd you order four cakes? Can you finish them?

258
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,640
I like them.

259
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,890
Don't worry! Order what you want, I'll pay.

260
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,960
My dad is the boss of SP in China.

261
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,350
Do you still think he's the poor guy without a background, education, or money from back then?

262
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,820
My dad can pay!

263
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,790
I know, because I've seen him working his hardest.

264
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,340
Little Ai, these next few days I have team training.

265
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,320
Stay with your mom for a few days, okay?

266
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,490
I'm talking to you. Put this on.

267
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,690
Little Ai!

268
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,310
Don't be like this.

269
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,000
Can't you see she's already very unhappy?

270
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,590
It's okay.

271
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,730
Wu Bai, right now Team One's average still isn't high enough.

272
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,630
Do you want to consider bringing in new people?

273
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,450
I'm looking into it, too.

274
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,800
K&K China's priority right now is on CTF.

275
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,290
If you have anything you need, tell me at any time.

276
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,610
Okay.

277
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,140
Rest for a bit.

278
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,300
<i>In a very cool bus, I've also become cool.</i>

279
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,200
<i>[Predestined Tonight Cafe]</i>

280
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,420
<i>He didn't say if I could go in.</i>

281
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,550
Captain, you're back.

282
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,330
Why didn't Boss come back with you?

283
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,990
He's busy.

284
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,890
Busy? What is he doing?

285
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,860
Look.

286
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,780
Follow closely.

287
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,430
Don't look around everywhere, look where you're going.

288
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,490
- Let's go, go.
- Boss, you can chat first!

289
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,030
- I'll bring your things upstairs for you.
- Bye, Boss!

290
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,460
<i>This is my first time coming to K&K.</i>

291
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,180
<i>[If not now, when?]</i>

292
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,890
- Have some juice.
- Thanks.

293
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,690
Wait for me here, I'm going to make a call.

294
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,220
Okay.

295
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,440
Sister-in-Law, nice pose.

296
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,860
- Sister-in-Law, don't be shy.
- We normally also slide down like that.

297
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,630
Hi. I'm kind of embarrassed.

298
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,060
Okay, she's embarrassed. Let's go back.

299
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,310
I know.

300
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:49,180
<i>Should I... take some pictures?</i>

301
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,610
<i>It's fine, right?</i>

302
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,150
- <i>I won't be discovered anyway.</i>
- Sure, okay.

303
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,910
No problem.

304
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,100
<i>Just one picture for a memory.</i>

305
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,280
<i>Turn around just a bit more.</i>

306
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,820
Sure.

307
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,220
<i>- One more picture.</i>
- Yes.  Pardon?

308
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,580
Okay.

309
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,040
Sure.

310
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,690
Wait.

311
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,700
<i>Delete it.</i>

312
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,190
<i>Obey.</i>

313
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,190
Please go on.

314
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,380
<i>Oh my... he knows this WeChat is mine?</i>

315
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,270
<i>So he received all the ads I sent before?</i>

316
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,980
<i>Oh my, he can guess it's me? I'm so stupid.</i>

317
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,640
Hold on.

318
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,200
Come in.

319
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,970
Oh, okay.

320
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,950
Phone.

321
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,090
- This isn't suitable.
- Hurry.

322
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,510
Your phone.

323
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,180
Oh. Mine. I deleted all your pictures, look.

324
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,420
I really did. There's no more.

325
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,000
WeChat.

326
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,320
<i>I can't take this! Did you meet Gun God or not?</i>

327
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,260
<i>Did he see you and not be able to move?</i>

328
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:34,210
<i>Your body figure's so nice, you must showcase those advantages of yours!</i>

329
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,550
How interesting.

330
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,870
<i>Did the line get disconnected?</i>

331
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:55,040
You are the host. Go get on the conference call first and host the meeting.

332
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,640
I'm hanging up.

333
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,210
Do you bring me up with friends often?

334
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,520
No.

335
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,250
No, no. Never. Please don't misunderstand.

336
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,420
Maybe sometimes. A little bit.

337
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,060
But it's just a tiny bit.

338
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,340
Really? What do you talk about?

339
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,810
They're very curious about you.

340
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:23,500
I will talk a little bit about your previous career, etc.

341
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,820
Just that?

342
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,430
Yes. Just that.

343
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,680
Really?

344
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,590
Yes.

345
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,680
Hello, everyone. This is Gun.

346
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,090
Then, you do your thing.

347
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,910
<i>Hi. Hi, Gun. Long time no see.</i>

348
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,180
<i>How's the weather in Shanghai?</i>

349
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,660
<i>Terrible weather. Heavy rain in Shanghai.</i>

350
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,990
<i>Good, good.</i>

351
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,420
<i>He's really handsome.</i>

352
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,460
<i>RAP became rich overnight.</i>

353
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,810
<i>The top ten global running scores, they own six of them.</i>

354
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,090
Boss brought Sister-in-Law here.

355
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,920
This is the first time an unmarried woman has paid a visit to Team K&K.

356
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,730
Where is she?

357
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,640
In Boss's room?

358
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,100
In the meeting room.

359
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,560
Meeting room?

360
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,530
The Big Devil brought his girlfriend here and still needs to have meetings?

361
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,330
Food's here! Everyone go wash your hands and come eat.

362
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,180
Okay, Auntie Zhao.

363
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,660
Okay, fine. See you.

364
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:44,950
<i> Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The 🍯 Honey Stewed 🐙 Squid Team @ Viki

365
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,390
<i>Anyone there?</i>

366
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,480
<i>Boss, are you done with the meeting?</i>

367
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,680
<i>Tell everyone to come in and bring two boxed lunches, too.</i>

368
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,660
No problem.

369
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,170
What's he calling us for?

370
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,620
To eat... together?

371
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,540
- Boss.
- Boss.

372
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,560
- Boss.
- Sister-in-Law.

373
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,370
- Boss.
- Sister-in-Law.
- Sister-in-Law.

374
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,990
Boss, this is...

375
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,980
Sit down and eat.

376
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,410
- Eating, that's all.
- Okay, eat.

377
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,800
This is Boss's new romantic byplay.

378
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,080
This is the first time Boss brought Sister-in-Law to eat here.

379
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,800
Right, this is our old nest.

380
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,220
Sister-in-Law, how are you feeling?

381
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,070
I'm good.

382
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,530
Hurry and eat. This is my favorite.

383
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,220
If you aren't used to it,

384
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,860
- I have many snacks in my dorm.
- It's enough.

385
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,630
- They always steal mine but I don't give...
- Demo!

386
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,790
I remember last time we tested speed, you were third to last.

387
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,800
Um... Boss. I've practiced this month.

388
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,120
Also, isn't there also second to last and last?

389
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,810
- Why must you target me?
- Demo.

390
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,910
Really?

391
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:36,320
Really, Boss. I used that app to test and got 201.

392
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,030
Amazing, right?

393
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,610
How come I remember DT is 106?

394
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,470
I'm wrong, Boss. I'll keep practicing.

395
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,440
Can I ask a question?

396
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,190
Sister-in-Law is rightfully sister-in-law. Gave us an instant save from predicament.

397
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,910
Ask.

398
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,860
What is the reaction-testing app?

399
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,500
97. Explain.

400
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,430
O-Okay. It is a software that we use to test our reaction time; it's really simple.

401
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,630
You open the software and then when you hear a "ding" in your headset,

402
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,190
you click the mouse in that instant. It is used to measure how fast your reaction time is.

403
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,750
Is 106 in milliseconds?

404
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,850
Yes, you're right. It's in milliseconds.

405
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,220
One second is equivalent to one thousand milliseconds, 201...

406
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,190
201 is not low at all!

407
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,380
- Right?
- Right!

408
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,330
I said that this time I did great!

409
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,920
Then why do you have to listen to sounds? Your reaction training isn't based on listening to sounds.

410
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,510
We just casually play with it from time to time.

411
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,740
I don't know who it was who uploaded it on the website to let us mutually hurt and torment each other...

412
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,110
Wasn't it the Demon King who did it to torture us all?

413
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,250
I have an idea! I think there could be another kind of software,

414
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,510
for instance, training our hands and eyes.

415
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:56,100
The screen could start out as green. And then turn into blue.

416
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,650
When the color changes, use your mouse to click.

417
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,860
Isn't that method more direct?

418
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,410
- This...
- Uh...

419
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,520
It already exists abroad; it's a very small software.

420
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,140
Really?

421
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,600
Then, how come you haven't taken it out to "torment" everybody?

422
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,720
- No, no, no!
- Why would you take it out?

423
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,590
Weren't you just teasing us? Really...

424
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,000
The difficulty level is too low.

425
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,070
I can make an improved version.

426
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,920
Using one color only to test reaction time might not be very ideal.

427
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,930
I think we can use lots of different colors, for example...

428
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,480
Tell me. How will you do it?

429
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,800
Actually, you don't have to just use colors.

430
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,600
There are many styles, as long as you can think of it.

431
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,460
Do you need a leaderboard? The type that can refresh every day? Do you need it?

432
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,700
What for?

433
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,790
It's easily said, but can you do it?

434
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,430
If everyone is interested, I can do it tonight!

435
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,040
- No, no, no!
- Not interested, not interested!

436
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,790
It's too troublesome! There's no need, no need!

437
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,240
Don't be polite! It's fine!

438
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,980
No need, no need. Truly.

439
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,900
This...

440
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,870
- Wow! This...
- What's happening here?

441
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:28,030
- A new romantic byplay.
- Right?

442
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,260
Are you going to eat or not? If you're not eating, then get out and train.

443
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,090
- Eat, eat, eat.
- Eat, eat, eat...

444
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,000
Yes, yes, yes.

445
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,700
Miss, why aren't you eating?

446
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,590
No, no! I've been eating, all this time!

447
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,790
Is it not tasty?

448
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,430
No... I'm just not very hungry. I'm already full.

449
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,440
Not hungry?

450
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,170
Before I came, I ate a lot of slices of cake, so I'm not hungry at all.

451
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,760
Then let's go!

452
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,380
Thank you.

453
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,200
Sir, take her to Jiaodong University.

454
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,720
Once I've finished the software, I will give you a call!

455
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,650
Your WeChat name... when are you going to change it back?

456
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,170
Don't you feel your name is too long?

457
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,420
How did you know that that WeChat was mine?

458
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,300
Intuition.

459
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,120
Sir, you can go. Drive slowly.

460
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,800
Okay!

461
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:16,320
Bye! When I've finished the software, I'll call you!

462
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:20,130
Go back inside! It's too cold!

463
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,630
Nian Nian! Why aren't you sleeping yet? What are you doing?

464
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,230
You sleep first, I am making something that is really fun.

465
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:55,330
Oh. Then, as soon as you're done, take some rest.

466
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,890
Nian Nian, did you not sleep the entire night?

467
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:53,700
Who has the capability to make you slave overnight to create software?

468
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,730
I already finished it.

469
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:01,010
Do you need to nap to make up for your lost sleep?

470
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,430
No need. Thank you!

471
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,210
Then I'm going to get washed up.

472
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,760
Little Ai! Wait for me. Little Ai!

473
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,700
You need to eat breakfast!

474
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,150
Little Ai! Little Ai.

475
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,060
This child... why don't you eat breakfast?

476
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,920
If you come down, then I'll eat.

477
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,000
I am wearing a skirt, I dare not!

478
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,090
- Han Shangyan! Han Shangyan, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

479
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,450
What are you doing? What are you doing?

480
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,170
Han Shangyan!

481
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,370
Eat.

482
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,150
Not eating.

483
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,560
Do whatever you want.

484
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,430
You must be Gun God.

485
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,500
You are Solo's daughter. What are you called? Little Ai?

486
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,050
Aren't you and my dad not on speaking terms? How do you know what I am called?

487
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:10,040
When you were two or three and about this tall, I saw you.

488
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,020
At the time, you still called me "Uncle."

489
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,230
Oh, I was young and inexperienced.

490
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,170
Han Shangyan, what were you doing just now?

491
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,450
I was teasing her.

492
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,740
Little Ai, out of these things, which do you want to eat?

493
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,010
I'll eat the leftovers.

494
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,520
How did Solo teach her? She has such a bad temper.

495
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,620
If you dare to say bad things about my dad, I'll turn against you!

496
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,650
Turn and show me then!

497
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,730
Han Shangyan, you're so great! Arguing with a child.

498
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,650
This kid needs a shakeup.

499
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,130
This is my daughter. Does she need your teaching?

500
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,680
Little Ai, do you want to go to the amusement park to play?

501
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,150
No. I'd gotten bored of it long ago.

502
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,500
I've never been there. Can you go with me?

503
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,290
I'm too lazy to move.

504
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:18,070
I said that Solo's teaching had problems. You should have brought her back long ago and taught her yourself.

505
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,050
There's no problem!

506
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,360
You and your mom might have a bad relationship, but towards an elder, you at least have to have some respect.

507
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,380
Did your dad not teach you this?

508
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,440
Proves that your dad isn't a competent dad.

509
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,930
Where was I not respectful? Where? I'll go then.

510
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,540
You said it! That's settled then.

511
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,170
You have to accompany us, too.

512
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,880
Why? If you can give me a reason to convince me, I'll go.

513
