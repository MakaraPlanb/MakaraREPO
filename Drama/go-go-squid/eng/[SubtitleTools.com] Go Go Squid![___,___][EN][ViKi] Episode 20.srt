If you're feeling upset, you don't have to reply to me.

23
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,530
I just worry about you because suddenly you disappeared just like Han Shangyan.

24
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,870
You don't need to be so nervous, and you don't need to explain yourself.

25

There's nothing I can't tell you.

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,380
I didn't become successful like Han Shangyan and the others.

27

In these last few years, I've just been at home.

28
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,720
You can continue competing.

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,890
You still have the capability.

I feel like something's wrong.

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,210
I feel the same as Han Shangyan.

32
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,940
I feel that once Team Solo is done, there is no point in staying.

33
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,510
That's exactly what I thought.

34
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,370
It seems you really understand me.

35
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,400
Therefore, you came back this time for Solo. Right?

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,320
I know Solo's been feeling guilty for the last few years.

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,210
Perhaps he'd feel better when I came back.

38
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,690
At the same time, this is for myself.

39
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,480
I wanted to try again.

40
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,460
This is sounding like an interview. Let's talk about something else!

41
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,530
I-I'm still extremely nervous when I talk to you.

42
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,010
Please understand me. It's because I like you too much.

43
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,580
No, no, not that kind of like.

44
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,410
I mean I like you as an adoring fan.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,250
You don't believe me?

46
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,250
Honestly, I never thought I would have fans.

47
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,210
When Han Shangyan told me, I thought you both were trying to play an April Fool's joke on me.

48
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,160
No! I'll show you your fan community.

49
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,320
Your fan community has more than one hundred people.

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,590
You're teasing me.

51
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,590
No! These are all your diehard fans.

52
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,660
Although there aren't as many as Han Shangyan's fans, they're all completely loyal to you.

53

Look. Look.

54
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,600
Look! This fan celebrates your birthday each year by buying a cake and eating it herself.

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,620
It's her way of celebrating it for you. Also, she...

56
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,300
She has written you a thousand letters,

57
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,770
but never sent them to you.

58
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:05,730
And this person, she loves to travel overseas and she brings your photo to every place.

59
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,540
Then, she takes a photo with your photo.

60
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,290
Does that work?

61
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,830
Of course!

66
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,830
When we found out, we all cried! I cried, too.

67
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,940
I cried until my eyes got puffy like a peach seed. It was so ugly.

This is his first time after I met him. I'm not sure about before that.

101
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,300
He's always thinking about others, and never thinks about himself.

102
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,530
Haven't you noticed that in K&K, aside from the members, every other person is elderly?

103
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,890
My guess is that he wants to take care of them.

104
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
- Start eating, babies!
- Time to eat.

To compete and win the world championship, right? I even memorized it.

But it's too long. I have to loop it around my wrist so many times.

134

It's fine to wear it as a bracelet. Just don't lose it.

135
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,520
How much is it? Was it expensive?

136
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,390
I bought it off a street vendor.

137
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,300
I still love it even if it's from a street vendor.

138
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,230
Get going.

139
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,970
Don't forget to hang out with me. Bye!

- Are you happy?

- Love you!
- So annoying.

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,230
That's enough. Why? You want to make a video clip and put it on the website?

150
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,140
That's right! And show everyone what you look like right now!

- Yes.
- How do you feel?

You already have a girlfriend. Can you not learn to speak more like a human?

169
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,610
Don't talk to him anymore. Let's go!

170
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,840
Old Han, we're all in Shanghai. Let's get together often. Call us at any time!

171
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,710
Hurry and go up! Dawdling even when saying goodbye.

172
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,220
We're leaving!

173
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,150
- Work hard!
- Work hard!

174
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,810
- Do well!
- Do well!

175
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,620
- Work hard!
- Work hard!

176
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,740
Charge! Whoever loses has to buy drinks!

177
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,900
Do you have them all?

178
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,830
Let's go hand in the exams.

179
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,290
Not missing any?

180
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,140
Nian Nian! It's Zheng Hui.

181
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,670
Zheng Hui!

182
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,970
Tong Nian, I heard your dad is the People's Hospital's authority on liver tumors. Is that right?

183
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,830
Yeah, what's wrong?

184
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,340
My mom's liver is not good.

185
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,530
She got examined at the hospital back at home, and they said she needs a liver transplant.

186
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,400
- So...
- Liver transplant?! A liver transplant means it is really serious.

187
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,180
I think... don't be anxious.

188
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,480
Don't keep your mom at that hospital anymore. Come to Shanghai.

189
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,730
Get her examined a few more times in case it is not like that.

190
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,850
- I'll send a WeChat message to my dad now.
- Okay!

191
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,550
But he might be in surgery right now, so I don't know if he will see it.

192
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,830
When he sees it, he will definitely reply to me. Don't worry!

193
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,340
Tong Nian, thank you!

194
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,240
Don't thank me. You're too polite.

195
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,770
Really, thank you.

196
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,940
Han family's eldest grandson was spoiled by his stepmother.

197
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,940
When I mention him to Uncle Han, Uncle Han gets so angry.

198
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,730
Do you know why?

199
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,040
To be honest, I don't have much contact with his family.

200
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,320
Originally, I also didn't understand,

201
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,260
but Yuejiao had that blind date with him.

202
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,230
But after I saw that child, I thought that he was a bit weird.

203
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,880
After, I thought I would go and ask around about him.

204
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,330
That's how I found out that when he was young, his mom passed away.

205
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,600
His dad remarried and got him a stepmother.

206
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,770
But not long after, his dad also passed away. Say, how pitiful is that?

207
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,120
The good thing is that his stepmother treated him well. She spoiled him like crazy.

208
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,850
But growing up, this child has been especially rebellious. He does whatever you don't want him to do.

209
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,990
No one could control him.

210
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,120
After graduating from university, he was set on starting a business, saying he wanted to start an internet club.

211
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh right. Ask Nian Nian to find out more information about him on the side.

212
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,590
Let's not rush to make a decision.

213
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,700
There's no need. They broke up already.

214
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,610
That fast?

215
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,440
Right. This matter... Nian Nian was really hurt.

216
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,920
So, in the future, don't ever mention Little Han in front of her.

217
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,420
Okay.

218
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,230
Really.

219
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,220
Say, I really hope that this child wasn't cheating our Nian Nian of her feelings.

220
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,900
Should we go discuss with Grandpa Han?

221
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,470
No need.

222
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,690
Here, Sir!

223
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,220
Sir, don't take her's!

224
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,480
In here I still have twenty-something yuan, it's enough.

225
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,120
- I have a lot in here. Take mine, Sir!
- Okay!

226
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,620
- Take it!
- I'll use yours then!

227
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,920
It's really too bad.

228
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,000
I hope that this matter doesn't affect the friendship between our two families.

229
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,620
To be honest, Old Tong and I don't hope to find someone of a similar background or status.

230
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,990
We just hope to find someone who is good to Nian Nian, and that's enough.

231
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,720
<i>Mom!</i>

232
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,500
- You're back.
- Oh, Aunt.

233
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,490
Zheng Hui, this is my aunt.

234
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,150
Hello, Auntie. Hello, Auntie.

235
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,090
Zheng Hui, you've come? Quickly sit down!

236
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,470
- Where's Dad?
- Your dad is in the study upstairs!

237
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,200
- Then, I'm going to take him up to see Dad and ask about the situation.
- Go on!

238
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,790
Okay, thank you, Auntie. Then, I'll go up first.

239
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,050
- Let's go!
- Okay.

240
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,230
I'm telling you. Although Zheng Hui is from a poor family,

241
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,280
he is so well-mannered and his temperament is good.

242
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,050
The most crucial point is that he is motivated.

243
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,600
Look at how happy you are.

244
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,330
How come it sounds like you're praising your son-in-law?

245
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,080
Where?

246
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,990
You're not admitting it!

247
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,400
Young man, my recommendation...

248
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,380
It's best that you bring your mom to Shanghai and to our hospital to do further examinations.

249
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,990
Also, we are close by so we can take care of each other.

250
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,070
This way, everyone will be more at ease.

251
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,690
Okay?

252
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,620
<i>[Dad, I forgot to tell you. His family is in a difficult spot financially.]</i>

253
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,440
<i>[His only family member is his mom. He even took loans to go to university.]</i>

254
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,990
<i>[Coming to Shanghai for an examination will definitely take more than a day to settle.]</i>

255
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,790
<i>[Staying at a hotel is too expensive.]</i>

256
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:22,620
Young man, if your mom comes to Shanghai, I recommend that she comes directly and lives in our home.

257
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,750
- Uncle, that's not good. It's too much.
- Listen to me, youngster.

258
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,300
You and Nian Nian have been college classmates for so long.

259
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,520
Besides, you guys have competed together before.

260
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,120
Your mother is coming here and is unfamiliar with Shanghai; we should help you.

261
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,660
Classmate love, isn't that right, Nian Nian?

262
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,180
Just listen to my day and let Auntie stay with us.

263
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,040
Besides, when she comes, she won't be here for long.

264
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,420
If she really needs surgery, then she will stay at the hospital.

265
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,170
If she doesn't need it, then treat it as our way to thank you

266
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,840
for helping Nian Nian when you went to compete abroad.

267
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,570
Let your mom come to Shanghai as a vacation.

268
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,750
That's right. When I got sick at the ACM competition <i>(International Collegiate Programming Contest)</i>, you were the one who looked after me.

269
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,170
This time, I get to help you.

270
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,200
Thank you, Uncle! Thank you, Uncle!

271
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,600
No worries. Then this will be the plan.

272
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,300
Okay. Then sorry to bother you!

273
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,190
No worries.

274
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,830
I have no problem with your wife returning earlier than planned.

275
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,790
But you should at least give me half a month to transfer the work.

276
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,560
<i>There's no problem.</i>

277
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,690
<i>This time your stepmother is getting remarried. Do you have plans to bring your girlfriend with you to attend?</i>

278
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,140
I have no time to worry about this.

279
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,800
<i>Bring her quickly! We want to see Sister-in-Law!</i>

280
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,400
You got married earlier, so you want all men in the world to follow your footsteps?

281
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,220
<i>Boss, we want to see her, too!</i>

282
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,310
Exactly! The few of us here have accompanied you to start a business.

283
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,380
Do we not have the right to see your girlfriend for a bit?

284
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,910
We will prepare a big present for Sister-in-Law.

285
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,500
Come on! Do you not want to show us your girlfriend until you're married?

286
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,920
Come on! Show us! Show us!

287
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,800
We just started not long ago. I'm still not used to it yet.

288
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,770
Stop making a fuss! Once it's settled, I'll definitely bring her over.

289
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,260
Okay, you said it. Remember not to switch her out.

290
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,280
- I said it.
- <i>Then, we'll see you when you come back.</i>

291
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,430
<i>- Bye.
- Bye-bye!</i>

292
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,290
Auntie, this way.

293
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,790
Zheng Hui's mom is here!

294
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,620
- You've arrived!
- Hello!

295
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,160
I've really troubled you guys too much with the examinations and living in your house.

296
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,630
Oh, you're being so courteous. Our children are good friends.

297
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,670
Between us adults, we should help each other. It's fine.

298
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,850
Thank you!

299
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,630
Nian Nian, take them to see their room.

300
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,580
- Okay, come this way, Auntie. I can take this.
- No, I can.

301
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,710
Okay. Auntie, this way.

302
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,440
Go slowly!

303
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,590
Slowly, do you need help?

304
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,720
No worries, I got this.

305
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,510
Nian Nian, what does Zheng Hui's Mom think about the room?

306
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,340
Pretty good. She's resting now.

307
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,660
- Zheng Hui, is he good at studying?
- Yes.

308
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,480
Last year, when you both competed internationally,

309
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,650
I thought he was pretty good.

310
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,620
He is good. The teachers like him, too.

311
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,140
Then, how about this? In the future, invite Zheng Hui over to visit more.

312
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,160
That way, he can take care of his mother and you can both study together.

313
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,240
That's not good. He's a guy.

314
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,840
Oh, Nian Nian, this is normal socializing.

315
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,540
I won't be against it.

316
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,430
That's not okay. What if people misunderstand?

317
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,240
You're quite conservative for someone who's so young.

318
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,510
I am a teacher, and I like these types of good students.

319
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,510
Then, do you like Han Shangyan?

320
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,590
Are you guys still in touch?

321
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,300
Look. You guys broke up already. Stop contacting each other.

322
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,450
Also, I don't like him one bit.

323
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,500
Why? Why don't you like him?

324
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,550
Why? He always has that long face, like people owe him money.

325
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,310
He didn't smile at us, either.

326
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,110
Also, I don't think he's very trustworthy.

327
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,750
You've misunderstood him.

328
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,440
He's actually a really good person. Towards his brothers, he is so loyal and sincere.

329
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,260
You're still a child and don't have life experience.

330
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,260
You're looking at issues with too much bias.

331
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,250
For example, the New Year's Eve dinner.

332
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,900
When he admitted that you were his girlfriend, he looked so forced.

333
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,750
Everyone could tell.

334
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,310
The next day when he came to our house for the first time as your boyfriend,

335
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:59,650
he didn't prepare anything and randomly bought some fruit from the corner store.

336
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,670
- Is that called sincere? That's called perfunctory!
- Mom, enough.

337
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,810
Good thing you broke up with him. He wouldn't have passed your father and my–

338
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,240
Enough. I said enough already.

339
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,040
He's almost thirty.

340
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,940
What hasn't he seen?

341
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,070
You're too naive. Don't believe everything he says.

342
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,620
In the future, you'll meet more and better people.

343
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,830
Don't be in a rush, okay?

344
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,060
Think about if what I've said is right. Okay?

345
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,400
Yaya, Han Shangyan is so pitiful.

346
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,970
What? How is he pitiful?

347
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,460
Everyone dislikes him. I feel so sorry for him.

348
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,900
Some people would dislike him?

349
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,680
His grandpa, stepmother, and my parents.

350
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,000
Why?

351
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,260
My mom said a lot of bad things about him.

352
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,400
She doesn't like him.

353
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,730
What did she say?

354
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,100
My mom talked about things related to when he was younger.

355
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:20,200
But... even if that's what he did, somehow it's twisted the way my mom says it.

356
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,000
She says that he's good-for-nothing, says he's full of lies, a man acting too young for his age.

357
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,950
A god has been successfully dragged down the altar by his future mother-in-law.

358
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,020
Don't say that! I'm not joking with you, okay?

359
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,600
I am also serious. In my heart, he is a god.

360
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,470
He has been recorded in the Annals of CTF History.

361
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,270
I must treat him well; treat him better.

362
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,490
I want to buy the whole world for him.

363
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,930
He loves work so much and is a workaholic.

364
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,810
How can I make him happy?

365
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,960
I don't know how I can make him happy.

366
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,200
Let me help you think. I'll help you think.

367
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,220
At most, half a year. Just put in more effort and I'll try to bring you back to Team One.

368
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,500
We can't for this year's national competition.

369
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,350
I know. Everyone speaks with their ranking.

370
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,350
Regarding this decision, I don't have a word of complaint.

371
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,560
Sorry.

372
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,580
What are you sorry for? You've already taken good care of me.

373
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,360
If you keep being biased like this, others are going to lodge a complaint.

374
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,600
I do have a personal stake in you, and I do want to treat you well.

375
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,240
Sorry, I let you down.

376
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,370
Let's talk seriously. When will headquarters change me out?

377
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,870
Next up is the last of the small group competitions.

378
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,300
SP has advanced.

379
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,600
After the next match, you and Team Two's captain will switch.

380
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,290
As long as your scores next year are in the National Top 30 ranking,

381
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,440
I'll move you back to Team One.

382
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,000
Understood.

383
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,620
Can I still fight side by side with Ou Qiang one last time?

384
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,150
Thank you.

385
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,250
Captain, can you hold off on announcing it?

386
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,000
Especially to Ou Qiang. I am afraid it will affect him competing.

387
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,100
Although he's loud and playful on the outside,

388
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,150
his heart's fragile.

389
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,950
Okay.

390
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,700
I will definitely play well in the next match.

391
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,320
- I'm going to a meeting.
- Okay.

392
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,650
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

393
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,230
Let's go.

394
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:05,380
I'm telling you! I found the loopholes, forced an attack, and successively broke the opponent's three nodes!

395
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,900
- Really?
- I'm not just boasting!

396
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,700
At the end, when they saw me, it was like a mouse seeing a cat; head down and running away.

397
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,960
- All right! That's impressive.
- You want to learn it?

398
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,080
- I do!
- Just follow me and I'll teach you!

399
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,540
Is it free?

400
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,700
- Why are you bringing up money...
- All right!

401
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,360
You scared me. What are you doing?

402
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,740
- I was listening to you brag.
- And I thought he was something...

403
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,800
Turns out he was just exaggerating.

404
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,860
What exaggeration? Everything I said is true.

405
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,160
Who is it?

406
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,640
<i>Idol, do you know what Han Shangyan likes?</i>

407
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,930
Idol?

408
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,600
<i>Let me search for you.</i>

409
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,720
- Not letting me see, are you?
- Let me ask you a question.

410
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,180
What does Han Shangyan like?

411
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,000
Old Han?

412
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,910
Old Han likes...

413
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,640
scolding people.

414
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,760
Let me see.

415
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,590
Just one look. One look.

416
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,830
Are we brothers or not?

417
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,260
<i>Thank you, my idol. I'll treat you to a meal.</i>

418
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,130
Who is it? Just tell me. What's wrong with telling me?

419
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,710
No!

420
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,280
No fun.

421
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,530
My favor is not important.

422
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,930
What's important is that you want to take your idol out to dinner, don't you?

423
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,800
Yes.

424
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,520
What's going on here?

425
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,460
Dominated!

426
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,960
One week. Take care of all the dorm rooms, the game rooms,

427
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,290
including the meeting room and the front desk.

428
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,400
Sure, I accept defeat.

429
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,980
Challenging me?

430
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,540
No chance before, still no chance now.

431
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,350
That's what you get for challenging Boss. He showed you.

432
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,600
What's up with him? He keeps making a fool of us.

433
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,970
Is his romance sweet? Or is he being beaten?

434
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,640
Why isn't he making nice with the Little Squid, honestly?

435
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,140
- Boss! Boss!
- Say it.

436
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,090
Someone came to find you at the front desk.

437
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,700
Who is it?

438
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,410
- Sister-in-Law.
- Louder.

439
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,960
Sister-in-Law!

440
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,400
Why don't you just go up?

441
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,690
I was waiting for you. I prepared a present for you.

442
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,500
- What is it?
- Wait! You can't look right now.

443
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,750
I'll let you see it when I go up. Let's go.

444
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,000
Why can't I see what you gave me?

445
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,430
You can't look at it here. I can only tell you when we get up there.

446
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,290
I'm not letting you see it.

447
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,460
I don't know what you like so I chose this for you.

448
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,550
I hope you'll like it.

449
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,150
Wait.

450
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,090
Come out.

451
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,780
Hello, I am a little cat.

452
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,400
I've never raised a cat before.

453
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,020
That pet store owner sent me a long list of things to pay attention to when it comes to pet cats.

454
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,240
I couldn't understand it. I'll forward it to you in a bit.

455
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,710
No need.

456
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,400
I... raised a cat before.

457
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,360
What is it? Are you not happy?

458
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,960
Look at him. He is saying hello to you.

459
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,120
Put it in the box.

460
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,070
Then, you'll have to remember to play with it often.

461
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,170
Why haven't you come to see me lately?

462
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,690
You haven't contacted me either.

463
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,180
Aren't I just afraid that you're busy?

464
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,600
I'll definitely be busier now.

465
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,670
Then, I'll give you this little cat.

466
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,400
You'll have to make frequent reports on its condition.

467
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Are you trying to tie me down with a cat?

468
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,700
Look at you. Why are you making it so complicated?

469
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:39,500
I just wanted the cat to cheer you up. I didn't want you to be bored. Right?

470
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,080
I have a whole house of boys, and you're afraid I'll be bored?

471
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,900
That's different. I gave you this.

472
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,700
What you're doing is adding to my troubles.

473
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,800
What's up with you? Do you not like him?

474
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,950
He's tolerable.

475
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,340
I spent an afternoon choosing him.

476
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,910
It does look like the one I raised before.

477
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,280
Isn't it? Isn't it? I especially asked Mi Shaofei.

478
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,800
Mi Shaofei?

479
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,380
What else did he tell you?

480
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,690
- Anyway, I'm giving him to you. You have to take good care of him, got it?
- Tong Nian...

481
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,570
Tong Nian, that cat of yours...

482
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,530
What are you looking at?

483
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,000
Boss, we did not see anything.

484
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,770
Boss, since Sister-in-Law is here, why don't we go out for dinner?

485
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,190
We haven't eaten together for a long time.

486
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,070
That's all right. I've been dieting lately. Why don't you go?

487
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,690
Are you dumb?

488
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,400
Boss is taking Sister-in-Law to eat a romantic candlelit dinner.

489
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,610
Then... Then, I'll help you close the door.

490
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,790
No need, no need. I'm leaving soon.

491
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,180
Then, we'll not bother you. We're leaving.

492
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,990
We'll leave now.

493
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,160
- Shut the door for a bit.
- Look at you, so awkward.

494
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,270
Oh right. There is a letter in the box.

495
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,560
Remember to open and take a look.

496
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,580
Also, remember to miss me.

497
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,930
Are you still coming back? If not, I'm closing the door.

498
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,870
I'll leave now. Bye-bye.

499
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,280
Hi.

500
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,610
That battle tactic of yours earlier...

501
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,200
Uh, you have to first analyze the attack, you know?

502
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,840
- You have to watch the back door!
- Beef up security!

503
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,250
- That's the battle strategy.
- Right.

504
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,800
That's the battle strategy.

505
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,900
Didn't I tell you?

<i>The past has passed. In the future, they are all here.</i>

508
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,260
<i>I'm here, too. From Tong Nian.</i>

509
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,470
<i> ...I think there is a stray cat. Over there.</i>

510
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,030
<i>You can go and pet him.</i>

511
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,090
<i>Here, here. Let's get up and play for a bit.</i>

512
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,700
<i>The little cat isn't scared of strangers.</i>

513
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,530
<i>Old Han,</i>

514
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,900
<i> I used to think you would like large dogs.</i>

515
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,090
<i>Turns out, you like the type</i>

516
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:24,210
<i>who sticks to you 25 hours a day, who'll cling to you from time to time,</i>

517
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,960
<i>a little creature who will use its little claws to hook on to you. Huh?</i>

518
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,420
- What class are you going to next?
- The Monster's class.

519
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,590
- Wish you luck. Park it over here.
- Okay.

520
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,990
- Thank you for your bike.
- You're welcome.

521
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,400
It's time to change it. I'm going to class now.

522
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,930
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

523
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,530
<i>Oh no. My face looks so bad. How can I see my idol like this?</i>

524
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,260

525
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,080
<i>Why would you suddenly come to look for me?</i>

526
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,040
<i>Wait for a second. Don't run around. Don't go anywhere.</i>

527
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,350
<i>I'll come to find you soon.</i>

528
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,770
<i>This color makes me look more pale.</i>

529
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,320
- Where are you going?
- I'm in a hurry. In a hurry. Bye-bye.

530
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,900
Let me catch my breath.

531
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,950
Take your time. I'll give you three minutes.

532
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,030
Don't need three minutes. Don't need it.

533
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,880
What is it, Idol? Do you not know me anymore? Why that expression?

534
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,340
No, no, no. It just... feels like you look different from last time.

535
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,030
Can't put my finger on it.

536
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,800
I just never thought you would come.

537
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,110
Because someone said she is going to treat me a meal, I came.

538
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,710
Is there something wrong?

539
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,020
Nothing wrong. I just didn't expect it.

540
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,230
Didn't expect what?

541
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:25,900
No, I... Because in my heart you are still the same as pictures.

542
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,160
I'm a living and breathing man. A picture?

543
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,840
No, no I don't mean that. I just meant to say that I still can't treat you like a regular person.

544
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,710
You get it, right?

545
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,830
Shall we go and eat at the canteen?

546
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,920
Just the canteen?

547
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,430
Because I've been away for so long, I'd like to experience college life again.

548
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,980
Then, okay. Let's go.

549
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,360
Let's go!

550
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,830
Here.

551
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,130
It's enough. These are enough. It's fine.

552
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,600
What is it?

553
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,600
These are enough. These are enough for like ten people. Here. Let's eat.

554
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,870
You said that you've never eaten at a cafeteria before, so I wanted you to try all of it.

555
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:37,280
My mom has tugged on my ear since I was little and taught me not to waste food.

556
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,080
So let's finish these.

557
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,700
Let's eat!

558
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,410
It looks like... it is a bit too much.

559
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:52,000
It's fine. If we can't finish, I'll just bring it back to the club.

560
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,410
What do you do in college gym classes?

561
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,460
It's not much different from high school. We all have to go through physical fitness tests.

562
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,120
Once I got into university, I thought that I would never have to do gym again.

563
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,090
I never thought I'd have to do it for the freshman and sophomore years of undergraduate.

564
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,940
- That miserable?
- Yes.

565
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,020
I'm so scared of long-distance running. So scared.

566
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,640
I was first place for long-distance running in high school.

567
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,230
Really? That amazing?

568
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,730
I'm going to put it into the group chat.

569
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,880
What are you doing?

570
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,140
No, I'm just used to it.

571
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,430
In our group, no matter who gets a bit of news about you,

572
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,250
we share it with everybody.

573
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:10,980
Now that you've met me in person, do you feel like your illusion's been destroyed?

574
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,160
Why would it be destroyed?

575
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,630
Then, do you still do long-distance running?

576
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,300
I stopped running a long time ago. It's all in the past.

577
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,050
When I was in school, I always thought I was so good at P.E.

578
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:37,090
Then I won the CTF national championship. I was so cool.

579
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:41,800
But now, it looks like I'm not doing anything with my life.

580
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,140
Right now, you are in SP.

581
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,600
It's the biggest internet club in the nation.

582
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,670
How can you say you aren't doing anything with your life?

586
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,330
I couldn't buy this ticket anywhere! I...

587
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:11,320
Won't you give it to more important people to you?

588
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,410
I don't have anyone else to give it to.

589
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:18,000
You have it. This is special seating; it's got a pretty good view.

590
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,210
Take it as thanks for all these years of your support.

591
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,640
Really?

592
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,040
Then... thank you.

593
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,220
I'll have to frame this ticket and hang it on my wall.

594
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,060
If you frame it, how will you come and watch?

595
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,590
You must come.

596
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:40,180
Yes. I must go, no matter what happens.

599
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:17,060
- Stay a little longer this time; don't rush to go back.
- Sure, sure.

600
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,590
Is Little Han not home?

601
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:23,860
He lives in that club of his all day and doesn't come back.

602
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,650
He's that busy playing with computers?

603
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,410
He wants me to understand it, but how can I?

604
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:34,460
What about Nian Nian? I haven't seen her in a while. Is she going through exams?

605
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,090
Nian Nian is on vacation; there are no more exams.

606
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,230
It's like this?

607
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,820
These past few days, one of her classmate's mom became sick.

608
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,500
My brother has been treating her.

609
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,770
My sister-in-law said they came from another province.

610
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,960
They didn't want them to spend money at the guest lodgings, so they invited them to stay at home.

611
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,620
My sister-in-law has such a kind heart.

612
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:55,290
You're all very warm and kind-hearted.

613
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,860
Let me tell you. I've seen Nian Nian's boy classmate.

614
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,360
He's a good person and very hard-working. I've heard he's pursuing his doctorate.

615
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,560
My brother and my sister-in-law like him very much.

616
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,190
They say that his future is bright.

617
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:12,720
They have high hopes for his future.
