Don't be too mean to her!

Have I led my team for so many years for nothing?

Go quickly.

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't lie to me!

28

What is the worth in me lying to a little brat?

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,800
So mean.

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,400
I don't even know what Sister Tong Nian likes about you.

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,500
If it were me, I wouldn't want you even for free.

32
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,200
You talk big.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
Tell me.

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
What do you want to know?

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
How did my mom and dad meet?

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,100
Dreams.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,500
Your mom used to play professionally, too.

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,900
Before I came back to China, the two already knew each other.

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,500
Even earlier than when Ai Qing and my dad met?

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,500
Your dad, mom, and me; the three of us met the earliest.

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,800
Before I officially came back to China, I flew back twice.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,500
At the time, the two still hadn't broken up yet.

43
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,800
Then... why did they break up?

44
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,990
There are so many reasons for a boyfriend and girlfriend breaking up, how would I know?

45
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,000
Aren't you clear on everything?

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,700
Maybe they didn't get along well with each other.

47
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,100
Just contradictions between any ordinary boyfriend and girlfriend, it's nothing complicated.

48
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,800
- Why aren't you asking anymore?
- Let me think.

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,900
My dad... did he not want me?

50
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,600
My dad did not want me, but my mom insisted on having me?

51
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,900
Tell me!

52
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,760

<i>Sorry, we won against you today.</i>

62
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,000
<i>You're wrong, it's not that I'm not convinced of your win.</i>

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
<i>It's the opposite, I am utterly convinced.</i>

64
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,050
<i>But why did you keep yielding to me?</i>

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,400
<i>I...</i>

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,430
<i>Just now, there were a few times we were directly against each other.</i>

67
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,000
<i>The third round you attacked my node. The sixth round you infiltrated. The tenth round you found my vulnerabilities.</i>

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
<i>You had a few chances to win for sure.</i>

69
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,600
<i>Why did you let me go?</i>

70
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
<i>You memorize the competition process so thoroughly.</i>

71
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,000
<i>Yes. I just felt that... I won many games against you guys already.</i>

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
<i>Then, the last few games I felt we shouldn't be too serious.</i>

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,300
<i>You know? Compared to losing to you, that makes me feel more embarrassed.</i>

74
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,900
<i>Don't cry! It's just one competition!</i>

75
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,280
<i>The next one, you guys can definitely win!</i>

76
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,600
<i>I don't want to have such a weak performance in front of you!</i>

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,500
<i>I don't want to make you disappointed in me! I am not the same as other people!</i>

78
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,300

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
<i>Sit wherever you want.</i>

86
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,710
<i>You probably know that he has a girlfriend now, right?</i>

87
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,100
<i>I know.</i>

88
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,700
<i>Then you should also know who his girlfriend is, right?</i>

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,480

98

<i>Can you tell me why?</i>

102
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,120
<i>She is sick.</i>

103
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,500
<i>She needs treatment.</i>

104
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,900
<i>I can't even support myself...</i>

105
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,000
<i>I really am not doing this just to rely on you.</i>

106
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,400

122
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,800

123
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,200
<i>This child wasn't in my plans.</i>

124
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,500
<i>And even more so, not in your plans.</i>

125
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,600

126
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,600
<i>Do you know?</i>

127
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,100
<i>When I found out I was pregnant, I was already three months in.</i>

128
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,300
<i>What do you think I could have done?</i>

129
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,700
<i>Your results were getting better and better.</i>

130
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,000

<i>Who is the kid... outside?</i>

138
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,580
<i>Ai Qing, I did not do anything that I am sorry for.</i>

139
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,800
<i>Su Cheng and I broke up two years ago.</i>

140
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,480
<i>At that time, I didn’t know you yet.</i>

141
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,350

<i>- Tell me. Who is this kid?
- Mommy, Mommy. </i>

144
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,030
<i>Ai Qing, we haven’t—</i>

145
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,130
<i> Stop talking nonsense!</i>

146
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,980
<i>What if it’s fake? You can’t believe whatever she says.</i>

147
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,410
<i>Ai Qing, you need to give Solo a bit more time. Okay? What if it’s really not real?</i>

148
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,780
<i>Have you tested the DNA?</i>

149
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,450
<i>No need.</i>

150
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,940
<i>Mommy, Mommy.</i>

151
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,470
<i>She is my daughter.</i>

152
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,520
<i>She is mine; Solo’s daughter.</i>

153
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,390
<i>- Mommy!
- Move!</i>

154
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,410
<i>- Ai Qing!
- Ai Qing!
- Mommy!</i>

155
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,470
<i>Mommy!</i>

156
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,480
My dad wanted me so he gave up his team?

157
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,710
Yes.

158
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,300
So you hate my dad?

159
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,410
Yes.

160
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,010
<i>I will go tell Ai Qing that the kid is mine.</i>

161
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,430
<i>Say you took the blame for me and I'll raise the kid for you.</i>

162
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,800
<i> Then you go look for Ai Qing. You cannot let her have an emotional breakdown. </i>

163
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,450
<i>We still have to compete at the national finals.</i>

164
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,150
<i>How are you going to raise her?</i>

165
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,220
<i>Also, what do you think I am?</i>

166
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,540
<i>What do I think you are?</i>

167
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,050
<i>What do you think I see you as?</i>

168
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,820
<i>Our hardships for all these years, was it for nothing?</i>

169
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,690
<i>Just one more step.</i>

171
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,130
<i>I know.</i>

172
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,660
<i>Solo, you are not my only bro.</i>

173
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,080
<i>I still have Ai Qing, Little Mi, Ou Qiang, and all the substitute players, too!</i>

174
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,310
<i>Team Solo is more than just you!</i>

175
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,090
<i>I didn't expect this either.</i>

176
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,410
<i>Why would this sort of thing happen to me?</i>

177
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,050
<i>Also,</i>

178
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,360
<i>the child is innocent.</i>

179
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,270
<i>This is not the time for you to feel guilty!</i>

180
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,300
<i>If you and Ai Qing are over, it is over for all of us!</i>

181
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
<i>So many years of hardships,</i>

182
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,360
<i> we've suffered so much. </i>

183
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,880
<i>We can't just let it end like this!</i>

184
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,630
♫ <i>Nothing to hide, not be afraid</i> ♫

185
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,390
<i>Wang Hao!</i>

186
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,160
<i>Are you willing to give up?</i>

187
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,000
<i> This team that we created with our own hands. </i>

188
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,530
<i>At the time for money, how many bosses did you look for and how many times did they close the door on you? Do you remember?</i>

189
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,830
<i> You were the one who found every single supporter, one by one. </i>

190
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,770
<i>It is because of you that everyone came into this circle!</i>

191
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,710
<i>Let me think.</i>

192
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,350
<i>What is there to think about? Do as I say!</i>

193
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,230

194
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,640
<i>Let me think!</i>

♫ <i>So many times I wish I could leave</i> ♫

197
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,200
My dad. He is a good dad.

198
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,130
But he isn't a good team captain.

199
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,150
But he has been trying to make up for it all this time!

200
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:01,220
Uncle Mi Shaofei and Ou Qiang, my dad fought hard to get both of them back.

201
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,310
Do you understand what the "golden age" is?

202
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:08,740
A professional player; the few years when he or she is in the best condition. All wasted.

203
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,210
It must be an inner struggle for you.

204
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:20,340
♫ <i>You’re walking away, begging to me</i> ♫

205
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,320
Tong Nian, where are Han Shangyan and Little Ai?

206
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,040
Over there.

207
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,330
Okay.

208
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,630
When I think about it from your point of view, my dad... really did let his bros down.

209
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,870
But why don't you put yourself in my shoes and think about it?

210
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,160
How pitiful I was! That time I was still so young.

211
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,660
And I have a disability, too!

212
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,270
My dad couldn't have thrown me aside and not take care of me.

213
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,770
Luckily...

214
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,340
Luckily, my dad didn't throw me aside to be your daughter.

215
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,020
If you were my dad, in one day, I would have fought you ten times.

216
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,840
Do you think that I think highly of you?

217
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,140
What a joke!

219
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,390
Little Ai.

220
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,790
Her luggage is still in Tong Nian's room. After you are done talking, we can go get it.

221
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,430
Can I talk to you?

222
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,660
The first time that your attention is not on me.

223
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,090
I... I am paying attention to them!

224
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,460
Say, how do you think their chat will go?

225
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,730
What will result from it?

226
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,580
What result do you want?

227
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,170
Did Uncle Han give you this new hearing aid?

228
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,390
What does he understand? He wanted to buy one for me.

229
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:45,710
But he doesn't understand it. He thinks it is like a headset, that you can just pay and get.

230
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,530
This is the one I secretly hid. A spare one.

231
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,990
You're like your dad. Very attentive and a careful thinker.

232
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,210
You're mad that he didn't pay attention to you. I've been mad about that before, too.

233
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,830
At the time, did you love my dad?

234
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,720
Did you love him?

235
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,720
He was my first love.

236
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,660
Then... what about my dad?

237
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,730
Were you his first love, too?

238
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,150
I never asked him that. I probably was.

239
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,720
You...

240
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,410
Ask me! Whatever you want to ask, you can ask me today.

241
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,620
I only took care of you for a very short time, and I didn't have any other kids.

242
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,270
I actually don't have much experience being a mother.

243
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,870
Why don't we treat each other as friends, okay?

244
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,840
Why did you give birth to me?

245
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,640
You don't love my dad, you don't love me. Why did you give birth to me?

246
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,490
I do love you guys.

247
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,170
Little Ai, I used to love him very much,

248
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,390
and that is why I gave birth to you. It's a way to remember.

249
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,420
So you treat me like a memento?

250
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,120
I'm sorry.

251
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,120
Back then, I thought of everything too simply.

252
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,270
I thought that I could raise you well by myself.

253
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,080
But later you didn't expect that I was going to be so troublesome and not a healthy child so you didn't want to raise me anymore. Right?

254
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,010
No.

255
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,930
At the time, my team was competing very poorly.

256
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,900
But I wanted to give you a good life.

257
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,610
I thought that you would be happier being with him than with me.

258
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,790
But that way you destroyed him and his career at the time!

259
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,800
Yes. In this matter, I was very selfish.

260
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,800
Or you could say, I never expected that I would bring harm to everyone.

261
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,420
And even more so, I didn't expect that Team Solo would disband.

262
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,090
And then you went and found someone else?

263
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,250
My husband right now was my former team's captain.

264
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,620
I knew him before I even knew your father.

265
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,140
He always had me in his heart.

266
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,650
And it was him that helped me.

267
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,470
He accompanied me when I was alone.

268
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,520
Why did you guys break up back then?

269
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,120
At the time, your dad's team had just started.

270
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:57,040
Every day, he was just thinking about how to get better results with his team.

271
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,380
I really admired him.

272
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,640
But I was also mad at him.

273
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,470
I didn't even get to ask him for a small amount of time to hold my hand and walk with me.

274
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,700
So we were always arguing. Always arguing.

275
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,780
It's all my fault.

276
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,940
At the time, I was too young.

277
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,230
Even though his work was really important,

278
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,960
I needed someone to be there for me, too.

279
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,240
<i>- Are you cold?
- I'm not cold!</i>

280
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,760
<i>Look!</i>

281
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,810
<i>Why do you look so good right now?</i>

282
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,970
To be honest, I know that although Little Ai is saying things like this,

283
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,400
her feelings towards Solo are very deep.

284
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,630
At the same time, I am sure Solo feels the same.

285
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,090
His feelings towards her must also be very deep, right?

286
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,730
Go ask her. How would I know?

287
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,800
Do you not know how to speak nicely?

288
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,700
You're clearly hungry, but still helping Solo persuade his daughter.

289
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,080
But your face says, "Whatever. It's none of my business."

290
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,280
Actually, you'd already forgiven Solo long ago, haven't you?

291
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,380
Only you have the most to say.

292
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,350
Is this how you reward one with merit?

293
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,290
Then, how do you want to be rewarded?

294
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,630
I'll drop you guys off here.

295
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,390
Do you know why he will only bring us up until here and not any further?

296
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,560
This is Team Solo's old dormitory

297
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,760
and its training base.

298
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,740
Take advantage of his mood swings and dejection,

299
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,840
and decisively capture his fragile little heart!

300
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,910
I'll send her off. You guys don't need to go up.

301
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,430
I didn't intend to go up anyway.

302
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,920
Slowly!

303
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:47,720
My dad already has a daughter this old, and you still have nobody that wants you. Have you no shame?

304
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,870
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

305
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,390
Bye-bye!

I won't be going in, okay?

308
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,950
Thank you for respecting me.

309

Don't just bypass me and talk to Dad.

My dad... he's very pitiful.

I know.

315
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,630
Go in quickly.

Okay. Go in!

317
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,090
Little Ai!

318
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,060
Dad.

319
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,510
It is raining so hard outside, why didn't you use an umbrella?

320
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:43,390
Your hair is wet! Sit down.

321
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,790
I haven't paid attention to you for a month. Your hair has already grown this long.

322
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,470
How come you're eating nonnutritious boxed meals again?

323
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,690
They already said in the news, there is a lot of oil and it's not healthy.

324
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,030
From now on, you should eat less of these boxed meals.

325
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,320
I didn't want to cook for just myself.

326
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,940
Then, I'll eat together with you. Go cook for me!

327
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,740
Treat it as an apology.

328
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,160
Okay! I'll dry your hair and then I'll go cook for you.

329
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,950
Tell me. What do you want to eat later?

330
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,600
Tomato and egg stir-fry!

331
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,590
I can do that!

332
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,220
Sweet and sour spare ribs!

333
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,180
Okay.

334
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,170
And... braised pork!

335
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,400
You don't know how to make it?

336
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,230
I can! Whatever you want to eat, I will make it for you.

337
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,080
Dad, you are drying it so slow!

338
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,350
You should dry it like this!

339
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,390
It's faster this way!

340
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,780
I won't get in the car. I want to walk by myself for a while.

341
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,760
It is raining so hard outside, are you sure you're okay by yourself?

342
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,580
We aren't going in the same direction. It's okay.

343
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,010
Then, you be careful!

344
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,490
Little Ai sent me a WeChat message.

345
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,070
She said Solo caught a cold.

346
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,740
It is because Little Ai wasn't there that Solo got sick.

347
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,990
Before, it was all factory buildings over here.

348
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,550
I didn't expect that it would have become an industrial park.

349
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,830
Back then, the roads were terrible. Once it rained, the whole road would be covered with mud.

350
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:13,820
At the time, Solo would piggyback Ai Qing home every time, so that her shoes wouldn't get dirty.

351
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:19,230
It was also hard for Ai Qing to find a person like that. She suffered a lot in her earlier years.

352
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,950
I really don't know what she saw in Solo.

353
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,630
How did they meet?

354
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:31,020
Ai Qing was at an internet cafe and fell in love with Solo at first sight.

355
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,130
Just like me.

356
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,900
How is it the same?

357
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,830
At the time, Solo and Su Cheng had broken up for only about half a year.

358
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,270
He was still hurt from love. I wasn't!

359
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,690
<i>[Fluidixine]
(penicillin antibiotic)</i>

360
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,600
Dad, stop what you're doing and come here first.

361
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,740
Dad, drink up the cold medicine first.

362
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,350
You know how to take care of me now.

363
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,810
Little Ai,

364
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,390
I was wrong.

365
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,870
You're not allowed to say that you're wrong.

366
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,640
Even if the whole world is wrong,

367
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,830
my dad isn't wrong.

368
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,350
It's all my fault.

369
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,760
If you didn't have me, you would've won the world championship long ago.

370
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,200
Dad, in my heart, you are China's greatest team captain.

371
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,660
I know.

372
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,920
Thank you.

373
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,390
I'll go and cook for you.

374
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,190
<i>Time is really cruel.</i>

375
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:06,220
<i>If everyone knew the outcome would be like this. Then, they probably would have made different choices back then.</i>

376
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Oh yeah, who brought you back?

377
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,190
Uncle Han.

378
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,560
Thank you for bringing Little Ai home.

379
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,340
Why don't you come in and sit for a while?

380
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,330
Su Cheng is about to go back to Norway.

381
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,930
There are still a ton of matters at the club. Forget it.

382
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,770
Then, when you have the chance. It's raining a lot, so be careful on the road.

383
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,100
Hi.

384
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,200
Thank you.

385
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,800
Sorry to call you out so suddenly.

386
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,500
No problem.

387
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,400
Your water. Please take a look at the menu.

388
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,900
- I'll have a juice.
- Okay.

389
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,800
- An Americano, thank you.
- All right.

390
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,610
So, is there a reason why you called me today?

391
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:44,490
Actually, I've always owed you an apology.

392
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,530
Are you talking about the past?

393
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,000
I think you've misunderstood.

394
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,300
Because that matter in my mind has already passed long ago.

395
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,800
Do you think I'm like Han Shangyan who loves to keep grudges?

396
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,200
At the time, I was really helpless.

397
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,000
As if I fell into the water and struggled to look for something to hold onto.

398
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,300
So naturally, I thought of Little Ai's father first.

399
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,100
To be honest, I actually don't blame you for bringing Little Ai there at all.

400
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,700
Instead, I blame Solo.

401
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,900
I blame him for taking in Little Ai without talking with me.

402
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,600
At that time, it caused me to be unable to continue with the team after that.

403
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,400
Including him secretly deciding to leave the team and causing the entire team to disband.

404
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,600
I was also the last person to find out.

405
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,850
So,

406
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:43,200
every team member in Team Solo was more important than his girlfriend.

407
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,300
So when Solo agreed to take in Little Ai, I was very relieved.

408
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,800
It meant he would do his best to take care of her.

409
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,970
Only, it was hard on you.

410
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,700
Actually, it was harder on Solo.

411
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,000
He was a man who didn't know how to take care of a child.

412
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,300
Every day, he would look at books and learn a little at a time.

413
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,930
<i>Dad is going to let you try the tomato and egg stir-fry I especially made for you!</i>

414
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,100
<i>Do you want to drink some water before you eat?</i>

415
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,200
<i>- Yes.
- Yes? Okay.</i>

416
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,800
<i>Coming! Have some water.</i>

417
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
<i>Solo.</i>

418
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,590
<i>It's already been three years.</i>

419
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,000
<i>Are you still planning to come out of retirement?</i>

420
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,100
<i>Dad will feed you.</i>

421
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,300
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

422
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,200
<i>Stay for a bit longer.</i>

423
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,000
<i>Once I'm done feeding her, we can talk.</i>

424
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,400
<i>I'm going.</i>

425
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,700
So I quickly got over my anger at him.

426
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,800
But this is all in the past. Since it's past, let it stay in the past.

427
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,400
I think the reason you called me out today wasn't to talk about the past, right?

428
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,200
- Your coffee.
- Thank you.

429
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,300
Your juice. Enjoy.

430
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,400
This is where I'm conflicted.

431
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,400
I want to ask you. If I bring Little Ai to Norway for ear treatment

432
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,520
and also for her education,

433
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,200
do you think Solo will be very sad?

434
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,400
Although he openly expresses his consent,

435
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm still really worried.

436
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,500
I understand now.

437
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,500
My advice is to ask for Little Ai's opinion yourself.

438
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,400
Besides, she is twelve years old already.

439
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,320
If you want to know from my perspective,

440
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,600
who she feels more emotionally tied to, you can think about it.

441
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,200
You took care of her for two years.

442
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,400
Solo took care of her for ten whole years and grew up with her during her childhood.

443
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,500
If it were you, who do you think you'd be closer to?

444
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,610
I'll go in to get something and then take you home.

445
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,500
What is it?

446
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,500
Do you want to go in?

447
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,110
I... won't go in.

448
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,400
If I go in, Grandpa will get the wrong idea again.

449
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,100
What wrong idea?

450
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,000
You know yet you are still asking me.

451
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,400
We can't keep pretending, especially since he's your grandpa.

452
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,280
If you don't want to lie, then don't.

453
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,600
You know, just now when I saw you two coming back alone, I was so happy.

454
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,400
Grandpa, I'm happy to see you, too.

455
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
- Really?
- Really.

456
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,100
Drink some juice.

457
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,800
Hey, hey, hey!

458
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Don't let her drink juice here. Take her upstairs.

459
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,900
Right, right! Take some movies and watch them upstairs.

460
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,600
Can't we watch them here?

461
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,400
I'm here watching my shows. You watch your shows up there.

462
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,900
Okay? Go up.

463
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay.

464
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,600
Then, Grandpa, we'll go up.

465
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Oh right, right!

466
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,800
The cat has already been taken to the club. Why do we still have so much cat food lying around?

467
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,600
- Hurry and take it over to the club!
- Okay.

468
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,200
<i>So the cat's still here.</i>

469
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,000
Grandpa, I'm going up to take a look around!

470
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,200
Watch a few movies! Don't be in a hurry to come down!

471
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,200
So you didn't give the cat away.

472
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,100
Why did all the cat food fall? Let me clean it up for you.

473
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,700
Don't worry about it, I can do it.

474
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,200
Do you have a cleaning towel or something?

475
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,470
In the bathroom.

476
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,600
<i>So this is what a man's bathroom looks like.</i>

477
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,800
Let's do it together.

478
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,000
<i>At his house doing chores, I'm so happy.</i>

479
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,700
You didn't tell me earlier.

480
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,600
Tell you what?

481
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,400
You didn't give the cat away. Why did you lie to me?

482
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,400
<i>How's the cat I gave you? Is it behaving?</i>

483
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
<i>It almost bit me.</i>

484
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,900
<i>If it bites me, I have to get a shot. Isn't that a bother to me?</i>

485
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,200
<i>Sorry. How about... you give it to me, I'll take care of it.</i>

486
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,400
<i>I gave it away.</i>

487
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,800
<i>Who'd you give it to?</i>

488
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,100
<i>My housemaid.</i>

489
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,520
I wasn't in a good mood that day so I casually said it.

490
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,900
Did I offend you?

491
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,000
Or did you encounter something else that day?

492
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,400
<i>This root must be cut off from your side, understood?</i>

493
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,000
<i>Okay.</i>

494
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,200
<i>Can I really trust you?</i>

495
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,100
<i>Am I this untrustworthy in your eyes?</i>

496
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,500
<i>I'll say this again. I promise you.</i>

497
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,200
There are things you don't need to ask in such detail.

498
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,400
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to know.

499
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,700
Then, what about you going overseas for a matchmaking meeting?

500
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:14,100
It's also fake. I returned to Norway for a debriefing meeting at headquarters. Also, to visit my step-mom.

501
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,400
Are you done asking questions?
