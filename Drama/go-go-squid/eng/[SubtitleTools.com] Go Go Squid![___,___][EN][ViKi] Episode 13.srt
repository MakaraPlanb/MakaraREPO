Then... he told us to take Little Squid home.

I guess he... he must be afraid that if he takes her himself, her parents will give him a lecture.

- Wasn't I embarrassing?
- Not at all. You were great.

94

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,830

101
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,610

102
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,080

103
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,660
Here.

104
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,440
- Slowly!
- Slow, slow.

105
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,220
So... since we've met, I'll just ask you directly. Do you have any feelings for our Little Squid?

106
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,840
To tell you the truth, I don't know her well at all. We've just met a few times.

107
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,600
If you ask me whether I like her and I say I do, it would be too hypocritical.

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,930
Liking or not should be said later. Take it slowly. This isn't important.

109
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,820
But this is very important.

110
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,990
All things in time. Sooner or later feelings will come.

111
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,230
That "sooner or later feelings will come," what does it mean? Is it what I imagine?

112
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,730
- Just that he'll take responsibility.
- Really?

113
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,700
Really! My male god said it very clearly. He'll take responsibility until the end.

114
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,800
Little Squid for sure will be so happy.

115
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,420
I’ll hold her.

116
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,390
Let’s add each other’s WeChat.

117
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,600

121

Drive safely, male god!

126
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,660
But that's wrong! Wasn't it he who got Little Squid drunk? How did he turn it on me?

127
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,630
Are you silly? He's just worried. He was exhorting you.

128
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,950
Oh, exhorting me?

129
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,480

132
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,160
We had a gathering and some prankster poured alcohol in Nian Nian's drink.

133
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,650
Auntie, don't worry. She should be fine after some sleep.

Oh, child, how much did you drink? She can't drink alcohol!

136
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,560
- I... I don't know.
- Come inside, quick!

137
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,330
- All right.
- Watch the door.
- Auntie...

138
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,340
- Take it easy.
- What "Auntie"? I'm your mother!

139

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,130
Within three days.

172
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,580
Okay. I'll wait for three days.

173
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,590
<i>Is this real or a dream?</i>

174
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,590
<i>Was he very close to me?</i>

175
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,000
<i>What happened yesterday?</i>

176
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,500
<i>Where's my phone?</i>

177
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,190
"Darling, when you wake up, you must give me a call!!"

178
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,380
Lan Mei!

179
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,770
I knew you would sleep until afternoon.

180
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,730
<i>Let me tell you! My husband was crazy happy yesterday!</i>

181
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,590
<i>He was able to meet his male god and shake hands and take a photo.</i>

182
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,350
<i>He told me to tell you to treat his male god well,</i>

183
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,520
you can't be fickle or cheat on him, you hear?

184
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,920
W-What did I do yesterday?

185
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,050
That's right! We should straighten out our story.

186
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,920
<i>Just say we were drinking together and then you drank too much because of a prank.</i>

187
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,360
<i>So my husband and I brought you home. You hear?</i>

188
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,740
Right. Her Highness Squid, you're too embarrassing.

189
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,070
You only drank one or two and you already got so drunk.

190
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,230
Did you do anything before you got too drunk?

191
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,720
Answer honestly. If you confess, the sentence will be lighter!

192
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,360
I won't talk to you now. I'll hang up first.

193
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,740
Okay.

194
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,360
My god! What on earth did I do yesterday. So embarrassing!

195
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,830
<i>I'm sorry for yesterday. I troubled you again.</i>

196
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,670
<i>[I'm sorry for yesterday. I troubled you again.]</i>

197
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,770
<i>I definitely scared him yesterday.</i>

198
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,120
<i>He hasn't replied. Must be unwilling to forgive me.</i>

199
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,140
<i>I deserve it. How could I let him see such a messy side of me?</i>

200
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,670
<i>This time it's probably the end of all hopes.</i>

201
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,320
Little Bai, help me with something.

202
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,990
The savings on your card...

203
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,520
adding the prize money from Norway last time, how much is it total?

204
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,430
$50,000.

205
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,790
Lend it to me for a year first. I don't have enough.

206
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,910
Is the club's capital turnover so bad?

207
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,930
It's not for the club. It's for me personally.

208
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,530
Did you borrow from loan sharks?

209
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,920
Scram.

210
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,600
It's... Auntie's necklace she had me buy last time,

211
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,390
I accidentally gave it to Tong Nian.

212
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,770
Accidentally gave? Then just ask for it back.

213
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,750
You already gave it away, how could I be so shameless to ask for it back?

214
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,640
Quickly transfer some money to me.

215
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,410
Oh right.

216
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,130
Don't tell anyone about this.

217
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,470
Okay.

218
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,800
<i>Is this for me? So pretty.</i>

219
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,620
<i>Thank you. I like this.</i>

220
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,610
<i>[Little Squid]</i>

221
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,790
<i>[Let's break up. It's fake anyway.]</i>

222
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,990
<i>When are we breaking up?</i>

223
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,360
<i>You can decide.</i>

224
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,390
<i>Whenever you decide to break up, just notify me in advance.</i>

225
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,820
<i>[Have you thought this through?]</i>

226
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,220
<i>[Yes.]</i>

227
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,080
<i>[OK]</i>

228
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:51,050
♫ <i>I carefully covered up that I don’t mind</i> ♫

229
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,480
♫ <i>So that I can be in your world slowly walking closer</i> ♫

230
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,930
<i> [GN: Ok]</i>

231
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:07,560
♫ <i>I attempted to cherish this experience</i> ♫

232
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:16,840
♫ <i>Attempt to use unfamiliarity to explain the distance between us</i> ♫

233
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:26,420
♫ <i>I start to portray an unfamiliar me</i> ♫

234
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:35,090
♫ <i>Fathoming the untrue distance behind the words</i> ♫

235
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,990
♫ <i>I thought I possessed the acting skills to deceive everything</i> ♫

236
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,870
<i>[I've transferred the money. Check your account.]</i>
♫ <i>I thought I possessed the acting skills to deceive everything</i> ♫

237
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:50,310
♫ <i>But no matter how much I practiced, I can't act like myself</i> ♫

238
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,450
♫ <i>The me who doesn't care about you</i> ♫

239
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,150
Tong Nian.

240
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,730
What's wrong?

241
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,940
You cried?

242
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,250
Broke up?

243
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,150
Enough. Come talk with Mom.

244
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,930
Don't feel bad anymore.

245
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,770
What's wrong?

246
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,040
They broke up.

247
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:36,000
It's okay, Nian Nian. Who doesn't break up a few times in their life, right?

248
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,940
Who talks like that?

249
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,440
The road ahead of you is still long. Forget this unhappy love experience.

250
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,000
Just take it as a test.

251
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,750
No, it was my fault.

252
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,020
- Enough, you leave.
- It definitely had nothing to do with her.

253
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,140
- Enough, you.
- It must have been that brat's fault.

254
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,730
Nian Nian, I'm telling you.

255
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:16,630
What girls shouldn't do most is be negative about themselves, understand?

256
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,710
That Little Han wasn't really with you, was he?

257
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,390
Actually, in our eyes, we never took him to be your boyfriend.

258
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,880
That's not it. He's just usually very busy.

259
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,430
All right, stop thinking about him now.

260
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,830
Just pretend you don't know him.

261
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,970
Mom, stop talking about it now, please?

262
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,870
Nian Nian, this is your first time crying for love. Right?

263
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,100
I'm telling you.

264
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:09,860
Before I met your dad, I actually dated a few times.

265
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,450
Each time I broke up, I was like you and bawled my eyes out.

266
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,790
I thought the world was coming to an end.

267
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,160
But, Nian Nian, you have to believe me.

268
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,390
You will find someone who loves you the most.

269
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,110
That person won't let you cry.

270
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,510
And only let you laugh. And will cherish you like we do.

271
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:41,960
Like a pearl, they'll hold you in their hands.

272
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,560
All right, don't cry my baby girl.

273
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:00,600
I will forever be like when you were young.

274
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,990
I'll hold your hand.

275
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:09,420
At your most uncomfortable and painful times,

276
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,400
your parents will forever be by your side.

277
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,970
Got it?

278
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,800
Tong Nian, don't worry.

279
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,380
I already prepared the report that we need for the Public Security Bureau.

280
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,560
I also called a cab already.

281
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,630
Don't worry, everything's fine.

282
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,810
- Nian Nian, where are you going?
- To the restroom.

283
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,560
Oh, I'll go with her.

284
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,570
Okay, I'll wait here.

285
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,960
Where's Nian Nian?

286
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,360
- She hasn't come out.
- Not yet?

287
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,730
I'll go check on her.

288
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,190
Okay, hurry and go.

289
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,690
Nian Nian! Nian Nian?

290
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,560
Why're you taking so long?

291
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,880
How come you didn't lock the door when you were in the restroom?

292
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,320
The lock broke, do you not know how to knock?

293
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,720
Sorry, I'm sorry.

294
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,740
I'm here.

295
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,130
What is it?

296
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,550
You cried?

297
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,400
I'm fine; just kind of sad.

298
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,860
I... I don't want to cry anymore.

299
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,730
I have to be strong.

300
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:44,330
But my mom said if I hold it in, it's bad for myself and for my body.

301
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,820
So, I wanted to cry for a bit.

302
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,180
What're you laughing about? I'm already to this point.

303
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:56,290
No, I haven't seen you cry much so I'm not used to it.

304
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,400
Yaya, I don't expect anything anymore.

305
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,190
I won't see him again.

306
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,530
Won't ever... You broke up?
<i>(T/N: or you fell out of love?)</i>

307
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,860
How'd you fall out of love again?

308
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,780
Don't follow me with this trend!

309
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,180
I just broke up and you follow right after.

310
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,630
Why are you surrounded by jerks in your life?

311
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,800
I finally meet someone who is more unlucky than me.

312
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,440
I spent two years, 24 months, to recognize one jerk.

313
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,120
But look at you, you got two in two months.

314
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,940
He's not a jerk, and there weren't two.

315
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,570
One? The same one?

316
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,100
You have to tell me honestly, who was it?

317
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,650
You don't know him; he's not from our school.

318
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,310
Then, at least tell me about it!

319
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,310
I still want to cry; let me cry a bit more.

320
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,250
That's not it. Nian Nian, we still have to go to the Municipal Public Security Bureau in a bit.

321
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,290
If you look like this from crying, the police officers will think you were mugged. That's not good.

322
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:58,180
How about if you rest a bit and I'll just go with Zheng Hui?

323
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,170
No, I'm this project's leader! I have to go!

324
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,770
Let's go.

325
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,330
<i>[Police]</i>

326
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,590
If you can't then don't force yourself.

327
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,820
My job is my job. It cannot interfere with my job.

328
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,320
Just give me ten more seconds and I'll be fine.

329
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,850
Tong Nian!

330
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,570
Tong Nian, Officer Wang has time now.

331
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,060
Let's...

332
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Go.

333
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,790
Take a look. Actually, our brain is not a camera,

334
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,510
so it can't completely capture a lot of important information.

335
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:55,190
For example, a lot of things that we see, they are not actually in their original form.

336
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,750
The vision, in our mind, goes through disassembly, stimulation,

337
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,010
divergence, and re-convergence: a series of steps.

338
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:07,860
Our naked eye for instance, when looking at the computer or looking at this, there's a margin of error.

339
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,420
Instead, our computer vision actually employs convolutional neural network.

340
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:17,000
Meaning it'll efficiently filters the information and provides it to us.

341
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,890
After hearing your explanation, I now understand this project better.

342
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,340
It's hard to believe that you, at such a young age, was able to lead this complicated project.

343
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,900
The youth deserve to be respected.

344
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,350
No, no. It's not just my work.

345
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:32,950
This is my senior, his name is Zheng Hui. He mainly focuses on medical aspects.

346
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,070
This time, he's joining our team to improve the system with us.

347
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,350
Hello.

348
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,560
Truly young and promising.

349
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,630
Not at all, Officer Wang, you're too kind. This is all Tong Nian's work.

350
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,220
No. No. Group effort.

351
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,720
<i>Officer Wang, then, thank you.</i>

352
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,870
- Yaya, how did I do? Did I mess up?
<i> - This project is very good.</i>

353
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,160
- No, no. You were good.
<i> - Then, if there's any news,</i>

354
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,990
- Really?
- Really.
<i> - I'll contact you again.</i>

355
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,990
- Then, I'm relieved.
<i> - Thank you.</i>

356
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,810
Tong Nian, it was very successful!

357
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:14,920
My emotions are back. I'm leaving first.

358
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,170
Yaya, what's up with Tong Nian?

359
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,200
You won't understand.

360
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,150
I won't?

361
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,390
Are you finally relaxed?

362
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,650
Hurry and eat more; you must be hungry.

363
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm not.

364
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,820
You're not... and scarfing down all the food?

365
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,660
If you didn't mention it, I wouldn't have realized that I ordered this much.

366
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,390
Little Squid, I realized that you have qualities of an Iron Lady.

367
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:00,540
You're so sad but can still make it so far.

368
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,140
Yaya, breaking up is really sad.

369
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,170
No wonder there are so many depressing love songs.

370
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,050
All right, all right. Good girl.

371
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,790
Did you know? There is a physiological cycle to this.

372
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:23,080
When the cells in your body that like him all metabolize, you won't be sad anymore.

373
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,490
You'll have a new life.

374
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,260
Cardiac muscle cells can't be reborn, right?

375
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,700
It's too difficult to comfort a scholar-tyrant.

376
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,150
I'm so sad.

377
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:43,190
Okay, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry. I'm here. Don't be sad.

378
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,480
I'm not sad, I'm not sad, I'm not sad.

379
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,600
- Not sad, not sad.
- But I'm still sad, what do I do?

380
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,530
Don't be sad.

381
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,520
Two more laps and you can rest!

382
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,920
All right.

383
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,550
You didn't press the stopwatch.

384
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,630
What's up with you these days? So ill at ease.

385
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,260
Nothing.

386
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,500
Demo, what're you doing? Hurry and run.

387
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,270
Don't you think Demo has been weird recently?

388
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,910
You're weird, too.

389
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,540

- Thank you, Sister Cheng.

394
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,590
One. Yours.

395
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,410

396
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,700
And yours.

397
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,350
I have one, too?

398
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,520
My daughter, Little Ai, wants you to give it to Tong Nian.

399
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,350
Why should I bring it to her?

400
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,750
If I don't give it to you, then who?

401
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,550
- Everyone, rest a bit and we'll head back to eat.
- Okay.

402
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,440
- Okay.

How did you know?

451
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,540
When you're in a bad mood, you start eating candy.

452
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,080
The whole world knows.

453
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,850
Is it that good?

454
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,320
You aren't afraid of getting diabetes?

455
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,210
If you don't treat diabetes, it will cause many complications.

456
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:23,450
Less serious include blurry vision, headaches, slow healing of wounds, itchy skin.

457
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,130
If it's serious, it can cause cardiovascular diseases,

458
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,250
strokes, chronic kidney disease, and retinopathy. You need to be careful.

459
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,690
Are you done?

460
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,400
I was already feeling bad.

461
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,690
I saw you were crying, so I comforted you and talked a bit.

462
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,430
Now you're being so disrespectful to elders?

463
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,050
I'm just caring about you.

464
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:46,640
Also, I'm already like this and you're scolding me.

465
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,210
It's fine if you don't want to comfort me.

466
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,060
My mother passed away early, not long after I was born.

467
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,910
My father also passed away soon after because of getting sick.

468
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:12,790
I was raised by my stepmother since I was young.

469
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:19,000
If you compare it like this, do you feel better?

470
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,420
I'm asking you. Are you feeling better?

471
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,290
What're you looking at?

472
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,810
Give me one, too.

473
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,140
Didn't you say eating candy leads to diabetes?

474
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,680
I see that when you aren't happy and eat candy, you get happy.

475
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,810
I want to try, too.

476
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:11,400
I want to eat the kind Sister-in-Law likes; the green kind.

477
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,790
You must be dreaming.

478
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,030
No. More. Crying.

479
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,960
You really aren't giving me one? Any color is fine.

480
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,620
Stingy.

481
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,760
When there's time these few days, I will get the kids' publicity photos taken.

482
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,940
There are individual ones and group ones, for publicity use.

483
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:51,600
Also, the sponsors want us and SP to do a set of confrontational publicity photos.

484
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,240
Boring.

485
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,790
Taking them or no?

486
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,510
Whatever you like.

487
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,160
I knew you would decline.

488
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,150
But Director Xiang will likely go find you directly.

489
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,550

- Yes?

491

492
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,740

493
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,300
What's wrong with him?

494
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,010
His parents divorced and none want him.

495
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:25,820
He's like a little kid; being quarrelsome. Don't let it affect the competition.

496
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,430
Okay.
