- Hello.
- Hello.

23
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,300
Excuse me, is the guest of room 1019 still here?

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,380
Hold on a moment.

25
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,000
Apologies but that guest just checked out.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, thanks.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,350
You didn't catch him?

28
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,940
No, he checked out already.

29
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,780
I'll ask Old Xiang for you.

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,720
I'll do it instead.

31
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,340
What time is Buff's train?

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,570
It's at 11, so it won't be leaving soon.

Han Shangyan.

38
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,720
What are you doing yelling and screaming in a public place?

39
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,820
Why did I realize earlier that you would be here?

40
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,980
After all these years, you still like to eat this?

41
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,120
You're lucky that my hearing is good.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,840
What's up? Need something from me?

43
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,370
What are you going to do once you get back? Look for work?

44
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,400
Of course. I have a wife and a son.

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,720
I have to be responsible for the family.

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,530
Eat first. We can chat while eating.

47
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,260
Why are you looking for me, just say it.

48
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,640
Do you still want to compete?

49
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,000
What, you want to sign a contract with me?

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,570
Why else would I be here?

51
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,050
I rush here this early in morning just to rub salt in your wounds?
<i>(TN: idiom: to throw a rock on someone who fell down a well)</i>

52
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,790
Just to kick you one more time before you left?

53
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,910
No no, I didn't think that.

54
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,100
Even though we are competitors, I know you are not that kind of person.

55
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,290
Say it, why do you want to sign me?

56
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,580
Because of your record.

57
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,290
What, not prepared to ask for a price?

58
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,860
Then how much do you think I'm worth?

59
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,860
The captain of a national championship winning team.

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,280
This sounds nice, but has no real value.

61
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,360
Listed #4, this year's rank is pretty good.

62
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,210
But the age is getting up there, maximum two more years before retirement.

63
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,400
Everything you say is correct. You know and you still want to sign me?

64
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,070
How about this. Two years, I'll give you roughly–

65
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,590
Can I join the main team?

66
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,940
I looked for you because I wanted you to join the main team.

67
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,450
But you have to start as an alternate.

68
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,600
There's no way for this national championship since you haven't even worked with the other team members.

69
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,720
Fine, I agree.

70
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,730
Whether you can compete depends on how well you gel with the other members and your personal performance.

71
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:23,800
My plan is for you to join the team after the national championship and fight for the Asia Cup.

72
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,100
Are all these things you say true?

73
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
What else could it be?

74
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,630
But if your performance goes downhill, then I can't help you.

75
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,880
Everything depends on yourself.

76
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,290
Okay, I agree.

77
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,400
Agreeing so easily?

78
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,910
You are not going to set a starting price?

79
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,360
Starting price?

80
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,040
I want to compete, I even dream about it.

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,390
I can satisfy this request. K&K is a constantly running train that won't stop.

82
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,120
You better not be sick then, crying and asking me to let you off.

83
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,950
Oh right. I can promise you that my performance won't get worse.

84
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,850
Promise me that I can get in the main team. This term must be in the contract.

85
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,820
No problem.

86
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,290
You are agreeing so easily...

87
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,980
Wait a second.

88
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,610
I have to think it over.

90
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,730
Oh right. I just thought of another term, I want to discuss it with you.

91
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,630
If I go now, I will likely shake the morale of the team, right?

92
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,900
That's why let's sign the contract first.

93
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,890
As for the Club, don't go there as of yet.

94
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,870
When the national finals end, I will have a meeting with the kids.

95
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,960
Everyone recognizes good results, they shouldn't be affected much.

96
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,530
Okay.

97
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,690
I never thought that after all these twists and turns,

98
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,820
the person who saves me in the end is you.

99
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,400
Don't try to cotton up with me. If it weren't for your good performance, who would care about you.

100
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,440
But for these two months, you must promise me that your condition won't go down.

101
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,980
Or else, I will terminate the contract with you.

102
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,610

<i>(T/N: Don't worry)</i>

103
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,780
I will not let go of this opportunity.

104
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,550
That's all I wanted to hear.

105
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,450
For CTF, you either don't touch it at all,

106
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,810
or if you do, you must get good results.

107
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,310
Or else, let alone letting other people down, you are first letting yourself down.

108
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,670
Right.

109
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,180

110
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,260
Their performances do not meet my expectation.

111
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,000
I understand.

112
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,500
Your champion dream, accomplish it yourself.

113
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,020

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,230
How many of them actually got to accomplish their dream and going back to their hometown in glory?

115
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,040
I think people are alive because of their dreams, sustaining them to go on.

What did he say?

146
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,630
He told me he wants to get married with me.

147
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,320
Get married?!

148
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,390
Get married?! So soon!

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,480
She is at her prime years, why would she be in a rush to do that?

150
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,330
I don't know.

151
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,900
You are getting married?

152
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,710
You are getting married?!

153
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,720
You...You...

154
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,850
You are getting married?!

155
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,230
If we are talking about your age, you should be anxious.

156
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,320
But...

157
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,100
Han Shangyan, it's not that I want to ridicule you.

158
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,070
Other than looking good, you are really not suited to be a husband.

159
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,890
But being able to find someone who sincerely wants to marry. I wish you happiness.

160
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,840
And you're suitable?

161
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,610
Boss, you're getting married?

162
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,060
You've only just kissed, and you're going to get married?

163
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,500
- What kind of tempo is this?
- Honestly, I thought about it.

164
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,800
If we really get married, that's also fine!

165
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,810
You really have blindly fallen in love.

166
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,270
I'm not! Besides, I don't want to break up.

167
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,500
If we don't break up, then at the end doesn't that mean we will get married?

168
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,620
Then I definitely have to warn you. Don't be mad.

169
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,580
Tell me.

170
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,400
In his brain, there is only competing. Aren't you mad?

171
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,100
Yeah!

172
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,010
He's older than you by ten years. You don't want to observe a bit more?

173
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,770
Yeah!

174
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,220
He is infamous for his bad temper, aren't you afraid of getting scolded?

175
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,840
Yeah!

176
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,610
When you get scolded, don't you feel wronged?

177
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,560
Yeah!

178
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,200
I don't feel wronged!

179
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,160
If a man has no career, how are they different from salted fish?

180
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,880
And, although he is older than me,

181
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,860
our communication has no barriers at all.

182
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,820
And you guys don't even know how good his temper is!

183
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,100
He is actually such a great person. He can cook, and he also enjoys working hard.

184
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,070
Actually, you guys misunderstood him before.

185
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,540
Most of the time, his temper was extremely gentle, very gentle.

186
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,260
Especially gentle.

187
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,930
Gen...tle?

188
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,130
Are you sure you're talking about him?

189
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,370
I am sure!

190
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,700
It's over, it's over. I can't talk her out of it.

191
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,260
This person has become drunk on love.

192
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,750
Anyway, he is the best.

193
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,900
What's it got to do with you?

194
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,420
- Don't! Don't, don't!
- Who told you to eavesdrop on others?

195
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,820
- I was wrong, I was wrong.
- That's all you have to say?

196
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,890
- Boss, I swear I will never say anything.
- Control your mouth, you know?

197
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,870
Cutting off, cutting off!

198
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,250
Let's go.

199
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,740
Go back and train!

200
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,010
Strike while the iron is hot! Today, we move.

201
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,890
Tomorrow, we can let Buff move in.

202
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,600
Grunt! Demo!

203
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,400
What?

204
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,900
Exciting news!

205
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,550
What happened?

206
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,530
Boss... is going to get married!

207
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,470
- No way!
- Really?!

208
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,440
Sister-in-Law is powerful, Sister-in-Law is mighty!

209
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,650
No, no! Wait!

210
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,240
Really? The word "marriage" does not match with Boss.

211
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,610
I'm 100% sure. I just overheard at the tea and living room.

212
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,260
Boss said it to our manager! How can it be fake?

213
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,020
- What else did they say?
- I didn't hear all of it.

214
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,070
At the beginning sounds like they said something about wedding dresses, wedding candies, or something like that.

215
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,440
I went closer to listen but Boss found me out, and then I ran over here.

216
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,420
I reckon... they are going to live together!

217
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,880
Wait, wait. Wait!

218
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:48,050
Does this mean that they will sleep on the same bed?

219
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,880
♫<i> I want to climb to the mountain peak with you </i>♫

220
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,910
♫ <i>Watching the most beautiful night sky with you </i>♫

221
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,910
♫ <i>I want to tease you and make you happy</i> ♫

222
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,260
<i>You might not be very clear on this, your mom has some opinions towards me. I haven't thought through how to resolve this yet.</i>

223
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,550
<i>If I go and mention marriage to her right now,</i>

224
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,720
<i>I'm afraid... she will come find me with a kitchen knife in her hands.</i>

225
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,710
<i>W-what's wrong?</i>

226
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,250
<i>- Your dad came out.
- My dad?</i>

227
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,710
<i>Every morning he goes to walk the dog. We can't let him find us! If he finds out, I'm dead!</i>

228
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,070
Nian Nian, what happened to you?

229
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,760
Why are you happy in one moment and sighing in the next?

230
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,020
I am thinking... if he is willing to marry me, then I also want to marry him.

231
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,100
But how do I deal with my dad and mom? Particularly my mom, she especially hates him.

232
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,250
I think you could let him go to your house more often.

233
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,760
Then have him help your mom tidy up or something like that.

234
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,290
How can he go?

235
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,120
My dad and mom still think that we have broken up.

236
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,780
No one told them that we got back together.

237
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,870
Then you should somehow give them a hint.

238
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,130
I don't dare!

239
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,890
I am afraid that after I tell my dad and mom, they will go find Han Shangyan and educate him together.

240
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,720
I don't want to let him be scolded again.

241
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,300
I don't want to let him feel wronged!

242
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,800
I don't want to let him be misunderstood by others again!

243
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,360
Especially my mom.

244
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,910
I don't want to let him know that my mom says so many bad things about him.

245
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,280
I feel... why don't you stop thinking about it for now?

246
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,400
Let's go and help Bro Little Mi clean up first.

247
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,270
You, tidy up a bit!

248
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,700
Come. Come in and look around.

249
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,020
- This place is very nice.
- There are utensils in the kitchen.

250
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,160
- You're here?
- Hello.

251
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,080
I am tidying up the bathroom. Nian Nian went out to go buy some things to eat and drink.

252
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,400
She was afraid your fridge would be empty because you just moved in.

253
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,600
You guys are so thoughtful.

254
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,190
- We already paid for three months rent, so rest assured and live here.
- Okay.

255
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,110
The shower has also been tidied. We've prepared some toiletries for you already too.

256
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,350
- Thank you so much.
- Don't do anymore, I can do it myself!

257
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,340
You put down your things and go rest!

258
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,260
- It's all done!
- This must be your wife?

259
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,900
She's such a good person.

260
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,920
She's not my wife.

261
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,410
- You haven't married yet? Then I can prepare a big red envelope for you! <i>(T/N: Contains money as a gift)</i>
- No, no!

262
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,320
No.

263
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,490
I... I am Han Shangyan's girlfriend's university classmate.

264
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,120
I am her best friend.

265
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,550
What is going on here?

266
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,420
Then... the relationship between you two is also very good.

267
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,330
We... take care of each other.

268
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,000
Take care of each other...

269
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,630
I-I am going to go see Nian Nian.

270
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,620
Why has Tong Nian gone for such a long time and still not come back?

271
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,740
- Go quickly.
- Right?

272
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,370
- She likes you?
- No. Hurry and go look around.

273
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,880
- That's very good!
- Very good.

274
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,850
- Try a bite.
- I won't eat it. You eat it!

275
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,910
Then I'll eat it!

276
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,450
Today is so hot. The sun is so bright. Is it bright?

277
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,370
Let's hurry and move stuff.

278
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,550
What's wrong?

279
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,850
What? You want to dance?

280
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,820
Stand here. Wait in the shade. I can move things.

281
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,810
You are moving stuff by yourself. How can I just stand here?

282
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,260
Eat your ice cream!

283
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,210
You guys are back!

284
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,790
He's moving things alone? You're supervising?

285
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,390
I told you before that he is very gentle.

286
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,740
You see?

287
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,710
I thought someone like Han Shangyan would be wild and hard to tame.

288
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,390
Didn't expect that our Tong Nian is a born animal tamer.

289
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,520
Of course! Go, help me move things.

290
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,360
- Move a lighter one.
- What is this?
- A pot.

291
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,100
Leave it there. I got it.

292
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,910
- Can you take all of it? I can help you.
- It's fine.

293
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,110
- He's so handsome!!!
- Yes, yes. He's handsome, handsome.

294
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,990
Isn't he really handsome? I really like him.

295
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,180
- I like him more and more. He is so handsome.
- Look at how happy you are.

296
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,960
- Okay, okay. Let's go up.
- Go, go! Let's go.

297
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,790
Let's close this.

298
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,720
Push this.

299
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,890
- Let's go!
- Go!

300
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,610
Han Shangyan, did you know? All these years, I had a lot of words I held back in my heart.

301
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,190
Let me make a toast to you.

302
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,230
- I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

303
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,610
I'm fine. I'm happy.

304
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:02,900
Han Shangyan. Really. You are too impulsive.

305
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,080
Back then, why didn't you go to the world championships?

306
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,200
Even if you needed to retire,

307
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,590
you should have waited until you played the world championships, won first place and then retired!

308
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:21,460
Little Mi, did you know? I, Buff, am one of the only people who have won against Han Shangyan!

309
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,060
If he won the world championship,

310
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,950
then I would be a greater player than the world champion!

311
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:34,200
I won against you once. So I am a player who is greater than the world champion, right?

312
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,050
Old Han.

313
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,760
Okay.

314
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,470
Did you guys know? I'll tell you again.

315
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,310
If that year, Han Shangyan did not retire.

316
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:53,700
The ones who won the world championship would definitely be the Chinese team.

317
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,350
Really. It really is a pity.

318
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,060
Here. Han Shangyan, let me make another toast to you.

319
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:11,460
I... am thankful to you for saving my life.

320
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,910
And also you

321
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,700
letting me return again to compete.

322
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,410
You are my savior.

323
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,470
You are. You are.

324
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,680
Cheers!

325
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,470
Cheers!

327
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,150
You... really know how to drive?

328
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,990
Of course. I just got my driver's license. It's legal.

329
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,790
Why did you think to go get your driver's license?

330
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,150
I was just thinking what if a situation like today happened, and you drank alcohol.

331
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,670
I have a driver license. Prepared just in case.

332
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,420
Seat belt.

333
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,030
Are you ready? I am going to drive!

334
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,240
Okay. The engine is on.

335
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,810
And then... clutch... handbrakes.

336
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,860
My car is automatic, there isn't a clutch.

337
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,280
Understood. It's automatic.

338
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,690
Left is the stop pedal, right is the gas pedal. Don't mess them up.

339
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,370
I know, I passed on my first try of course.

340
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,310
You're also a genius on the driving test?

341
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,300
Please don't talk to me right now.

342
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,440
When I drive I can't talk to anyone, I have to be really focused. I'm driving now, okay?

343
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,500
Don't talk? But...

344
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,990
Can you even drive?

345
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,670
Sorry. Sorry.

346
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,970
Sorry. I'm sorry.

347
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,030
What are you doing?

348
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,210
- Calling the police.
- What?

349
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,010
Calling a substitute designated driver.

350
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,410
No no no. You don't need to call one.

351
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,880
I told you, I know how to drive.

352
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,910
Just now is because you kept on talking to me.

353
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,950
I told you that you can't talk to me, when I'm driving I need to focus.

354
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,600
If you talk to me, I won't be able to focus properly.

355
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,210
As soon as you talked to me, I almost hit another car.

356
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,550
Fine, you drive. I'll give my life to you, okay?

357
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,500
This time please don't talk to me, okay?

358
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,950
Can you understand the navigation signals?

359
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,820
No cars, let's get going then.

360
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,990
♫<i> I think I've seen you in my dream before </i>♫

361
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,000
♫<i> Your eyes are like shining stars </i>♫

362
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,500
Don't go past 40 miles per hour, okay?
♫<i> You captured all my attention </i>♫

363
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,890
That's not okay. A steady pace is 60 miles per hour.

364
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,860
Our driving instructor said so.

365
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,960
Okay..
♫<i> Getting ready, taking deep breaths </i>♫

366
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,560
♫<i> I want to climb to the mountain peak with you </i>♫

367
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,860
Miss, do you even know how to drive? If you don't know, don't block the road!

368
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:24,500
I didn't even block him, why does he have to be so mean?

369
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,860
♫ <i>Let’s go together, let’s go together, </i>♫

370

♫ <i> we won’t worry regardless of how far</i> ♫

371
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,540
I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

375
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,240
♫ <i>Holding hands, holding hands, </i> ♫

376
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,540
Start backing up slowly. You can start turning now, you can turn the wheel till it stops. Yup.
♫ <i>I'll stay by your side</i> ♫

377
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,440
Hello? I'm on the first floor now, could you come out and help me park the car?

378
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,720
Why so much nonsense? Hurry, come down, come down. Hurry!

379
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,670
Wait, no. You turned to early, you turned too much now.

380
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,070
First move forward. Move forward.

381
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,940
Moving forward. Moving forward. Moving forward.

382
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,790
Have the car go forward. Not this forward, the earlier forward.

383
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,040
Now just stop. Put it into park and then prepare for turning.

384
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,130
And then turn the wheel until it stops, and then slowly release...

385
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,420
Release the gas pedal and then slowly press the stop pedal and then go back.

386
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,870
Go back slowly. Back up.

387
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,410
You turned too early. Yes.

388
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,420
You parked into the wrong spot. First stop for a bit. Stop for a bit.

389
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,630
Put the car into park. Into park! Come forward. Come forward.

390
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,120
Boss.

391
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,410
Boss, what's up?

392
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,510
Who's that? Sister-in-Law?

393
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,110
Quickly and help her park the car correctly.

394
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,660
Wait a moment, Boss. You won't park it yourself?

395
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,770
I was in a video call with my girlfriend!

396
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,870
I'm telling you to do it, so you should go do it. I drank alcohol, so I can't drive the car!

397
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,060
Sister-in-Law! Sister-in-Law! I'll do it. I'll do it.

398
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,970
Okay. Okay.

399
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,840
I don't know why... why my skills aren't so great today.

400
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,530
At the driving test, when I parked the car I got full points.

401
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,730
I got it in there so quickly and easily. The driving proctor even praised me. What's with this...?

402
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,750
This is reverse parking.

403
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,990
This isn't side parking?

404
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,240
Isn't it similar?

405
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,970
What are you laughing about?

406
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,070
I'm not.

407
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,010
<i>He has a girlfriend, don't you now?</i>

408
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:25,890
<i>I didn't know.</i>

409
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,900
<i>Now you know? What are you thinking then?</i>

410
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,640
<i>- I have no thoughts.
- Okay wait.</i>

411
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,360
<i>Little sister, come over here. Let me get this straightened out.</i>

412
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,080
<i>Tell the truth, alright? Why are you looking for me?</i>

413
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,800
<i>I wasn't looking for you.</i>

414
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,570
<i>Okay no. I can give you an autograph, even a selfie, anything else, just tell me.</i>

415
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,310
<i>As long as you tell the truth, say that we really don't have anything to do with each other.</i>

416
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,790
<i>You can make any request, just as long as you don't ask me to be my girlfriend.</i>

417
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,010
<i>Who wants to be your girlfriend? I don't even like you.</i>

418
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,460
<i>I think she's actually your crazy fan, dude.</i>

419
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,930
<i>You even want me "to carry the black pot" for you?
(T/N: means to take the shame or blame for him)</i>

420
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,120
<i>Say that one more time. Carry what black pot?</i>

421
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,940
<i>Wait. No. no... Hey!</i>

422
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,570
<i>Hey! Little sister, if you like him, just say it loud and clear.</i>

423
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,990
<i>I was looking for you.</i>

424
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:27,940

425
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,620
<i>You guys still won't tell the truth, right?</i>

426
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,520
<i>This is the truth!</i>

427
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,200
Are you thinking about last time when he his stomach bled at the competition?

428
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,600
What stomach bleed... I don't know what you're talking about...

429
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,930
Acting dumb?

430
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:46,100
That event was from so long ago... so awkward... can we not talk about it?

431
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,830
Boss! I parked it.

432
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,220
Parked it? Okay, go back then.

433
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,370
He's very professional, isn't he?

434
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,370
Boss, Sister-in-Law, I heard that you guys were getting married?

435
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,490
You said so?

436
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,160
Who said so? 97?

437
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,120
Why are you so embarrassed?

438
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,160
Getting married is a very big exciting matter!

439
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,920
Our brothers have prepared a big gift for you both, a big gift!

440
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,060
Go back now. Call a car in a bit to send her home, okay?

441
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,130
Oh. Sister-in-Law, bye!

442
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,180
Getting married? You thought it through already?

443
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,310
If you are in a hurry to get married, let's settle all the matters then.

444
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,690
Not in a hurry. I'm not in a hurry at all.

445
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,460
Then... then let's wait until the final national championship ends.

446
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,020
Let me think about how to face your mom and dad.

447
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,910
The challenge of coming forward to my mom and dad definitely is a hard one to pass.

448
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,910
- <i>Looks like he's really prepared for it then.</i>
- Let's go.

449
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,940
<i>[No cameras]</i>

450
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,950
Little Han. Tong Nian. You guys just got back?

451
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,140
Auntie, how are you? Is everything alright?

452
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,470
I was just waiting for you to get back.

453
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,770
- Waiting for me?
- Yup.

454
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,700
I heard that you guys were getting married? And I was so happy for both of you.

455
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,360
Little Han, you've been by yourself in China for a long time and have no experience with preparing weddings.

456
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,960
I'll help you take care of a little of it.

457
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,830
Back at the mountainside village, I used to help prepare brides for marriage.

458
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,660
I'm very familiar with all these processes already, okay?

459
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,530
Auntie, auntie, hold on. It's okay, it's okay. When we have time, we'll come back to talk to you. Thank you, Auntie!

460
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,830
Don't forget to tell me if you need me!

461
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,750
Okay. okay.

462
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,650
You can just sit wherever you'd like. I told Grunt to call a car.

463
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,070
If you go back to your dorm late, that's okay, right?

464
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,940
<i> Does he not have enough money for the wedding? </i>

465
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,510
<i> Everyone is giving him so much pressure and he still has to get through my mom and dad. </i>

466
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,420
<i> Then he must feel so burdened right now! </i>

467
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,360
Where's Squiddy?

468
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
He must've run downstairs to the living room to play.

469
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,950
Squiddy! Meow.

470
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,200
Is it true that everyone in K&K thinks that you are...

471
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,220
thinks that you are... really soon...

472
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,010
Getting married with you?

473
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,840
Yes, I know. Usually they are pressured and easily excited while they are practicing.

474
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,330
As long as a little wind passes by and disturbs their typical pace of things, they'll start to gossip a lot. Don't let it bother you.

475
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,830
Oh it's them gossiping about it? I almost thought it was you...

476
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,560
Well, whatever.

477
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,990
I don't care what they are thinking, I won't be bothered by them.

478
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,460
I'm just worried about what you think.

479
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,420
Then what do you...

480
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,060
What's wrong?

481
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,400
Right now it's too late, it's too hard to get a car at the moment.

482
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,630
How about I drive Sister-in-Law back?

483
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:20,050
<i>It's all right. In a moment, I'll go and call a car. Go back and rest.</i>

484
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,570
Okay.

485
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,410
Then what do you think I'm thinking?

486
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,020
Do you not have any money anymore? I know that your team and club need money...

487
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,160
you also need money for signing Buff.

488
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,660
If we both get married right now, it will also require a lot of money.

489
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,420
So you think if I don't have enough money right now, I won't be able to take good care of you?

490
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,580
No. No that's not what I mean.

491
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,850
I just don't want you to have that much pressure.

492
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,760
So I hope you don't hide anything from me or push yourself too much.

493
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,250
Then are you hiding something from me now?

494
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,300
I'm not, you still aren't understanding what I'm saying right now.

495
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,810
I'm saying that I'm hoping that between the two of us...

496
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,860
But when Zhen Hui stayed at your place, you didn't tell me, did you?

497
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,550
I was scared that at the time if I told you, you would...

498
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,560
you would worry and get upset at me, so I didn't tell you.

499
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,020
So you also have times where you don't understand me, right?

500
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,200
Well you obviously don't understand me very well either. Last time, when I went to your house when your grandfather was here,

501
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,840
I can't eat mangoes because I'm allergic to them, but I still ate the whole plate of mangoes.

502
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,490
Then why did you have to force yourself to eat the mangoes?

503
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,570
Because you cut them for me. When I finished eating that plate of mangoes, I was very happy.

504
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,450
So I didn't think about my allergies anymore!

505
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,330
You just said that you wanted to be honest with each other.

506
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,360
If you didn't tell me beforehand, how would I know you can't eat mangoes?

507
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,920
That's true, I didn't tell you. Then that's my fault there, okay?

508
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,760
But I'm a young lady, some things and matters I shouldn't always need to tell you.

509
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,410
When you love someone, shouldn't you pay attention to them?

510
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,020
If you really love me, then you should pay attention to me.

511
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,770
So I don't think you understand me at all.

512
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,100
If you understood me, you would know that I'm allergic to mangoes and I like to eat strawberries.

513
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,350
I don't care if you have money or not, I just care if your future has me in it or not.

514
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,470
I like when we are embarrassed and don't talk too much, and I hate it when you talk all over the place and think too much.

515
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,560
Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's not argue anymore, okay?

516
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,930
If we keep going like this there will be no end. Let's calm down, okay? Let's calm down...

517
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,560
But I'm still not finished talking.

518
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,560
<i>I must've gotten anxious over talking about getting married.</i>

519
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,470
<i>He clearly is really attentive to me!</i>

520
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:50,190
<i>I already like him a lot, and am very happy with him!</i>

521
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,640
<i>Should I go look for him?</i>

522
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,150
<i> Forget it. Forget it. It's better to let him cool-down. Don't go disturb him. </i>

523
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:25,440
Am I a pig head? Why did I have to say those words?

524
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,390
Boss, did Sister-in-Law catch her ride safely?

525
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,630
Probably.

526
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,250
Boss, I'm going out for a bit?

527
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,030
<i> That's weird. Why didn't he react? </i>

528
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:26,030
<i>[You design your own destiny]</i>

529
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:04,680
♫ <i>I carefully covered up that I don’t mind</i> ♫

530
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:13,970
♫ <i>So that I can be in your world, slowly walking closer</i> ♫

531
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:20,700
♫ <i>I attempted to cherish this experience</i> ♫

532
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:29,690
♫ <i>Attempt to use unfamiliarity to explain the distance between us</i> ♫

533
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:41,390
♫ <i>I start to portray an unfamiliar me</i> ♫

534
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:49,830
♫ <i>Fathoming the untrue distance behind the words</i> ♫

535
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:56,860
♫ <i>I thought I possessed the acting skills to deceive everything</i> ♫

536
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:05,440
♫ <i>But no matter how much I practiced, I can't act like myself</i> ♫

537
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:12,930
♫ <i>The me who doesn't care about you</i> ♫

538
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,210
Come over here!

539
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:56,010
Boss, I just chatted for a while with some friends.

540
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,380
You're experienced at this. Usually, what do you give to a girl to make her feel better?

541
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,850
If you have money, go buy lipstick.

542
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,870
If you don't have money, go buy food.

543
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:09,750
The difference between the prices is too much.

544
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,780
But you need to get the right brand of lipstick too. For example...

545
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,350
It's for Sister-in-Law, right?

546
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,840
If it's for Sister-in-Law, then just get food.

547
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,540
Like cream puffs and also strawberry cake.

548
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,040
There's also chocolate. There's also a lot more. Boss!

549
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,220
Han Shangyan.

550
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,940
Han Shangyan?!

551
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:00,520
<i> Looks like he's really angry. He didn't come back last night. </i>

552
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:13,340
<i> He didn't reply to any messages either. Where did he go? </i>

553
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,960
Sorry, Sir. You don't checkout strawberries over here.

554
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,900
Sir, what do you need?

555
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:35,090
Do you have strawberry cakes here?

556
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,270
Sorry, it just so happens that we just sold out strawberry cakes.

557
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,220
Why don't you look at this mango cake?

558
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,340
It's still so early, and you already sold out of strawberry cakes?

559
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,120
Why don't you guys make a little more?

560
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,410
I'm really sorry.

561
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:49,720
Why don't you come again tomorrow or look at this newly released chocolate cake?

562
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,060
- Young Master, do you need me to help you?
- No.

563
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,720
Boss, there's so much food.

564
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,990
- Is it for us?
- Did Tong Nian leave already?

565
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,210
No. No, I didn't see her leave.

566
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,820
Boss, you're so stingy!

567
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,690
Yesterday night, I didn't control my emotions well.

568
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,850
Here, I would like to apologize to you.

569
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,760
You're not mad at me anymore?

570
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,590
In the future, I'll try to change. I won't make the same kind mistake again.

571
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,310
Okay.

572
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,680
Also, I don't really know how to cheer up girls.

573
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,950
Anyways, in the past, when Solo earned money, he would go buy good food for his girlfriend.

574
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,150
I think that girls that you also like to eat,

575
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,540
so I bought you strawberries, strawberry cake and strawberry macarons.

576
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,580
And the store clerk also said that you should eat the strawberry cake soon. If it melts, it won't taste good.

577
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,040
Maybe in the future, you can give me a list of what you want to eat. Then I can just buy what's on your list?

578
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,190
I want to eat it right now.

579
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,090
Then I'll go get it for you.
