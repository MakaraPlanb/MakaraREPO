00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:07,628
Oh! Mi Ho!

4
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:16,572
Dae Woong! I'll grant you that wish
that you really want.

5
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:20,313
I'll grant all your wishes.

6
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:21,625
Because...

7
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:23,743
I like you.

8
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:31,002
Dae Woong!

9
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:36,651
I'm going to hide!

10
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:42,448
Mi Ho!

11
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:44,526
Mi Ho!

12
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:45,729
Mi Ho!

13
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:50,584
Mi Ho!

14
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:51,676
Mi Ho!

15
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,599
Mi Ho!

16
00:00:58,085 --> 00:00:59,128
Mi Ho!

17
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,391
Mi Ho!

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,735
Woong!

19
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:06,995
What the hell!

20
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,613
Why'd you just jump off like that
out of nowhere?!

21
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,970
I was hiding.

22
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,293
Who in the world would jump off like that
just to hide?

23
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:17,775
I'm not a human.

24
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:21,017
I'm fine.

25
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:24,785
Why'd you get so surprised and follow me?

26
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:28,883
Oh... I just saw your tail, too...

27
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,158
Why did I do that?

28
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:38,134
What's this?

29
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:39,225
It's a sign.

30
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:42,093
When I jumped,
it got caught and broke.

31
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:43,608
What?

32
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:49,104
What's this?!

33
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:51,628
It got caught and scratched. It's fine!

34
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:56,181
That girl's coming again!

35
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:57,556
I'll go hide again.

36
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:01,694
Just stay here.

37
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,116
There's no reason for you to hide.

38
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,602
Dae Woong!

39
00:02:08,286 --> 00:02:10,686
What the hell! What's going –

40
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:31,593
Are you staying here with her again?

41
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:36,205
No... did you ever send her away
in the first place?

42
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:42,750
I found her and brought her back.

43
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:47,930
And from now on... I have to stay with her.

44
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:51,721
Is that so?

45
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,790
You weren't even planning
on coming to me then.

46
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:58,224
I can't go to you for now.

47
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:03,512
Now, you're not even trying to
explain that it's a misunderstanding.

48
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,354
Do you...

49
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:10,910
like her?

50
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,223
I have to stay with Mi Ho.

51
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,518
I promised I would.

52
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:56,757
Dae Woong.

53
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,927
I didn't do it for you.

54
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,901
I didn't want

55
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:13,053
to lie to her anymore, that's why I did it.

56
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:21,430
If I try to hold onto her,
while you're beside me...

57
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,509
to noona, I'll be a bad guy.

58
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:37,081
I am a bad guy, though.

59
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:40,900
I'm not a nice guy.

60
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:05,020
Usually I'm not the type of guy
who keeps promises, but

61
00:05:12,494 --> 00:05:17,608
how did I end up making a promise
to you that I can't break?

62
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:07,188
Originally,

63
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:11,009
I bought this as a promise ring for noona...

64
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:33,491
Oh! It's raining.

65
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:42,322
Oh! It's raining.

66
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,125
How long have you been standing there?

67
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:50,542
For a while.

68
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,351
Isn't it heavy?

69
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:54,728
Yeah... a little.

70
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,088
Oh you're fine 'cause you're a gumiho.

71
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:00,681
I almost forgot again.

72
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:05,932
I'm going to think a little
longer so keep holding it up.

73
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:07,439
OK.

74
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,095
Ah... it's heavy.

75
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:36,032
What else can I hide now?

76
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,916
Woong!

77
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:44,208
<i>Let's go.</i>

78
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:52,083
Come in!

79
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:05,884
Let's go fix the sign first.

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,653
This is really amazing.

81
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:14,445
Everything just sticks!

82
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,011
Careful!

83
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,267
That's instant glue!

84
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,294
If you stick it wrong,
it sticks and will never come off.

85
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:28,341
Mmm... I guess you can say it's like you.

86
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:29,722
I'm instant glue?

87
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:33,259
By a one-second mistake,
you stick on and never fall off.

88
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:36,271
You're the strongest instant glue!

89
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:42,126
Ah! It stuck perfectly.

90
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:46,021
Now, it'll never fall off.

91
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,862
Instant glue is permanent?

92
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,976
You have to fall off after 100 days.

93
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:52,816
<i>We have ninety-something days left right?</i>

94
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:56,116
I have to make sure
and count the days right.

95
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:03,416
Don't fall off. Don't fall off.

96
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:05,767
There're 95 days left.

97
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:14,890
Five days have already passed.

98
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:29,834
Hey that...

99
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,020
Is it OK?

100
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:33,098
This?

101
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:34,143
I just have to do this!

102
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,484
Hey! Don't!

103
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:44,581
We're done fixing the sign
so let's fix you.

104
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:50,805
I'll apply this here for you,
so you can't eat this.

105
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:54,352
Rather than applying this,

106
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:58,756
if I hug my bead close,
I think I'd get better sooner.

107
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,651
We have a lot of time together.

108
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,699
You can take your time and get better.

109
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:06,192
OK.

110
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:09,484
Woong!

111
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,026
I got hurt here too.

112
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:15,102
After I'm done with this.

113
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,146
How is it that you act exactly
like our Ddoong Ja?

114
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:23,426
Dog?!

115
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:25,881
Aish! Are you calling me a dog again?!

116
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:27,889
Hey! Ddoong Ja is not just any dog!

117
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,308
Besides humans, Ddoong Ja
is my closest be-pu!

118
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:32,970
What's be-pu?

119
00:10:33,144 --> 00:10:34,471
Be-st fr-iend.

120
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:36,192
It's a best friend.

121
00:10:36,295 --> 00:10:38,273
Oh! Then make me a be-pu too!

122
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:44,374
I can't... if Ddoong Ja finds out,
she'll get jealous.

123
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:51,877
Fine! We'll keep it a secret from Ddoong Ja
for now, and I'll make you my be-pu.

124
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:55,326
Yay! I'm so happy I'm your be-pu!

125
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:58,619
OK, OK!

126
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,164
Other hand!

127
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,950
Good job.

128
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:24,967
I don't know, I just hung it up
and now I'm nervous about it.

129
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:26,475
Mi Ho, try hitting it.

130
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:29,414
Ooh!

131
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,891
Shoot, it tilted!

132
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:35,948
We'll have to repair it correctly tomorrow.

133
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:39,975
Someone's coming.

134
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,023
Director Ban!

135
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:48,721
<i>Director Ban!</i>

136
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:50,694
<i>Oh no! oh no!</i>

137
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,965
<i>What do I do?</i>

138
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,303
<i>Director Ban!</i>

139
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:02,069
Oh! Director Ban!

140
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:03,983
Get a hold of yourself!

141
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:07,826
AC-TION!

142
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:11,180
Why the hell isn't Dae Woong
picking up his phone?!

143
00:12:11,695 --> 00:12:13,621
<i>[unintelligible muttering]</i>

144
00:12:15,688 --> 00:12:19,499
Oh? Why is my aunt bringing
the director here?

145
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:20,689
Dae Woong.

146
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:23,785
That director followed me again.

147
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:25,287
Really?

148
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:32,615
Secretary Kim, thanks for your hard work.

149
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:42,619
Where the heck did Dae Woong go?

150
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:49,421
Oh? Cell phone.

151
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:58,286
This must be Dae Woong's girl.

152
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:05,059
So it's true they're staying together again.

153
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,815
Oh, it's hot.

154
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:13,211
It really is hot!

155
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,980
If he sleeps like that
he'll probably boil to death.

156
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,885
Should I at least take off his coat?

157
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:36,384
No.

158
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:41,113
I don't want to be mistaken for someone
who undresses a drunk man.

159
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:45,234
Cha Min Sook – have some pride.

160
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:47,235
Just get up.

161
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:52,541
Oh! Cr-! Cra-! Cramp!

162
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:59,164
What the...?

163
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:10,103
Why?

164
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:14,297
Oh no! Oh no!
Isn't this instant glue?!

165
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:19,412
Oh no! What do I do?
My butt's completely stuck!

166
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:55,021
My aunt left the director in the room.

167
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:57,701
We'll have to sleep here tonight.

168
00:14:59,029 --> 00:14:59,913
I don't get why..

169
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:02,681
that director keeps following me around.

170
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,975
Hey, this is used when making a movie.

171
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,735
You can't break it.

172
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:10,631
Woong, that thing called movie, the one
that you're making with the director.

173
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:12,716
Is it something only humans can see?

174
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,558
You can see it even though you're not human.

175
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:19,097
In movies, there are non-humans, too.

176
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:20,319
Like what?

177
00:15:20,408 --> 00:15:24,200
Mmm... aliens, monsters, ghosts...

178
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:25,833
This and that, a lot of things appear.

179
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:27,567
What happens to them?

180
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:29,398
It depends on the movie.

181
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:31,761
Then, is there a movie

182
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:38,360
where one falls in love with a human,
gets married and lives happily ever after?

183
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:41,828
There're a lot where
they fall in love with a human.

184
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,796
Really? Like what?

185
00:15:47,674 --> 00:15:49,482
A Chinese Ghost Story.*
[*Name of film]

186
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:53,481
<i>A very beautiful ghost was living off
humans' chi* [*life force]</i>

187
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,456
<i>And a naïve student fell for her.</i>

188
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,415
<i>It makes no sense but they end up
liking each other.</i>

189
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:14,431
<i>You know, because it's a movie.</i>

190
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,539
And then?

191
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:16,944
Do they end up happily ever after?

192
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:18,268
No way!

193
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:20,784
The ghost leaves him and disappears.

194
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,168
Why'd she do that? What an idiot!

195
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:24,973
Well, because she's not a human.

196
00:16:25,098 --> 00:16:27,970
Then, not a movie with a
stupid character. What else?

197
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,003
Isn't there something else?

198
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:30,466
Something else?

199
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:34,089
Hmmm... something else...

200
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:36,502
Vampire.

201
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:40,652
<i>There was this really sexy vampire</i>

202
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:42,963
<i>who was living by sucking on human's blood.</i>

203
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:46,973
<i>When a sincere countess fell for it.</i>

204
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,186
<i>It's stupid but they end up
liking each other.</i>

205
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,010
<i>Because it's a movie.</i>

206
00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:08,002
And so? Do they get married?

207
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,440
No way!

208
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:12,147
The vampire is struck by sunlight
and disappears.

209
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:13,686
Not something like that.

210
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,191
Isn't there one where it ends well?

211
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,111
Something that ends well?

212
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:21,027
Hmm.. There's Friend! Friend!

213
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:26,504
Hi! I want to be your friend.

214
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,842
Ha ha! If you acted like Chucky,
that'd be hilarious!

215
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:32,564
Mi Ho! Follow me.

216
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:36,838
Open your eyes wider and glare.

217
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:38,053
"I want to be your friend."

218
00:17:38,162 --> 00:17:39,170
"I want to be your friend."

219
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:45,531
Then does he end living happily ever after?

220
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:46,666
No way.

221
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:49,739
He also ends up fighting before
he dies and disappears.

222
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:53,702
It doesn't end well for him either.

223
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:57,227
There's no story with a happy ending.

224
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,588
That's because it's a movie.

225
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,423
But you're real.

226
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:05,424
And we're friends.

227
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:08,820
Hoy hoy.

228
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:10,829
Hoy hoy.

229
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,560
And I'm sure if we look for it, we'll find
a lot of movies with happy endings.

230
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,274
Even ET... leaves.

231
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,751
King Kong...

232
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:22,997
Also dies.

233
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,232
<i>Oh yeah, King Kong dies.</i>

234
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:28,754
I'll have to go ask Dong Ju teacher.

235
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:30,751
Dong Ju teacher is really smart so

236
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:32,544
he'll probably know.

237
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,153
Dong Ju teacher?

238
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,538
Dong Ju teacher's that smart?

239
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:41,281
Yeah. Dong Ju teacher knows everything

240
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,066
And he teaches everything very nicely.

241
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:47,293
Because you found a nice and smart friend,

242
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:48,849
you must be very happy.

243
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:52,097
I should go ask him tomorrow.

244
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:53,344
Sure go ahead.

245
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:56,275
Go to Dong Ju teacher and
play with him often!

246
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:57,841
Go get lots of meat!

247
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,490
And ask him things you don't know.

248
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,552
I told him I'll come by often anyway.

249
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,555
You better do it then.

250
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,933
This is good for me! Less of a burden!

251
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:13,205
I just feel sorry for this Dong Ju teacher.

252
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,340
And grateful and stuff!

253
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:18,778
Hey I got to go to sleep.

254
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:20,118
Hurry up and get to bed.

255
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,134
Get up.

256
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,480
Woong.

257
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:31,399
Tell me about the movie you're in.

258
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:35,175
I don't know. Just go ask Dong Ju teacher.

259
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,793
Even though he's really smart,
I don't know if he'll know about that.

260
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,638
- Woong.
- Go to sleep!

261
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:01,956
Why am I sleeping here?

262
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,618
Oww! My head!

263
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:18,701
It's stuck.

264
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,264
<i>Fall off.</i>

265
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:22,006
Fall off.

266
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:23,571
Fall right off!

267
00:20:24,772 --> 00:20:27,035
Dang! Not falling off!

268
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:40,217
<i>Cha-kun.</i>

269
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:42,786
Aish! It's that director!

270
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:47,146
<i>Cha-kun! Are you here?</i>

271
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,638
<i>Cha-kun! Are you here?!</i>

272
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:55,104
Cha-kun!

273
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,061
Cha-kun!

274
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,582
<i>Cha-kun!</i>

275
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:07,294
Cha-kun! Are you here?!

276
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,766
Oh yeah! Director!

277
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:24,318
Did you bring me here by any chance?

278
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:28,060
Oh, no. My aunt dropped you off and left.

279
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,373
Your aunt?

280
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:31,835
I don't remember anything at all.

281
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,785
Aish! Why does that person keep showing up?

282
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:44,285
Director!

283
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:59,352
Oh! Could I get your aunt's
phone number from you?

284
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:02,072
Oh, my aunt's number?

285
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:04,399
I hurt my head! My head!

286
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:06,905
Tell me your aunt's phone number.

287
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:16,565
Did he leave?

288
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:17,323
Yep.

289
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:21,858
Thankfully, we didn't get caught
for breaking the sign.

290
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:28,060
You drank all that alcohol last night and
you're eating meat in the morning?

291
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:31,884
Yeah! I think I have to eat meat
to help my stomach.

292
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:34,988
Ah! It's healing hangover cow.

293
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:36,359
Yeah.

294
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:41,681
Just by smelling this meat,
I think my stomach feels better.

295
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:44,080
Yummy! Delicious!

296
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:52,741
Hey! Did you grill the meat and
leave the fry pan over there again?

297
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:56,015
Yep! I can cook meat by myself now!

298
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:59,015
But you're only cooking the meat.

299
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,261
It's been getting on my nerves
but I haven't been able to say it.

300
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,971
Wash the fry pans you use!

301
00:23:05,624 --> 00:23:09,605
You seem to be learning some tact
but you have no sense of shame!

302
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:11,261
In fact, it seems like you have
even less now!

303
00:23:11,354 --> 00:23:13,502
I thought you liked washing the fry pans!

304
00:23:13,646 --> 00:23:15,848
Hey! When I'm washing the fry pans

305
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,405
"Phew! I figured out another meal."

306
00:23:19,494 --> 00:23:21,012
That's why I'm happy!

307
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,299
I didn't wash it cause I liked washing it!

308
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:24,881
Fine! Fine!

309
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,962
I'll wash it after I'm done
eating everything.

310
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:29,162
Now that is a good idea.

311
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:30,345
Mi Ho.

312
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:37,074
While we're at it, should we discuss
basic house rules for living together?

313
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:39,759
<i>In order to live in this building,</i>

314
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:43,168
we promised the director that we'll
take care of the action school

315
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:43,685
Right?

316
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:44,499
Yeah!

317
00:23:44,762 --> 00:23:46,538
Dae Woong, you said you'll do it.

318
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:48,876
Yes. I have to do it.

319
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:51,017
But I have to prepare for the movie.

320
00:23:51,123 --> 00:23:53,514
And I have to study, so I'm too busy.

321
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,981
So it's too much.

322
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,722
That's true. Dae Woong,
you have a lot of stuff to do.

323
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,409
That's why I was thinking about it.

324
00:24:01,631 --> 00:24:04,812
Do you want to try being this
action school's custodian?

325
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:06,539
Custodian?

326
00:24:06,764 --> 00:24:10,811
Custodian. "-ian" is the
character for person.

327
00:24:11,147 --> 00:24:13,045
It's something only humans can do so

328
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:15,829
I am a little worried about
having you do it but...

329
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:17,409
it seems like you're getting
closer to humans these days so

330
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:19,425
I'm thinking about giving you
this opportunity.

331
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:20,456
How about it?

332
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:21,861
You think you can do it?

333
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,799
Custod-ian! Ah! I really
want to be a custodian!

334
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,948
OK!

335
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:29,766
It's not something anyone can do but

336
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:31,221
I'll trust in you and
give you that position.

337
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:33,117
What do I have to do?

338
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:34,879
<i>Before people come,</i>

339
00:24:34,998 --> 00:24:36,113
You have to clean this area up and

340
00:24:36,263 --> 00:24:39,309
Organize all the equipment.

341
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:41,757
You have to clean the dust off this window

342
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:43,672
And sweep the floors.

343
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,708
And then you have to come up this way.

344
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,917
Go over the plants and pull the weeds.

345
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:49,840
And you have to take out the trash.

346
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,835
The upkeep of this place is
the face of the action school.

347
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:55,079
If you meet anyone by chance,

348
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,952
you have to be careful and docile

349
00:24:57,123 --> 00:25:00,138
To elders you have to speak in polite form.

350
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,992
<i>Think you can do it?</i>

351
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:05,592
It hurts my pride to speak
in polite form to humans.

352
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:07,451
I've been alive for much longer!

353
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:09,481
Even if a human is really old,

354
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:11,744
could they be any older than 100?

355
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,379
OK, then hold onto your pride,
Gumiho Grandma.

356
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:16,483
I'll do it!

357
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:18,201
I'll just do it.

358
00:25:19,324 --> 00:25:20,196
Fine.

359
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:25,000
From now on, we will make you
the action school's custodian.

360
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:26,917
Here.

361
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:29,092
This is the evidence of that.

362
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:36,765
Oh and this is a special task
that I'm giving you,

363
00:25:36,843 --> 00:25:39,673
so you can't tell anyone
that you're the custodian.

364
00:25:39,713 --> 00:25:40,870
Look at this!

365
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:44,080
I've decided to be the action school's
custodian!

366
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:48,300
Cha Dae Woong really gets who you are
and is managing you.

367
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:49,984
Yeah. Dae Woong seems to

368
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:53,348
Treat me more and more like
a person so I'm very happy.

369
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:57,730
Yesterday, he told me about movies
where non-human like me appear.

370
00:25:58,025 --> 00:26:01,632
Oh! Dong Ju teacher knows a lot of
those kinds of movies too right?

371
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:04,976
Those stories are in movies
as well as books.

372
00:26:05,203 --> 00:26:06,294
Books?

373
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,814
Wow! There're so many books!

374
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:17,244
Without coming in contact with humans,

375
00:26:17,354 --> 00:26:20,176
you can learn about the world through books.

376
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,815
Wow! There's a lot of animals
I've never seen before!

377
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:28,321
The world is very wide and there's
a lot of stuff to eat right?

378
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:31,318
I didn't look at it
because I want to eat it!

379
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:38,196
I can't read any of these words!

380
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,663
Most people here can't read it well either.

381
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:42,952
How about you, Dong Ju teacher?

382
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,452
You want me to read it to you?

383
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:46,685
I won't understand it, even if I hear it.

384
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,552
Wow! It's mating!

385
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:56,325
You never just walk past it, do you?

386
00:26:58,963 --> 00:27:00,931
Oh! It's a cow!

387
00:27:05,276 --> 00:27:06,760
If he bumps into you,

388
00:27:06,845 --> 00:27:08,896
that person will get hurt.

389
00:27:09,006 --> 00:27:11,974
Then you'll be found out as not human.

390
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,458
Oh that's right.

391
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:14,940
Phew, that was close.

392
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:19,259
Books that are fit for your level
are over there.

393
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:23,238
Wow! These are all about non-humans!

394
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:29,558
This will be good.

395
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:31,587
The Little Mermaid?

396
00:27:31,688 --> 00:27:32,647
She's a fish!

397
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:34,999
It's about a mermaid who wants to be human.

398
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:35,997
Really?

399
00:27:36,228 --> 00:27:37,631
What happens to her?

400
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,480
Read it yourself.

401
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:42,220
I'll give it to you as a gift.

402
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:46,557
I liked your action so much that
I revised the script,

403
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:48,929
and made your part a little bigger.

404
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:51,372
It's not that I have any other reason to.

405
00:27:52,746 --> 00:27:58,132
Oh! Thank you! I can take it,
no matter what!

406
00:27:58,328 --> 00:27:59,724
<i>Seon Nyeo! Seon Nyeo!</i>

407
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:01,872
Dad!

408
00:28:02,503 --> 00:28:03,361
<i>Let me go!</i>

409
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:05,361
What is this!

410
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:08,636
I only had five lines and
you shortened it to two!

411
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:09,948
Are you sure I'm your daughter?!

412
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:11,506
Then you think I adopted you?

413
00:28:11,631 --> 00:28:15,779
In this movie, you are not my daughter!
You are Maid Number 1.

414
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:19,711
Fine! Then Maid Number 1
will shut her mouth!

415
00:28:19,854 --> 00:28:22,973
Instead, as your daughter,
I need to find out something.

416
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,251
Hey Cha Dae Woong!

417
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,249
Yesterday, my dad...

418
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:29,682
Did he really drink with you
and stay up all night?

419
00:28:29,762 --> 00:28:30,944
What?

420
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:44,014
Of course! Last night your dad was

421
00:28:44,116 --> 00:28:46,921
with me at the action school.

422
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:50,346
Oh yeah?

423
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:54,536
Seon Nyeo, We shouldn't be here like this
when the director is having a meeting.

424
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,605
Let's go, let's go.

425
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:57,123
Let's go, let's go.

426
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:06,262
As expected you can take direction
from my eyes.

427
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:10,488
I am not the kind of person
who misreads your eyes.

428
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:13,612
I know, I know, I know.

429
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:20,036
What are you doing here, Hae In?

430
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:25,082
I saw the revised script and I had some
questions to ask you, Director.

431
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:29,288
Oh then, sit here.

432
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:33,845
Well then, I'll be on my way.

433
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:41,978
Cha Dae Woong!

434
00:29:42,196 --> 00:29:44,799
Was my dad really at the
action school last night?

435
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:46,597
Yes, I told you already.

436
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:49,653
Then you guys drank with that girl!
The three of you?

437
00:29:49,774 --> 00:29:50,462
Girl?

438
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:52,683
Hey, we all know already.

439
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,845
You met up with Ms. Mi Ho,

440
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:56,124
and you're with her again.

441
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:57,980
We heard it all from Hae In unni already.

442
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:00,889
That Mi Ho girl is sticking to you again!

443
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:03,150
What do you mean, sticking to him.

444
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:06,002
They're back on track!

445
00:30:06,086 --> 00:30:08,223
<I>Cha Dae Woong said it's nothing!

446
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:11,986
Isn't that why you didn't
tell anyone and hid it?

447
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:13,786
I'm not hiding it!

448
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,866
It's not nothing!

449
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,113
From now on, Mi Ho is my girlfriend.

450
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,120
There!

451
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:27,726
I thought he'd say it's not,
but he says it is.

452
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:30,210
Cha Dae Woong is a total pooh-head!

453
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:45,147
Oh! She's so diligent!

454
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:46,979
Her hands are fast.

455
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:49,104
And she works so hard.

456
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,658
It's so hot today... she must be suffering.

457
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:00,325
No! He said not to eat stuff like this
off the floor.

458
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,755
That's right! That's right!

459
00:31:07,328 --> 00:31:08,400
Oh my!

460
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:10,493
Grandpa! Are you OK?

461
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:11,555
Huh?

462
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:13,775
I'm fine.

463
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:17,990
Miss, thank you so much.

464
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,481
You almost got hurt as well, are you OK?

465
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,671
I'm fine*!
[*spoken in impolite form]

466
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:24,643
- I'm fine.* [*Polite form]
- Oh I see.

467
00:31:26,283 --> 00:31:27,909
Such a young miss,

468
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:31,133
Worried that this old geezer
would get hurt and helping out.

469
00:31:31,235 --> 00:31:33,881
You have such a kind heart.

470
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:37,576
And you're so pretty when you smile!

471
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:41,140
And when I saw you earlier,
you were working so hard!

472
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,213
Here.

473
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:45,965
Drink something nice and cold
and then go back to work.

474
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:48,188
This is organic juice.

475
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,209
It'll taste pretty good.

476
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,504
Thank you.

477
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:52,646
OK.

478
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,524
Miss, what's your name?

479
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:02,608
It's Mi Ho.

480
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:03,969
Mi Ho?

481
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:08,648
Wow, even your name is so pretty!

482
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:10,110
What about your parents?

483
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:11,785
Don't have any.

484
00:32:12,825 --> 00:32:14,420
Don't have any?

485
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:20,531
Oh no... your parents aren't around either.

486
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:25,034
I have to go back to work.

487
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:26,432
OK, go ahead.

488
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,869
Drink one more.

489
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:31,100
This is organic juice.

490
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,535
They say it's good for your body.

491
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:33,983
Thank you.

492
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:35,075
You're welcome.

493
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:37,478
Can I give this to someone else?

494
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:38,652
Sure!

495
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:40,912
Thank you.

496
00:32:42,554 --> 00:32:45,344
It's vegetable so I better
give it to Dae Woong!

497
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:50,855
To give to Dae Woong,

498
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,906
she took the vegetable juice...

499
00:32:54,078 --> 00:32:57,027
She has such a kind heart.

500
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:01,894
But,

501
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:06,532
she also has no parents.

502
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:10,472
Is that why Dae Woong was attracted to her?

503
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:18,407
Eh! My Ddoong Ja! Have you been good?

504
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,288
Should we eat something?

505
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,835
Wait a moment.

506
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:27,385
<i>Oh! Grandpa!</i>

507
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:34,795
While you are working on the movie,

508
00:33:34,903 --> 00:33:37,620
You said you would train there
and not come back here.

509
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:41,411
Well... I got annoyed so I came back.

510
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:44,840
So what, you're not going
to go back to training?

511
00:33:47,915 --> 00:33:50,877
I want to give it all up and come back here.

512
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:54,251
I like my own house.

513
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:56,076
You can't do that.

514
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:58,835
It's really hot there and
it's far from school.

515
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:00,768
So it's really bothersome to get around.

516
00:34:02,592 --> 00:34:05,258
Well then, go ahead and use the car.

517
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:07,493
Really?!

518
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:12,069
But what's the point of having a car?

519
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,865
I don't even have money for gas.

520
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:16,047
You want me to revive your card?

521
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:17,220
Really?!

522
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,509
I'll revive your card, so

523
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:23,989
don't go back to your old ways,

524
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:27,393
and look after the person
next to you and stuff!

525
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:28,845
All right!

526
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:30,997
Grandpa! Seriously! Thank you so much!

527
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:33,744
In exchange, until the movie is over,

528
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:35,926
don't quit and work really hard!

529
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,830
Of course!

530
00:34:51,404 --> 00:34:54,132
It's been so long since I've seen you.

531
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:57,207
Should we run along together?

532
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,709
These two... give me them exactly
like this, off the mannequin.

533
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:05,886
Give me this one.

534
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,016
And give me this one too.

535
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:08,359
Give me both.

536
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:13,339
Oh wait... swipe it!

537
00:35:16,703 --> 00:35:17,831
Swipe it.

538
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:18,972
- Welcome.
- Yeah.

539
00:35:21,095 --> 00:35:22,087
This is cute.

540
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,743
Wow this is nice.

541
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:26,598
Oh this one's pretty!

542
00:35:30,515 --> 00:35:31,680
Give me this one.

543
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:34,521
We're having a promotion right now;
you get a free gift.

544
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,198
Would you like to pick one?

545
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:38,314
Give me the men's belt.

546
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:39,374
Yes sir.

547
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:41,483
Oh wait a second!

548
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:45,302
Never mind, give me this cell phone chain.

549
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:48,249
I can't just give her the
cell phone chain so...

550
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:50,437
I'll have to buy her a cell phone as well.

551
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,684
<i>Which one would be good?</i>

552
00:35:56,243 --> 00:36:00,437
Well, I appointed her as custodian, so...

553
00:36:00,582 --> 00:36:02,339
I'll think of this as her salary.

554
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:03,573
Give me this one.

555
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:06,822
Mi Ho!

556
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:08,634
Oh! Woong!

557
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:14,088
Wow! You cleaned up everything really well!

558
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,107
Yep! I cleaned it all!

559
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:17,192
Good job!

560
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:19,486
What is all this?

561
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,002
I had some stuff I needed so
I just bought this and that.

562
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,106
There's something for you as well.

563
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:27,085
Really? What is it?

564
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:30,109
When you see it, you'll really be surprised.

565
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:34,575
Oh? What's this?

566
00:36:34,657 --> 00:36:35,265
Is it a book?

567
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:36,311
Yeah.

568
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:39,145
Whoa, you're reading books now?

569
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:40,301
<i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

570
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:42,581
Dong Ju teacher gave it to me as a gift.

571
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:43,983
Dong Ju teacher?

572
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:46,931
When I asked about movies
with non-human characters,

573
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:48,100
he said they appear in books too.

574
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:49,445
And gave it to me to read.

575
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:51,756
Do you know this story too?

576
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:55,525
I know Batman, Superman, Spiderman.

577
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:57,840
Only these stories with the word "man".

578
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,838
Heh! You don't know this story huh?!

579
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:03,951
I'm saying it's not my taste!

580
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:06,481
But, what's mine?

581
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:07,677
<i>What'd you buy?</i>

582
00:37:07,786 --> 00:37:08,586
Meat.

583
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:11,347
Right here, I bought meat.

584
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,384
Wow! There's a lot of meat!

585
00:37:18,418 --> 00:37:19,990
It'll be delicious, eat it well.

586
00:37:35,157 --> 00:37:37,839
I should've just taken the belt.

587
00:38:05,554 --> 00:38:09,305
I used it very usefully.

588
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,841
I tried my best to get it off,
but there's some residue left.

589
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:34,135
Well then, we're done here
so I'll be on my way.

590
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,597
I'm really going.

591
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:46,239
Oh my!

592
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,581
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?!

593
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:52,483
Every time I meet him I cause accidents!

594
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:53,947
I always cause a scene!

595
00:38:54,088 --> 00:38:57,486
Even to the last moment! What is this?!

596
00:39:00,682 --> 00:39:05,379
Since you're all wet, cover it
with this and go.

597
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:07,388
Well then...

598
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,358
You seem...

599
00:39:09,823 --> 00:39:12,803
to have gotten hurt a lot.

600
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,144
You said you really liked
the smell of Icy Hot.

601
00:39:16,238 --> 00:39:20,242
So I put on all the ones I had and came.

602
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:25,163
I'm so bad at talking
in front of women so...

603
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:28,565
I'm sorry.

604
00:39:35,737 --> 00:39:38,987
Let's talk about it.

605
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:42,399
I'll listen to everything.

606
00:40:11,353 --> 00:40:13,516
Mi Ho! Let's eat!

607
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:35,575
For today, it's the best,
prime Korean beef steak!

608
00:40:35,673 --> 00:40:36,919
Wah! It looks delicious!

609
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:38,234
The more I stay with you,

610
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:41,503
the more I seem to become a meat-lover.

611
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:46,783
What's wrong?

612
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:49,104
Have you seen my book around here?

613
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:50,379
Book?

614
00:40:53,314 --> 00:40:54,082
Is this it?

615
00:40:54,187 --> 00:40:55,825
Oh no! My book!

616
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:57,559
Oh! It was your book!

617
00:40:57,695 --> 00:41:00,118
I was in a hurry so I used it as a hot pad.

618
00:41:00,428 --> 00:41:01,914
<i>Oh no! It melted!</i>

619
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:04,546
What to do? The book's trashed.

620
00:41:04,938 --> 00:41:09,258
No. There's a pretty circle
design on it now.

621
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:12,349
And the book smells like meat!

622
00:41:12,454 --> 00:41:14,327
Yay! I'm happy!

623
00:41:15,328 --> 00:41:16,884
That's good then.

624
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:20,571
Should we just keep using it
as a meat plate then?!

625
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,879
So it'll smell more?!

626
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:23,799
Should we?

627
00:41:24,845 --> 00:41:25,963
Forget it.

628
00:41:26,248 --> 00:41:28,149
Just eat the meat.

629
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,773
Eat as much as you want, I bought a lot.

630
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:34,926
I ate a lot at lunch too.

631
00:41:35,172 --> 00:41:36,281
At Dong Ju teacher's place?

632
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,515
Yep! Steaks exactly like this...

633
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:40,574
I ate three of them.

634
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:42,778
Oh really?

635
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:45,764
Hey, from now on all the stuff you need,

636
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:48,091
why don't you get it at
Dong Ju teacher's place?

637
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,758
I'm going to get busier and busier.

638
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:51,868
Instead of following me around,

639
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:54,720
get closer to Dong Ju teacher!

640
00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:56,532
Just be regular friends with me,

641
00:41:56,637 --> 00:41:59,109
and go be be-pu with Dong Ju teacher.

642
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:00,634
I can't do that!

643
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:03,068
I'm closer to you, Dae Woong.

644
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:06,377
Why?

645
00:42:06,535 --> 00:42:09,291
That Dong Ju teacher buys you
more expensive meat.

646
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:12,335
Hmm... how should I explain this?

647
00:42:12,523 --> 00:42:14,112
If I were to compare...

648
00:42:14,454 --> 00:42:16,723
If Dong Ju teacher is just meat,

649
00:42:16,921 --> 00:42:19,880
Dae Woong, you're beef!

650
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:23,535
Is that so?

651
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:27,916
I don't mind if I'm just poultry
or something like that...

652
00:42:28,008 --> 00:42:31,537
No! Dae Woong you're the best Korean Beef!

653
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:32,661
Really?

654
00:42:33,328 --> 00:42:38,898
Hey! The beef that I bought is really
the best prime Korean beef!

655
00:42:39,153 --> 00:42:42,628
Oh yeah! I bought something else for you
and forgot about it.

656
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:43,860
What is it?

657
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:46,174
It's inside oooover there.

658
00:42:46,268 --> 00:42:47,325
<i>Go check it out.</i>

659
00:42:54,423 --> 00:42:55,969
Dae Woong, what is it?!

660
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:57,605
Where is it?

661
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,592
<i>I like beef!</i>

662
00:42:59,736 --> 00:43:01,232
<i>Beef is the best!</i>

663
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:05,981
<i>I like beef! I like beef!</i>

664
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:08,719
<i>Wonderful taste, our beef!</i>

665
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:10,845
<i>I like beef</i>

666
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,081
<i>- Mi Ho!
- Dae Woong!</i>

667
00:43:14,278 --> 00:43:15,495
That cell phone

668
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:16,726
is yours.

669
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:18,040
Really?!

670
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:20,504
As you're the custodian,
I thought you would need it so

671
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:22,513
I bought you one.

672
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:24,872
You see the thing hanging next to it?

673
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:27,306
<i>This?</i>

674
00:43:27,384 --> 00:43:28,358
<i>Wah! It's a bead!</i>

675
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:30,117
It's so pretty!

676
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,222
Since you gave me a bead

677
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:34,654
I'm giving you a bead as well.

678
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:35,858
Do you like it?

679
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:39,100
Mi Ho?

680
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:40,464
Mi Ho?

681
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,089
Mi Ho!

682
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:46,406
Woong!

683
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:47,896
Do you like it or not?

684
00:43:48,104 --> 00:43:49,487
Woong!

685
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:56,428
Thank you so so so much!

686
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:58,456
You treat me like a person.

687
00:43:58,622 --> 00:44:00,587
And give me gifts you give to people!

688
00:44:00,727 --> 00:44:03,107
Thank you so so so much!

689
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:06,342
Oh... yeah.

690
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:08,943
Call me again!

691
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:12,971
But you're right in front of me...

692
00:44:13,075 --> 00:44:15,694
Then I'll go way over there
where you can't hear me.

693
00:44:15,804 --> 00:44:17,353
Try to call me!

694
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:31,627
Woong! I'll go that way!

695
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,438
What am I doing?

696
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:46,292
If my heart's beating faster because
a gumiho said I'm prime beef then

697
00:44:46,538 --> 00:44:48,832
I must be going crazy.

698
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:54,713
I really need to pull myself together.

699
00:45:01,906 --> 00:45:03,607
When Cha Dae Woong's part got bigger,

700
00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:05,463
your part got bigger as well.

701
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,589
It worked out great.

702
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:12,191
How many scenes do I have to film
with Dae Woong?

703
00:45:12,422 --> 00:45:13,523
If you two do this well,

704
00:45:13,664 --> 00:45:16,809
then you guys will be noticed more
than the main characters.

705
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,267
<i>Since you guys are so close, I'm not even
worried about your onscreen connection.</i>

706
00:45:20,388 --> 00:45:22,575
I'm not even worried about it!

707
00:45:23,043 --> 00:45:24,124
That's true.

708
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:25,851
Here.

709
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:28,808
Jung Min Hyo, who's from our company,
is having a movie premier.

710
00:45:28,901 --> 00:45:31,162
These are the tickets. Go with him.

711
00:45:31,283 --> 00:45:34,266
It's a similar genre so watching it
will be helpful.

712
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,246
I'll bring it up to him.

713
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:40,972
Um... about his contract with our company...

714
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,751
<i>Can you talk to him about it again?</i>

715
00:45:42,828 --> 00:45:44,902
It's kind of difficult to bring it up,
being in the middle.

716
00:45:45,013 --> 00:45:47,463
You should talk to him yourself.

717
00:45:49,743 --> 00:45:51,348
"Man"

718
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,953
Aish, I can't get the tone right.

719
00:45:54,078 --> 00:45:54,858
Dae Woong!

720
00:45:55,346 --> 00:45:56,622
Isn't she really pretty?

721
00:45:56,735 --> 00:45:59,465
So what if she's pretty? She's got a tail.

722
00:46:00,084 --> 00:46:01,461
Hey, she's just like you!

723
00:46:01,602 --> 00:46:03,153
You got a tail, she's got a tail.

724
00:46:03,315 --> 00:46:05,431
I have nine of them!

725
00:46:05,822 --> 00:46:07,030
You win!

726
00:46:08,384 --> 00:46:10,539
She saved this guy.

727
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:12,203
<i>And she really likes him.</i>

728
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:15,124
But this guy doesn't really know.

729
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:17,757
She stuck to him after hiding her identity.

730
00:46:17,864 --> 00:46:20,754
She has her reasons,
that's why she can't tell him!

731
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:27,513
If... she told him she's
going to become a human,

732
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,370
would this guy be happy?

733
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:32,411
Probably not.

734
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,487
Oh, that all comes out in the end!

735
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:36,475
Don't tell me!

736
00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:38,486
I'm going to read it and find out myself!

737
00:46:39,203 --> 00:46:39,996
Sure, go ahead.

738
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:42,446
I really hope she becomes a human

739
00:46:42,835 --> 00:46:44,614
And becomes happy.

740
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:03,439
That's a tragedy...

741
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,582
She'll get depressed when she reads it.

742
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:35,713
Why the heck did he choose
this kind of depressing story?

743
00:48:53,846 --> 00:48:56,123
Whether she's going to die,

744
00:48:56,259 --> 00:48:59,378
or she's going to kill
the person she loves...

745
00:49:00,073 --> 00:49:02,162
The moment she has to choose is going to be

746
00:49:02,296 --> 00:49:04,438
the hardest for her.

747
00:49:21,383 --> 00:49:23,980
Oh? The book is torn!

748
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:27,859
It's a defective book!

749
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,420
You should've checked before you bought it.

750
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:32,580
This Dong Ju teacher is quite lacking.

751
00:49:32,713 --> 00:49:36,486
Ah! I have to read the ending!
What is this?!

752
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:38,723
There's nothing to it.
I'll just tell you the ending.

753
00:49:38,814 --> 00:49:40,233
No!

754
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,991
Everyone is happy and it ends!

755
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:51,175
It's also a movie, and
a really famous story.

756
00:49:51,845 --> 00:49:54,270
"Under the Sea..."

757
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,817
You don't know it right?

758
00:49:56,019 --> 00:49:56,954
There's a movie too?

759
00:49:57,114 --> 00:49:58,364
Yeah!

760
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:03,620
That mermaid becomes human, marries
the prince and gets rid of the villain!

761
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:05,987
And it ends while they're all happy.

762
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:10,563
Oh that's so good! That's so good...

763
00:50:11,769 --> 00:50:14,428
Next time, you want to watch
the movie version?

764
00:50:14,525 --> 00:50:16,394
Oh! I want to see it!

765
00:50:17,163 --> 00:50:21,433
You really have to watch movies
at a movie theater to get the full effect.

766
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:22,807
Movie theater?

767
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:26,065
Can I... go in there?

768
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:28,078
Why? You want to go?

769
00:50:28,164 --> 00:50:28,943
Yeah.

770
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:35,700
I'm really busy these days.

771
00:50:36,587 --> 00:50:39,109
If you say you really want to go then,

772
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,231
I want to take you but...

773
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,552
Since we brought it up,
should we just go today?

774
00:50:44,663 --> 00:50:45,977
Really?!

775
00:50:46,116 --> 00:50:49,205
Yeah! We'll both finish our work

776
00:50:49,357 --> 00:50:51,496
and at night, let's go watch a movie.

777
00:50:51,603 --> 00:50:52,632
I'll call you.

778
00:50:52,718 --> 00:50:53,818
OK! You have to call!

779
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:54,945
Then once again,

780
00:50:55,043 --> 00:50:56,411
Take good care of our action school.

781
00:50:56,926 --> 00:50:57,783
OK!

782
00:51:15,785 --> 00:51:17,560
I'm so glad.

783
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:22,386
Dae Woong bought it for me.

784
00:51:22,572 --> 00:51:24,386
I'll send you my business card.

785
00:51:28,564 --> 00:51:30,897
Wah! You can do stuff like this too?!

786
00:51:31,048 --> 00:51:34,287
He bought you the most
extravagant gift out there.

787
00:51:34,368 --> 00:51:36,673
Ah! Dae Woong did this for me.

788
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,605
I'm going to end up like her,
no matter what.

789
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:41,030
The book...

790
00:51:41,212 --> 00:51:42,716
Did you read it to the end?

791
00:51:43,606 --> 00:51:45,101
I couldn't read it all, but

792
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:48,241
Dae Woong told me that
they live happily ever after.

793
00:51:48,788 --> 00:51:50,473
He's thinking of you.

794
00:51:51,063 --> 00:51:53,997
Anyway, it'll be the first date
so good luck.

795
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,541
It's not a date.

796
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:58,173
We're going somewhere called movie theater.

797
00:51:58,553 --> 00:51:59,862
That's a date.

798
00:51:59,985 --> 00:52:01,777
A man and a woman going out to play.

799
00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:05,740
Usually they go to the movie theater.

800
00:52:06,646 --> 00:52:08,785
Ohhh! It's a date.

801
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,941
What am I supposed to do on a date?

802
00:52:12,021 --> 00:52:14,832
You won't be able to pay for the date.

803
00:52:14,951 --> 00:52:17,434
Nor do you know how to strike up
an interesting conversation.

804
00:52:17,557 --> 00:52:20,352
Or have a sense of humor
to make him laugh...

805
00:52:20,444 --> 00:52:21,932
Of course you don't.

806
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,809
Just go looking pretty,
that's all you can do.

807
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:27,747
Other than that! Nothing else?

808
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:32,319
Look for ways to make him happy.

809
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:35,532
Ways to make him happy? Like what?

810
00:52:36,512 --> 00:52:37,988
Do you want to eat meat?

811
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:38,940
Yes!

812
00:52:39,008 --> 00:52:40,717
These are ways to make someone happy.

813
00:52:41,383 --> 00:52:45,095
Ah! I should give him what he likes!

814
00:52:45,971 --> 00:52:47,156
Eat meat before you go.

815
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:49,449
I've prepared a lot today too.

816
00:52:54,491 --> 00:52:57,125
What does Dae Woong like?

817
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,089
Huh? The Chicken Ahjumma is crying!

818
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:03,973
Yah! You jerks!

819
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,797
If you ate the chicken,
you have to pay for it!

820
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,965
Pay me for my chicken!

821
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:11,758
Run away.

822
00:53:11,864 --> 00:53:13,016
Don't you know who we are?!

823
00:53:13,127 --> 00:53:14,983
I don't know you jerks!

824
00:53:15,172 --> 00:53:16,513
Give me my money!

825
00:53:17,122 --> 00:53:18,078
Hey!

826
00:53:18,247 --> 00:53:19,170
This ahjumma!

827
00:53:21,528 --> 00:53:22,431
Yah!

828
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:25,187
I'LL FRY YOU TO DEATH!

829
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:27,045
Aish! This ahjumma!

830
00:53:35,347 --> 00:53:36,781
Eyeballs!

831
00:53:36,888 --> 00:53:38,930
Ahjumma! Are you OK?

832
00:53:42,288 --> 00:53:46,296
Those jerks won't pay for my chicken.

833
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,078
What?! Won't pay for the chicken?!

834
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:50,350
Those jerks!

835
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,491
I'm the Head Chicken from the Chicken House.

836
00:53:56,574 --> 00:53:58,302
She's the Blue Eyeballs.

837
00:53:58,634 --> 00:54:01,326
You guys are all dead!

838
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,152
All dead!

839
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:09,939
I'm sorry.

840
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:11,869
Count it as you go.

841
00:54:19,888 --> 00:54:21,592
Ha ha. Oh! You worked hard,
so let's go to my store.

842
00:54:21,697 --> 00:54:22,507
I'll cook a chicken for you.

843
00:54:22,806 --> 00:54:25,570
No. I'm going on a date so I'm busy.

844
00:54:25,691 --> 00:54:26,959
Date?

845
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:29,034
You're going to go like that?

846
00:54:29,114 --> 00:54:29,957
Why?

847
00:54:30,453 --> 00:54:32,916
I'm going to go get my hair permed.

848
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,179
Should I take you with me and perm it too?

849
00:54:35,334 --> 00:54:36,508
Perm?

850
00:54:38,535 --> 00:54:39,423
Hey Byung Soo.

851
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:41,333
What's a good movie these days?

852
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,664
Mmm... Jung Min Hyo in a movie
called "Pung Wul Do"?

853
00:54:43,794 --> 00:54:45,241
I heard that one's really good.

854
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:49,695
I got some premier tickets,
you want to go too?

855
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:54,985
I'm going to go with Seon Nyeo.

856
00:54:55,722 --> 00:54:57,371
Hey, you and Mi Ho should
come watch with us.

857
00:54:57,541 --> 00:54:58,373
Here.

858
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,036
Hmm... "Pung Wol Do"?

859
00:55:10,365 --> 00:55:12,985
Aish! I can't really go with Dae Woong.

860
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,838
Should I just not go?

861
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:24,995
Did you find the place OK?

862
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:25,979
<I>Yeah.

863
00:55:28,223 --> 00:55:31,299
Are you sure you're in front of
the place that says "Mae Pyo Suh"?

864
00:55:31,406 --> 00:55:32,331
<i>Yeah.</i>

865
00:55:39,596 --> 00:55:40,873
She's not here...

866
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:56,970
Dae Woong!

867
00:55:59,201 --> 00:56:01,376
What are you doing?

868
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:02,905
Perm!

869
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,770
The Chicken Ahjumma did it for me.

870
00:56:07,641 --> 00:56:10,343
Your fashionista friend helped you out.

871
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:11,559
Yep.

872
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:17,504
Dae Woong, what do you like?

873
00:56:17,622 --> 00:56:22,123
What do you like the way I like meat,
sparkling water, and beer?

874
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:26,096
Why? So you can find out what I like
and get it for me again?

875
00:56:26,243 --> 00:56:27,030
Yeah!

876
00:56:28,638 --> 00:56:33,994
So... is it like the genie in the lamp?
Whatever I want just comes right out?

877
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:34,771
What's that?

878
00:56:34,881 --> 00:56:35,915
It's like this.

879
00:56:36,077 --> 00:56:41,135
You just rub it and money, cars,
and houses come out.

880
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:44,259
Oh! It's like the goblin's club*!
[*from a legend of goblins with magic clubs]

881
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,036
I can't do stuff like that though.

882
00:56:46,205 --> 00:56:51,478
If I had to meet a fantastical creature
I should've met him.

883
00:56:51,584 --> 00:56:52,374
Dae Woong...

884
00:56:52,473 --> 00:56:53,940
Even though I can't do stuff like that,

885
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,991
I still really want to give you
something you want.

886
00:56:57,085 --> 00:56:58,413
<i>Dae Woong.</i>

887
00:56:58,952 --> 00:56:59,752
Oh you're here!

888
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:01,358
Mi Ho! Long time no see!

889
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:03,445
Sit together, I'll go buy some soft drinks.

890
00:57:10,037 --> 00:57:12,355
You must have made an effort.

891
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:13,871
You're pretty too!

892
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:15,648
You must have made an effort.

893
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,254
You're a fashionista too.

894
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:19,248
Oh well, you know me...

895
00:57:20,542 --> 00:57:22,009
Oh! It's dad's bag.

896
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:24,475
This is pretty gross, but

897
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:27,314
if you wear it like this it looks okay.

898
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:29,387
Is this gross?

899
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:35,347
The cell phone chain is so pretty!

900
00:57:35,427 --> 00:57:36,349
It's a bead!

901
00:57:36,455 --> 00:57:37,706
Dae Woong gave it to me.

902
00:57:37,956 --> 00:57:39,496
Where did he buy it?

903
00:57:41,373 --> 00:57:42,824
It's the Little Mermaid!

904
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:44,118
Did you download this?

905
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,315
No, it's the book.

906
00:57:45,425 --> 00:57:46,692
Dae Woong did it for me.

907
00:57:46,968 --> 00:57:49,140
I am going to become like her.

908
00:57:50,058 --> 00:57:51,590
Like the Little Mermaid?

909
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:53,826
Then you're going to die?

910
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,813
She dies?

911
00:57:56,914 --> 00:57:58,279
Yeah. She dies.

912
00:57:58,670 --> 00:57:59,732
Right, Byung Soo?

913
00:57:59,949 --> 00:58:02,464
The Little Mermaid totally just dies right?

914
00:58:02,787 --> 00:58:04,208
I don't think she dies,

915
00:58:04,504 --> 00:58:07,794
I think she turns into something
and disappears.

916
00:58:07,925 --> 00:58:09,766
He said she becomes happy.

917
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:17,903
Where's Mi Ho?

918
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:18,768
Huh?

919
00:58:19,355 --> 00:58:20,670
She said she's going to buy some book,

920
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:22,504
so when I told her there's a
bookstore downstairs, she left.

921
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,131
Book?

922
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:34,944
You didn't read

923
00:58:35,055 --> 00:58:36,565
the ending.

924
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:52,153
Is the bookstore one level down?

925
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:17,595
Dae Woong, we have to film a movie together.

926
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,581
Let's not make it awkward.

927
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:22,997
I don't want to make you
uncomfortable either.

928
01:00:09,658 --> 01:00:10,721
<i>The mermaid</i>

929
01:00:10,844 --> 01:00:12,561
<i>watches the happy prince</i>

930
01:00:12,683 --> 01:00:15,138
<i>with the woman he loves</i>

931
01:00:15,335 --> 01:00:18,677
<i>and changes into a bubble.</i>

932
01:00:18,879 --> 01:00:20,201
<i>Then she drifts</i>

933
01:00:20,313 --> 01:00:22,795
<i>and disappears into the air.</i>

934
01:00:59,361 --> 01:01:02,073
Because I decided to give him what he likes,

935
01:01:02,213 --> 01:01:06,398
and make him happy, I need to stay here.

936
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:28,035
What are you doing?

937
01:01:28,174 --> 01:01:30,107
Why'd you just leave when you saw me?

938
01:01:30,823 --> 01:01:33,265
You lied to me right?

939
01:01:34,387 --> 01:01:36,785
She never ends up happy, right?

940
01:01:37,613 --> 01:01:39,288
She disappears right?

941
01:01:44,461 --> 01:01:46,081
She doesn't disappear.

942
01:01:47,021 --> 01:01:50,510
She really lives, happily ever after.

943
01:01:52,274 --> 01:01:54,279
Don't listen to anything else.

944
01:01:54,401 --> 01:01:57,344
What I'm saying is true so...

945
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:00,125
You just have to believe what I say.

952
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:36,344
OK, from now on 93 days!

953
01:02:36,435 --> 01:02:38,879
The time left for you to stay
is also 93 days!

954
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:40,506
After all this is colored in,

955
01:02:40,634 --> 01:02:42,077
where will I go?

956
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:44,964
Aren't you supposed to go back to
the Three Gods Grandmother?

957
01:02:45,108 --> 01:02:46,577
<i>Are you happy seeing that?</i>

958
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,148
You think you'll be happy if you got that?

959
01:02:48,294 --> 01:02:50,055
Why? You going to buy it for me?

960
01:02:50,205 --> 01:02:51,282
It looks like it'll be expensive.

961
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:52,842
It's hellishly expensive.

962
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:54,936
How would you buy that?

963
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,913
<i>He's not totally cured but...</i>

964
01:02:57,044 --> 01:02:59,268
<i>He's just enduring it for that Mi Ho girl?</i>

965
01:02:59,364 --> 01:03:01,235
You're not going to stop Mi Ho
but you're going to do what?!

966
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:03,466
She's pushing him to do it!

967
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,914
Mi Ho, you and me...

968
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,776
We're stopping here. There's nothing more.

969
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:09,707
<i>Should I...</i>

970
01:03:09,816 --> 01:03:12,301
<i>tell him that I'm going to become a human?</i>

971
01:03:12,408 --> 01:03:13,768
<i>Even if you become a human,</i>

972
01:03:13,911 --> 01:03:15,575
<i>You won't ever be able to stay
next to Cha Dae Woong.</i>

973
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:20,340
<i>The fact that I was worried about a girl
who would eat me alive...</i>

974
01:03:20,481 --> 01:03:21,998
really makes no sense.

975
01:03:22,153 --> 01:03:25,152
When she's like that...
Mi Ho seems like a person too.
