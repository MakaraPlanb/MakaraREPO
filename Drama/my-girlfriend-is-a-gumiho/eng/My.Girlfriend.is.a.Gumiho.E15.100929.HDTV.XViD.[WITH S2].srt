00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,270
It closed down.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,630
Looks like they left together
to a faraway palce...

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,250
Thank you.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,659
Oh, excuse me, Miss.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,760
You didn't fill out the name.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,770
My name is Park Sun Ju.

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,020
Miss Park Sun Ju!

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,990
Park Sun Ju...

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,860
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,900
She must've left
with Teacher Dong Ju.

13
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,040
How could she have been here?

14
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,019
Miss Park Sun Ju!

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,310
Wait.

16
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,120
You forgot the complimentary gift.

17
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,669
You're skin's so nice.
Would you mind trying one of our products,

18
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,280
and posting your picture on our website?

19
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,020
Was the name Park Sun Ju,
a very common name?

20
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:14,600
Mi Ho's probably living well
as Park Sun Ju, right?

21
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,620
You're early.

22
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,659
Good thing I came first and waited.

23
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,340
I walked around everywhere but it wasn't
very interesting so I came early.

24
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,039
Teacher Dong Ju,
you said that there was a lot to do today, right?

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,110
Yes. Afterwards, we have a lot of places to go
so eat a lot of delicious things.

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,510
You don't need my help with ordering now;
you can do it yourself, right?

27
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,370
Try ordering the dishes you want.

28
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,380
Teacher Dong Ju can pick. Anything's fine.

29
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,740
Looks like she didn't come here once.

30
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,700
She threw this away too.

31
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,680
That's good, she left behind everything.

32
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,720
Then she should be able
to stop at that state and live well.

33
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:56,719
<i>Shalalalala, while singing a song.</i>

34
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,370
<i>Calling my name again and again.</i>

35
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,829
<i>Shalalalala, you belong to me.</i>

36
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,309
It really suits you.

37
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,310
<i>Only looking at you beautifully.</i>

38
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,830
Teacher Dong Ju, they're not
putting on blush?

39
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,870
I don't get to wear the traditional headress?

40
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,259
Those are only used for
traditional weddings.

41
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,239
This wedding you'll wear a veil
and hold a bouquet of flowers.

42
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh really?

43
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,069
Then we won't be riding on a
flowered carriage either?

44
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,700
If you like those things, should we
change to a traditional wedding?

45
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,990
No. Wearing this is fine.

46
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,300
Anything's fine.

47
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,369
These are the designs you prepared.

48
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,010
Which one do you like? Pick one.

49
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,609
If you don't like any of them,
we can make a special order.

50
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,779
Teacher Dong Ju can pick one.

51
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,950
It doesn't matter which one I wear.

52
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,319
Really? It's okay if you wear any of these?

53
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,560
Yes, You should pick whichever one
you like.

54
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,890
The invitation cards are ready.

55
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,759
What are invitation cards?

56
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,380
It's an invitation for the people you want
to come and congratulate you at the wedding.

57
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,319
I don't have anyone I want to invite.

58
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,360
Don't you have Cha Dae Woong?

59
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,600
He just came back from China today.

60
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,840
- You know that too right?
- Yes.

61
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:51,279
This wedding is for Cha Dae Woong to see
that you're living well.

62
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,740
So you have to ask him to come
and show him.

63
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,030
If I don't appear in front of Dae Woong,

64
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,120
get married with someone else,
and then leave for somewhere far away,

65
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,980
he should assume that, like you,

66
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,819
I'm living well amongst other people, right?

67
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,660
<i>He probably would.</i>

68
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,969
He said if I stayed by Teacher Dong Ju's side
and lived as Park Sun Ju,

69
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,650
<i>he wouldn't feel bad about it anymore.</i>

70
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,390
That's right, help him lighten his remorse
for leaving you.

71
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,670
He can forget you faster, too.

72
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,169
<i>That way, you can quickly end
your attachment with him.</i>

73
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,950
No, you'll definitely be able to stop it.

74
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,350
You HAVE to.

75
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,930
This is the only way,
you'll be able to live.

76
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,680
Teacher Dong Ju.

77
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,609
Are you worried that my tail
will disappear again today?

78
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,900
Tonight, if death returns once more...

79
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,120
you'll only have one last chance
to live.

80
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,720
How are you feeling right now?

81
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,890
I don't know.

82
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,880
I feel like I've forgotten him...
but at times I don't.

83
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,980
Right now, where your heart lies...

84
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,390
we'll know when we see the results tonight.

85
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,350
Whether he remains in your heart
and your tail disappears

86
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,360
Or if he's no longer there
and you've stopped...

87
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,090
I can't ever stop.

88
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,570
<i>I will disappear.</i>

89
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,070
Good thing, I took out the bead that's
holding Dae Woong's life.

90
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,210
This won't disappear...

91
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,659
Ddoong Ja, you've been walking
with aunt everyday...

92
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,000
You're happy you came out with
oppa today, right?

93
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,470
My friend Mi Ho,

94
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,730
is a cute gumi-

95
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,460
Ddoong Ja, you're thirsty, right?

96
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,240
Let's go.

97
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,980
Ddoong Ja, wait here for me.

98
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,490
Wait. Wait.

99
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,140
You came out a bit later today.

100
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,690
I worried I wouln't be able to
see you today.

101
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,450
Looks like aunt was busy.

102
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,940
Ddoong Ja, I wish you were a fox.

103
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,120
That way we could communicate

104
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,940
and I could find out about Dae Woong.

105
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,870
Did you understand what I said?

106
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,359
I'm going to leave.

107
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,640
You should go back to aunt.

108
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,060
Ddoong Ja, bye.

109
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,900
Ddoong Ja!

110
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,060
Ddoong Ja!

111
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,770
What are you doing over here?

112
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,330
What are you eating?

113
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,910
Let's go home.

114
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,539
We have to go home.

115
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,270
Ddoong Ja, get up quickly.

116
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,319
Ddoong Ja, after we go home,
I'll give something good to eat.

117
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,540
Let's go.

118
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,410
Ddoong Ja!

119
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:50,540
<i>I love you,
words from the bottom of my heart.</i>

120
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:58,080
<i>I love you,
words which I would say a thousand times.</i>

121
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,200
You and her... a wedding?!

122
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,310
Give this to Cha Dae Woong for me.

123
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,500
Passing it through you will be better
than me giving it to him directly.

124
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,749
That Mi Ho...

125
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,940
No, now she's called Park Sun Ju, right?

126
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,620
She really gave up on Dae Woong?

127
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,659
Before she said she loved him to death
and stuck to his side...

128
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,449
How could she give up so fast
and leave him?

129
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,480
A person like you will never
be able to understand.

130
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,970
Even when you like someone, you
question and calculate.

131
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,890
When separating...

132
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,060
you have to find excuses
and ways to defend yourself.

133
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,430
<i>But there's also a type of love
that can leave out those processes.</i>

134
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,250
<i>In this type of love,
you give everything to the other person.</i>

135
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,410
<i>So without giving up everything,
you can't end it.</i>

136
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:12,320
Understanding, convincing, justification...

137
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,140
...these are all unnecessary.

138
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,320
I thought you left far away...

139
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,240
But you're still here.

140
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,660
I'm preparing to leave.

141
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,450
Teacher Dong Ju and I still have
a some things to do.

142
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,450
I see...

143
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,770
Do you want to drink this?

144
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,390
Isn't this what you like?

145
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,870
I don't like soda anymore.

146
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,500
Beyond this, there are so many fun
and amazing things in this world.

147
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,750
Looks like that you've been living well
with Teacher Dong Ju.

148
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,259
Then, have you given up
on becoming human and

149
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,550
are you living by Teacher Dong Ju's side
as a half human?

150
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,880
Yeah, I have to...

151
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,699
Because I'm among people
who don't know what I really am,

152
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,500
it's really comfortable and I like it.

153
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,930
And because I'm by Teacher Dong Ju's side,
who's just like me, I can get a lot of help.

154
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,740
I'm glad to hear that.

155
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,510
Right now, I really really really really
feel great.

156
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,689
Oh! Good.

157
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,700
I have something to give you.

158
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,280
Here, I thought I should give this to you.

159
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,300
What's this?

160
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,040
I figured you should know
I'm doing good,

161
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,240
so you won't feel bad for me.
That's why I'm giving you this.

162
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,880
By Teacher Dong Ju's side,

163
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,760
I'm doing very well as Park Sun Ju.

164
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,090
You're even giving me something like this.

165
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,750
Seems like you truly are doing well.

166
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,310
- But, there aren't many days left.
- Yeah.

167
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,440
You might be busy and have
a lot of things to do but...

168
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,990
I hope that you can take some time off for it.

169
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,740
Sure, I can take time off but...

170
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,390
I don't think I need to.

171
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,110
These cosmetics are for women.

172
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,759
[Cosmetics coupon]

173
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,400
Oh?! What's this?

174
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,649
You used to collect chicken coupons everyday...

175
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,600
Have you expanded to cosmetic coupons now?

176
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,299
You say you're living as Park Sun Ju,

177
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,760
but you're still acting like gumiho!

178
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,560
Where'd Ddoong Ja go?

179
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,820
- Ddoong Ja.
- Ddoong Ja!

180
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,690
Ddoong Ja!

181
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,610
Ddoong Ja?

182
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,309
She came back by herself and

183
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,790
just finished off her lunch.

184
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,949
Now she's getting ready for a nap.

185
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,600
Ddoong Ja!

186
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,519
Where'd she go?

187
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,720
It's good nothing happened.

188
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,109
Ok.

189
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm hanging up.

190
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,140
I can't find her anywhere.

191
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,080
Where did she go?

192
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:25,190
Even if aunt let go of the leash,
she never ran out of the park.

193
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,740
Ah!

194
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,339
Ddoong Ja really likes this so...

195
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,979
If she smells this,
she'll come right back.

196
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,539
Let's take this and look for her together.

197
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,440
Were you the one who gave Ddoong Ja
soemthing to eat?

198
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,699
Then because
you wanted to see Ddoong Ja...

199
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,620
did you come to the park by my house frequently?

200
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,740
Ddoong Ja and I are best friends,
remember?

201
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,270
Then trace Ddoong Ja by her scent.

202
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,510
Even though your tails have been reduced
by half, you still have that ability right?

203
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,109
Scent?

204
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,830
Unless.. are your abilities so reduced
that you can't even tell if Ddoong Ja...

205
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,949
is in this park or not?

206
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,069
No, it's because there are too many
other dogs, I get confused.

207
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,749
You didn't hear the conversation
between me and grandpa, right?

208
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,979
You weren't even that far away.

209
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,770
You weren't able to hear that?

210
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,859
A month ago, you could hear
everything, right?

211
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,299
It's because it's too loud here.

212
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,800
Your abilities are continuing
to disappear, right?!

213
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,939
Then, you still haven't...

214
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,939
No... I want to look like an ordinary person...

215
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,290
So I'm just hiding my abilities on purpose.

216
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,979
I don't want to stand out as gumiho.

217
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,790
I'm just trying hard to live as Park Sun Ju.

218
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,130
I'm leaving.

219
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,420
Tell me everything and then leave.

220
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,180
Let go. I'm going to leave.

221
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:07,220
You don't even have the strength to
shake me off anymore?!

222
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,580
You don't have to conceal your
gumiho abilities to me!

223
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,600
So if your abilities really haven't
disappeared,

224
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,060
then push me away forcefully
and try to get away.

225
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,240
I don't want to.
Other people are watching!

226
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,190
I'm not doing it.

227
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,780
If I push a man down, other people
will think that I'm a monster.

228
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,170
Just like you said I'm a monster.

229
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,210
How many tails do you have left?

230
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,250
Just like a month ago,
you still have four tails left, right?!

231
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,030
If you're curious, then see for yourself.

232
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,960
Take a look yourself and count them!

233
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,439
I can't see them right now.

234
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,699
I can only see them when the moon comes out.

235
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,830
Even with the moon, you probably
can't see them! You'd be too scared.

236
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,129
<i>Because you're so scared
you won't be able to run.</i>

237
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,340
I don't want to force you by my side again.

238
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,810
I won't ever show you.

239
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,690
I need to confirm how many
tails she has left.

240
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,470
I have to hang onto her until the moon
comes out...

241
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,710
and confirm it.

242
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,889
<i>As you can see, the schedule is full.</i>

243
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,629
<i>These days are needed for editing.</i>

244
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,200
In the following week there's a premiere
so it'll be difficult...

245
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,110
Ah, this day is free.

246
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,760
Miss Min Sook, let's get married
on this day.

247
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,409
Director.

248
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,479
You have to set the wedding date and
move your schedule around!

249
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,990
How can you just choose a day that
you're not filming for the wedding?

250
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,770
But marriage and work have equal importance.
What do you want me to do?

251
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,439
Also, after our passionate meeting
at the sauna,

252
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,350
we must think about our Gae Lan* who
occurred after we ate boiled eggs. [*Egg]

253
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,629
Our... Gae Lan.

254
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,989
If she knew about the secret
of our Gae Lan's birth,

255
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,630
my daughter, Seon Nyeo, would tear me
into shreds and eat them one by one.

256
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,279
Then again, we DO have to
get married quickly.

257
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,709
so we can say it was a premature birth...

258
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,570
But, even if it's for our precious Gae Lan,

259
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,869
I didn't receive a formal proposal.

260
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:54,330
And just getting married off this way
is too unjust.

261
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,560
<i>Miss Min Sook.</i>

262
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,670
This is my heart.

263
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,850
This? This is just coffee...

264
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,369
I really like coffee.

265
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,119
Whenever I'm tired, sleepy or lonely,
drinking a cup of coffee,

266
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,779
makes me feel the happiest.

267
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,229
But ever since meeting Miss Min Sook,

268
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,440
The amount of coffee I drink everyday
is a lot less.

269
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,320
Why?

270
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,220
Because I'm happy 24 hours a day.

271
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,080
Miss Min Sook filled up the empty void
in my heart,

272
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,800
with the coffee of love.

273
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,790
Director.

274
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,770
Miss Min Sook.

275
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:08,760
Please become my expectant, 24 hour,
love's automatic vending machine.

276
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,340
Okay.

277
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,390
I'll become your cafe of happiness.

278
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,840
Director is getting married with
Dae Woong's aunt right?

279
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,450
Seems like they're in a hurry.

280
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,710
Did they cause some trouble?

281
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,809
Back when we thought Dae Woong
and Mi Ho caused trouble,

282
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,229
the atmosphere was pretty good too.

283
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,669
Even though they seemed like they're
gonna break up everyday, it always worked out...

284
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,750
They'll probably get back together.

285
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,810
<i>I bet they won't...</i>

286
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,520
<i>What's this?</i>

287
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,920
Park Sun Ju is Mi Ho?

288
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,979
Park Dong Ju, that veterinarian?

289
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,059
The two of them are getting married?

290
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,490
That's right.

291
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,819
You guys give this to Dae Woong.

292
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,259
I tired so I don't want to get involved.

293
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,000
What's going on between the
three of them?

294
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,049
It's something unimaginable for you guys...

295
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,760
So it's better if you don't know.

296
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,450
If you knew, you'd get hurt.

297
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,350
What's so unimaginable?!

298
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,829
If he finds out that Mi Ho's getting married,
he'll probably be shocked.

299
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,759
Should we tell him or not?

300
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,620
What if Cha Dae Woong runs into the
wedding like a movie?

301
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,840
Movie?

302
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,540
NO!

303
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,370
<i>Hey, she said something unimaginable!</i>

304
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,920
NO!

305
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,380
<i>No, no. Dae Woong's not on that team!</i>

306
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,840
NO!

307
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,870
Hyung, Mi Ho.

308
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,660
The three of us are siblings.

309
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,510
Siblings?

310
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,500
We have to get revenge for our parents.

311
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,370
That doesn't even make sense!

312
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,389
Then Dae Woong is Park Dae Woong?

313
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,869
And who's the enemy?

314
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,199
Ah, really.

315
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,200
What's the "unimaginable" thing?!

316
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,190
Why are you following me?

317
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,170
I...

318
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,489
Buy me lunch.

319
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,639
What?

320
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,330
Buy me some meat.

321
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,349
While I was filming in China,

322
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,580
I didn't meat at all!

323
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,070
I really want to eat meat.

324
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,480
Especially cow. I want to eat cow.

325
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,350
Why do I have to buy meat for you?

326
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,829
We're nothing now.

327
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,220
That's right,

328
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,320
We don't even know each others names anymore...

329
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,610
If you haven't changed, you'd be sa*-miho
(*sa = 4).

330
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,770
But are you sam*-miho? Ee*-miho?
I don't know your last name. (*sam=3, *Ee=2)

331
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,940
Tell me clearly.

332
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,900
You...

333
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,710
How many-tailed-fox are you?

334
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,780
I'm...

335
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,750
My name is Park Sun Ju.

336
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,690
Okay then.

337
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,300
I'll just regard you as Park Sun Ju so...

338
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,010
Buy me some meat.

339
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,439
Buy me cow.

340
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,990
Until you buy me a cow,
I'll never leave.

341
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,719
The meat's gonna burn!

342
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,649
Leave it alone!

343
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,130
I like to cook meat until it's burnt.

344
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,089
Let's put all of them so
we can cook it faster.

345
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,179
<i>No.</i>

346
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,340
I'm going to savor each piece one-by-one
and barbecue them slowly.

347
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,979
Then you eat slowly. I'm leaving first.

348
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,149
I don't know how much more I'm gonna eat!

349
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,950
You have to wait and pay the bill
before you leave!

350
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,519
This is the only meal you've ever
bought for me.

351
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,249
Stingy! Leaving before paying for everything!

352
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,350
There's a lot here.

353
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,070
You call this is a lot?!

354
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,370
I wasn't gonna say this cause
I sound petty but...

355
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,849
If you took all the meat I bought
and built a tower out of it,

356
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:28,020
it may not be as tall as Namsam Tower,
but it's probably as tall as Dabotap or Seokgatap!

357
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,619
Fine.

358
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,790
Go ahead, eat your heart out.

359
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,070
They're all cooked.

360
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,819
They're cooked perfectly.

361
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,550
Here, eat it.

362
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,329
What's wrong?

363
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,839
You can't eat any more?

364
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,330
Should we go?

365
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,130
No, I can still eat for awhile.

366
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,970
Check please!

367
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,379
We finished eating!

368
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,449
Why're you following me again?!

369
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,190
I was gonna drink beef bone soup
to rinse my mouth...

370
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,580
Instead, you just threw me away and left
while I went to the bathroom!

371
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,860
I could've eaten for another hour.

372
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,860
Anyways, in the past, I mooched a lot off you.

373
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,430
I'm glad I was able treat you out.

374
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,200
Go.

375
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,900
I'm leaving too.

376
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,020
Mi Ho!

377
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,810
What now?

378
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,690
Since you're buying me food,
buy me this too.

379
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,059
I ate meat so I have to drink this!

380
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,559
I wasn't gonna say this,
cause I'll sound stingy but...

381
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,059
If we collect the soda I bought you,

382
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,069
it might not fill a swimming pool, but
it's more than enough to fill a bathtub.

383
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,570
Fine.

384
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,819
Since I mooched a lot of these from you,

385
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,420
after I buy this for you, I'm leaving.

386
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,150
Why isn't it coming out?

387
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,070
<i>It ate your coin!</i>

388
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,190
It really knows perfect timing.

389
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,390
There's no other choice.

390
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:16,490
Until someone comes to fix this machine,
we're gonna have to wait here.

391
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,359
There's a bench here
and the weather's nice...

392
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,800
It's perfect for waiting for someone.

393
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,690
Has your strength dwindled?

394
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,539
Before you could lift up
an entire vending machine.

395
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,479
Where did all of your strength go?

396
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,540
I just did that so I won't stand out.

397
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,610
Get the drink yourself.

398
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,759
Dad, pass this invitation to Dae Woong.

399
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,060
We're not confident enough to face
Dae Woong's shocked face.

400
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,069
I'll take care of it.

401
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,030
The two of you leave.

402
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:41,839
Between my real action dream and Mr. Cha,

403
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,650
a major historical drama of love
and betrayal has started.

404
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:58,400
No... it's a melodramatic movie...

405
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,850
Dae Woong, I'm pregnant.

406
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,459
What?

407
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,910
But I had a miscarriage.

408
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,140
What?

409
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,049
So let's break up.

410
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,360
What?

411
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,460
I'm getting married to another man.

412
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,830
What??

413
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,550
What? What? What?

414
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,780
I can't think of any other lines.

415
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,239
I'll just stick with action films.

416
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,430
Melodrama is not my genre.

417
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,420
What? What?

418
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,600
There's still a lot of time
before the moon rises.

419
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,890
Mi Ho, do you have any medicine on you?

420
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:15,199
Ah, you're a gumiho so you don't need any.

421
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,120
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

422
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:22,120
I think I'm getting indigestion from
the meat.

423
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,240
It's so painful that I can't move.

424
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,100
Does it hurt a lot?

425
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,589
Let's go to the hospital.
I'll take you there.

426
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,110
No, No. If I stay like this for a bit
I'll be fine.

427
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,960
Speaking of which, your bead
is very effective.

428
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,780
I feel a lot better
just by being beside the bead.

429
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,259
You can feel the bead beside you?

430
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,510
Yeah! Because the bead's by me,
it hurts a lot less.

431
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,970
So until I get better,
stay with me for a while.

432
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,970
You're lying about the pain, huh?

433
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,110
Of course not, I'm really in pain!

434
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,120
My hands are cold, I'm sweating,
and my face is pale.

435
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,770
It's really serious.

436
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,270
Your hands are warm...

437
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,990
...you're not sweating,
your face colour is fine too.

438
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,120
You're not sick at all.

439
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,240
Don't follow me anymore.

440
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,810
If you keep on following me, I'll scream.

441
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,170
And tell people that you're a stalker.

442
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,589
What? Stalker?

443
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:48,109
That's right, always following someone
who doesn't like them back,

444
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,730
that's a stalker, right?

445
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,460
Who said I was following you?

446
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,270
After the moon comes out
and I've seen your tails,

447
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,229
I won't follow you anymore.

448
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,260
Then you're a pervert.

449
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,319
What? Pervert?

450
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,099
Yeah! Going up to a girl in the
middle of the night,

451
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,279
And saying "Let me see. Just once, let me see"
You said that's a pervert!

452
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,090
Ah, also, you're a parasite.

453
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,859
What? Parasite?

454
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,059
Yes, you said that always staying
at other people's places,

455
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,279
scrounging food, water,
and money from them. That's a parasite.

456
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,360
That's what you did to me today.

457
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,530
If you don't want to become a pervert,
parasite, or a stalker

458
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,440
then stop following me.

459
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,740
Even if I become a parasite, pervert
or stalker, I still have to confirm it.

460
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,850
Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

461
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,650
Ahjusshi, stop the bus.

462
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,340
Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

463
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,570
Mi Ho!

464
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,310
You can't know my condition right now.

465
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:05,840
You have to think that I'm happy,
living somewhere far away.

466
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,680
The wedding invitation will be delivered
into Cha Dae Woong's hands tomorrow.

467
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,870
Yeah?

468
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,530
I don't know if he'll come to the wedding
and see for himself.

469
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,950
But he'll accept everything
that you've already sorted out,

470
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,980
and the fact that you'll
continue to live well.

471
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,700
Then he won't be worried about me
anymore, right?

472
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,520
This is the airplane ticket to Japan.

473
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,599
If we show him that we're leaving
to Japan right away,

474
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,940
he'll think you left happily,
the way you wanted it.

475
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,110
Teacher Dong Ju, I'm sorry.

476
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,500
Because of me, you've broken
your old routine.

477
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,570
Your old peaceful life has
become disorganized and noisy.

478
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,340
I said that I don't care.

479
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:26,600
As long as your feelings can stop...

480
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,510
As long as you continue to live...

481
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,990
I don't care about anything else.

482
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,730
I'm sorry.

483
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:42,750
I'm really, really sorry.

484
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:49,090
Today is the 88th day.

485
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,240
If the deaths haven't stopped,

486
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,830
then tonight, another tail will disappear.

487
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,000
Since Teacher Dong Ju is studying through books,

488
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,900
I'll watch the TV and study.

489
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,730
I'll study together with you.
What do you want to watch?

490
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,450
What's the most loudest thing?

491
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,870
Ah, something with singing and dancing.
Turn that on.

492
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,179
Teacher Dong Ju, I'm going to buy soda.

493
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,009
I'll go.

494
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,009
No, I'll go.

495
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,970
You watch the show. Don't turn it off.

496
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,510
If he knew that I took the bead out,

497
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,520
Teacher Dong Ju will so sad.

498
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,920
There's only one left.

499
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,230
What are you doing there?

500
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,880
I was looking in the mirror.

501
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:01,990
On my way out, my tail felt weird all of a sudden,
so I cam here.

502
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:16,030
Did it... disappear again?

503
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:23,580
Yeah, another tail disappeared.

504
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,650
Teacher Dong Ju,

505
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,819
it's time to let go of me.

506
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,280
No, I won't ever give up.

507
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,170
There's still one more left.

508
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,699
I'm going out for a bit.

509
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,250
Dae Woong.

510
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:57,450
Starting from today, follow your aunt,

511
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,109
and help prepare for the wedding.

512
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:04,159
I have something urgent so
I have to go out for a bit.

513
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,960
You punk!

514
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,710
So you want your aunt to go around
preparing for it, all by herself?!

515
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,909
What about the director?

516
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:19,240
He said that he's too busy
and can't help her.

517
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,470
Your aunt has grown horns THIS big.

518
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,289
How is old is she now?

519
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,520
She's finally getting married.

520
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:35,380
You should stay with her and help.

521
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:45,619
Aunt, after we book the hall in this hotel,
we're done right?

522
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:50,110
Yes! After we make the reservations, I'll let you go
so stop rushing me!

523
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,110
<i>October 9th has been reserved for you.</i>

524
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,499
You haven't seen a wedding hall yet, right?

525
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,170
Let's see it before we leave.

526
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,640
This way.

527
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,409
Since it's a weekday,
it's available for reservation.

528
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:31,879
That's great.

529
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,220
Then I'll book it for you immediately.

530
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,590
The name of your son
who's about to get married is...

531
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,919
He's not getting married, I am.

532
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,070
Oh, right.

533
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,810
Because there won't be many guests,
I reserved the smaller one.

534
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,560
Do you like it?

535
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,919
<i>This one is simple and nice.</i>

536
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,059
Ah yes. How about this?

537
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,680
Oh, this one's really good.

538
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,060
Because it's autumn,
there's a lot of weddings.

539
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,440
Park Sun Ju, Park Dong Ju?

540
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,950
There's another Park Sun Ju...

541
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,050
But the groom is Park Dong Ju?!

542
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,680
Why does it have to be Park Sun Ju
and Park Dong Ju getting married?

543
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:43,429
Then let's go look at the hall first.

544
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,420
- Okay.
- This way.

545
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,680
Should we go now?

546
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,360
This way.

547
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,140
Aunt, let me take this call. Go ahead.

548
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,240
Byung Soo, I'm out with aunt right now.

549
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,020
Am I ok?
About what?

550
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,880
Don't I know yet?
What are you talking about?

551
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,940
Bride, groom, the waiting room is over here.

552
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,030
I really couldn't have imagined this.

553
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:55,380
But it seems like you're really doing
perfectly fine.

554
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,550
I didn't know at all.

555
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,100
I was going to give this to you
when we met yesterday...

556
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:11,350
Here, we're leaving right after
the wedding ceremony.

557
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,060
We're busy today so I have to go.

558
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,560
See you at the wedding ceremony.

559
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:28,200
Do you think I'll go?

560
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,660
If you're not going to come,
then let's say goodbye here.

561
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,190
We'll probably never see each other again.

562
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:44,050
Yeah. Let's never see each other again.

563
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,100
Goodbye.

564
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,020
That's good.

565
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,050
Now I can be at ease.

566
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,519
When I saw them...

567
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,439
It seemed like that it wasn't Dae Woong
who dumped Mi Ho...

568
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,099
he was the one who got dumped.

569
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,740
What's wrong with our Dae Woong?

570
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,980
Since he's young, he'll get over it soon.

571
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:09,990
At that age you dump
and get dumped by love.

572
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,270
Oh yea...
Min Sook,

573
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,829
The first time that you were
dumped by a man...

574
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,270
was at Dae Woong's age right?

575
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,110
Every time that I got dumped,

576
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,410
I received a lot of comfort from Dae Woong.

577
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,630
Auntie, kiss.

578
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,359
Aunt, if you can't get married,
when I grow up, I'll marry you.

579
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,280
Dae Woong.

580
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,609
Who's this punk?!

581
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,319
Who dumped Aunt?

582
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,329
He's DEAD!

583
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:33,230
Dae Woong. Dae Woong, don't be like this.

584
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,520
Don't be like this.

585
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:47,020
This time, I should be the one
who comforts Dae Woong.

586
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,659
So this time...

587
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,190
Aunt, I'm hungry. Make some food for me.

588
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,790
- Food?
- Food?

589
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,739
Eat a lot.

590
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,210
Grandpa, you eat some too.

591
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,409
It's the egg rolls that you like.
Eat.

592
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:10,349
Aunt, after you get married, I won't be able
to eat your delicious egg rolls anymore.

593
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:12,769
I'll come back often.

594
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:16,490
If there's something you want to eat,
call me any time.

595
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:21,040
Right, what do you want for your
wedding gift?

596
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,209
Forget it.

597
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,290
You probably don't even have the energy
to get me a wedding gift right now.

598
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:30,290
Just say it; I'll buy it for you.

599
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,760
Should I make some meat for you?

600
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:45,220
I ate so much meat yesterday,

601
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,940
I probably don't need to eat meat
for a while.

602
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:59,340
There's a small mountain behind here.
They say it's really beautiful in the fall.

603
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,260
- Aigoo.
- There's more here.

604
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,920
Sit.

605
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,490
You're Seon Nyeo*, right?
[*Fairy]

606
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,930
Yes.

607
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,830
She's my friend, Grandpa.

608
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:27,350
Like a fairy, you're so graceful
and pretty.

609
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:34,490
Director.

610
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,100
Do you want another cup of coffee?

611
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,320
You're giving me goosebumps.

612
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,649
I don't know what's going on,
but you should let it go.

613
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,260
Anyways,

614
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:04,760
the director went to clean up the action school
attic room where you used to stay.

615
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,020
I'll throw away everything in there
for you.

616
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,620
This woman was the stand-in
for unni in China?

617
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,510
Yeah.

618
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,540
Obviously she wasn't as good as Mi Ho.

619
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:23,869
You hated Mi Ho but...

620
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,630
You still miss her, right?

621
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,400
She could've left
after I finished filming my parts.

622
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:34,030
Oh! Isn't this Mi Ho?

623
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,810
What?

624
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,940
Why would she be there?

625
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,610
I'm right! Look at the long hair.

626
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,410
Is it?

627
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,379
It probably isn't.

628
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,869
She decided to get married to Park Dong Ju.

629
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,630
Why would she be there?

630
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,930
"Stalker, pervert and parasite,"

631
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,180
I learned these words from following you.

632
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,629
You can't be here!

633
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:18,999
Leave, leave, stalker. Stalker.

634
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,580
Stalker?

635
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,409
What are you trying to look at?!

636
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,590
You can't, you pervert. Pervert.

637
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,760
Pervert? Pervert...

638
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,610
You're a parasite.

639
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,280
Parasite?

640
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,899
You followed him all the way there...

641
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,530
Good thing you didn't get discovered
by Cha Dae Woong.

642
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,330
Just watching him from afar...

643
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:21,930
was so hard.

644
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,000
In the old photo album I had,

645
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,960
I only filled it with good memories...

646
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:35,770
Tomorrow we're going to hold
the wedding ceremony.

647
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,459
I know.

648
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,339
It was me who wanted to.

649
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:43,279
I know that we're only doing this
to get rid of Cha Dae Woong but,

650
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,050
I still hope,

651
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,650
that your heart
can be sorted out as well.

652
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:55,079
I left something at the attic.

653
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,840
I have to go get it.

654
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,540
Just leave it.

655
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,800
We're going to go far away.

656
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:09,160
When we leave, leave everything here,

657
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,680
including everything in your heart.

658
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,780
Right now your life
hasn't entirely disappeared yet.

659
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,010
There's still a chance.

660
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,740
No matter what kind of life
you want to live,

661
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,360
I can create it for you.

662
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,350
So...

663
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:34,850
everything that's here...
throw it away.

664
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,970
I'll only bring the things
I absolutely need.

665
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,230
I'll be right back.

666
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,729
To me, it really looks like Mi Ho.

667
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:52,929
Isn't it?

668
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,339
Even if it is, let's say it's not.

669
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,669
If Dae Woong see's this,
he'll get really upset so

670
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,730
Destroy it.
Destroy, destroy it.

671
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:01,339
What is it?

672
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,290
- Dae Woong.
- What's gonna make me so upset?

673
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:08,880
It's Mi Ho.

674
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:14,699
See, if Cha Dae Woong can recognize her
at once, it's gotta be her.

675
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,759
She doesn't look like Mi Ho to me.

676
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,079
<i>All the girls we saw in China
had long hair.</i>

677
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,350
<i>I think it IS her!
Their faces are similar!</i>

678
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,630
Yeah! It's probably not Mi Ho.

679
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:33,690
She had no reason to go there.

680
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:38,070
That's right! The wedding's tomorrow,
why would she go to China...

681
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,560
It's here.

682
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,590
I just need to take this.

683
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,009
Drumstick!

684
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,989
Woong! That's really a big piece of meat!

685
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:05,370
Mi Ho, catch the meat.

686
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,520
I can't leave this here either.

687
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:17,020
I'll just take this too.

688
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,350
I can't throw this away either.

689
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,690
It's really awesome right?

690
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,129
You really surprised me.

691
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,539
Dae Woong, it's really great right?

692
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,050
Really awesome right?

693
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,220
Yes, it's really awesome.

694
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,260
If I continue like this,
I won't be able to throw away anything.

695
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,470
We stopped here.

696
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,380
Now it's up to here.

697
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,380
Who left the lights on?

698
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,140
It's Dae Woong.

699
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,650
What do I do?

700
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,660
Where's the thing that was here?

701
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,620
Did someone clean it up already?

702
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,690
I'm sure the album was here...

703
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,800
Why are you here?

704
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,640
I needed to find something.

705
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,999
You came to find this?

706
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,580
It has nothing to do with you.
That's mine.

707
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:15,720
Forget it, I'll just leave.

708
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:21,940
Did you follow me to China?

709
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,250
Am I right?

710
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,239
No.

711
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,850
I definitely didn't.

712
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:30,620
Let go.

713
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,820
What condition are you in right now?

714
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,820
The moon's up so show me your tails!

715
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:42,030
You... your strength is disappearing,

716
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,099
and your tails are disappearing too, right?

717
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,320
It has nothing to do with you!
Let go!

718
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:05,430
Mi Ho. Mi Ho!

719
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,200
Mi Ho, wait for me! Mi Ho!

720
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,330
Stop running away!

721
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:27,520
Why are you running away?
Why are you hiding your tails from me?!

722
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,660
You...

723
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:35,860
haven't stopped, right?

724
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:41,040
Your tails are still disappearing right?!

725
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,460
My condition...

726
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,360
do you HAVE to know?

727
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:55,780
Yeah! I have to know.

728
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:58,840
Show me.

729
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,050
Then, open your eyes wide and look at me...

730
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,620
See how I am right now...

731
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,590
See how I feel right now...

732
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:52,340
I... couldn't stop.

733
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,300
Then you're...

734
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,540
still dying?

735
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:04,930
I will...

736
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,420
disappear.

<i>Raise my level of popularity

752
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,569
So I can be elected
as a member of the national party?

753
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:54,150
<i>Member of the National Party,
Didn't you know?</i>

<i>I became a prosecutor just to

<i>We deal with political affairs.</i>

756
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,959
Then it's to be like those trash-like guys
who clean up messes?

<i>Did my father deal with political affairs

758

761

for becoming the President]
