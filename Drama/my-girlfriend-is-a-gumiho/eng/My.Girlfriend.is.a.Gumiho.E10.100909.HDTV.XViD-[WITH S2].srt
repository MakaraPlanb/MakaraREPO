00:00:06,742 --> 00:00:07,874
Is it Mi Ho?

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,175
Why are you calling?

5
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:11,074
Where are you?

6
00:00:11,197 --> 00:00:13,510
When are you coming back?

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,460
I want to see you.

8
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:18,161
<i>Can you come back earlier today?</i>

9
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:21,559
Well, I don't miss you that much.

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,612
And I never thought of going back earlier.

11
00:00:23,713 --> 00:00:24,934
What's wrong?

12
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,351
Looks like you really don't miss me.

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,445
That's very fortunate.

14
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:33,467
Mi Ho, actually I...

15
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:34,612
<i>Woong.</i>

16
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:36,875
I have something to say to you.

17
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,396
Even if I'm not scaring you,

18
00:00:41,497 --> 00:00:44,097
you will still protect my bead, right?

19
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:45,498
Yes.

20
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:47,532
Even if you don't need it,

21
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,233
you will protect it, right?

22
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:51,877
Yes.

23
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:53,878
You still don't trust me?

24
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>I trust you.</i>

25
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,577
So,

26
00:00:57,678 --> 00:00:59,278
even if I'm not by your side,

27
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,779
you still have to protect the bead well.

28
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:03,248
What?

29
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:05,037
<i>Dae Woong.</i>

30
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:11,205
I think I'm going to have to
disappear from your side

31
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:13,970
<i>In the future,</i>

32
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,371
I'll definitely find you
and ask for my bead.

33
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:18,674
<i>You have to wait for me until then.</i>

34
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,561
Don't come back!

35
00:01:22,423 --> 00:01:25,893
Because I said that I don't miss you,
you're showing your strength?

36
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:28,138
Last time you disappeared without a word.

37
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,654
This time you want to
disappear after a call?

38
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:35,143
If you dare, then just disappear
like this and see.

39
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:39,273
Where are you right now?

40
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:40,574
<i>Oh...</i>

41
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:44,434
The hospital.

42
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:49,079
You even followed me to the hospital
where I had my checkup?

43
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:51,998
If you're like that, then where
do you want to disappear to?

44
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:53,070
Don't move! Wait for me!

45
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:54,231
I'm going to find you.

46
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:07,083
I have to disappear.

47
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,923
Otherwise The Hater will
force me to get a checkup.

48
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:12,244
And will also spread strange rumors.

49
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:14,488
What should I do?

50
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:16,576
I have to disappear.

51
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,738
I can't cry.

52
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,861
If I cry, it'll start to rain.

53
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:40,868
In the future, when I've become human,

54
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:44,043
and when I can get a checkup normally,

55
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,994
I can go back to Dae Woong's side again.

56
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:55,385
I don't want to disappear.

57
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:57,886
Don't want to disappear.

58
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:09,772
<i>Mi Ho!</i>

59
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,673
Turns out you were here.

60
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,845
Did Dae Woong get his check-up?
Is he all right?

61
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:19,636
Dae Woong will be fine.

62
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:21,754
You didn't see Dae Woong?

63
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,005
Then did you see Hae In unni?

64
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:23,649
Yes.

65
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,158
<i>That's really strange.</i>

66
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,642
She made us come with you.

67
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:29,272
Unless she's playing tricks on us.

68
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:31,763
Mi Ho, we were just about to go eat.
Let's go together.

69
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:34,513
Since you're not in a very good mood,
let's eat barbecue meat.

70
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,813
Meat?

71
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:38,557
Let's go, it's my treat.

72
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:39,880
<i>Let's go.</i>

73
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,213
I have to disappear.

74
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:44,345
Let's go, to eat barbecue meat!

75
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:45,834
Let's go.

76
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:12,674
Mi Ho, why are you eating so fast?

77
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:15,248
I have to disappear right
away after I eat meat.

78
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:29,939
Where are you?

79
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:31,117
The barbecue meat shop.

80
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:32,483
What?

81
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:35,265
Weren't you going to disappear?
Why did you start eating barbecue meat?

82
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,244
Where is the barbecue meat shop?

83
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:40,585
Is it Dae Woong?

84
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:42,876
Are you eating together with Byung Soo?

85
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:56,125
<i>I have to disappear.</i>

86
00:04:56,221 --> 00:04:58,812
The two of you, take care.

87
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:02,113
What?

88
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,560
Where should I disappear to?

89
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:09,624
I just had a fight with Teacher Dong Ju.
I don't want to go find him.

90
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:12,864
Where should I go?

91
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:18,827
<i>Oh, it's Mi Ho.</i>

92
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:20,459
It's Grandpa.

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,800
You came to the hospital, too?

94
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:24,846
<i>Really?</i>

95
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:27,234
I misunderstood you.
I apologize.

96
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,198
<i>Don't take it to heart.</i>

97
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,329
<i>Come to my house.
Have a talk with the family members.</i>

98
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,841
I have to disappear.

99
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:37,426
Come here.

100
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:49,347
Mi Ho said that she had to
disappear and she left.

101
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:50,524
Make her stay!

102
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,425
Why did you guys only
care about eating meat?

103
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:56,125
Hey! All the meat here
has been eaten by her!

104
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:17,621
Thanks for believing in Dae
Woong and accompanying him.

105
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:18,769
<i>You're truly amazing.</i>

106
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,678
<i>Eat lots.</i>

107
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:24,666
You sure can eat a lot.

108
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:29,428
Min Sook, bring over the
Korean beef tenderloin.

109
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,629
[Dae Woong]

110
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:37,990
<i>It's Dae Woong, right?</i>

111
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,791
Pick up.

112
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:42,398
Dae Woong doesn't like
that you're not going back.

113
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,039
He's calling for you to hurry up.

114
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,230
Min Sook, pack some kimchi.

115
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:52,406
<i>And also some other side dishes
for her to take along.</i>

116
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:56,873
Take it back and eat it with Dae Woong.

117
00:06:56,972 --> 00:06:58,818
Wait a minute.

118
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:02,018
There should be other things
for you to bring, too.

119
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:09,140
I have to disappear.

120
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,023
She's not picking up her phone.

121
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,133
She saw Hae In unni today, is
she feeling uncomfortable?

122
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:18,701
How could Mi Ho have seen Hae In noona?

123
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:21,776
Didn't Hae In noona's dad
give you your check-up?

124
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,616
That hospital belongs to Hae In noona's dad?

125
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:27,537
Hae In unni told us to bring Mi Ho there
while you were getting your check-up.

126
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:29,542
She said she'd take us out to eat.

127
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:31,366
<i>But she wasn't even picking up her phone.</i>

128
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:32,991
<i>Turns out that we've been fooled.</i>

129
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:35,825
<i>We saw that Mi Ho's expression
didn't look too good.</i>

130
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,167
Could it be that when she was with
Hae In noona, she became unhappy?

131
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,845
It's possible that she was
fooled as well.

132
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:49,076
Once I've taken this back,
I have to disappear.

133
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:52,140
<i>Big eyes!</i>

134
00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:53,723
Ahjumma.

135
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:57,038
Why do you look so unenergetic?

136
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,039
This, this!

137
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,085
Do you want me to buy this for you to drink?

138
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:07,838
Ahjumma. Goodbye.

139
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:15,346
Why does she look so unenergetic?

140
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:19,426
Before she was always really energetic,
and she even helped me make deliveries.

141
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:31,653
Right now, I don't have any other excuse.

142
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:37,140
Do I really have to disappear?

143
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:39,180
<i>Isn't she a monster?</i>

144
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:42,340
<i>So I made her disappear.</i>

145
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:45,556
I thought it was a bit strange.

146
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,231
Because of a girl who suddenly appeared,

147
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,132
you started to drift away from me.

148
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:51,417
An injury that can only fully recover
in at least three to four months,

149
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:53,518
she healed in a couple of days.

150
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,941
<i>I can't understand.</i>

151
00:08:57,015 --> 00:09:01,041
Afterward, I also saw this.

152
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:02,997
<i>The video camera filmed it.</i>

153
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:05,441
<i>This is footage that I cut off.</i>

154
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:06,737
This is...

155
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,226
She's... not a human, right?

156
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,423
<i>I'm correct, right?</i>

157
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:18,246
So did you tell her to disappear?

158
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,337
I originally wanted to find out
her true identity at the hospital.

159
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:26,699
But she said that if I let her go,
she'll disappear by herself.

160
00:09:26,795 --> 00:09:29,486
She was a little scary,
and I was also hesitant.

161
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:30,891
I really couldn't continue talking with her.

162
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:33,054
She said that she'll disappear by herself?

163
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:34,950
That's right.

164
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,366
A monster that scary.

165
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:40,303
She's finally disappearing from your side.

166
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,104
<i>It's really fortunate.</i>

167
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:46,037
Mi Ho's not scary at all,
and she's not a monster.

168
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:46,648
What?

169
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,936
Also, unless Mi Ho deliberately
wanted to break up,

170
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:54,027
she definitely wouldn't leave me.

171
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,704
I don't want to disappear.

172
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:06,518
I really don't want to disappear.

173
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:11,528
Woong!

174
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:16,370
I don't want to leave!

175
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,741
I don't want to leave!

176
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,467
I never wanted to chase her away.

177
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:27,480
You don't have to be troubled by it.

178
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:29,760
What is she exactly?

179
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:31,961
You don't have to mind that, either.

180
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,098
Just pretend that nothing has changed.

181
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:35,875
What's with you now?

182
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:38,988
A thing that dangerous and you're leaving
and don't care?

183
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,203
Have you gone crazy?

184
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:41,420
That's right.

185
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:45,221
Because of that I'm really
about to go crazy!

186
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:47,825
So, don't you mind it.

187
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:16,178
[Dae Woong]

188
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,051
It was sunny a while ago, why did
it start to rain so heavily?

189
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,030
I'm begging you, pick up the phone.

190
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,794
Woong.

191
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:50,069
Mi Ho, you're crying right now, right?

192
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,849
Yes.

193
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,733
It's raining so heavily.

194
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:56,317
I didn't even bring an umbrella.

195
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:57,418
Can you stop crying?

196
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:58,629
But...

197
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,430
I can't stop my tears.
I can't do anything about it.

198
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:04,320
I don't want to get drenched in the rain.

199
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:07,309
I can only go back if you stop crying.

200
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:15,482
If I want you to stop crying,
I only have this tactic left.

201
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:18,181
Mi Ho.

202
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:24,599
I... miss you.

203
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:28,515
What?

204
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:31,632
I really miss you.

205
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:32,909
I will go there right away.

206
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,310
Don't cry anymore.

207
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,889
<i>The rain's stopping.</i>

208
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:58,587
<i>These are the things that you wanted.</i>

209
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:07,892
With the identity of 23-year old
Park Sun Ju,

210
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:10,360
<i>I created a passport and birth certificate.</i>

211
00:13:10,694 --> 00:13:13,664
<i>Park Sun Ju, driver's licence.</i>

212
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,394
<i>Elementary school, middle school,
high school graduation certificate,</i>

213
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,095
<i>and also a university diploma.</i>

214
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:20,755
<i>It's all been completely prepared.</i>

215
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,131
Very good.

216
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,089
In the suburbs of Tokyo, Japan,

217
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,256
I want to buy a house under her name.

218
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:29,684
<i>It has to be quiet around there.</i>

219
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:34,624
It's best if there's can be a spacious
courtyard where you can barbecue meat.

220
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:37,186
How much time can you give me?

221
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,957
I'll give you three month's time.

222
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:41,225
After three months,

223
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:48,026
there will be a girl called Park Sun Ju
who will arrive in Japan.

224
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,767
I even heard him say that he missed me.

225
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:54,851
I definitely can't disappear.

226
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:59,701
No matter what, I have to
finish off that woman.

227
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:08,424
<i>At any rate, I still have to
make her receive a check-up.</i>

228
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,334
Saying that she's a monster
just by using this...

229
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,693
It'll probably only make people
think that I've gone crazy.

230
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,637
<i>Miss Hae In.</i>

231
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:31,252
That girl, is she interested in my movie?

232
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:34,084
Director, if the action movie
meets the standards,

233
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:36,513
will you really start using new
people for the main roles?

234
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:38,206
Yes.

235
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:42,590
If it's like that, then please
give me an opportunity.

236
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:43,554
I have confidence.

237
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:48,344
No doubt, Miss Eun Hae In's
acting is pretty good.

238
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,418
<i>But I already abandoned selected
stars who took on the role.</i>

239
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,490
I really want to produce real action.

240
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,093
Miss Eun Hae In has not
reached that stage yet.

241
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:04,217
Regardless, if you see that girl,

242
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:09,618
just tell her that Ban Doo Hong
really wants to see her just once.

243
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:11,935
Please, you have to help
me pass on the message.

244
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,701
He wants me to bring that
kind of girl over here?

245
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,579
That's too unreasonable.

246
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:22,424
What?

247
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:32,020
Ah, I didn't even put down the hand brake.

248
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:34,008
<i>So annoying!</i>

249
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:40,261
Who parked their car in
the middle of the road?

250
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,730
What?

251
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:07,803
What are you doing?

252
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:09,511
I came to see you.

253
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:12,000
<i>You're making me disappear.</i>

254
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,123
But I am unable to.

255
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:16,215
So what are you going to do to me?

256
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:18,535
Are you threatening me?

257
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:22,716
There are a lot of people who pass by here.

258
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:25,599
There's no one here.

259
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:54,000
You... can you just let me go this once?

260
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:57,318
I don't want to disappear.

261
00:16:57,944 --> 00:17:02,420
Because of my self-respect, I originally
didn't want to do this to humans.

262
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,616
Just let me go this once.

263
00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:09,550
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

264
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:18,875
<i>You gave the bead to Dae Woong,</i>

265
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:23,852
so Dae Woong definitely won't feel
pain, and won't get injured?

266
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,493
That's right.

267
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:28,364
That bead won't be harmful
at all to Dae Woong.

268
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,027
It will only benefit him.

269
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:36,076
So that's why he can fearlessly
act in the movie.

270
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:40,671
Your bead... give me one too.

271
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:44,563
If you give one to me, I'll just
pretend not to know about it.

272
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,265
Dae Woong is helping cover
you up because of that, too.

273
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,168
I can't, I only have one bead.

274
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:53,770
Once I gave it to Dae Woong,
I can't take it back anymore.

275
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:58,453
If I had that, then I can act
like Dae Woong, too.

276
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:01,499
I can also perform well
in front of the Director.

277
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:06,827
I can threaten you to intimidate you.

278
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:09,609
I can also use strength to
make you unable to move.

279
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:12,379
<i>But if I do that, I won't be like a human.</i>

280
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:14,782
I'm not a monster.

281
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:18,922
Right now I'm like a human, begging you.

282
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:21,353
I won't cause any harm to you.

283
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:24,347
Can you just let me remain here?

284
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:28,498
If you want to beg other people,
you have to pay a price.

285
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:31,443
You'll be more like a human if you do that.

286
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:37,109
Will you do whatever I tell you to?

287
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,825
Mi Ho and Hae In noona are together.

288
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:05,089
The atmosphere is a bit strange.

289
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,590
[Dae Woong]

290
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:13,376
I finally met you.

291
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:17,351
I never knew that you were
this close to me all along.

292
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:19,925
This period of time,
I've been really troubled.

293
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,278
I'm very glad to meet you, Mi Ho.

294
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,133
Mi Ho said that she's shy around strangers.

295
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:25,957
<i>When Director chased her,</i>

296
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:29,358
she thought it was burdensome,
so she ran away.

297
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:33,794
I'm not the kind of person who
gives other people burdens.

298
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,659
<i>I only saw Miss Mi Ho's ability that night,</i>

299
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,095
and I just wanted to show my enthusiasm
about my brand-new action movie,

300
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:42,824
<i>So I was following you.</i>

301
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,508
How about it?

302
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,985
Have you ever thought about filming with me?

303
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:55,096
Then let's cooperate nicely this once.

304
00:19:55,197 --> 00:19:56,932
I don't know how to act in action films.

305
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:59,438
I don't want to be famous.

306
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:04,689
Then you mean, you only
want to be a stuntwoman?

307
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,175
She's really shy.

308
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:08,251
Her acting skills are completely
below standard.

309
00:20:08,352 --> 00:20:12,694
She also never thought
about becoming an actor.

310
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,730
So it's like that.

311
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:18,997
I clearly had confidence that I can
train you, Mi Ho, to become a star.

312
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:22,339
<i>But if you don't want to, then I
can't help it either.</i>

313
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,800
Then will the main actor choose the star?

314
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,707
The action part will be
covered by our Miss Mi Ho.

315
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,879
I will do it only if she acts.

316
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,019
Let her face be known,
I'll do the action parts.

317
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:41,262
What is this?

318
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:42,750
If it's like that...

319
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:45,043
I only know how to be her stuntwoman.

320
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,241
If she acts the lead role,
then I will be the stuntwoman.

321
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:51,298
If I want to film a movie with Mi Ho,

322
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:54,947
then I have to let Eun Hae In
take the lead role?

323
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,057
Is that what you mean?

324
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:00,319
Director, I will do it very well.

325
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:09,275
<i>I thought that person was chasing
me because he was irritated with me.</i>

326
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:12,664
Turns out that he was chasing
me because he liked me too much.

327
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:15,135
If the Director's side approves,

328
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:17,800
then during the three months of filming,

329
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:19,854
I won't mind you.

330
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:24,589
Then in the future, are you still
planning to do something to me?

331
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:26,735
It depends.

332
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:28,474
Forget it.

333
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:32,419
After three months, I'll become normal.

334
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:39,482
Noona, what did you do to her?

335
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,223
Didn't I tell you to stop minding her?

336
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:43,644
Dae Woong, you knew too?

337
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,958
You know that I've been discovered?

338
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:48,717
<i>Are you confused with the current situation?</i>

339
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,362
You should protect me on
behalf of humankind!

340
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:56,418
Let's go.

341
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:00,407
Cha Dae Woong.

342
00:22:04,092 --> 00:22:07,807
According to what you said,
she's not very dangerous.

343
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:10,804
<i>On the contrary, she's
actually quite useful.</i>

344
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:14,370
You want her to stay by
your side because of what?

345
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,134
You understand it, too.

346
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:20,715
I heard that you already
started to use her bead.

347
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,823
Then I can only let her
be my stuntwoman...

348
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:26,124
to get the position of the lead role.

349
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,446
What?

350
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,566
Just like how you're using her,

351
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,013
I'm just copying you.

352
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,957
<i>I need her anyway,</i>

353
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,069
so I decided to leave her
alone and not mind.

354
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:51,411
That woman doesn't understand anything.

355
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:54,149
Dae Woong, you clearly don't need the bead,

356
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,750
and you're even helping me take care of it.

357
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,016
That woman is really mean.

358
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:02,556
I helped her push the truck to the
side for nothing a while ago.

359
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,545
Mi Ho.

360
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:09,571
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:14,612
I wanted to use you,

362
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:17,013
I'm really, really sorry.

363
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:22,191
No, at first... didn't I threaten you
by saying that I'm going to eat you?

364
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:27,669
Mi Ho.

365
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,105
I'm really sorry.

366
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:33,846
Woong, I'm sorry too.

367
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:37,916
Woong, they said that I'm
a stuntwoman.

368
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,900
Very cool, right?

369
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:41,805
That's very tiresome.

370
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:43,306
Will you be all right?

371
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:44,621
I'm a gumiho.

372
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:47,393
It's suitable for me.

373
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:52,414
I'm just worried that doing too well
will make you get discovered.

374
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:54,974
Even though you don't need them,
you have to use the steel wires.

375
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,060
Occasionally you have to
show a tired expression.

376
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,797
I can do it very well.

377
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:01,961
Ah, so tired.

378
00:24:02,062 --> 00:24:04,762
I'm a weak woman.

379
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,400
It's not like that.

380
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:09,577
This time you should be like,

381
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:12,497
Ah, so tired.

382
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:15,098
Let's rest a bit.

383
00:24:15,224 --> 00:24:17,178
Ah, so tired.

384
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,079
Let's rest a bit.

385
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,202
That's right.

386
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:21,903
Wipe it like this.

387
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,468

[Swordsman Under the Moon]

389
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:28,764
<i>This is the script for your
part in the movie.</i>

390
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,990
You have to look at this to learn.

391
00:24:32,111 --> 00:24:33,802
You're the heroine, Full Moon.

392
00:24:33,903 --> 00:24:36,394
The hero is New Moon.

393
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:38,476
Full Moon, New Moon.

394
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:40,444
Then that's Round Moon and Crescent Moon.

395
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:45,829
It symbolizes the two heroes' love and fate.

396
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:50,605
Full Moon dedicated everything
to the hero before disappearing.

397
00:24:50,644 --> 00:24:55,750
And the empty man, New Moon,
becomes full because of Full Moon.

398
00:24:55,856 --> 00:24:58,564
But it's a sad story where he ends up alone.

399
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,323
Ah, so it's a love story between two people.

400
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:07,053
Then, since I'm Full Moon, you be New Moon.

401
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,251
No, I'm playing Black Rain, Hyun Woo.

402
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:14,639
Then should I say I won't be Full Moon
unless they make you New Moon?

403
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:17,138
That doesn't work.

404
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:19,113
Just study the script some more.

405
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:21,356
Here's Full Moon's part.

406
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,934
It's here!

407
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:25,823
Rose petals fall scattered into the bathtub.

410
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,790
Wait!

411
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,449
You're not the one acting this.

412
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,046
You don't even need to look at this.

413
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:37,918
What? I like taking baths.

414
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,370
You're only doing the action scenes.

415
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:43,103
You're not supposed to do romantic films.

416
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:45,061
I know.

417
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:51,060
I think Full Moon has a fighting scene
further back where her clothes fall off.

418
00:25:51,996 --> 00:25:53,478
It's here.

419
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:57,776
Hanging from a tree branch,
revealing white skin.

420
00:25:57,843 --> 00:25:59,583
These parts aren't what you're acting!

421
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:01,300
Just say that you definitely
won't act these. Understand?

422
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:03,347
I know.

423
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:07,342
Dae Woong, there's Black Rain,
Hyun Woo, here too!

424
00:26:07,454 --> 00:26:11,194
You act the part where you gaze
lovingly at a virtuous girl.

425
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:16,044
The plot hasn't developed much yet.

426
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:31,006
At first, when your tears
drenched my clothes,

427
00:26:31,147 --> 00:26:36,933
I thought to just wait and let it dry.

428
00:26:37,372 --> 00:26:43,074
But those tears became
bigger clouds and wind,

429
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:48,839
and fell as rain that
held back my footsteps.

430
00:26:49,212 --> 00:26:54,453
While rain that can't be stopped,
can't be avoided, falls down on me,

431
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:57,962
where am I supposed to go?

432
00:26:58,812 --> 00:27:01,496
I lost my way.

433
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:13,783
Even though I want to run far away,

434
00:27:14,195 --> 00:27:17,001
you stay on my mind,
and I keep coming back.

435
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,646
I want to protect you,

436
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:25,047
and I want to treat you well.

437
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:28,402
While getting rained on,

438
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:32,403
I must have lost my mind.

439
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,773
What are you doing?

440
00:27:37,832 --> 00:27:40,466
Showing the virtuous girl's feelings.

441
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:45,711
This isn't in the script.

442
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:47,753
Don't be like this from today on.

443
00:27:47,854 --> 00:27:51,218
The last sentence you said
isn't in here either.

444
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:54,595
That's because I said the wrong lines.

445
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,809
I was wrong.

446
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:25,177
Being at Cha Dae Woong's side,
your identity will be exposed.

447
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,001
I said that he definitely won't tell anyone.

448

If other people know,

449
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:36,462
at that time, what are you going to do?

450
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:40,402
I will become human in three months.

451
00:28:40,503 --> 00:28:43,228
Until then, I just have to
not get discovered.

452
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:45,888
Only your body is becoming human.

453
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:50,318
But the gumiho in the past
will be exposed again.

454
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:52,977
I'm definitely a bit worried about that.

455
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:57,477
That woman said I'm a monster.

456
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:03,533
If another person found out,
they'd say that too, right?

457

Thoroughly erase your gumiho past.

458
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:12,175

a complete human being.

that a human being needs.

00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:25,489
Wow, it's so complete!

463
00:29:27,878 --> 00:29:31,807
I have these, so I can
live like human beings.

464

Yes, you can live like a real human.

465
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,599
But, using Park Sun Ju's name to live,

466
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,450
you can't remain by Cha Dae Woong's side.

467
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:47,808
The people around Cha Dae Woong all
know that you're called Mi Ho.

468
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,801
Also, there's somebody who
already knows your true identity.

469
00:29:52,235 --> 00:29:56,120
In the future, you'll be associated
with even more people.

470
00:29:56,134 --> 00:30:00,839
You'll be revealed, sooner or later.

471
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:06,978
To become human, you have to go to
a place where nobody recognizes you.

472
00:30:06,994 --> 00:30:08,870
If you agree to that,

473
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:14,971

Can I go too?

528
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:57,084
Okay, you can come.

529
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:01,302
Woong, what's a party?

530
00:36:02,124 --> 00:36:05,573
It's just when everybody eats, drinks,
plays and is happy together.

531
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,172
It's like a get-together.

532
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:11,112
Ah, is it like this?

533
00:36:12,426 --> 00:36:13,695
When did you learn that?

534
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,416
This is the same as the ones
five hundred years ago.

535
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:22,309
Five hundred years ago is too outdated.

536
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:25,325
Then, like this.

537
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:26,930
Where did you learn that from?

538
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:30,671
I saw the ahjumma at the fried chicken
shop and her friends go like this.

539
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:32,163
It's not like that.

540
00:36:32,264 --> 00:36:34,626
The moves are all kind of like,

541
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:36,509
Like this, like this,

542
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:40,256
<i>like, more variety...
- Like this.</i>

543
00:36:41,793 --> 00:36:44,120
<i>You really don't have a
feel for rhythm.</i>

544
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:45,721
[Dae Woong! Let's make up!]

545
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:58,355
<i>You try it.</i>

546
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:05,487
You don't even blink an eye.

547
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:08,315
You're indeed different from humans.

548
00:37:08,912 --> 00:37:10,838
I blinked.

549
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:14,654
You think that you can just pretend?

550
00:37:17,082 --> 00:37:21,027
Today, don't attend the director's
congratulations party.

551
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:22,496
Why?

552
00:37:23,114 --> 00:37:25,530
It's supposed to be a happy occasion.

553
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,036
Dangerous people are not allowed to mingle.

554
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:30,059
<i>If you get mixed up in a group of people,</i>

555
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,441
I will feel frightened and I really
don't know what you'll be saying.

556
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:37,551
Dae Woong will also be distracted
and unable to enjoy himself.

557
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:41,428
After he started being with you, he
drifted farther away from his old friends.

558
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:44,207
You know that too, right?

559
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:47,827
A day like today, just let him go.

560
00:37:50,055 --> 00:37:51,740
<i>Miss Mi Ho, drink this.</i>

561
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:53,996
<i>- Also this.
- Do you like to eat sandwiches?</i>

562
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,426
Mi Ho.

563
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:01,898
Drink this.

564
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:04,626
Wow! This is my favorite.

565
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:14,663
Miss Mi Ho.

566
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:17,844
You have to come to the director's
congratulations party.

567
00:38:23,455 --> 00:38:27,545
I really can't be at ease for even a moment.

568
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:33,458
Woong, if I'm together with
humans, will it bother you?

569
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:35,428
Worry you?

570
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:39,877
I'm not being worried on purpose,
it's because you're too beau-

571
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:44,762
Haven't seen the world.

572
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:48,313
Don't casually talk with other people.

573
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:54,317
Change upstairs and let's go.

574
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,973
I'll let you experience the so-called party.

575
00:38:58,187 --> 00:38:59,653
You go first.

576
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:03,004
I'll go after I see the fried
chicken shop's ahjumma.

577
00:39:03,245 --> 00:39:06,006
Do you know the address?
Will you be able to find it?

578
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:10,078
Yes, you go and have fun.

579
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:25,561
<i>The 21st Korean Film Festival
special award winner is...</i>

580
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:28,946
<i>Director Ban Doo Hong.</i>

581
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,590
I truly thank everyone.

582
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:48,215
<i>I truly thank everyone for
giving me this award.</i>

583
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,638
<i>Thank you.</i>

584
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:56,996
Oh, my!

585
00:39:57,276 --> 00:40:00,355
I'm going to take this
honor and share it with...

586
00:40:01,103 --> 00:40:04,856
everyone who likes my movies.

587
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,355
Please wait a moment.

588
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:11,243
Thank you.

589
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:13,369
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

590
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:15,865
<i>The one who's looking at me right now,</i>

591
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,497
I believe that you definitely...

592
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:26,398
<i>understand my sincerity now.</i>

593
00:40:27,398 --> 00:40:33,252
<i>You made me able to receive this honor.</i>

594
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:45,028
Thank you! Thank you!

595
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:53,442
I understand.

596
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:55,959
Director's sincerity...

597
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,791
I understand!

598
00:41:06,075 --> 00:41:09,488
That Ban Doo Hong or Ban Du Hoon,

599
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:13,087
seems like he really meant it.

600
00:41:19,288 --> 00:41:20,088
Here.

601
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:22,213
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

602
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,355
Speaking of which,
what happened to my father?

603
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:28,969
<i>What was that? He acted like an idiot.</i>

604
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:31,311
When is Mi Ho coming?

605
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:34,388
She said that she went to see a
friend. She'll be here in a minute.

606
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,489
Mi Ho has friends?

607
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:38,639
Hey, our Mi Ho is okay.

608
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,794
Her popularity is very high
in our neighborhood.

609
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:43,405
They're all cheering her
to become community president.

610
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:52,449
I want to go to the party too.

611
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:03,088
Oh, it's Teacher Dong Ju.

612
00:42:03,793 --> 00:42:05,549
Teacher Dong Ju?

613
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:13,541
They say it's some party,
but it's actually not much.

614
00:42:13,754 --> 00:42:15,268
You're that sad about it?

615
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:18,926
Teacher Dong Ju, you've been to
many, so you think it's not much.

616
00:42:19,027 --> 00:42:21,129
It's because I've never
been to one, so I'm curious.

617
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,682
Gumiho still can't enjoy
it to her heart's content.

618
00:42:26,785 --> 00:42:29,937
Have you thought about
becoming Park Sun Ju?

619
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,876
Becoming her, of course, is good.

620
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:36,829
But no matter how good it is,
if Dae Woong's not at my side,

621
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,822
it's not meaningful.

622
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:47,254
It's because you've never been there before,
so you're saying that it's not meaningful.

623
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:49,621
<i>Do you want to go there once?</i>

624
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:54,333
For the remainder of the day,
become Park Sun Ju.

625
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:58,387
Are you okay, Miss Park Sun Ju?

626
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,015
What are we doing here?

627
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:06,357
You have to have outfits
that suit Park Sun Ju.

628
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:08,318
I don't have money.

629
00:43:09,135 --> 00:43:12,783
Even though you don't have any,
Park Sun Ju does.

630
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:22,136
Try this one on.

631
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:49,075
The style on this side is pretty too.

632
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:57,606
I like this color. It's the color of cows.

633
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:13,779
How many?

634
00:44:30,949 --> 00:44:32,427
Where did Miss Park Sun Ju
attend university?

635
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,528
What major? How many years?

636
00:44:33,556 --> 00:44:35,227
You've remembered them clearly, right?

637
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:38,835
Yes. Korea University.
Asian Studies major, Class of 07.

638
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:40,194
That's right.

639
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:44,804
Today your classmates are having
a gathering. A university reunion.

640
00:44:44,913 --> 00:44:47,245
It's a type of party.

641
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:48,708
Party?

642
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,155
I can go into that type of place?

643
00:45:02,256 --> 00:45:03,409
Of course.

644
00:45:03,547 --> 00:45:07,128
Miss Park Sun Ju has the
qualifications to go in.

645
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:10,087
I won't be discovered by
other people as a fake, right?

646
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:15,091
It might cause a bit of suspicion.

647
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,141
Wait a moment.

648
00:45:21,723 --> 00:45:24,668
Why isn't she here yet?

649
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,819
Cha Dae Woong!

650
00:45:32,478 --> 00:45:38,321
In my heart, you're completely defeated.
Defeated!

651
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:44,525
Hey, Byung Soo, Seon Nyeo is drunk!

652
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:47,198
Seon Nyeo definitely drank too much!

653
00:45:49,922 --> 00:45:55,552
Lastly, I'm going to give
you a farewell kiss.

654
00:45:59,209 --> 00:46:00,162
<i>Seon Nyeo!</i>

655
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:09,970
<i>You didn't kiss Seon Nyeo?!</i>

656
00:46:12,262 --> 00:46:15,976
Ah, so close.

657
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:18,652
I almost caused big trouble.

658
00:46:18,812 --> 00:46:19,997
<i>I was very fortunate.</i>

659
00:46:20,098 --> 00:46:23,339
Cha Dae Woong, it's very fortunate
that nothing happened.

660
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,431
Because Seon Nyeo likes you, she went a
bit too far while the liquor was strong.

661
00:46:26,532 --> 00:46:28,627
You made it sound as if it was
a big deal, just grumbling here.

662
00:46:28,728 --> 00:46:30,639
You really ruined my appetite.

663
00:46:30,735 --> 00:46:33,720
Hey, I almost caused big trouble!

664
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:36,396
Abusing me once, I can bear it.

665
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:40,638
But if by accident something happens,
Mi Ho will be in big trouble!

666
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:44,150
You're Cha "Chun Hyang"*! Cha Chun Hyang!
*Korean folk tale heroine known for loyalty

667
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:49,127
<i>Even if there's a sword resting on my neck,
I still have to guard my chastity.</i>

668
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:53,168
So take Seon Nyeo farther away.

669
00:46:57,747 --> 00:47:00,061
It should be okay, right?

670
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:03,027
Why? Let's go together.

671
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:08,776
Our Dae Woong is so great.

672
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:16,072
So, is it because of that girl?

673
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:18,927
It'll cause trouble?

674
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:38,511
Right now this is more suitable for you.

675
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:42,967
Did Park Sun Ju buy this, too?

676
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:46,234
This is a present that I'm giving you.

677
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,022
Give that one to me.

678
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:58,428
There are a lot of precious things in here.

679
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:00,550
It doesn't suit you.

680
00:48:08,445 --> 00:48:11,343
This is more suitable for you.

681
00:48:22,434 --> 00:48:24,438
Okay, let's go in.

682
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:26,439
Miss Park Sun Ju.

683
00:48:31,753 --> 00:48:33,380
<i>Please come in.</i>

684
00:48:34,918 --> 00:48:36,537
Don't be nervous.

685
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,455
Just follow what the other people are doing.

686
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:48,037
Please show your name.

687
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:50,712
Park Sun Ju.

688
00:48:53,465 --> 00:48:55,645
Okay, please come in.

689
00:49:07,372 --> 00:49:10,078
She shouldn't have caused
any trouble, right?

690
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:13,019
I'll call the fried chicken
shop's ahjumma and ask.

691
00:49:21,637 --> 00:49:23,359
Dae Woong.

692
00:49:24,019 --> 00:49:28,442
Are you still angry at me?

693
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:37,610
Noona, I understand why you think that way.

694
00:49:37,654 --> 00:49:39,826
At first I was like you, too.

695
00:49:39,898 --> 00:49:41,864
I'm really very worried about you.

696
00:49:41,965 --> 00:49:44,684
- It's the truth.
- Noona.

697
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:47,453
The one I'm worried for now is her.

698
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:52,538
That's what I truly feel.

699
00:49:58,676 --> 00:50:00,628
I'm leaving first.

700
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:12,233
There are still a lot of friends left.
Why did you come out so early?

701
00:50:12,445 --> 00:50:17,084
Everybody really did treat
me as Park Sun Ju.

702
00:50:17,497 --> 00:50:20,742
Although it's very new, I feel a bit shy.

703
00:50:20,843 --> 00:50:24,003
There's still ample time
for you to get used to it.

704
00:50:24,904 --> 00:50:26,732
Becoming human with Park Sun Ju's identity,

705
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:29,915
I won't ever be discovered by anyone, right?

706
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:34,588
But, when I'm with Dae Woong,

707
00:50:34,689 --> 00:50:37,489
it'll be better if we can naturally
become more comfortable.

708
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:40,927
The two of us are both lying,
and it's very tiring.

709
00:50:41,028 --> 00:50:46,346
If you're by Dae Woong's side,
you have to tell lies and work hard.

710
00:50:46,433 --> 00:50:48,542
Cha Dae Woong will do it even more.

711
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:53,480
Isn't he hiding the truth from his
family and friends right now?

712
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:59,027
Because of me, Dae Woong both
worries and tells lies.

713
00:50:59,128 --> 00:51:01,586
He must be really exhausted.

714
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:09,317
If you have this, you can go anywhere.

715
00:51:09,722 --> 00:51:15,557
After one hundred days, leave Cha Dae Woong,
and this place, by yourself.

716
00:51:16,181 --> 00:51:18,327
I will help you.

717
00:51:27,976 --> 00:51:30,529
Min Sook really did see it.

718
00:51:40,198 --> 00:51:42,287
Who are you?

719
00:51:52,615 --> 00:51:55,387
This is also what I feel.

720
00:51:55,492 --> 00:51:58,490
I like everything about you.

721
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:03,004
You definitely can't give up.

722
00:52:03,811 --> 00:52:05,822
Min Sook.

723
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:16,777
Oh, my!

724
00:52:16,878 --> 00:52:18,878
What am I going to do?

725
00:52:20,157 --> 00:52:21,722
What?

726
00:52:22,523 --> 00:52:25,052
Chow Yun Fat.

727
00:52:31,994 --> 00:52:34,002
I'm sorry.

728
00:52:36,446 --> 00:52:38,711
She's not at the fried
chicken shop or at home.

729
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,619
Where exactly is she?

730
00:52:44,464 --> 00:52:46,451
Where did you go?

731
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:59,482
Where did you go dressed like that?

732
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:01,083
Hmm?

733
00:53:02,257 --> 00:53:04,784
My clothes, my bag!

734
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,144
You left your things in my car.

735
00:53:11,245 --> 00:53:12,647
It's too late today,

736
00:53:12,748 --> 00:53:15,148
I'll take them over some other time.

737
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:24,185
It's good if she just forgets
everything one by one like this.

738
00:53:25,877 --> 00:53:27,916
It's fortunate that I didn't
leave them somewhere else.

739
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,517
I left them in Teacher Dong Ju's car.

740
00:53:30,658 --> 00:53:32,832
Dae Woong, your cell phone.

741
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:43,557
Dae Woong, did you have fun at the party?

742
00:53:43,697 --> 00:53:46,735
Yes, it was a lot of fun.

743
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,150
Looks like you had a good time, too.

744
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:53,470
You look like you really
went to a real party.

745
00:53:53,953 --> 00:53:55,516
Yes.

746
00:53:56,576 --> 00:53:59,190
You really dressed for the occasion, too.

747
00:53:59,822 --> 00:54:03,981
This outfit I borrowed from
a person called Park Sun Ju.

748
00:54:04,055 --> 00:54:06,859
Who's Park Sun Ju?

749
00:54:07,096 --> 00:54:09,580
Is she Park Dong Ju's relative?

750
00:54:09,688 --> 00:54:13,022
You even met Park Dong Ju's family members?

751
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:15,806
What kind of relationship do you have?

752
00:54:15,939 --> 00:54:17,021
Dae Woong,

753
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:23,202
how did you introduce me
to your relatives and friends?

754
00:54:24,785 --> 00:54:27,571
What did you say about me?

755
00:54:28,203 --> 00:54:31,774
Say what? Of course I couldn't say anything.

756
00:54:31,808 --> 00:54:36,125
Then what will you say if they ask?

757
00:54:37,113 --> 00:54:41,029
I said something before.

758
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:47,828
But we'll have to find a day to clearly say
what happened between you and me before.

759
00:54:49,824 --> 00:54:55,429
Dae Woong, I'm sorry that because of me,
you have to lie.

760
00:54:56,285 --> 00:54:57,273
It's okay.

761
00:54:57,374 --> 00:55:00,674
Lying is my instinct, don't worry about it.

762
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,230
But Mi Ho.

763
00:55:07,331 --> 00:55:08,194
Yes?

764
00:55:08,286 --> 00:55:11,545
There's something that
I'm a bit worried about.

765
00:55:11,662 --> 00:55:16,404
The bead in my chest... there
seems to be some side effects.

766
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,790
What's wrong?

767
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:22,216
When I become intimate with another woman,

768
00:55:22,317 --> 00:55:24,087
the bead will shatter
and I'll be hurt, right?

769
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:25,326
Yes.

770
00:55:26,183 --> 00:55:30,110
Following the same principle,
when I'm wearing the bead,

771
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:35,628
and you meet with another man, there
are some side effects on me, too.

772
00:55:35,729 --> 00:55:36,932
Really?

773
00:55:37,071 --> 00:55:38,058
There shouldn't be any.

774
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:39,935
No, no, no.

775
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:43,281
The bead has a reaction.

776
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,798
Especially when you meet
with Teacher Dong Ju.

777
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,611
The pressure over my chest
is getting more serious.

778
00:55:53,732 --> 00:55:59,359
Since it affects my health, I hope you'll
try not to see Teacher Dong Ju anymore.

779
00:55:59,394 --> 00:56:01,986
So, if I do meet with Teacher
Dong Ju in the future,

780
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:04,807
I'll stay farther away from him.

781
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:09,453
Before I was too close.

782
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,157
You two were really close together?!

783
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:16,002
So that's why my body's like this!

784
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:18,165
At least five meters away.

785
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,989
No, ten meters' distance.

786
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,012
I understand.

787
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:25,197
Why is the bead like this?

788
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,298
Are you still uncomfortable now?

789
00:56:30,046 --> 00:56:36,020
I think there's still a bit, over here.

790
00:56:40,183 --> 00:56:45,597
Seems like the bead has calmed down
because the owner is at its side.

791
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:48,872
Here.

792
00:56:55,771 --> 00:56:58,084
If she's always looking for him,

793
00:56:58,185 --> 00:57:00,785
it'll be very difficult for her to forget.

794
00:57:38,076 --> 00:57:40,367
Dong Ba, make this movie
into a big event this time!

795
00:57:40,468 --> 00:57:41,555
- Yes!
- Okay!

796
00:57:41,556 --> 00:57:43,612
- I understand!
- Work diligently!

797
00:57:43,939 --> 00:57:45,274
<i>Preparations for the dress
rehearsal are finished!</i>

798
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:47,878
Okay, the first scene!

799
00:57:47,975 --> 00:57:49,187
Camera!

800
00:57:49,288 --> 00:57:51,536
Let start with the action, got it?
Gong Pal!

801
00:57:51,637 --> 00:57:53,137
<i>- Yes, I understand!
- Let's go!</i>

802
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:55,511
<i>- Everyone, fighting!
- Fighting!</i>

803
00:58:04,807 --> 00:58:06,678
Director.

804
00:58:07,102 --> 00:58:09,157
I came here to greet you
before the first scene.

805
00:58:09,258 --> 00:58:10,258
Mmm, yes.

806
00:58:10,335 --> 00:58:12,770
Watch attentively at the side.

807
00:58:12,842 --> 00:58:15,626
Please go over there.

808
00:58:19,837 --> 00:58:23,705
Yes, Mi Ho is at the filming location.

809
00:58:23,752 --> 00:58:24,563
Mi Ho?

810
00:58:24,664 --> 00:58:25,795
Okay, I got it.

811
00:58:25,896 --> 00:58:29,021
Tell her that I'll come
over to return her bag.

812
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,753
Park Dong Ju?

813
00:58:30,779 --> 00:58:33,206
Why did you tell that person Mi Ho is here?

814
00:58:33,237 --> 00:58:35,992
Just tell him to drop off
the bag at our house.

815
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:40,828
Cha Chun Hyang, you're
getting way too jealous.

816
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:43,159
You're going to stay here again today,
even though you're not filming?

817
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,549
Yes, I'm going to stay until the end.

818
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:54,928
Take off the ring.

819
00:58:55,772 --> 00:58:56,908
Why?

820
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:01,207
Is it right to wear a ring like
that in a historical drama?

821
00:59:07,187 --> 00:59:08,533
Mi Ho.

822
00:59:09,843 --> 00:59:11,808
Come out for a moment.

823
00:59:19,937 --> 00:59:22,052
<i>It fits me perfectly.</i>

824
00:59:27,124 --> 00:59:28,519
Look at this.

825
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:34,127
Compared to a monster like you wearing
this ring, it fits me perfectly, too.

826
00:59:34,228 --> 00:59:35,989
That isn't yours right now.

827
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:38,090
It's mine, give it to me.

828
00:59:39,548 --> 00:59:41,618
It's not mine right now?

829
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:43,756
Then you're saying it was mine before?

830
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:45,685
It's mine! Give me back my ring!

831
00:59:45,786 --> 00:59:47,199
Speak clearly.

832
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,373
Was this originally mine?

833
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:51,570
You can't win against me.

834
00:59:51,617 --> 00:59:55,046
If you don't want to get injured,
return it to me immediately.

835
00:59:55,052 --> 00:59:58,613
I got it, I'll give it to you.

836
01:00:05,984 --> 01:00:10,058
My strength definitely
can't beat a monster's.

837
01:00:10,905 --> 01:00:14,503
As a result, I can't possibly
take that ring away from you.

838
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:20,257
You gave Dae Woong the bead and
then took away my ring, right?

839
01:00:21,853 --> 01:00:24,724
Is the bead that extraordinary?

840
01:00:25,938 --> 01:00:31,553
By chance, if that bead got into an
accident, it would cause you trouble?

841
01:00:31,638 --> 01:00:33,433
You don't need to know.

842
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:41,034
Dae Woong said that just touching
him will cause big trouble.

843
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:43,387
Wait and see.

844
01:00:43,488 --> 01:00:45,088
I will make you get hurt.

845
01:00:45,381 --> 01:00:48,539
Dae Woong, you hold onto this.

846
01:00:49,686 --> 01:00:50,807
<i>Okay.</i>

847
01:00:51,716 --> 01:00:55,590
Don't perform too enthusiastically, to keep
people from seeing that you're a gumiho.

848
01:00:55,691 --> 01:00:57,775
Be more delicate. What did you I teach you?

849
01:00:57,876 --> 01:01:02,484
Ah, so tired. Let's rest a bit.

850
01:01:02,522 --> 01:01:03,750
Good job.

851
01:01:03,851 --> 01:01:06,051
Our Mi Ho, fighting!

852
01:01:06,577 --> 01:01:08,739
What's fighting?

853
01:01:09,043 --> 01:01:12,201
That's right, I have to speak
language that you can understand.

854
01:01:12,376 --> 01:01:13,825
Win!

855
01:01:13,926 --> 01:01:15,628
Win!

856
01:01:19,646 --> 01:01:23,260
Miss Mi Ho, you have to
take the ladder outside...

857
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:26,834
onto a smooth platform and jump down.

858
01:01:26,899 --> 01:01:29,195
How about it? Will it be okay?

859
01:01:29,257 --> 01:01:30,511
Don't be too uneasy.

860
01:01:30,612 --> 01:01:34,052
The safety facilities have
all been readily prepared.

861
01:01:35,026 --> 01:01:38,135
It could be a bit difficult,
but I'll try it.

862
01:01:40,562 --> 01:01:43,919
Before filming starts,
she should drink a soda.

863
01:01:44,074 --> 01:01:45,996
Byung Soo, are they about to film now?

864
01:01:46,097 --> 01:01:46,980
I'll tell you later, later.

865
01:01:47,081 --> 01:01:48,481
Hey!

866
01:01:49,354 --> 01:01:50,957
Ah, really...

867
01:01:51,058 --> 01:01:53,858
Are they starting to film from this side?

868
01:01:54,813 --> 01:01:57,933
Slowly, slowly.

869
01:01:58,152 --> 01:01:59,976
A bit higher.

870
01:02:01,345 --> 01:02:04,821
Take off, landing, understand?

871
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,125
Mi Ho.

872
01:02:27,894 --> 01:02:28,830
<i>Dae Woong,</i>

873
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:29,731
- Ah, yeah...
- You don't have any scenes today,

874
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:30,722
why did you come over?

875
01:02:30,731 --> 01:02:34,055
Because it's the start of the movie,
