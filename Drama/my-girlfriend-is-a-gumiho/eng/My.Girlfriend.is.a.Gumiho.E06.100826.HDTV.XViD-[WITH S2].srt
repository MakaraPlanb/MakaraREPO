3
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:09,666
Starting from now, I'm your girlfriend.

4
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:12,345
You and I are a couple.

5
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,777
That's right,

6
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:21,878
even though you're really unfortunate, and
really unlucky, we are indeed a couple.

7
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:27,522
But you agreed, only for 100 days.

8
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:32,520
Dae Woong, since we're a couple,

9
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:36,021
can you fulfill something
that I've always wanted to do?

10
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:40,765
We've already gone this far,
what is there we can't do?

11
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:42,917
What is it that you want to do?

12
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,824
Why are you holding a towel?

13
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:05,724
You even drew on your face.

14
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:09,735
Please receive a bow from a little miss.

15
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:12,038
Stop!

16
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:17,185
I've got the general idea
of what you're about to do.

17
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,392
You can't do this.

18
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:23,772
I've always wanted to do this!
Just let me finish!

19
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:25,630
No!

20
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:28,776
Because of the bead, I had no choice
but to be your boyfriend.

21
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:32,174
And now you're seizing the chance
for me to become your groom?

22
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:36,151
Wow, Gu Mi Ho is so shameless
that I'm speechless!

23
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:40,253
Gu Mi Ho is really so shameless
that nobody has anything to say.

24
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:50,351
I really wanted to do the whole thing.
What a pity.

25
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:54,088
Woong! Then let's mate!

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,751
What?

27
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:04,185
I think I heard wrong.

28
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:06,306
What did you say?

29
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:12,098
Mate!

30
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:19,105
You're that happy?

31
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:22,851
Ah, seriously. Seriously...

32
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:33,071
If I had to mate with a gumiho,
I'd much rather spit out the bead.

33
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:39,098
You think you can spit it out like that?

34
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,678
<i>Until 100 days have passed, you
definitely won't be able to get it out.</i>

35
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:44,784
During this period of time,
you belong to me.

36
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,436
Okay then. Come on.

37
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:10,277
What you wanted, is it this?

38
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,996
No, I was just joking.

39
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,512
Don't casually joke around.

40
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:21,593
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:24,493
<i>Normal girls are all like this.</i>

42
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:31,071
Okay then. Come on.

43
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,359
What you wanted, is it this?

44
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,184
Mi Ho, don't be like that!

45
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:41,749
I was just joking!

46
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,452
That won't do!

47
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:44,904
I really was only joking.

48
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:46,277
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

49
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:49,784
Let go of me. Let go.

50
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:07,446
Was I too impulsive,
so I did something stupid?

51
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,787
No, thinking about the bead in
my stomach makes me feel better.

52
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:18,138
I just have to endure 100 days,
then I'll have reached the end.

53
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:22,672
He actually dares to joke
around with a gumiho.

54
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:25,465
Made me like him, but without fruition.

55
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:30,977
After 100 days, I will become human!

56
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:49,976
100 days starting from now.

57
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:59,564
After 100 days, one bulb will be empty.

58
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,549
<i>The other bulb will be completely filled up.</i>

59
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:14,468
We're not in a relationship,
we're just in a type of contract.

60
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:18,339
I'm in because of the bead, and you're
in because you want to stay here.

61
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,981
We're together because
of each others' needs.

62
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,431
But there's a boundary line between
human and gumiho...

63
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:23,898
that neither of us are able to cross.

64
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:26,398
Let's just cooperate with each other.

65
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:28,168
I know,

66
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:32,169
I won't do anything that you don't like.

67
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:37,213
If it's like that,

68
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:41,914
then you don't have to look at me with
an expression like you're going to eat me.

69
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,012
It looks like I'm going to eat you?

70
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,653
Strange, I haven't thought
about that recently.

71
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:53,761
Recently?

72
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,986
Ah, so sleepy.

73
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:00,280
You can't go to sleep like this!

74
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:03,283
Why? I'm really tired.

75
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:05,915
I need to address this.

76
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,949
I have to get it straight.

77
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:14,523
Did you have thoughts of
wanting to eat me before?

78
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:18,796
Why are you asking this type of question?

79
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:20,915
Even if it was just once.

80
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,351
"Wow, Dae Woong must definitely be tasty."

81
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,375
You never thought that before?

82
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:28,385
You're a gumiho!

83
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:29,953
Just in case you can't
control your instinct,

84
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:32,141
you still can't make a mistake.

85
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:34,627
I don't want to say it.

86
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,700
I'll be understanding, so just say it.

87
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:42,521
Did you or did you not have
these kinds of thoughts?

88
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,666
Just once.

89
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,391
Just once?

90
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,720
<i>Actually it was twice!</i>

91
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:54,848
It was actually twice?

92
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,731
What's wrong?
Didn't you say that you'd be understanding?

93
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,517
What kind of person can
understand these things?

94
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:11,507
I shouldn't have asked.

95
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,485
Let's maintain a distance between us.

96
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:19,360
Woong!

97
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:21,728
Right now...

98
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:26,429
I don't have the confidence to face you.

99
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:43,032
If I'd known this earlier,
I wouldn't have said it.

100
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,202
Twice?

101
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:55,730
Maybe three times, four times, who knows.

102
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:22,732
<i>I love you, you fool</i>

103
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:26,518
Do you want to go to the
delicious udon soup shop...

104
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:29,386
and drink a bowl of udon soup together?

105
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:34,620
The two of us should have
had some good udon soup...

106
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:38,721
<i>I want to be with you</i>

107
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:44,222
<i>The way I'm like this is...</i>

108
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,623
<i>the fluttering of love</i>

109
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:50,224
<i>Please stay by my side</i>

110
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:53,625
<i>Please don't leave me</i>

111
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:57,626
<i>When I close my eyes
after time has passed...</i>

112
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:02,730
I am a rough man, who smells like Icy Hot.

113
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:08,417
How pungent.

114
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:14,977
Eyes and heart are both very pungent.

115
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:12,042
You scared me!

116
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:13,973
What's wrong with you?

117
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,687
Are you crying?

118
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,424
It won't rub off.

119
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:27,986
The stuff on my face won't rub off.

120
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:31,784
What did you use to draw it?

121
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:34,839
<i>This.</i>

122
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,591
You used a permanent marker
to draw on your face?

123
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:43,937
I thought it was a regular blush.

124
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:48,184
Let me see. Lift up your head.

125
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,030
How can a gumiho like you be so stupid?

126
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:55,336
Let's find a solution.

127
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:57,134
<i>Typing: Methods to remove
permanent marker stains</i>

128
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:07,000
<i>A lot of people replied.</i>

129
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,901
Seems like there are many people
who are as stupid as you.

130
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,872
Then that means I've made a mistake
that many people make.

131
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:19,018
<i>Glue.</i>

132
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:19,997
Glue?

133
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,112
<i>It's so comfortable.</i>

134
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,790
<i>Sit still!</i>

135
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,084
<i>Oh, it came off!</i>

136
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,189
<i>Really?</i>

137
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:29,271
<i>Yes.</i>

138
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:33,882
It's your fault for insisting
on drawing this on your face.

139
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:39,891
I've always wanted to put blush on my
face and pretend to get married.

140
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:47,442
<i>Before, I was going to get
married and live a human life.</i>

141
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:53,289
<i>But, once the rumor spread that
gumihos eat livers, nobody came.</i>

142
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:58,129
So, I wasn't able to get married before
I was locked up in that painting.

143
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:03,567
Turns out you were the victim
of evil at that time.

144
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:05,438
What is evil?

145
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:10,221
Talking behind people's back,
harming intentionally, spreading rumors.

146
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:14,297
Seems like back then, there were also
these types of bad people.

147
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,965
I honestly never ate a person before.

148
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:20,126
But before, a tiger wanted to eat people.

149
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:23,211
I blocked it and told it to not eat people.

150
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:26,149
You blocked it?
That tiger listened to you?

151
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,166
Yeah.
"If you don't listen, I will eat you."

152
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:31,651
Ah...

153
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:37,634
so you mainly said that you'll
eat the opponent as a threat.

154
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:43,332
It's already been 500 years, but this
type of problem still arises.

155
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:46,591
From what I can see, this problem
is very difficult to overcome.

156
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:50,288
This prejudice is truly
very difficult to change.

157
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,650
<i>Wait until I've become a famous actor.</i>

158
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,921
I'll star together with my
friend Kim Byung Soo.

159
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:56,580
We'll film a movie that will shatter
people's perception of gumihos.

160
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:57,687
It'll wash away any accusations about you.

161
00:12:57,788 --> 00:12:58,914
Really?

162
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:00,598
<i>That's right.</i>

163
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:04,020
If I can become an actor,
your bead gets some credit.

164
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:06,182
A small present like that
is quite necessary.

165
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,061
That's right, present!

166
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:10,949
Wait for me!

167
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,224
You'll definitely be greatly surprised!

168
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:25,738
Mi Ho, what is the thing
that you like the best?

169
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:26,696
Meat!

170
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:28,442
That's right.

171
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:31,008
This thing, regardless of
its appearance or size,

172
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:32,624
has, even at first glance,
obviously been made for you.

173
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:37,914
You can't show your tails or anything
just because you're too excited.

174
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,219
Okay.

175
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:42,624
Prepared especially for Miss Gu Mi Ho,

176
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:46,725
the super, king size, massive beyond
comparison, chicken drumstick!

177
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:48,640
Chicken drumstick!

178
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:50,816
Wow, that meat is really big!

179
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:52,246
Here, Mi Ho, I give you meat.

180
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:53,961
Catch it!

181
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:57,452
Mi Ho, are you okay?

182
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:04,996
Mi Ho, what's wrong? You don't like it?

183
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:08,256
Because it's not real meat,
are you disappointed?

184
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:12,414
<i>No, it's because I'm too happy.</i>

185
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:16,540
My tails aren't going to show,
but my tears are about to fall.

186
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:20,412
Next time, I'll look for
a beef ribs plushie.

187
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:25,873
This can't be bitten, otherwise
cotton will be come out.

188
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:27,848
But I still want to pretend
like I'm eating it.

189
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,023
If there are drumsticks this big, then
wouldn't the wings be as big as this room?

190
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:34,571
As big as the entire room.

191
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:37,692
If there really was a chicken this big,

192
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,893
my life's road would be a lot smoother.
What a pity.

193
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:46,765
Does the Director know that
Dae Woong got injured?

194
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:48,198
Not yet.

195
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:50,199
Didn't Hae In unni advise him to give up?

196
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,270
Was he planning to give up?

197
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:56,291
I did talk to him about it, but we
haven't been in contact since.

198
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:03,607
Dae Woong shouldn't be hurt
because of what I said, right?

199
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:07,400
<i>I don't even have to see it to know,
she definitely hurt him.</i>

200
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,152
<i>When Hae In unni speaks, she always
likes to make herself sound innocent.</i>

201
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:12,631
<i>When she does that, she's very hateful.</i>

202
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:15,048
She knew that Cha Dae Woong got into
an accident, she's just too much!

203
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,906
Dae Woong definitely can't say that he's
giving up face to face with the director.

204
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:23,000
Before he acts impulsively
and hurts himself even more,

205
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,622
looks like I'll have to tell the director.

206
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:27,661
Director!

207
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:08,036
Exactly what kind of person are you?

208
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:10,460
<i>How did you do it?</i>

209
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:13,988
It's simply perfect action.

210
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:21,718
Look into my eyes.

211
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,025
You don't have fear in your eyes.

212
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:29,145
What is fear? I do not know.

213
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:32,312
After doing three somersaults in the air,

214
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:34,813
and when landing on one foot,
you weren't scared?

215
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:36,339
Absolutely not.

216
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:42,420
Usually when you're landing on one foot,
your ankle will crack and break.

217
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:44,711
I won't be scared of getting injured.

218
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:50,695
I'm not the type of person who'd sacrifice
the seriousness of the moves out of fear.

219
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:57,819
Wow... too inspirational!

220
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,691
The moves you perform...

221
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:05,321
will let you be inspiring.

222
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:22,378
I will give you even greater inspiration.

223
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:24,962
Inspiration.

224
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:26,170
Inspiration.

225
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:27,911
Ah, inspiration.

226
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:33,197
Are you really okay?

227
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,178
Have you been enduring
too much pain?

228
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:39,807
Look carefully into my eyes.

229
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:41,619
Do these eyes...

230
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,703
look like I've been going
through a hard time?

231
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:49,151
Didn't I say that I was okay?

232
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:51,270
It's all been resolved.

233
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,296
At one glance, it looks
exactly like a couple ring.

234
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:05,442
He was even wearing it proudly.

235
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:10,591
Cha Dae Woong... how can he
have another girlfriend already?

236
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:13,450
Who is it?

237
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:17,285
I reckon it should be Hae In noona.

238
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:20,934
Unni, let me see your hand.

239
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:26,994
This doesn't look like a couple ring.

240
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:28,285
Couple ring?

241
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:31,226
Unni, is this the couple ring that
you're wearing with Dae Woong?

242
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:33,434
It's not.

243
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:42,784
Then who is Cha Dae Woong
wearing a couple ring with?

244
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:46,746
What do you mean by that?

245
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:51,030
Cha Dae Woong is like lightning.
He has another girlfriend already!

246
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:53,795
Girlfriend?

247
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:57,966
Dae Woong has always been popular.

248
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:02,083
Plus this time, he even
started to film a movie.

249
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,807
Movie?

250
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,708
I thought that couldn't be filmed anymore.

251
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:07,908
They say that Dae Woong's
body has recovered a lot.

252
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:10,399
There don't seem to be any problems, so
they're still going to film the movie.

253
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,231
<i>You didn't know?</i>

254
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,930
It really isn't noona then.

255
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:35,034
Couple ring? Who with?

256
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:39,135
<i>Dae Woong</i>

257
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,886
I became Dae Woong's girlfriend.

258
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:52,284
Looks like he really did need the bead.

259
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:56,960
This type of ring is bought for
the person you like, right?

260
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:04,089
Cha Dae Woong doesn't show
affection towards you.

261
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:07,426
And doesn't consider you as a human.

262
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,702
I will become human.

263
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:13,503
Maybe in the future, he will like me.

264
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:17,089
Seems like you wish for
Cha Dae Woong to like you.

265
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,322
What does he like about you?

266
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:21,442
Dae Woong said before that I'm very special.

267
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,218
He said that I can run fast,
jump high, and am powerful.

268
00:20:26,274 --> 00:20:29,229
There are cars that can go fast,
and planes that can fly high.

269
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,033
<i>Those kinds of abilities aren't useful,
even if they are considered special.</i>

270
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:38,601
Things that are far away,
I can see and hear them clearly.

271
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:45,339
Those kinds of abilities
can't compare with this.

272
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:48,089
He also praises me when I eat a lot.

273
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,405
That's going to cost more money.

274
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:52,458
Even if he likes a woman who
can make a lot of money,

275
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,559
<i>he won't like a woman who only
knows how to spend money.</i>

276
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:58,946
I'm very beautiful.

277
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:04,004
That... I admit.

278
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:11,121
But women who just go on their beauty,
cause very large side effects.

279
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:17,565
I strongly suggest that you don't talk about
mating with Cha Dae Woong in the future.

280
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,632
Then what am I supposed to do?

281
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:26,591
Don't be like before and threaten
him to get what you want.

282
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:30,005
Try and help him with what he wants to do.

283
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:33,049
What Dae Woong wants to do?

284
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:35,551
<i>You like this, right?</i>

285
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:38,149
Eat it while you're thinking it over.

286
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:40,048
Am I a dog?

287
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,628
I'm sorry, I was too careless.

288
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:49,833
Don't eat it on the road.

289
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:56,684
Miss, miss.

290
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,915
That sounds too disgusting.

291
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:05,751
Miss, miss.

292
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,884
That sounds too casual.

293
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,173
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

294
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:14,103
Yes?

295
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:16,582
Since you gave me a present like this,

296
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,700
<i>I also want to help you with
what you want to do.</i>

297
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:21,352
What should I do for you?

298
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:24,145
I wish that you can be a bit quieter.

299
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:26,970
I want to do something for you!

300
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:30,020
Say what you want. Woong, Woong!

301
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:33,997
- Woong! Woong! Woong! Woong!
- You're so noisy.

302
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:36,227
If you can't even be quiet
when I tell you to,

303
00:22:36,328 --> 00:22:38,450
what else could you do for me?

304
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,999
Whatever you want, I will do it for you.

305
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:42,547
Really?

306
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:47,548
Then, if I tell you quit eating meat,
can you do it?

307
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,295
I'm not planning on giving Gu Mi Ho
any excessive requests.

308
00:22:53,396 --> 00:22:56,808
You don't have to think about it.
Just be quiet.

309
00:22:58,164 --> 00:22:59,939
I will be quiet.

310
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:02,372
In the future, you definitely
have to tell me.

311
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:04,778
And I will definitely help you fulfill it.

312
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,847
I'll think about it.

313
00:23:11,277 --> 00:23:13,875
Someone's coming!

314
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:15,748
<i>That's right.</i>

315
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:18,316
May I ask, is there a problem?

316
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:22,347
Oh, the director asked us
to clean up this room.

317
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:27,685
Director, during this period of time
that I'm filming the movie,

318
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:31,058
please allow me to continue
living in the room up there.

319
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:33,550
That's a storage room. I was afraid that
you'd think living there is inconvenient.

320
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:36,661
Is it because you have some problems
that you're like this?

321
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,064
I want to concentrate all
my energy on the movie.

322
00:23:39,143 --> 00:23:43,039
If I live here, I can practice
all the time.

323
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,686
Then I'll consider it and let you stay here.

324
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:49,528
I will manage this Action School well.

325
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:52,268
I'll keep watch of the door at night,
and I'll even clean when I have time.

326
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:55,507
<i>I'll also wipe the equipment
so it's sparkling clean.</i>

327
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,514
That house number is covered with dust.

328
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:01,458
I will clean that, too!

329
00:24:02,052 --> 00:24:03,908
I cleaned that yesterday.

330
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:08,070
But if you're going to stay here,
your aunt will be coming in and out.

331
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,198
I'll call her and tell her
to stop coming in and out.

332
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:12,891
That's not it, that's not it!

333
00:24:13,197 --> 00:24:17,590
I'm not a person who's picky about
someone coming in and out.

334
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,790
You can just live here.

335
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:21,317
Thank you!

336
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:25,340
Ah, that's right.

337
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:28,751
Have you seen a girl around here,
with long hair,

338
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:33,352
wearing a white dress who can jump
really high, and run really far?

339
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:35,853
Run far?

340
00:24:47,818 --> 00:24:53,640
If you see her, ask for her phone number.

341
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,733
Mi Ho, by any chance...

342
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:05,545
did the director see you that day,
when you kicked down that wall?

343
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,089
I don't know.

344
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:11,573
Last time he saw me, he started chasing me!

345
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:13,223
Really?

346
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:20,101
Mi Ho, no matter what, don't ever
appear in front of the director.

347
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:22,268
If you see him, you have to run away.

348
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:23,761
Okay.

349
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,585
Real Action. My dream.

350
00:25:32,636 --> 00:25:34,887
What's your name?

351
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,646
Don't even know her name.

352
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,757
Director, we're going to a shop that
makes the best udon soup for lunch.

353
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:42,412
<i>Let's go.</i>

354
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,100
Udon soup?

355
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:47,701
In the near future, don't mention
udon soup in front of me.

356
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,596
Then what do you want to eat?

357
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:52,084
Black food. Black bean noodles.

358
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,058
It's really great!

359
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:58,749
Only special people have it,

360
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:01,053
it's a very rare limited edition
that isn't sold anywhere.

361
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:03,064
Limited editions are good right?

362
00:26:03,165 --> 00:26:04,607
Of course!

363
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:08,206
Once you wear that, you'll look
exactly like a fashionista.

364
00:26:08,307 --> 00:26:10,148
That's good too, right?

365
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:12,016
It's saying that you're smart.

366
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:14,187
<i>I'm already prepared...</i>

367
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:15,848
Ahjumma!

368
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:26,070
My bag looks really smart, right?

369
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:27,715
<i>Ban Do Hoon's Action School
Opening Souvenir</i>

370
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,548
Yes.

371
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,150
Ahjumma's bag is really nice, too.

372
00:26:34,171 --> 00:26:38,073
Ahjumma is also a fashionista.

373
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:45,645
Thanks.

374
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:48,405
Tonight I'm going to eat chicken.

375
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:50,378
Okay.

376
00:26:59,706 --> 00:27:02,679
You and that ahjumma became friends?

377
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:04,685
Do we look like friends?

378
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:08,471
You greeted each other and
talked about a fashion topic.

379
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:11,011
And you even praised her.
Isn't that being friends?

380
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,577
So it's like that!

381
00:27:12,678 --> 00:27:15,578
Then the chicken wing shop's
owner is my friend!

382
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:19,876
You're making friends on your own.
Good job.

383
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,378
Who is this?

384
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,962
This is Cha Dae Woong, right?
I'm Park Dong Ju.

385
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,377
Who?

386
00:27:33,478 --> 00:27:36,476
If Mi Ho is with you,
please give her the phone.

387
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,169
Mi Ho?

388
00:27:38,693 --> 00:27:40,527
Is it Mr. Dong Ju?

389
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:43,361
He told me to give you the phone.

390
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:46,010
Oh, Mr. Dong Ju. It's me.

391
00:27:46,544 --> 00:27:48,932
I'm very curious about your progress.

392
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,049
You're doing well, right?

393
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,575
Yes. Wait a minute.

394
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,936
Hey, just talk over here.

395
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,159
I listened to what you said
and didn't mention mating.

396
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:07,469
Do you know what Cha Dae Woong
wants now?

397
00:28:07,513 --> 00:28:09,945
He said that he'll tell me later.

398
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:14,167
Whatever Dae Woong wants,
I will definitely do it.

399
00:28:16,323 --> 00:28:18,840
It seems like their relationship is good.

400
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,253
I'll go over and hang out another day.

401
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:29,071
Who was it?

402
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:31,070
Park Dong Ju.

403
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:33,971
Mr. Dong Ju is my friend.

404
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,938
Friend?

405
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:40,428
Mr. Dong Ju?

406
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:43,329
She said she'll come over and hang out?

407
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:47,990
Seems she thinks I'm her friend.

408
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:52,068
She doesn't even know
what I want her to do.

409
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:54,369
It ought to be like this.

410
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:01,565
You even have a friend who
you can hang out with?

411
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:04,714
He treats me very well
and we're very close.

412
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,089
That person doesn't know you're a gumiho,
so he's treating you well,

413
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,224
and you're very close?

414
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:12,829
Hiding your true identity and then
hanging out with him is wrong, isn't it?

415
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:15,559
What does he do?

416
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,360
How did you meet?

417
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,769
Woong.

418
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,170
Don't ask any questions
related to Mr. Dong Ju.

419
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,840
I'm not curious,

420
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:25,611
I'm just a bit worried about that guy.

421
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:29,685
Don't worry, I won't do anything bad to him.

422
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,033
What?

423
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:34,734
Won't do anything bad?

424
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:40,718
Threatening to eat me, tormenting
me to buy meat for her to eat,

425
00:29:41,371 --> 00:29:44,805
But pretending to be kind
to her new friend.

426
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,042
If something happens to him, I'll feel bad.

427
00:29:52,143 --> 00:29:54,704
Tell him to stop calling me in the future.

428
00:29:54,896 --> 00:29:55,962
I understand.

429
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:58,463
I'll tell him to stop calling.

430
00:29:58,572 --> 00:30:00,691
I'll just go and hang out with him.

431
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:07,837
It sounded like a young man.

432
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,655
Looks like he's enchanted by her looks.

433
00:30:12,722 --> 00:30:16,122
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk... how foolish.

434
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:39,623
Wow... so pretty.

435
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:54,573
There are a lot of people looking at her,
drooling with greed.

436
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:08,427
The bus is here, let's go.

437
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:10,053
Okay.

438
00:31:47,565 --> 00:31:49,438
Didn't you tell me to keep
a distance from you?

439
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:51,039
Why are you sitting beside me?

440
00:31:52,063 --> 00:31:54,557
I never thought much about it,

441
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:57,158
but I have the task of protecting
these foolish people.

442
00:31:57,258 --> 00:31:59,441
I can't just not care.

443
00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:04,728
My childhood dream was to become Batman,

444
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:08,229
but I've never thought of using
this way of protecting the world.

445
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:11,118
Ah, what a pain.

446
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:14,515
<i>Excuse me.</i>

447
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:16,827
What?

448
00:32:21,254 --> 00:32:22,210
What do you want?

449
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,977
You're Cha Dae Woong sunbae, right?

450
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:27,378
I'm your high school junior,
do you remember?

451
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:32,045
Hoobae, you look kind of familiar.

452
00:32:32,146 --> 00:32:33,484
Really?

453
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:35,686
Your name is...?

454
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:37,764
Mi Nyeo, Go Mi Nyeo.

455
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:41,962
That's right, it's Mi Nyeo!
Right, right, right!

456
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,346
I even wrote you a letter
at the graduation ceremony.

457
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:46,206
Did you?

458
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:49,348
<i>You've gotten more handsome.</i>

459
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:52,093
Mi Nyeo got prettier, too.

460
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,636
I have to get off at this stop.

461
00:32:54,737 --> 00:32:56,637
Sunbae, you've changed phone numbers, right?

462
00:32:56,737 --> 00:32:58,491
Yes, I changed numbers.

463
00:32:58,592 --> 00:33:00,192
<i>My number is...</i>

464
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:14,839
I'm sorry for bothering you
and your girlfriend.

465
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:22,576
Mi Nyeo, bye.

466
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,680
Mi Nyeo, bye.

467
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:31,989
<i>This ring is amazing.</i>

468
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,590
<i>Just by showing it to them, they will leave.</i>

469
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:39,158
That's right, they all left.

470
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:43,929
Woong, because I didn't let you continue
talking to that woman, are you angry?

471
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,870
She's my very close hoobae whom
I haven't seen in a long time.

472
00:33:46,963 --> 00:33:50,065
Because of you, she left before
I even greeted her properly.

473
00:33:50,123 --> 00:33:51,305
If I didn't intervene,

474
00:33:51,832 --> 00:33:54,232
I was afraid that you'd want to mate
with her and run off with her.

475
00:33:56,813 --> 00:33:58,920
What do you take me for?

476
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:02,118
Hey, I'm not that type of an easy man.

477
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:04,195
I'm popular,

478
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:08,296
but I've only had one person in
my heart and it has never changed.

479
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:13,198
Is that person the person from last time?

480
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,705
Yes, it's Hae In noona.

481
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,828
If you like her that much,

482
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,529
why didn't you make her
your girlfriend earlier?

483
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:24,195
I even had the rings prepared,
but it didn't work out.

484
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:30,530
By any chance, that ring
isn't this one, right?

485
00:34:32,443 --> 00:34:34,882
You originally wanted to give it to her,
but she didn't want it,

486
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:37,003
so you gave it to me?

487
00:34:37,045 --> 00:34:39,583
Noona never said that she didn't like me.

488
00:34:39,684 --> 00:34:42,684
If I asked her now, she'd definitely
say she likes me.

489
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:44,689
You can't be like this!

490
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:47,988
I know, so it's okay.

491
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:50,420
I didn't give her the ring,

492
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,121
so you have the opportunity to wear it.

493
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,339
What?

494
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,540
I'm wearing it because of that?

495
00:34:56,755 --> 00:34:59,855
Between you who's wearing noona's ring
and me who gave you that ring,

496
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:02,356
I'm the one more deserving of sympathy.

497
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:06,537
If you don't like it,
then give it back to me.

498
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,119
Okay, I'll take mine off too.

499
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:12,919
Wearing this makes me nervous.

500
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,020
Taking it off, of course,
makes me feel more relaxed.

501
00:35:15,127 --> 00:35:17,246
Enough, just wear it.

502
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:23,577
Let's go.

503
00:35:27,587 --> 00:35:28,969
Why?

504
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,070
Are we going somewhere where
only humans can enter again?

505
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,872
You're finally starting to
get the hang of things.

506
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:35,373
Wait here.

507
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:39,874
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

508
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:43,675
<i>As I sing a song</i>

509
00:35:43,776 --> 00:35:49,950
<i>I will dream and sing your name</i>

510
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:54,577
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

511
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:59,078
<i>As your woman,</i>

512
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:05,279
<i>Lovingly, I will only look at you.
Sha la la la la la</i>

513
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,180
<i>As I sing a song</i>

514
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:15,681
<i>I will dream and sing your name</i>

515
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:20,082
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

516
00:36:20,183 --> 00:36:22,683
<i>As your woman</i>

517
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:27,984
<i>Lovingly, I will only look at you.</i>

518
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:33,803
Why don't you come in, too?

519
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,382
I can go in too?

520
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,982
Although I don't feel confident in you,
but I'll try and see.

521
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:46,275
But you have to observe quietly,

522
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,476
you definitely can't stir up trouble.

523
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:50,935
I know, I'll just observe obediently.

524
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:52,206
Go in!

525
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:53,607
Wait a minute!

526
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:57,333
This has dirt, wipe it off.

527
00:36:58,005 --> 00:37:00,313
Don't touch anything without
permission, understand?

528
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:02,011
Let's go.

529
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:06,100
In here, you just have to listen seriously
and pay attention in class.

530
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:07,545
So you just have to listen?

531
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:08,672
Yes.

532
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:11,873
Occasionally the professor will
ask someone for a response.

533
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:14,086
You definitely can't make eye contact.

534
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:15,498
I understand.

535
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:16,945
<i>There are too many extras
that have to be filmed.</i>

536
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:18,840
The class's curriculum needs to be adjusted.

537
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:20,194
That's right.

538
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,002
<i>You definitely can't make eye contact.</i>

539
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:28,661
It's nice.

540
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,560
You look awkward if you sit there like that.
Open this.

541
00:37:36,362 --> 00:37:38,033
What is this?

542
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:39,134
Are these words?

543
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:42,325
That's English, English.

544
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,305
This is a foreign language.

545
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:49,223
Can you read this?

546
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:51,324
Read a bit.

547
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:55,680
Mi Ho, I think you're too nervous.

548
00:37:55,944 --> 00:37:58,772
I'm very nervous.

549
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:00,973
It feels like my tails are
going to stand up.

550
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:05,584
To relieve your pressure, I'll buy
some soda water. Wait for me.

551
00:38:09,276 --> 00:38:11,364
You definitely can't let anyone else
know that you're not a student.

552
00:38:11,565 --> 00:38:12,765
Yes.

553
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:27,732
It feels like I've really become human.

554
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:35,874
If I fall asleep in class,
I'll be really embarrassed.

555
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:38,209
I'll drink some coffee before going in.

556
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,320
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

557
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:47,111
You're going to drink coffee?

558
00:38:47,212 --> 00:38:48,509
Yes.

559
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:52,801
Then get me a drink, too.

560
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,981
Coins...

561
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:03,463
<i>What do you want to drink?</i>

562
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:05,706
Oh, there's fruit beverages in here.

563
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,075
Fruit is beneficial to the skin
and the body.

564
00:39:11,952 --> 00:39:13,496
Why don't you drink that?

565
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,125
Give me two bottles.

566
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:17,685
I'm going to eat sandwiches with a friend.

567
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:18,903
Two.

568
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:25,631
Did you come here to attend class?

569
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:26,781
Yes.

570
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:28,983
Where's the classroom?

571
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:31,159
Over there.

572
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:37,200
<i>Here.</i>

573
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,646
<i>Thanks.</i>

574
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:46,855
Also, I'm sorry, Dae Woong.

575
00:39:47,748 --> 00:39:52,801
Last time I wanted to advise you,
so I said some ruthless words.

576
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:55,327
I think I overdid it.

577
00:39:55,716 --> 00:39:58,741
You understand my heart, right?

578
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:00,481
Oh,

579
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,382
Noona. I'm doing pretty well.

580
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:06,282
Don't worry.

581
00:40:07,928 --> 00:40:10,564
Pay attention in class. I'm leaving.

582
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,365
Noona, I'll call you.

583
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:22,866
Aish!

584
00:40:24,474 --> 00:40:27,124
Ah, it went that far under?

585
00:40:31,104 --> 00:40:32,661
<i>Come quickly.</i>

586
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,797
I'm going to take this to someone.

587
00:40:45,898 --> 00:40:47,798
Wait a bit.

588
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:00,689
Noona!

589
00:41:10,622 --> 00:41:12,658
How strange.

590
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,589
What's wrong?

591
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:36,345
Did I scare you?

592
00:41:36,434 --> 00:41:38,240
Don't be scared anymore.

593
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:40,441
I just knew that you'd get scared.

594
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:42,516
Noona has been scared this thoroughly.

595
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:44,617
I really feel successful.

596
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,760
It's your evildoing again!

597
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:50,735
What were you doing,
coming to the classroom?

598
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:55,469
This sandwich... I came here
to give it to you.

599
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,639
Ah, sandwich.

600
00:41:57,832 --> 00:41:59,080
Thanks, Noona.

601
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:02,249
It's time for you to go to class, right?

602
00:42:02,327 --> 00:42:04,317
<i>I don't have anything to do,</i>

603
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:06,118
is it okay if I attend class with you?

604
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,519
I don't have a class.

605
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,721
I got it wrong.

606
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:14,109
I let Byung Soo help me choose classes.
I got some mixed up.

607
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,676
You don't have a class?

608
00:42:15,777 --> 00:42:17,677
Then eat with me!

609
00:42:18,729 --> 00:42:20,423
Okay.

610
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,712
I'll go get my bag.

611
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:25,240
Count to one hundred,
wait for me to get back.

612
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,641
Yes.

613
00:42:42,533 --> 00:42:46,049
I have some administration problems,

614
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,683
and I have to go the department office.

615
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:49,995
Really? Let's go!

616
00:42:50,096 --> 00:42:51,814
<i>Mi Ho,</i>

617
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:54,815
didn't you want to attend class?

618
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:57,733
<i>You stay and listen to the class.
I'll be right back.</i>

619
00:42:57,823 --> 00:43:00,792
Don't go anywhere, just stay here.

620
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:06,475
This is the teaching material, read this.

621
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:11,032
If you're bored, just jot down
what the professor is saying.

622
00:43:15,178 --> 00:43:16,931
I'll be right back.

623
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,573
Noona!

624
00:43:28,537 --> 00:43:31,693
In front of the school there's a newly-
opened Chinese restaurant, let's go there.

625
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:33,161
Oh?

626
00:43:33,495 --> 00:43:35,892
Let's just eat sandwiches here.

627
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:38,821
I'm apologizing to you
along the way, it's on me.

628
00:43:38,922 --> 00:43:40,611
Let's drive my car there.

629
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:50,954
Nothing should happen, right?

630
00:44:02,276 --> 00:44:04,286
<i>Regarding the classification
of normal behaviour,</i>

631
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,167
<i>there are a few points for discussion below.</i>

632
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,356
That student. What's wrong?

633
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,618
The student with her hand raised,
what is it?

634
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,426
What?

635
00:44:38,395 --> 00:44:40,048
<i>A fly.</i>

636
00:44:45,176 --> 00:44:47,568
I want to know everything.

637
00:44:48,036 --> 00:44:52,240
Dae Woong was right, I can't make
eye contact with him.

638
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,152
I'll wait for him outside.

639
00:44:58,998 --> 00:45:00,987
I want black bean noodles.

640
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,650
No, I said that I'm inviting
you to eat something good.

641
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,944
We'll have two sets of meal A.

642
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:09,345
<i>Yes.</i>

643
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:12,088
Meal A?

644
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:19,036
Wow, it's really long.

645
00:45:19,408 --> 00:45:21,395
Eat slowly.

646
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,169
Okay, slowly.

647
00:45:32,972 --> 00:45:35,307
When is Dae Woong coming?

648
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,822
I'm starving to death.

649
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,774
I'll just go home by myself.

650
00:45:59,305 --> 00:46:01,444
Dad, thank you!

651
00:46:17,668 --> 00:46:19,107
Real Action.

652
00:46:30,298 --> 00:46:32,930
Wow, she's faster than a car.

653
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:34,536
And it seems like she hasn't
even run that much.

654
00:46:34,637 --> 00:46:37,247
Seriously, she's already so far ahead.

655
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,745
Oh, hurry.

656
00:47:17,773 --> 00:47:21,045
Ah, what's wrong with me?

657
00:47:21,584 --> 00:47:23,894
My body feels strange.

658
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:28,100
<i>You will gradually die.</i>

659
00:47:30,704 --> 00:47:32,758
The fruits after the meal.

660
00:47:41,647 --> 00:47:43,804
I'm finished, let's go!

661
00:47:43,911 --> 00:47:45,902
Why are you eating so fast?

662
00:47:46,103 --> 00:47:47,303
Be careful, you could get indigestion.

663
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:49,636
Oh, probably because I was too hungry.

664
00:47:49,737 --> 00:47:52,037
I swallowed before I could chew.

665
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:53,701
Let's go, Noona.

666
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:02,507
Ah, I think I got indigestion.

667
00:48:09,669 --> 00:48:10,976
What?

668
00:48:11,277 --> 00:48:15,477
I thought that she'd be waiting for me here.

669
00:48:17,321 --> 00:48:22,263
I wolfed down a meal, and ran
over flustered and confused.

670
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:24,460
But she went home by herself.

671
00:48:31,398 --> 00:48:34,145
You really came over.

672
00:48:34,671 --> 00:48:37,682
My body is acting strange.

673
00:48:40,878 --> 00:48:45,271
Suddenly, there was something
thumping in my body.

674
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:48,392
My throat felt suffocated all at once.
And then my body started to heat up,

675
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:50,993
I couldn't move for awhile.

676
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:52,761
It's really uncomfortable.

677
00:48:53,202 --> 00:48:55,587
That's called pain.

678
00:48:55,692 --> 00:48:58,728
You've never experienced pain before,
so you'll feel alarmed.

679
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:01,365
But humans often get injured
and will feel pain.

680
00:49:01,466 --> 00:49:05,537
Then that means I'm a bit
similar to humans now?

681
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:07,387
That could count.

682
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:10,116
<i>You'll still feel like that in the future.</i>

683
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:13,104
It'll get worse as time passes.

684
00:49:13,205 --> 00:49:14,277
<i>Can you bear it?</i>

685
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:17,637
As long as I become human,
I'll have to bear it.

686
00:49:22,774 --> 00:49:24,235
I thought you didn't eat meat.

687
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,983
You said that you'd come hang out,
so I prepared this.

688
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:29,590
Weren't you in pain? Eat lots.

689
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:32,180
Humans are all like this.

690
00:49:39,413 --> 00:49:41,318
Originally today was chicken day.

691
00:49:41,419 --> 00:49:45,381
If Mi Ho knew we're eating beef today,
she'd be even happier.

692
00:49:47,293 --> 00:49:52,724
Today I'm specially giving you
Grade A Korean beef to eat.

693
00:49:53,495 --> 00:49:55,733
After heating the grill,
we can eat right away.

694
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,721
It's very cold.

695
00:50:21,122 --> 00:50:27,122
<i>How did I come to meet you,
what kind of fate is this?</i>

696
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:32,423
<i>The more I see you,
my heartbeat seems to get stranger</i>

697
00:50:32,524 --> 00:50:36,524
<i>Could it be love?
I'm starting to like you so much</i>

698
00:50:36,621 --> 00:50:38,263
It's late.

699
00:50:39,664 --> 00:50:44,664
<i>Does she know my heart feels like this?</i>

700
00:50:44,828 --> 00:50:49,019
<i>Mr. Dong Ju, this is the place where I live.</i>

701
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,864
Ohh.

702
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:55,405
<i>That's Mr. Dong Ju?</i>

703
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:58,883
He's not that good looking.

704
00:50:58,984 --> 00:51:00,287
Let's hang out next time.

705
00:51:00,388 --> 00:51:02,149
<i>I will prepare lots of meat.</i>

706
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,250
Meat?

707
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:07,256
Mr. Dong Ju, the meat you gave me
to eat today was really delicious.

708
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:09,026
Was it expensive?

709
00:51:09,127 --> 00:51:11,741
Of course it's expensive. Very.

710
00:51:11,808 --> 00:51:13,364
So it is.

711
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:15,027
Then Dae Woong definitely won't
buy it for me to eat.

712
00:51:15,128 --> 00:51:16,450
That girl...

713
00:51:18,872 --> 00:51:20,313
What is he doing?

714
00:51:22,296 --> 00:51:24,466
You're fine now.

715
00:51:24,587 --> 00:51:26,870
Next time you're uncomfortable,
come find me.

716
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:28,286
Okay.

717
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:36,859
Oh, it's Dae Woong!

718
00:51:40,155 --> 00:51:42,433
There's something that I'm curious about.

719
00:51:42,544 --> 00:51:45,461
Why do you call me Mr. Dong Ju?

720
00:51:45,554 --> 00:51:49,572
Because you're my teacher who's
teaching me how to become human.

721
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,380
So of course it'll be Mr. Dong Ju.

722
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:54,430
Do you trust me completely?

723
00:51:54,437 --> 00:51:55,810
Have you lied to me?

724
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:59,556
No. I've never lied to you before.

725
00:51:59,657 --> 00:52:04,041
Although... I haven't told you everything.

726
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:07,137
Then I'll still find you
to continue learning.

727
00:52:07,238 --> 00:52:09,442
Wait for me. Bye, bye!

728
00:52:14,288 --> 00:52:16,226
Wait for you.

729
00:52:17,412 --> 00:52:21,059
Making me wait for you.

730
00:52:30,004 --> 00:52:32,106
Oh, it's beef!

731
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:33,557
Is it Korean beef?

732
00:52:34,011 --> 00:52:36,880
What, this is cheap beef.

733
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:38,406
Why is the one who came back
after eating expensive beef,

734
00:52:38,507 --> 00:52:39,907
still running over here to eat cheap beef?

735
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:44,002
Oh, so you heard what I said to Mr. Dong Ju.

736
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:48,816
Isn't your behaviour incorrect?

737
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,298
Hiding your true identity,

738
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:53,699
eating the expensive meat that a man bought
for you, riding in his expensive car.

739
00:52:53,952 --> 00:52:55,768
You're a gumiho, not a seductress!

740
00:52:55,869 --> 00:53:00,000
First you say I'm a dog.
Now you're saying I'm a seductress.

741
00:53:00,101 --> 00:53:02,547
Hey, I'm a gumiho.

742
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:05,472
That's right, you're a gumiho.

743
00:53:05,535 --> 00:53:09,892
A gumiho who can kick a wall into
pieces is pretending to be sick?

744
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:14,595
He's worried for you and
even touched your forehead.

745
00:53:16,678 --> 00:53:18,309
"I'm a weak and helpless girl."

746
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,779
"I want to eat beef."

747
00:53:20,848 --> 00:53:22,491
"Very expensive beef."

748
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,499
Is that what you did?

749
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,576
Where did you put the ring?

750
00:53:29,677 --> 00:53:31,060
Ring.

751
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,947
That's right, ring!

752
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:36,598
<i>Wow!</i>

753
00:53:42,184 --> 00:53:43,410
<i>It's here, found it!</i>

754
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,473
Mi Ho, you're still very powerful.

755
00:53:45,574 --> 00:53:47,556
Three strong men couldn't even lift this up.

756
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,306
You really are special.

757
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:55,442
Why is the ring here?

758
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:05,065
It rolled under there and I had no
idea how to get it out by myself.

759
00:54:05,794 --> 00:54:09,615
Look, Mi Ho, you already found
the ring, and even some coins.

760
00:54:09,716 --> 00:54:12,838
This is enough to buy three
bottles of soda water.

761
00:54:12,943 --> 00:54:16,237
I asked, why did the ring roll under there?

762
00:54:16,394 --> 00:54:19,269
Why did the ring roll under there?

763
00:54:21,427 --> 00:54:24,353
When I was taking it off, it fell down.

764
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,201
Why did you take it off?

765
00:54:26,486 --> 00:54:28,780
I saw Hae In noona.

766
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:31,434
I didn't want her to see the ring.

767
00:54:31,514 --> 00:54:33,885
So it fell while I was taking it off.

768
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:37,937
Turns out that you left me
by myself to see that noona.

769
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:42,016
Yes, I went to see Hae In noona
and ate with her.

770
00:54:42,055 --> 00:54:45,681
But nothing happened,
the bead is still fine.

771
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:47,997
Isn't that all right?

772
00:54:48,026 --> 00:54:51,664
Just like you concealed the
ring from that noona,

773
00:54:52,148 --> 00:54:53,072
are you going to conceal me, too?

774
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:58,146
That's right. If I can do it, it'll
be best to hide it from her.

775
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:00,453
Is that your wish?

776
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:02,092
What if it is?

777
00:55:02,193 --> 00:55:03,880
That's right. You said before,
whatever I wish for,

778
00:55:03,988 --> 00:55:04,988
you're going to help me achieve it, right?

779
00:55:05,724 --> 00:55:10,562
Then what if my wish is concealing it from
Hae In noona, will you help me achieve that?

780
00:55:12,259 --> 00:55:13,176
No.

781
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:15,530
I knew you'd be like this.

782
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,911
Since you're not going to
help me do it anyway,

783
00:55:17,225 --> 00:55:18,798
why did you ask me what I wish for?

784
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:23,385
Other than this, just say something else!

785
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,218
I don't have any other wishes.

786
00:55:28,677 --> 00:55:32,266
Humans don't dare to mention
any wishes to gumihos.

787
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:35,948
Regarding you, I don't have anything I want.

788
00:55:35,968 --> 00:55:37,415
Then you...

789
00:55:38,854 --> 00:55:42,047
The only thing you want
from me is the bead?

790
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:49,853
Isn't that asking the obvious?

791
00:56:28,449 --> 00:56:31,806
Why does she always run away
from me as soon as she sees me?

792
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,425
Look into my eyes.

793
00:56:34,526 --> 00:56:36,953
Do I look like an abnormal person?

794
00:56:37,076 --> 00:56:42,629
Honestly speaking, if there was a guy like
Director chasing me, I would run away too.

795
00:56:43,129 --> 00:56:45,464
<i>Stop chasing that girl away.</i>

796
00:56:45,565 --> 00:56:48,146
Just make do with Kim Hee Joon
as the female lead.

797
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:50,430
You little...

798
00:57:04,857 --> 00:57:06,889
<i>Are you okay?</i>

799
00:57:12,879 --> 00:57:14,892
I'm okay.

800
00:57:31,293 --> 00:57:32,723
Oh, brother.

801
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,132
Brother, thank you.

802
00:57:38,646 --> 00:57:40,600
Oh, he should've arrived.

803
00:57:40,634 --> 00:57:43,365
At the bar on the 19th floor, right?

804
00:57:43,505 --> 00:57:45,097
Okay, wait for me.

805
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,112
<i>Thank you.</i>

806
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:53,213
<i>I love you, you fool</i>

807
00:57:53,314 --> 00:57:56,714
<i>I want to be with you</i>

808
00:57:56,815 --> 00:58:03,415
<i>Honestly, I only want to
send you all my heart</i>

809
00:58:03,516 --> 00:58:06,916
<i>I stop in front of you</i>

810
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:11,017
<i>I become ice like a fool</i>

811
00:58:11,118 --> 00:58:15,218
<i>Even like this, I love you</i>

812
00:58:15,331 --> 00:58:18,376
Why are you always avoiding me?

813
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:22,266
Please don't be like this.

814
00:58:23,343 --> 00:58:25,378
Please let go of me.

815
00:58:28,808 --> 00:58:30,077
Let go of me.

816
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:32,052
<i>Please let go of me!</i>

817
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:33,474
Let go!

818
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:35,475
<i>Let go!</i>

819
00:58:38,404 --> 00:58:40,043
Director Ban!

820
00:58:40,426 --> 00:58:44,025
Are you making me carry you on my back?

821
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:47,192
I say...

822
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,841
Oh my God, Director Ban!

823
00:58:53,965 --> 00:58:56,008
My dad's phone is off.

824
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:00,881
There's still no accurate news of who'll
be confirmed as the female lead?

825
00:59:00,982 --> 00:59:03,539
Tomorrow I'll help you ask my dad.

826
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:09,285
But the girl my dad is looking for
seems to be a student at our school.

827
00:59:09,351 --> 00:59:10,921
What?

828
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:14,256
That shouldn't be right.

829
00:59:14,357 --> 00:59:17,273
My dad said the he saw her at school today.

830
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:21,599
You're saying that she was
at our school today?

831
00:59:27,532 --> 00:59:31,035
Unni! What's with the couple ring
that Cha Dae Woong is wearing?

832
00:59:31,136 --> 00:59:32,424
Did you ask him?

833
00:59:33,705 --> 00:59:37,911
When we met today, he wasn't
wearing a couple ring.

834
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,808
Really?

835
00:59:41,182 --> 00:59:43,957
Byung Soo didn't see it clearly then.

836
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:47,389
On my way home, I'll make a trip
to the Action School along the way.

837
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,592
To see Cha Dae Woong.

838
00:59:50,014 --> 00:59:52,605
Dae Woong didn't go home?

839
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:55,410
He's living over there again.

840
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:59,747
Unni, you don't even know that?

841
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:24,952
Why does my heart feel so congested?

842
01:00:28,276 --> 01:00:30,648
Is it indigestion?

843
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:56,766
Mi Ho, you're... oh!

844
01:01:00,589 --> 01:01:01,817
<i>Look at you, look at you.</i>

845
01:01:01,918 --> 01:01:04,629
You've spread out all your tails,
what are you doing?

846
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:08,071
Do you have a problem with a
gumiho letting her tails out?

847
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:12,191
In the future, I'm going to spread
out my tails and live diligently.

848
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:17,533
You're drunk.

849
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:20,422
You drank the whole box.

850
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:22,783
And soju?

851
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:40,912
Dae Woong, you're too much.

852
01:01:41,176 --> 01:01:44,082
Because I'm not a human,
you look down on me.

853
01:01:44,344 --> 01:01:47,364
Mi Ho, clear your head,
put away your tails first.

854
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:50,068
They're so bright,
they're visible from far away.

855
01:01:50,152 --> 01:01:52,340
Extinguish the light from your tails.

856
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:56,218
Is that your wish?

857
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:57,780
Yes.

858
01:01:57,963 --> 01:02:01,069
Okay, then I'll definitely do it.

859
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:16,185
That's good.

860
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:18,388
Spreading out your tails as
you please is very dangerous.

861
01:02:18,489 --> 01:02:20,505
<i>Don't do that anymore in the future.</i>

862
01:02:20,915 --> 01:02:23,999
What else? What other wishes do you have?

863
01:02:30,478 --> 01:02:34,525
But you have to help me
with everything I wish for.

864
01:02:39,157 --> 01:02:43,008
Oh, that nail is sticking out,
it'll poke someone.

865
01:02:43,109 --> 01:02:44,352
Hammer it back in.

866
01:02:44,464 --> 01:02:46,225
I got it.

867
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:51,846
Wow, good job!

868
01:02:52,979 --> 01:02:54,124
What else?

869
01:02:54,161 --> 01:02:55,854
Again?

870
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,855
What else...

871
01:02:59,185 --> 01:03:03,735
Oh, they're too noisy.
You make them be quiet.

872
01:03:10,338 --> 01:03:13,756
Wow, our Mi Ho's voice is really loud!

873
01:03:15,972 --> 01:03:18,647
Really? What else, what else, what else?

874
01:03:18,748 --> 01:03:23,187
What else... what else is there?

875
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,332
Oh, the mosquitoes flying around here,
kill all of them.

876
01:03:27,372 --> 01:03:29,761
That's something I do every day.

877
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:35,507
Something you do every day?

878
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:40,722
I don't want mosquitoes to bite you,
so I kill mosquitoes every day.

879
01:03:41,647 --> 01:03:45,928
So that's why I've never gotten
a mosquito bite here.

880
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:50,734
Ah, after I drink, I can't hit them anymore.

881
01:03:56,276 --> 01:03:58,028
These stupid mosquitoes,

882
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,732
because our gumiho is drunk,
they're looking down on her.

883
01:04:03,558 --> 01:04:05,216
Oh! I killed it!

884
01:04:05,317 --> 01:04:06,609
I killed it!

885
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,669
There's another one!

886
01:04:15,958 --> 01:04:18,969
Hey, you're scaring me on purpose, right?

887
01:04:19,052 --> 01:04:21,023
Stretch out your hand, let me see.

888
01:04:22,581 --> 01:04:23,780
Let me see!

889
01:04:23,907 --> 01:04:25,813
Stretch out your hand, let me see!

890
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,735
Gumiho isn't any different from before,
even when she's drunk.

891
01:04:28,836 --> 01:04:29,896
Let me see.

892
01:04:40,217 --> 01:04:41,897
Let me see.

893
01:04:44,843 --> 01:04:47,700
Oh, it's that woman.

894
01:04:48,089 --> 01:04:49,155
What?

895
01:04:58,068 --> 01:05:00,056
She's coming over here.

896
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:04,469
Who's coming?

897
01:05:09,492 --> 01:05:10,718
Mi Ho!

898
01:05:14,354 --> 01:05:16,367
Dae Woong!

899
01:05:16,468 --> 01:05:19,368
Your true wish, I'm helping you fulfill it.

900
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:23,576
All of your wishes, I'll help you
fulfill all of them.

901
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:26,914
Because I like you.

902
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,404
Dae Woong?

903
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:39,972
I'll hide.

904
01:05:44,118 --> 01:05:44,845
Mi Ho!

905
01:05:46,127 --> 01:05:48,005
Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

906
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:54,944
Mi Ho!

907
01:05:55,445 --> 01:05:56,195
<i>Mi Ho!</i>
