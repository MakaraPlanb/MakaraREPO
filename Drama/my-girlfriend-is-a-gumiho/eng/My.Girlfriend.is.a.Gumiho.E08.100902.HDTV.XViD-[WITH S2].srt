EPISODE 8

4
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:29,753
<i>I still don't understand love,</i>

5
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:34,442
<i>So I'm unable to get closer</i>

6
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:45,445
<i>But why does my silly heart keep pounding?</i>

7
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,940
You won't disappear.

8
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:56,223
You'll be happy and let him live on well.

9
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:01,230
Don't listen to what other people say.

10
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,938
Everything I say is true.

11
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:07,914
Just believe in what I say.

12
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:11,059
I won't disappear.

13
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:14,303
I'll be happy and let him live on well.

14
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:18,645
Dae Woong, you're right.

15
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,157
Good,

16
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:25,258
so don't cry.

17
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:27,323
It'll rain.

18
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,425
<i>A day has passed, all I think about is you.</i>

19
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:35,816
Let's go.

20
00:01:36,732 --> 00:01:38,768
OK, let's go.

21
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,970
<i>What should I do?</i>

22
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,982
We're too late for the movie premiere.

23
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,250
<i>Let's see a different movie.</i>

24
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:54,151
Wait here.

25
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:55,376
Okay.

26
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,124
Looks like they're on a date too.

27
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:32,668
Tastes good!

28
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,418
Is she copying Oh Ji Myung*?
[*Korean actor]

29
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,163
Dragon woman, dragon woman*
[*lines from the drama]

30
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:03,943
Could it be that she
learned it from Teacher Dong Ju?

31
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:06,382
Doesn't even understand what she learned.

32
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:08,145
<i>Soft drink.</i>

33
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:38,616
<i>This is mine!</i>

34
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:41,917
You can't randomly stick your
straw into someone else's cup.

35
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:47,724
Did Teacher Dong Ju teach you this?

36
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:56,127
<i>I think that I understand my heart.</i>

37
00:03:56,228 --> 00:04:02,142
<i>When it's sunny out, I want to hold
your hand and walk down the street.</i>

38
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,499
I was planning on giving it to you.

39
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,400
Ah, really

40
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:07,801
Here.

41
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:11,292
You can't even bear it for a little while.

42
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:20,338
<i>Let me confess what my heart is saying.</i>

43
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:26,706
<i>Ay, ay, ay, I don't want tears.</i>

44
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:32,829
Okay, okay, I'll give it to you!

45
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:37,174
<i>Here.
[Package label: beef jerky]</i>

46
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:42,334
No smell can escape your nose.

47
00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:45,235
<i>I love you.</i>

48
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:54,747
<i>Come quietly to the window
when the morning sun calls.</i>

49
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:00,086
<i>Covering my ears, I want to hear your voice.</i>

50
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:04,178
Look Dae Woong!

51
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,279
Mi Ho, let go, let go.

52
00:05:07,378 --> 00:05:08,587
<i>Let go of my arm!</i>

53
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:11,988
Mi Ho, let go, let go.

54
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:13,589
Let go….

55
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,669
<i>Ay, ay, ay, I don't want tears.</i>

56
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:27,019
Woong, the movie theater is very fun!

57
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,420
I laughed so hard,
my tails were going to fall off.

58
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:32,080
You're going to dislocate it.

59
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:36,281
Woong, dates really are very enjoyable.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,044
What? Date?

61
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:41,349
Aren't we on a date right now?

62
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,813
Who said such irresponsible words?

63
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:45,959
Where did you hear it from?

64
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:49,407
It's not Teacher Dong Ju again right?

65
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:53,240
He heard that I was going to the theater,
so he told me to have a good date.

66
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:56,360
That teacher is very immoral.

67
00:05:56,372 --> 00:06:00,471
Next time I see him,
I have to teach him a lesson.

68
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:04,465
Mi Ho, what he's teaching you is wrong.

69
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:07,563
Right now, we're not on a date.

70
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:08,569
Then what is it?

71
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,077
This is…

72
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:14,189
This is taking a walk, taking a walk.

73
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:16,244
<i>I used to always take my pets out.</i>

74
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:18,326
Now it has changed to you.

75
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,009
<i>Let's go.</i>

76
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:23,858
Woong, don't grab onto this.

77
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,362
Let's hold hands and take a walk.

78
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:31,675
No, when I took walks with my pets,
I held a leash like this too.

79
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:35,526
Your pets only have paws,
but don't I have hands?

80
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:42,234
No, no, no.

81
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,122
We're taking a walk.

82
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,964
It's you hoobae.

83
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:54,445
<i>He left in such a hurry,
seems he went to look for his girlfriend.</i>

84
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,422
His girlfriend is very beautiful.

85
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:20,798
Wow, that's too awesome.

86
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,085
Wow, that's too awesome.

87
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:30,226
Dae Woong, you like this?

88
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:32,679
Yeah, it's great.

89
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:34,237
Wonder how much this costs?

90
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:36,339
Do you want this?

91
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:38,747
I won't use it.

92
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:43,533
But if I had it and if I was standing at
a place like that, it'll be really great.

93
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:49,452
Woong, when you see that, are you happy?

94
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,302
If you had that, would you be happy?

95
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,744
Of course, of course I'd be happy.

96
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,907
What? You're going to buy it for me?

97
00:07:58,097 --> 00:07:59,124
It's probably really expensive.

98
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:00,862
Very expensive.

99
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:03,276
How will you be able to buy that?

100
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:05,119
<i>I'm so hungry.</i>

101
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:06,945
What should we eat?

102
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:11,566
So, that's what Dae Woong likes.

103
00:08:19,144 --> 00:08:20,342
Mi Ho!

104
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:24,460
She went up there again.

105
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,882
It's true that I seriously can't
let go of the leash even for a minute.

106
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:29,157
Mi Ho!

107
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:51,521
The dance isn't like that.

108
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:53,912
It's like this. Da da da.

109
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,661
Ah, da da da.

110
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:59,262
Teacher Dong Ju really didn't
teach you anything properly.

111
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:02,214
Dragon woman... you can't do "dragon woman"
and you can't do "da da da" either.

112
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:04,820
But, it's really nice here.

113
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,729
There's so many new things!

114
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,128
You don't even know all the
basic household appliances?

115
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,837
But you go to Teacher Dong Ju all the time!

116
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:14,057
What have you learned?

117
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:17,296
I've learned a lot from Teacher Dong Ju.

118
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,455
I know practically everything in here.

119
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:23,560
Television, washing machine,
refrigerator, air conditioner, computer.

120
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:24,596
<i>And also rice cooker.</i>

121
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:26,073
Really?

122
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:29,334
Then how about I test you to see
if you really do know all of them.

123
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,335
<i>I think I lost my mind at that time.</i>

124
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:34,490
Do you know what this is?

125
00:09:34,502 --> 00:09:35,704
This is my first time seeing this.

126
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:37,505
You don't even what it is?

127
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,498
You've never even heard of a
sophisticated product like this?

128
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:45,309
This is almost like a telephone.

129
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:46,881
If you speak into this microphone,

130
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:49,182
- the other side of the room can hear.
- Hmm

131
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:51,450
Put this here,

132
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:53,951
you can even hear your thoughts.

133
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:55,332
Here,

134
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,933
<i>Think about something.</i>

135
00:09:57,034 --> 00:10:00,434
<i>Please forgive me</i>

136
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:02,735
<i>I think I lost my mind</i>

137
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:05,007
Were you thinking about meat just now?

138
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:06,636
Oh? How did you know?

139
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:09,539
I can hear everything.

140
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:17,347
<i>Even if the wind blows, my heart is lonely
I can't see you anymore, oh</i>

141
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:21,056
Do you know what this is?

142
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,897
This is my first time seeing this as well.

143
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,961
You didn't even learn
something as important as this?

144
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:28,885
<i>What exactly has Teacher Dong Ju been doing?</i>

145
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:31,249
Looks like he's not doing very well.

146
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,803
I'll just use the plentiful knowledge
of the Cha family to teach you.

147
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:36,658
- Do you see the numbers on here?
- Yes

148
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,583
This represents age.

149
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:40,311
Age?

150
00:10:40,312 --> 00:10:41,814
Here, stand on this.

151
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:47,215
<i>I'm really sorry
I can only cry</i>

152
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:54,548
You are much older than you
appear to be.

153
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:59,549
<i>I really miss you, I miss you</i>

154
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:05,147
These are chopsticks used to grill meat.

155
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,467
Grip the meat like this.

156
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:09,515
Wait until it's cooked,
then it can be eaten. Here.

157
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:11,129
It's great.

158
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,580
You have to be careful,
don't burn your mouth.

159
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,768
Be careful.

160
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:20,397
Do you know what this is?

161
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:23,073
Oh, isn't this a remote control?

162
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,120
That's right.

163
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,191
Television remote and air
conditioner remote are all different.

164
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:27,289
I know that too.

165
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,980
Hmm, really?

166
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:32,520
Then…

167
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,035
<i>Do you know what kind of remote this is?</i>

168
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,336
That…

169
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:39,419
This is used to control people.

170
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,627
Insert your ID number and then press this.

171
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:44,608
It'll turn into a remote
that can control other people.

172
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:49,161
I entered mine, you try.

173
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:50,460
<i>You don't believe it?</i>

174
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:52,344
If you press this red button,
people will stop moving.

175
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,631
You're lying to me right?

176
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:56,046
Then don't believe me.

177
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:58,717
Liar.

178
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,113
Woong!

179
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:06,076
It's fake.

180
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:09,622
You're way too gullible.

181
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:12,290
Tricking you gives no
sense of accomplishment.

182
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:14,450
What?

183
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:18,962
This can suck in everything around here.

184
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:19,992
Just something that small?

185
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:21,599
You don't believe?

186
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:26,423
This is the truth, but you don't believe it.

187
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:28,742
Try it and see.
Here..

188
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,917
Turn it on like this.

189
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,954
Then put your hand on top of this and see.

190
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:35,316
Oh! Oh! My hand, my hand! Oh..

191
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,408
Dae Woong!

192
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,349
Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

193
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,449
I was just kidding.

194
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:52,403
<i>Thank you.</i>

195
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:57,962
How can something this
small be able to eat me up?

196
00:12:58,063 --> 00:13:00,022
It was you who tricked me.

197
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,544
That's right.

198
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,371
It should be me who gets scolded
for joking around with you.

199
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:15,773
I really don't need this thing.

200
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,633
Ahhhhh.

201
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:26,270
Ahhhhh.

202
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:29,420
<i>Do I actually think a child like that
would eat me?</i>

203
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:31,995
I really can't understand it.

204
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:47,291
Recently there are times when my
heart suddenly starts to beat fast.

205
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:53,330
<i>If we did meet, what ties us together?</i>

206
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:58,822
When she's like that,
Mi Ho seems like a human too.

207
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:06,104
<i>Is it love? It's so great with you</i>

208
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:11,460
<i>I think that I understand my heart</i>

209
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:17,417
<i>When it's sunny out, I want to hold
your hand and walk down the street</i>

210
00:14:17,518 --> 00:14:22,924
<i>When it rains I want to be your umbrella</i>

211
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,192
Woong!

212
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:35,993
This is huge. Standing in front
of this I feel like I'm about to fly.

213
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:41,914
<i>Ay, ay, ay, I don't want tears</i>

214
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:47,971
<i>I don't want to live with a bruised heart</i>

215
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:52,772
If the fan blows you too much,
your face will start to look old.

216
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:53,773
Let's go.

217
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:58,574
Seems like that after I broke the vacuum,
he got angry.

218
00:14:58,575 --> 00:15:02,375
So, why do humans beings still
joke around with a gumiho.

219
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:06,434
<i>I love you, I love you</i>

220
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:09,935
<i>I love you</i>

221
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:16,064
<i>You're a bright light in my dark life</i>

222
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:25,229
<i>It's my idea of him</i>

223
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:31,030
<i>I love you, I'll only love you</i>

224
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,125
<i>Unni, thanks for inviting us to lunch.</i>

225
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,724
<i>But, why are you doing this?</i>

226
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:43,695
Noona unexpectedly contacted us
and even invited us for lunch.

227
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:46,524
We're about to work together.

228
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:49,378
I have something I want to request of you.

229
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:51,079
A request?

230
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:54,660
My relationship with Dae Woong
is a bit awkward.

231
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,900
You know that too right?

232
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:59,124
I even thought that Cha
Dae Woong liked Unni.

233
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:02,283
Mi Ho appeared so we found out
that Unni was deceiving people.

234
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:06,641
What deceiving people?

235
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:07,938
What's wrong?

236
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:13,178
That's right, my situation
has become a bit laughable.

237
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:16,768
But I don't want other to laugh at me
because of something like this.

238
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:20,567
So, help me make my relationship
with Dae Woong more natural.

239
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,494
Yes, we will.

240
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:27,034
Even if I run into Mi Ho,
I don't want to seem awkward.

241
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:31,993
So I just wanted to ask,
what type of person is Mi Ho?

242
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:36,282
Dae Woong doesn't talk about it much,
so we don't really know either.

243
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:39,554
It's said that she's not
a student at our school?

244
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:41,413
Then where does she go to school?

245
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,509
She doesn't seem to be
going to school right now.

246
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:45,472
Then what is she working as?

247
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:48,615
She doesn't work, so that's why she's
following Dae Woong around every day.

248
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:49,785
According to what Dae Woong said,

249
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,886
he met her in the countryside
and then she followed him here.

250
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,077
Then her home is in another part of country?

251
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:58,166
This can't be determined either.

252
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,925
She doesn't seem like a child
who returned from overseas.

253
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:04,140
She saw a Won Bin* poster at the theater
and asked who that was. [*Korean actor]

254
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,288
She doesn't understand any jokes either.

255
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:08,282
Her style is very strange too.

256
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:13,686
It strangely feels like Miss Mi Ho
has been living in a different world.

257
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:18,626
Unni looks really cool,
but it seems like you still care.

258
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:19,774
Seon Nyeo.

259
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,692
The girl that Director Ban is looking for,
is she really that incredible?

260
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,949
Her?

261
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,807
According to what my dad says, she can fly
like a fairy and can run faster than a car.

262
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,745
It must be a lie.

263
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:34,866
Really?

264
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:39,799
Unni, it seems like you have
your heart set on the main lead.

265
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,583
Don't even know where
she is or what she does.

266
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:50,750
Did she fall from the sky?

267
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,770
<i>Mi Ho! Mi Ho!</i>

268
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:03,921
That one time did seem a bit strange.

269
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:07,584
They were originally together,
but then she disappeared downstairs.

270
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:10,927
Then did she jump down from the roof?

271
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:14,246
That's outrageous.

272
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:25,603
I kept my hair like ahjumma's for awhile.

273
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:28,417
I really like curly hair.

274
00:18:34,094 --> 00:18:36,419
How is curly hair made?

275
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:40,528
Ah, it's curly!

276
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:45,599
What?

277
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:48,448
Oh, continue.

278
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:51,879
Usually stupid people wear a flower
to indicate their stupidity.

279
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,255
Instead, you can just use
beef bones to display it.

280
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:59,067
I have determined what you
are inside my head.

281
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:00,968
How great.

282
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:03,864
I almost got confused.

283
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:06,994
Mi Ho is a gumiho.

284
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,492
Mi Ho is a gumiho.

285
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:10,693
<i>Mi ho is a gumiho.
Mi ho is a gumiho.</i>

286
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:15,062
No, I don't want to be seen as a gumiho.

287
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,845
Woong!

288
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:21,998
When are we going to go on a date?

289
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:24,925
Oh, when are we going on a walk?

290
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:27,434
I want to go often!

291
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:30,307
I really like to go on walks with you!

292
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:36,560
It seems like you really like movies,
you can go there by yourself.

293
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:38,396
Go there by yourself often.

294
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:40,301
I want to go together with you.

295
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:43,548
I don't like the theater, I like you.

296
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:48,653
Ah, it's delicious!

297
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:51,002
Woong! I really like it.

298
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:56,736
Mi Ho, you like the meat right?

299
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:57,648
Yes!

300
00:19:57,749 --> 00:19:59,645
I buy meat for you, so I'm good right?

301
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:00,905
Yes!

302
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:03,243
So that's why you like me?

303
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:08,176
When I take the meat away,
you don't like me anymore?

304
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:09,459
Give me back my meat.

305
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,868
Starting from now,
I won't buy meat for you anymore.

306
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:17,621
If I don't buy meat for you,
you'll be unhappy?

307
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:21,130
I can't do anything about it.

308
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:23,214
Why are you like this?

309
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:24,829
You're a gumiho!

310
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:27,095
If I don't buy meat for you,

311
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:29,017
“Do you want to die?”
“Give me back my meat.”

312
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:30,694
<i>That's what you're supposed to say!</i>

313
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:32,116
Instead you say that you
can't do anything about it.

314
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:34,232
Are you still considered a gumiho like this?

315
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,388
Right now I don't want you to be afraid.

316
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,850
I'm more afraid when you're like this.

317
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:43,748
Mi Ho, be harsher with me.

318
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,023
I'll only be afraid of you when
you're a bit harsher with me.

319
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:49,157
And I won't be able to
forget that you're a gumiho.

320
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,877
Always saying that you'll
help me fulfill my wishes...

321
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:53,400
"Woong, it's so great."

322
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,414
If you're like that,

323
00:20:54,515 --> 00:20:56,992
I won't be able to differentiate
whether you're a gumiho or a human.

324
00:20:57,093 --> 00:21:00,013
Then, just pretend that I am human.

325
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:02,612
How can you be human? You're a gumiho.

326
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:06,531
Even though your tails are hidden,
you still have nine tails.

327
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,850
I understand now.

328
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,012
Here, I stole your meat, right?

329
00:21:15,113 --> 00:21:16,471
Then…

330
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:18,153
Do you want to die?

331
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:19,854
Return my meat.

332
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:24,807
Yes, ahh, I'm very scared.

333
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,081
I'll give your meat back to you.
Please eat.

334
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:45,314
Yes, I have to clearly define
our relationship.

335
00:21:45,424 --> 00:21:49,598
She and I, we can't both be confused.

336
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:52,406
That's right, gumiho, gumiho.

337
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:54,439
Oh, gumiho gumiho.

338
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:04,852
<i>Dal-ah, my precious Kil Dal.</i>

339
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:09,356
<i>Please remain by my side
forever, Kil Dal.</i>

340
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:15,498
<i>I've fallen in love with a human.</i>

341
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,499
<i>Please help me become human.</i>

342
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,062
<i>That guy betrayed you, just kill him.</i>

343
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,577
<i>I can't let him die.</i>

344
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:27,537
<i>I'm begging you, kill me.</i>

345
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:56,859
<i>So, there're 93 days left now.</i>

346
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:03,369
Hanging this up and seeing
everything clearly, it's great.

347
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,075
<i>Woong!</i>

348
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:10,858
I heard that the big building
that's being built out front

349
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,389
will open as a large barbecue shop.

350
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:15,770
So the boss' wife from the fried
chicken shop is really worried.

351
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:18,280
Right now you're very informative
regarding this small neighborhood,

352
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:21,381
you should start caring about
other matters when you have time.

353
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:23,356
If you continue like this,
you'll become a the community president.

354
00:23:23,387 --> 00:23:27,572
But, if a barbecue shop that size opens,
then that'd be awesome.

355
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:32,546
Even if we just sit here, we can smell
the scent of barbecue beef every day.

356
00:23:33,236 --> 00:23:36,729
The construction won't be completed
until next year.

357
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,880
Yes, the boss of the yoghurt shop up front
says that it'll be completed by next spring.

358
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,274
I helped ahjumma carry her bags,
so she gave this to me.

359
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,445
The barbecue meat shop won't
be completed until next spring,

360
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:50,670
so you sitting here and smelling
the scent of barbecue meat every day,

361
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:53,029
That definitely won't happen right?

362
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,859
There are 93 days.

363
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:02,235
There are only 93 days left
that you'll be staying here.

364
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,259
Next spring, when this place is
filled with the scent of barbecue meat,

365
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,100
you probably won't be here anymore.

366
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:12,750
After you've crossed all of them out,
where will I be?

367
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:20,166
You're not returning to
the Three Gods Temple?

368
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:23,995
Then where are you going?

369
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,163
No, that's not something that concerns me.

370
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:35,672
Mi Ho, this is as far as we can go.

371
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:38,073
<i>There's no future.</i>

372
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:39,683
I'm leaving.

373
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:06,382
When I'm come back,
I'll buy meat for you.

374
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,992
Dae Woong said, compared to eating him,

375
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:23,459
liking him is scarier.

376
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:25,304
Seems that even if you become human,

377
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:28,205
you won't be able to stay
by Cha Dae Woong's side.

378
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:32,544
Should I tell him that
I'm going to become human?

379
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:38,524
Aren't you looking forward to him
liking you after you become human?

380
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:44,673
What are you relying on?

381
00:25:44,774 --> 00:25:45,787
What's wrong this time?

382
00:25:45,888 --> 00:25:49,411
Qualities that will let humans like you,
you don't have any, do you?

383
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:51,389
What do I need to have?

384
00:25:51,477 --> 00:25:54,691
First of all, you don't have
what humans like the most, money.

385
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:57,351
<i>Also, you're in no position to
be able to find a profitable job.</i>

386
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:59,993
You don't have enough knowledge
to get a job.

387
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:03,103
You don't have any skills, no background,

388
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:06,404
you don't have anything.

389
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:07,914
If I continue like this,

390
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:11,215
even if I do become human,
I'll become a useless human right?

391
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:14,598
Yours right now is a very special existence.

392
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:20,506
Yet you're going to abandon it and become
an useless and insignificant human being.

393
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:23,383
I really don't understand you.

394
00:26:23,972 --> 00:26:28,085
Teacher Dong Ju, are you
in a bad mood today?

395
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:38,732
<i>Don't leave me</i>

396
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,733
Teacher Dong Ju, are you sad?

397
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:49,235
<i>You're destined to lose your hand</i>

398
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,208
This,

399
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:53,939
I planned on giving it to Dae Woong,
but you drink it Teacher Dong Ju.

400
00:26:54,037 --> 00:26:58,567
Since you don't eat meat and
only eat vegetables, you should drink it.

401
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:03,781
Ahjumma said to go like this.
Shake it then drink.

402
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:07,023
<i>Here, drink it.</i>

403
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:11,249
Thanks.

404
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,959
If I can get a hold of another one,
I'll give it to you again.

405
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,219
Wait for me.

406
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,420
Bye bye.

407
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:30,866
Okay, I'll wait for you.

408
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,155
Noona.

409
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:40,420
You came to see the director, right?

410
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:41,698
Yes.

411
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:47,320
He called me, too, and said
we should wait here for him.

412
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:48,621
Really?

413
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:02,072
Wow, he won a prize like this?

414
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:14,597
<i>Mr Cha.</i>

415
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,913
Uh oh, what should we do?

416
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:23,473
Where's Mr Cha?

417
00:28:23,574 --> 00:28:25,606
He hasn't come yet.

418
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:28,007
Ah... well.

419
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,716
Then, then just a wait a bit longer.

420
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:35,417
He's a bit late.

421
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:46,641
Let's quickly clean this up
before the director gets back.

422
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:47,942
Okay.

423
00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:58,038
These are all really old CDs.

424
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:01,912
Those are 1980s Hong Kong gang films.

425
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:04,113
The director really likes them.

426
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:10,295
Ah, the case is cracked.

427
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:15,050
It's fine as long as the disc isn't damaged.

428
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:16,851
Just have to be careful with it.

429
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,246
Noona, your reflexes are very fast.

430
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:29,252
Your dress was really helpful.

431
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:32,053
If it was a bit shorter,
we would've gotten into big trouble.

432
00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:36,506
I think these kinds of things
can make a large contribution.

433
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:38,908
Because of the mess created here,

434
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:42,109
I was able talk and smile normally with you.

435
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,491
If the director discovers that
the CD is damaged,

436
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:48,692
the both of us will leave crying.

437
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:50,557
Clean up quickly.

438
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:12,258
That scared me!

439
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,685
Ah, it's the message machine.

440
00:30:15,711 --> 00:30:18,923
<i>Director, it's me.</i>

441
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:22,112
That voice is really familiar.

442
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,105
Is the director not there?

443
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:31,622
Min Sook, is it sweet?

444
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,676
Of course.

445
00:30:33,902 --> 00:30:35,843
Father, eat some watermelon too.

446
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:39,205
This watermelon is very
juicy and very sweet as well.

447
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:42,202
Really? Eat lots.

448
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:48,845
I feel sweetness just by looking at you.

449
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:55,257
Mmm, it's so sweet.

450
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:06,234
Dae Woong said that he liked this.

451
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:11,397
Wow, it's awesome.

452
00:31:12,462 --> 00:31:15,355
Dae Woong, do you want this?

453
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:18,925
Okay, then I'll buy it for you.

454
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:22,279
Wow, earning money to buy
this type of thing for me,

455
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,980
our Mi Ho has truly become human.

456
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,618
So now you'll look at me like a human?

457
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:30,200
Of course, Mi Ho, you're really great.

458
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:34,445
How much is this?

459
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,275
There's only 93 days left.

460
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:55,664
I thought each day would feel like a year,
but it's actually passing quickly.

461
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,591
Today's almost over,
so there're 92 days left.

462
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:19,714
But it's already really late today,
where did that girl go?

463
00:32:30,837 --> 00:32:33,585
I'm going to earn money.

464
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,397
Did that girl go to Teacher Dong Ju's place?

465
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,100
She's at his place right?

466
00:33:06,203 --> 00:33:11,134
Should I call Teacher Dong Ju?

467
00:33:17,244 --> 00:33:18,333
Forget it.

468
00:33:18,434 --> 00:33:20,534
What relationship does he have with me?

469
00:33:28,994 --> 00:33:29,825
Mi Ho!

470
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,450
Woong, did you call me?

471
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,745
Where are you?

472
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:35,807
Why is it so noisy?

473
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,506
I'm really busy. Don't call me.

474
00:33:38,527 --> 00:33:41,207
What?
When are you coming back?

475
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:44,081
I'll be really late. Don't wait up for me.

476
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:51,698
"Really busy, don't call me"?!

477
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,431
"Really late, don't wait for me"?!

478
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,552
And hung up?!

479
00:33:57,917 --> 00:34:01,269
Watch me never call you again.

480
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:19,150
She's still not back yet?

481
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:23,743
<i>The smiling face of mine</i>

482
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:26,088
Forget it.
What does it have to do with me?

483
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,745
Hello?

484
00:34:33,188 --> 00:34:35,680
Mi Ho! Why aren't you back yet?

485
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:37,831
I'm really busy, why are you calling me?

486
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:41,590
It's because it's really late and
a girl like you is still not home.

487
00:34:41,643 --> 00:34:45,147
Woong, I'm a gumiho.

488
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:49,005
I'm hanging up!

489
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,242
What's wrong with me?

490
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:02,117
I can't call anymore.

491
00:35:02,444 --> 00:35:04,155
Take out the battery.

492
00:35:08,956 --> 00:35:16,756
<i>You are really lucky</i>

493
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:24,557
<i>Shalalalala, while singing a song.</i>

494
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,197
When did you get back?

495
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:31,641
Even though I wasn't waiting for you,

496
00:35:31,742 --> 00:35:34,042
but we're still people who live together.

497
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:37,064
No, gumiho, I should know
what you've been doing.

498
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:41,271
<i>When there's nothing to do,
you still need to sleep.</i>

499
00:35:42,071 --> 00:35:44,218
Hey, where are you going now?

500
00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:49,142
Woong, I'm really busy.

501
00:35:49,243 --> 00:35:50,443
I'm leaving.

502
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:53,374
Where are you going?

503
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,231
Earn money.

504
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:58,791
Earn money.

505
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,650
Today she'll be coming back late too.

506
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:15,951
<i>I see that it's more than
just your heart beating fast</i>

507
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:23,152
<i>Is it love? It's so great with you</i>

508
00:36:23,153 --> 00:36:28,653
<i>I think that I understand my heart</i>

509
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:34,654
<i>When it's sunny out, I want to
hold your hand and walk down the street</i>

510
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:39,955
<i>When it rains I want to be your umbrella</i>

511
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:47,056
<i>I feel thrilled that this
is my first time lalalalala</i>

512
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:53,079
<i>The customer you dialed has the phone off.</i>

513
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:58,624
Even turning her cell phone off?!

514
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:05,125
<i>I don't want to live with a bruised heart</i>

515
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:11,526
<i>Lalala, I'm in love from now on.</i>

516
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:16,111
What is this? Not coming home again.

517
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:24,806
I'll call Teacher Dong Ju and ask him.

518
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:29,614
Ah, it's just a gumiho.

519
00:37:35,597 --> 00:37:37,143
<i>You're just coming back now?</i>

520
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,895
Yeah, it was kind of busy.

521
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:43,610
Where were you before?

522
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:46,053
Were you together with Teacher Dong Ju?

523
00:37:49,015 --> 00:37:51,676
If you really did spend the night
with him, then get out!

524
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:54,935
Fine then, I was with him.

525
00:37:57,314 --> 00:37:58,786
How can you be like this?

526
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:00,545
What exactly is Teacher Dong Ju to you?

527
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:04,648
If you're a regular cow,
then Teacher Dong Ju is a wild cow.

528
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,760
I have no interest anymore
in the cow tied at home.

529
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:11,371
I'm going to find a new wild cow.

530
00:38:25,122 --> 00:38:27,803
How could I have had a dream like that?

531
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:32,747
My heart feels shaky from
waiting for a gumiho.

532
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:35,687
I have these kinds of dreams
when I go crazy right?

533
00:38:36,627 --> 00:38:40,323
Stop caring about what she's doing.

534
00:38:58,033 --> 00:39:01,289
Is the time passing slowly?

535
00:39:05,063 --> 00:39:07,414
It's not easy earning money.

536
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,578
I haven't even slept.

537
00:39:10,636 --> 00:39:13,564
I can't even see Dae Woong
in order to earn money.

538
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,583
Big eyes, you need money?

539
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:19,080
Yes.

540
00:39:19,242 --> 00:39:21,841
You look like you can really eat meat,

541
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:24,205
why don't you come earn
some money with me?

542
00:39:25,603 --> 00:39:27,521
<i>Is everything prepared?</i>

543
00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:31,020
Check over the video camera.

544
00:39:32,026 --> 00:39:34,337
<i>Twenty minutes to broadcast.</i>

545
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,277
Is it really okay if I just eat?

546
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:38,178
Hmm..

547
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:41,554
It's really hard to eat so much that
your stomach feels like it'll to explode.

548
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:44,429
- Do you have confidence?
- I have confidence for something like this.

549
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,623
Right now you can't grill this yet.

550
00:39:55,752 --> 00:39:58,360
When exactly can we eat?

551
00:39:59,198 --> 00:40:04,303
<i>3, 2, 1.</i>

552
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:07,671
<i>Everybody, this is a hard product to find,
but today: Goong Nae San specialty beef.</i>

553
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,966
Korea's Grade A beef ribs
at an unimaginable price.

554
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:16,058
<i>Eat.</i>

555
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:27,288
<i>The outfits were the responsibility
of Mr. Jip Chul.</i>

556
00:40:27,304 --> 00:40:29,941
That type of role is the best.

557
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:31,342
Oh...

558
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:34,583
Why is your face like that?

559
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:37,710
You look really tired. Didn't sleep well?

560
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:41,073
Who didn't sleep well? I slept great.

561
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:44,133
I slept too well so my face got swollen.

562
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,602
Are you getting along well with Mi Ho?

563
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:48,210
Mi Ho?

564
00:40:49,923 --> 00:40:51,647
Of course we're getting along well.

565
00:40:51,737 --> 00:40:53,695
I don't know what she's doing.

566
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:02,090
Today, everybody present all
forgot about their jobs on hand.

567
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:05,654
<i>Being deeply intoxicated by the
wonderful taste of Korean Grade A beef.</i>

568
00:41:06,935 --> 00:41:10,722
<i>I think I lost my mind at that time</i>

569
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:14,769
<i>How could I have left you?</i>

570
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,008
<i>I only love you</i>

571
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:20,769
The look she has of eating
deliciously might raise the sales.

572
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,418
Give her a solo shot.

573
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:26,319
<i>I think I lost my mind at that time</i>

574
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,320
<i>How could I have left you?</i>

575
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,074
Well, Director Ban.

576
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:37,372
Yes?

577
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:43,335
How about we have udon for lunch.

578
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:46,578
Then let's eat udon.

579
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,438
Let's go.

580
00:41:51,515 --> 00:41:58,066
I think she's at that barbecue meat shop
smiling sweetly, she should be doing well.

581
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:02,873
<i>Mi Ho!</i>

582
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,404
Oh, it's true.

583
00:42:05,463 --> 00:42:07,723
Why is she there?

584
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:10,778
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

585
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:20,268
Aunt!

586
00:42:20,637 --> 00:42:22,524
We're planning on going out for lunch.
Do you want to come?

587
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:27,168
Oh, I'm not hungry yet.

588
00:42:27,782 --> 00:42:32,094
Let's not eat udon, let's eat beef ribs.

589
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:34,677
That's good too

590
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:36,078
Let's go.

591
00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:37,934
- Then we're…
- Yeah

592
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:47,170
It's a live broadcast.

593
00:42:47,671 --> 00:42:50,945
Oh, the fried chicken shop's
boss' wife is there too.

594
00:42:51,097 --> 00:42:54,564
Letting others worry but
playing happily by herself.

595
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,537
- It's not bad, right?
- Yes

596
00:42:59,088 --> 00:43:00,894
You did a really good job today.

597
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,470
Come again for my next show.

598
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:12,446
<i>Woong!</i>

599
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:17,413
Woong!

600
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:20,503
We haven't seen each other
in a long time, right?

601
00:43:20,562 --> 00:43:22,361
Really?

602
00:43:22,493 --> 00:43:23,517
I can't remember.

603
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:26,068
Oh, I'm really busy right now.

604
00:43:26,169 --> 00:43:31,641
I'm so busy that I can't even see you,
but I really really miss you.

605
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:35,128
I saw you.

606
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:37,589
Being super happy when
you were eating beef.

607
00:43:37,654 --> 00:43:39,203
Ah, that.

608
00:43:39,304 --> 00:43:41,104
The fried chicken shop's
ahjumma took me there.

609
00:43:41,276 --> 00:43:43,469
That was really great.

610
00:43:44,394 --> 00:43:47,486
That's good, you looked really happy.

611
00:43:47,997 --> 00:43:51,673
Dae Woong, are you angry?

612
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:55,401
Whether you're with the fried chicken
shop's ahjumma or with Teacher Dong Ju,

613
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:57,270
<i>Even though it doesn't concern me,</i>

614
00:43:57,371 --> 00:44:01,013
But you're phone's turned off and you
can't be contacted. Isn't that too much?

615
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:05,283
I was too busy wiping the grill pans,
so I had no time.

616
00:44:05,973 --> 00:44:06,937
Grill pans?

617
00:44:07,038 --> 00:44:08,589
Yeah, the barbecue meat shop's
grill pans have been piling up

618
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,390
so I've been wiping them continuously

619
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:12,789
which is why I was really busy.

620
00:44:12,882 --> 00:44:15,810
Why are you wiping grill pans?

621
00:44:15,972 --> 00:44:17,568
To earn money.

622
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:19,710
Why are you earning money?

623
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:22,311
To buy what you want.

624
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:25,440
What I want?

625
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:26,341
Yes.

626
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:30,041
Didn't I say that I wanted to
give you something you wanted?

627
00:44:30,142 --> 00:44:33,872
So, I wiped grill pans,
ate meat, earned money,

628
00:44:33,973 --> 00:44:36,260
and I bought something you like.

629
00:44:37,322 --> 00:44:42,259
Then during this time when you didn't
come home and said you were busy,

630
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:46,640
it wasn't to play, it was to earn money?

631
00:44:46,755 --> 00:44:48,543
Yes.

632
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,644
After I earned the money,

633
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:55,045
I realized living in the
human world really isn't easy.

634
00:44:57,386 --> 00:45:00,329
A gumiho really does do everything.

635
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:02,865
Woong, I bought something you like.

636
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,721
I'll give it to you now, okay?

637
00:45:06,184 --> 00:45:08,860
Something I like, what is it?

638
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:12,959
When we went to see a movie last time,
the one that you said was very awesome.

639
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,052
Very awesome?

640
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:18,485
Really? You bought it?

641
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,608
That's definitely extremely expensive.

642
00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:23,050
How many grill pans did you clean
recently to be able to buy it?

643
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:25,668
I cleaned so many that all my
tails were about to fall off!

644
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,206
I'm giving you the present.

645
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,452
You'll definitely be surprised.

646
00:45:33,101 --> 00:45:37,801
She already said what it is,
how will I be surprised?

647
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:41,459
Dae Woong!
This is something that you really want!

648
00:45:43,898 --> 00:45:45,989
Look!

649
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,119
<i>Here!</i>

650
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,555
<i>It's really awesome right?</i>

651
00:45:58,653 --> 00:46:00,439
It can truly scare a person to death.

652
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,687
Dae Woong!
Do you like it? It's awesome right?

653
00:46:04,737 --> 00:46:07,594
Yeah, I'm speechless.

654
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:11,121
Is it only a tiny bit awesome?

655
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:19,732
I am really thankful to you.

656
00:46:19,834 --> 00:46:23,118
I truly did want this.

657
00:46:23,126 --> 00:46:26,220
You, Mi Ho are really
talented in selecting gifts.

658
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:31,333
This definitely has to
be hung beside my bed.

659
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:38,092
I'm so touched that
my tears are about to fall.

660
00:46:38,983 --> 00:46:40,155
You're that happy?

661
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:43,037
Yes, very happy.

662
00:46:44,595 --> 00:46:46,672
Our Mi Ho is earning
money and giving presents.

663
00:46:46,773 --> 00:46:48,148
She's completely turned into a human.

664
00:46:48,249 --> 00:46:51,066
If you're that happy, then I'm happy too!

665
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:53,827
I'm so happy,
my tails are about to pop out!

666
00:46:58,665 --> 00:47:02,621
Next time I go eat meat, all the leftover
meat will be packaged and given to me.

667
00:47:02,722 --> 00:47:04,831
Mi Ho, if you continue like this,

668
00:47:04,932 --> 00:47:08,132
you won't become a famous model
for television products right?

669
00:47:08,232 --> 00:47:09,872
No, because I'm very special,

670
00:47:09,873 --> 00:47:12,573
there are a lot of places
that they want to use me.

671
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:15,906
The fried chicken shop's boss is also
letting me go every day to wash grill pans.

672
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:19,152
Isn't washing grill pans exhausting?

673
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:21,540
Yes, very exhausting.

674
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:22,741
Aigoo.

675
00:47:22,785 --> 00:47:26,633
Wiping through the day and night,
you must've earned a lot of money right?

676
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:28,254
How much did you earn?

677
00:47:28,364 --> 00:47:30,440
They only gave me one bill per day.

678
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:33,078
100,000?

679
00:47:34,355 --> 00:47:36,552
One 10,000 bill.

680
00:47:36,655 --> 00:47:37,704
What?

681
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:42,017
How can you only pay 10,000 for cleaning
entire day's worth of grill pans?

682
00:47:42,118 --> 00:47:45,141
Because her identity is unclear,
so it can only be unfair.

683
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:48,950
How can you treat an intelligent person
who is even on television, like this?

684
00:47:49,051 --> 00:47:52,838
If this happens again,
I will immediately report you.

685
00:47:55,813 --> 00:48:00,821
This is the pay for this period of work.

686
00:48:00,904 --> 00:48:02,471
Put it away well.

687
00:48:04,057 --> 00:48:06,636
I didn't think they would pay very much,

688
00:48:06,737 --> 00:48:10,337
<i>but a difference this big, I didn't expect.</i>

689
00:48:10,742 --> 00:48:13,558
I've been fooled by other people
like an idiot.

690
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:16,021
It's not because you're an idiot.

691
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,971
It's because you're a gumiho.

692
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,124
It's not that you're not as good as humans.

693
00:48:21,225 --> 00:48:23,005
It's that you're different from humans.

694
00:48:23,105 --> 00:48:25,545
That's right, I'm a gumiho.

695
00:48:25,563 --> 00:48:28,511
Wanting to do things like humans,
really isn't easy.

696
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,650
Mi Ho, don't be discouraged.

697
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:34,289
Don't feel that you're inferior
because you're a gumiho.

698
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,772
You have to hold your head high
and straighten yourself up.

699
00:48:46,738 --> 00:48:51,914
Unni, the one that you're buying
is the newest product right?

700
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:53,015
Yes.

701
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:56,172
Using the video camera to record
the practices is really helpful.

702
00:48:56,273 --> 00:48:57,445
You should buy one too.

703
00:48:57,466 --> 00:49:01,533
I only have two lines.

704
00:49:07,302 --> 00:49:09,216
<i>Please give me another one of the same.</i>

705
00:49:09,317 --> 00:49:10,300
Okay.

706
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:12,449
Who are you going to give it to?

707
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:14,521
Dae Woong.

708
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:18,373
Everybody's making the film together,
we should help each other out.

709
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:22,707
What's helpful for Dae Woong in
filming isn't you Unni, it's Mi Ho.

710
00:49:22,808 --> 00:49:24,445
<i>He said that no matter
how serious the injury is,</i>

711
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:27,746
as long as Mi Ho's there,
he can do anything.

712
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:31,175
Then that means,
he's not fully recovered yet?

713
00:49:31,276 --> 00:49:34,157
But it's for that girl called Mi
Ho that's he's forcing himself?

714
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,320
No matter what the doctors advise,
he refuses to change his mind.

715
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:40,968
Perhaps this is the power of love.

716
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,848
I'll be right back after
confirming my costume.

717
00:49:49,949 --> 00:49:50,987
Wait for me here.

718
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:52,215
Okay.

719
00:49:58,782 --> 00:50:01,643
Let's go out and eat delicious food today.

720
00:50:01,744 --> 00:50:03,269
Date?

721
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:05,148
Taking a walk.

722
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,543
Thanks for inviting me to eat ribs.

723
00:50:12,172 --> 00:50:16,081
I saw that you ate a bit too much,
are you okay?

724
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:17,482
Ah yeah...

725
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,217
It was very delicious,
it's just seemed like it was imported.

726
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:23,460
Just joking.

727
00:50:24,865 --> 00:50:26,658
Are you buying one too?

728
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:28,932
<i>- It's really helpful for acting.
- Please wait a bit.</i>

729
00:50:29,033 --> 00:50:30,733
Omo...

730
00:50:30,817 --> 00:50:32,680
Dad!

731
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,798
<i>Dad!</i>

732
00:50:36,817 --> 00:50:38,693
Dad, you haven't eaten lunch yet right?

733
00:50:38,794 --> 00:50:39,764
Buy ribs for me.

734
00:50:39,865 --> 00:50:42,070
- I ate already and I have no money left.
- I'm really hungry.

735
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,371
<i>Let's go, let's go.</i>

736
00:50:43,427 --> 00:50:45,936
Dad, also, I'll buy you a video camera okay?

737
00:50:46,037 --> 00:50:47,654
It's said to be helpful for acting.

738
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:49,487
<i>Over here.</i>

739
00:50:49,544 --> 00:50:50,826
I'm sorry.

740
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,410
Looks like he hasn't told his daughter yet.

741
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,937
Excuse me, are you okay?

742
00:51:04,038 --> 00:51:05,353
Yes.

743
00:51:09,565 --> 00:51:14,804
Excuse me, aren't you Dae Woong's friend?

744
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:30,501
If I had lots of these,
will I turn into a useful person?

745
00:51:32,797 --> 00:51:35,671
Oh, there's someone
talking about Dae Woong.

746
00:51:36,657 --> 00:51:39,779
I saw that he had your
picture in his cell phone.

747
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,762
I thought that you're his girlfriend.

748
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,334
Dae Woong's girlfriend, is someone else.

749
00:51:49,762 --> 00:51:51,844
I had only heard about
what kind of child she is.

750
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:55,636
I haven't met her,
so I'm a bit unsure. I'm sorry.

751
00:51:55,871 --> 00:51:59,485
What kind of girl she is,
did you find out clearly?

752
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,960
Not very clearly.

753
00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:06,131
Even though I can't casually judge someone,

754
00:52:06,232 --> 00:52:10,432
but because I'm worried for Dae Woong,
I'll tell you outright.

755
00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:14,443
She planned it ahead of time to
intentionally get close to Dae Woong.

756
00:52:14,544 --> 00:52:19,826
I'm telling you myself that she wants
things from Dae Woong so she's chasing him.

757
00:52:19,927 --> 00:52:21,828
What?

758
00:52:22,157 --> 00:52:27,177
Looking at how Dae Woong
concealed her past experiences,

759
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:30,686
Perhaps she's not a very proper girl.

760
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,107
Since she's been by Dae Woong's side,

761
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:36,195
nothing's gone smoothly for Dae Woong.

762
00:52:36,257 --> 00:52:38,232
<i>It's all because she ruined
interviews for the movie.</i>

763
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:42,492
Luckily, with the director's assistance,
it succeeded, but with difficulty.

764
00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:45,410
These events actually happened?

765
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:49,925
Grandfather said the she seemed
pretty nice, unless he was mistaken?

766
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,333
Then do you know that Dae Woong
suffered a very serious injury

767
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:57,034
but is still insisting on filming the movie?

768
00:52:57,898 --> 00:52:59,783
Injured?

769
00:53:00,451 --> 00:53:06,335
According to what I understand,
he got injured around the time he met her.

770
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:10,536
Doctors say if he forces himself,
a terrible accident could happen.

771
00:53:10,637 --> 00:53:13,638
No matter how earnestly I urge him,
he remains unmoved.

772
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:16,553
Perhaps that girl doesn't
dissuade him either.

773
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:18,747
Urging him on:
“you're doing well, you're doing well”.

774
00:53:18,848 --> 00:53:21,366
That's probably the main reason.

775
00:53:24,678 --> 00:53:26,446
Thanks for telling me these things.

776
00:53:26,547 --> 00:53:28,625
I have to get back.

777
00:53:45,665 --> 00:53:47,924
Were you listening from behind all along?

778
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,407
You don't know anything.

779
00:53:50,511 --> 00:53:53,309
You just make up nasty
rumors about other people.

780
00:53:53,381 --> 00:53:54,875
<i>What?</i>

781
00:53:56,452 --> 00:53:58,562
What did I say that was wrong?

782
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:00,257
<i>It's the truth.</i>

783
00:54:00,258 --> 00:54:03,514
You're nothing, just an imperfect
girl sticking to Dae Woong's side.

784
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:04,759
Isn't that right?

785
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:08,536
I'm not imperfect, I'm just different.

786
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:12,311
How are you different?

787
00:54:12,342 --> 00:54:17,069
If you find out, you'll die.

788
00:54:30,611 --> 00:54:33,174
That strange girl even threatens me?

789
00:54:33,245 --> 00:54:35,054
I'm so furious.

790
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:38,027
I should've said something back.

791
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:46,714
If I give this to Dae Woong personally, he
wouldn't tell her that it's from me, right?

792
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:48,903
I have to let her know.

793
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:58,605
If Dae Woong knew the ominous words
I said to that woman, he'd get angry.

794
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,663
I should just go back.

795
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:08,657
Once you've put it on, it'll get altered
after the director takes a look at it.

796
00:55:08,749 --> 00:55:10,005
Is it nice?

797
00:55:10,794 --> 00:55:12,668
Speaking of which,
when is the director coming back?

798
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:15,369
I have to finish up quickly and get going.

799
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:19,186
Is it because Mi Ho is
waiting for you downstairs?

800
00:55:20,538 --> 00:55:23,504
It's because it's hot, hot.

801
00:55:30,356 --> 00:55:31,956
Mi Ho!

802
00:55:32,827 --> 00:55:37,266
You're leaving first?
Just wait a bit longer.

803
00:55:39,223 --> 00:55:43,052
Oh, ok then, you go back first.

804
00:55:46,673 --> 00:55:50,863
Give the director a call and ask
him when he's coming back.

805
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:54,272
He'll be here in awhile.

806
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:05,576
Dare to go back first.

807
00:56:05,877 --> 00:56:09,085
No, what am I insufficient in?

808
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:12,321
I even bought Dae Woong
the thing that he likes.

809
00:56:13,035 --> 00:56:15,372
He doesn't understand anything.

810
00:56:17,402 --> 00:56:19,534
<i>Express delivery.</i>

811
00:56:32,451 --> 00:56:33,451
<i>From Eun Hae In.
To Cha Dae Woong. Gift.</i>

812
00:56:33,498 --> 00:56:35,565
<i>Eun Hae In?</i>

813
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:37,366
Is it that woman?

814
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,932
This…

815
00:57:10,171 --> 00:57:15,418
So what Dae Woong actually wanted was this.

816
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:20,830
I really am stupid.

817
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,834
What's going to happen to Dae Woong
if he practices martial arts?

818
00:57:26,935 --> 00:57:30,015
What if there's an accident?
He might not even be able to walk anymore.

819
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:33,376
But what's wrong with Mi Ho,
not holding him back?

820
00:57:33,498 --> 00:57:36,372
She's encouraging him to continue!

821
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:39,168
That bastard.

822
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:43,501
I thought that Dae Woong liked that picture.

823
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,936
You actually bought him that
advertisement for 10,000 won?

824
00:57:46,952 --> 00:57:49,464
That salesperson was very mean.

825
00:57:49,604 --> 00:57:52,403
That was the money I saved from
laboriously cleaning grill pans.

826
00:57:52,504 --> 00:57:56,782
Only earning 10,000 won a day,
those people are pretty mean too.

827
00:57:56,883 --> 00:58:01,459
I told her it's not that I'm lacking,
I'm just not ordinary.

828
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:03,528
But, honestly, I do think I'm lacking.

829
00:58:03,629 --> 00:58:06,486
You're right, they are different.

830
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:10,678
But compared to being insufficient,
being not ordinary is more difficult.

831
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:13,375
The places where you're lacking,
you can work hard to improve,

832
00:58:13,476 --> 00:58:15,776
<i>but not ordinary is different.</i>

833
00:58:15,876 --> 00:58:21,051
In your case, you're different from humans,
so you're working hard to become human.

834
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:25,923
If I become human, will I be able
to satisfy Dae Woong's likes?

835
00:58:26,024 --> 00:58:27,449
Other people probably don't know,

836
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:31,250
but Cha Dae Woong should know that
you're different from other people.

837
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:33,759
<i>It'll be a better idea to
work harder in becoming better</i>

838
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:37,460
<i>with the people who just think
you're lacking.</i>

839
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:42,648
Trying to get along with those who know
you're not ordinary will be more tiring.

840
00:58:44,641 --> 00:58:48,758
Hey, let's go drink a cup of cold beer.

841
00:58:49,156 --> 00:58:51,990
No, I accepted Mi Ho's present.
I need get a present in return.

842
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:54,891
I'm going to buy beef ribs on the way home.

843
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:57,911
Not flowers, but flower cut beef?

844
00:58:58,086 --> 00:58:59,419
Our Mi Ho is different.

845
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,120
She doesn't like flowers,
she likes beef ribs.

846
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:04,265
Did Mi Ho say she hates flowers?

847
00:59:04,366 --> 00:59:05,980
Oh…

848
00:59:08,313 --> 00:59:10,481
Hates them?

849
00:59:10,682 --> 00:59:12,482
I never asked her.

850
00:59:14,327 --> 00:59:15,862
She probably hates them.

851
00:59:16,606 --> 00:59:20,068
How do you know if you never even asked?

852
00:59:26,497 --> 00:59:28,688
Our Mi Ho is different.

853
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:34,026
Does Mi Ho like flowers too?

854
00:59:44,074 --> 00:59:47,647
No, it's wrong no matter
how I think about it.

855
00:59:47,746 --> 00:59:50,174
The gumiho and a bouquet of flowers.

856
00:59:50,902 --> 00:59:53,391
That's too funny, funny.

857
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:23,186
<i>The smiling face of mine.</i>

858
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:27,287
Seems like Mi Ho figured it out.

859
01:00:32,835 --> 01:00:38,290
<i>I'm crying tears on my pretty face
The crying face is mine</i>

860
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:44,761
<i>The pretty tears will fall
more than anyone can imagine</i>

861
01:00:47,302 --> 01:00:52,008
<i>People passing by on the streets</i>

862
01:00:53,923 --> 01:00:59,479
Hey, how could you throw
such a beautiful picture out?

863
01:01:00,571 --> 01:01:03,327
But this isn't what you liked, is it?

864
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:10,494
Yes, I'll admit that when I first saw this,
it wasn't the advertisement that I liked.

865
01:01:11,321 --> 01:01:18,292
But, since you gave this to me,
starting from now, I'll like it.

866
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:26,110
Also, I don't know whether
or not you like this.

867
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:31,068
I prepared a present in return.

868
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:35,523
It's so pretty!

869
01:01:39,314 --> 01:01:41,238
Do you like flowers, too?

870
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:44,124
Yes, I really like flowers.

871
01:01:45,844 --> 01:01:50,600
I thought that because you were different
from us, you wouldn't like flowers.

872
01:01:50,634 --> 01:01:52,391
<i>I was wrong.</i>

873
01:01:54,192 --> 01:01:56,692
It's very fortunate that you like it.

874
01:01:56,769 --> 01:02:00,163
I have no ability for giving you
what you want.

875
01:02:00,582 --> 01:02:02,185
You're wrong too.

876
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:04,386
Your understanding of me isn't very deep.

877
01:02:04,486 --> 01:02:07,589
So you didn't know what I actually like,
therefore you were wrong.

878
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:12,073
The part where we're wrong, we should ask
each other. We just need to change that.

879
01:02:18,093 --> 01:02:22,194
Starting from now, I'll ask you everything.

880
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:25,494
Okay.

881
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:35,630
Woong, how afraid of me are you right now?

882
01:02:39,746 --> 01:02:43,894
The be honest, I'm not afraid at all.

883
01:02:45,207 --> 01:02:49,684
Because I wanted to draw clear boundaries,
I was pretending to be scared of you.

884
01:02:50,795 --> 01:02:56,180
You still don't like to
be with me now?

885
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:02,291
Honestly, it's not that bad.

886
01:03:03,274 --> 01:03:05,301
<i>I think I'm already used to it.</i>

887
01:03:11,433 --> 01:03:14,415
That's really beautiful.

888
01:03:14,516 --> 01:03:17,916
When we have time,
let's go there together.

889
01:03:18,242 --> 01:03:19,577
Dae Woong.

890
01:03:21,817 --> 01:03:24,886
Starting from now...

891
01:03:25,387 --> 01:03:28,287
could you like me?

892
01:03:37,691 --> 01:03:40,228
Even though you and I are different...

893
01:03:41,129 --> 01:03:43,229
couldn't you still like me?

894
01:03:53,049 --> 01:03:59,265
<i>A day when my pain disappears</i>

895
01:03:59,366 --> 01:04:04,204
<i>Will that day ever come?</i>

896
01:04:04,305 --> 01:04:09,566
<i>The pitiful and foolish me</i>

897
01:04:11,136 --> 01:04:12,444
Grandpa.

898
01:04:16,178 --> 01:04:18,498
<i>The two of you can't be together.</i>

899
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:20,605
Separate right now!

900
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:25,042
Cha Dae Woong, get your things.
