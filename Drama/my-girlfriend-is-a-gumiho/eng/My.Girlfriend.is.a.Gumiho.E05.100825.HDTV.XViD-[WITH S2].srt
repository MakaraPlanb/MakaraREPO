Episode 5

4
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:17,290
Where did she go?

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,734
Has she started digging around in
other people's trash cans already?

6
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:31,091
Why do I feel so stiff?

7
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:34,230
Did I drink and fall down?

8
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:45,728
The beef ribs from yesterday are still here.

9
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:50,252
There's no way she would go out
and leave the beef ribs.

10
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:54,640
Mi Ho, I've been drinking.

11
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:55,980
Right!

12
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:57,786
I drank yesterday and
then I saw Mi Ho!

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,481
We don't even have anywhere to go,

14
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:05,432
do you want to spread your tails
and do a round of hoy hoy?

15
00:01:05,457 --> 00:01:08,447
<i>We even did hoy hoy.</i>

16
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:10,022
Hoy hoy!

17
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:13,363
What did we do after that?

18
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:20,036
It hurts so bad!

19
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:23,955
It feels like my toe's going to fall off.

20
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:31,215
But why does it hurt so much?

21
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:35,759
<i>It shouldn't hurt because I have the bead.</i>

22
00:01:40,302 --> 00:01:43,280
Are you not inside me?

23
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:50,795
Then Mi Ho's not here either?

24
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:52,995
Mi Ho!

25
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:54,241
Mi Ho!

26
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:55,519
Mi Ho!

27
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:01,511
Mi Ho!

28
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,835
Let's have beef ribs for breakfast!

29
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,304
Mi Ho!

30
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,610
She's not here no matter how much I look.

31
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:20,390
She won't even come when I call.

32
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:23,806
Mi Ho's really not here.

33
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:34,789
She left.

34
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:36,831
She left.

35
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:40,890
Gu Mi Ho finally left.

36
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:45,089
This day did come!

37
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:52,605
Freedom!

38
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:03,317
Since she left, I'll leave too.

39
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:06,706
Before she comes back, I need to hide.

40
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:19,846
These are the coupons Mi Ho collected.

41
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,676
Nine.

42
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:30,250
<i>She worked so hard to collect them.</i>

43
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:33,129
But she left without getting the last one.

44
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:39,751
But don't come back to get one more!

45
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,255
Dae Woong's really excited.

46
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:05,300
Isn't he too happy that I left?

47
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,580
The weather's great!

48
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,002
Rain?

49
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:25,990
Ahjusshi!

50
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,036
Young man!

51
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,185
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,130
I was scared it was raining!

53
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,988
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,938
My heart sank for no reason.

55
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:50,625
If it fox rains on a clear day,
I'll feel bad from now on.

56
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:55,344
No.

57
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:57,875
Is my Mi Ho the only fox in the world?

58
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:01,649
A northern fox could cry
and a desert fox could cry!

59
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:02,986
Right.

60
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:16,449
It doesn't rain in the desert,
do desert foxes not cry?

61
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:19,031
Woong.

62
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,989
Goodbye.

63
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,171
Ahjusshi!

64
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:45,951
Then where did that fall from this time?

65
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,006
<i>What?</i>

66
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:04,485
That girl left?

67
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,886
I woke up in the morning and
she had disappeared without a word.

68
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:11,534
Then you have to go look for her, you punk!

69
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:13,065
Why should I?

70
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:18,337
She left of her own accord
so don't say anything to me.

71
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,553
<i>That punk!</i>

72
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,657
Father, let it be.

73
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:28,456
Frankly, I let it be because
you said Dae Woong

74
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:31,057
was becoming independent and responsible,

75
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:36,282
but I felt uncomfortable about him
being with some girl we don't even know.

76
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:37,978
Still...

77
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:43,379
she's the girl who made him
start becoming a person!

78
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:44,969
<i>My goodness.</i>

79
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:49,990
You said you liked her too!

80
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:56,932
What can we do if they ended it?

81
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:04,471
I thought he was becoming a person now...

82
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:09,830
What if he changes back after leaving her?

83
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,631
Grandfather has no idea.

84
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:34,727
It's nice.

85
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:40,530
Now that I'm in my room like this,
it really feels like Gu Mi Ho left.

86
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:52,081
But why do I feel so empty and awkward?

87
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:58,777
Did she take something else from
my body besides the bead?

88
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,523
It's noona!

89
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:14,355
You ran out immediately when I called.

90
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,743
It really seems like you now.

91
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:22,294
My body couldn't run out due to a situation
but my heart was always following you.

92
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:25,545
You couldn't see that and misunderstood.

93
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:27,833
Don't do anything for me to
misunderstand anymore.

94
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,154
If she comes back or calls,
don't hang out with her.

95
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:36,161
I don't have her number
and I don't know where she is.

96
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:38,486
There's no reason for me to
see her again either.

97
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:41,751
She left without saying a word.

98
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:48,034
Looking back, she left without
even saying goodbye.

99
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:52,559
We have an attachment after all that time,
how could she do that?

100
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,789
Figures..

101
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,095
She's not a human who would know
affection, loyalty, or anything like that.

102
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:01,543
Are you upset?

103
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:03,797
Upset?

104
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:05,223
I'm totally relieved.

105
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:12,265
What's this?

106
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,572
It's soda.

107
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:29,062
Is she somewhere searching through
trash and sucking on pop tins?

108
00:09:36,364 --> 00:09:40,936
I filled it around dinner time
but it's already empty.

109
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:45,318
There aren't even any students
around, is it broken?

110
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,985
What's that sound?

111
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:59,485
My goodness, who did this?

112
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,404
Let's take a break.

113
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:25,596
Hey!

114
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:27,687
My meat's missing.

115
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:30,612
Mine too.

116
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:32,367
Yours too?

117
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:40,421
All the meat in the hamburgers disappeared.

118
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:22,985
No!

119
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,355
Cheers!

120
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,637
Congratulations!

121
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:45,159
Cha Dae Woong, congratulations!

122
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:46,920
You can't pretend to not know us
when you become a star.

123
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,661
It'll be hard to see you when I'm busy but
I'll treat you like this every now and then.

124
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:54,363
Does Mi Ho know about this?

125
00:12:58,024 --> 00:12:59,180
What does it matter?

126
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:02,314
You became a star and it seems like
you'll be famous so you dumped her, right?

127
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:04,393
It's not a kind of relationship to dump.

128
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:05,982
Well..

129
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:10,427
We were friends but she went her way.

130
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:15,266
We're all friends, if she's
a friend then call her.

131
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:17,087
<i>If it's not a special relationship
then you can call her.</i>

132
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:24,779
<i>If you didn't dump her or anything,
then call her.</i>

133
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,791
It would be nice to
congratulate you together.

134
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:28,859
Even if I wanted to...

135
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:32,393
I can't! Happy now?

136
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:56,081
I came just in case but
it figures, she isn't here.

137
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:59,712
She really must have left completely.

138
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,782
It's a relief!

139
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:05,678
I feel so carefree!

140
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:30,367
The moonlight is nice.

141
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:35,686
Why did she leave like that?

142
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:59,921
Mysterious Mi Ho.*
[*to the tune of My Friend, Dool Li]

143
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:08,578
My friend Mi Ho

144
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:12,046
is a cute,

145
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:16,209
is a scary,

146
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:18,820
gumiho.

147
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:21,551
Hoy Hoy!

148
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:24,342
Mi Ho is

149
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:28,798
Gu Mi Ho, my friend.

150
00:15:31,992 --> 00:15:34,743
Hoy hoy.

151
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,014
Mi Ho is

152
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:42,929
my scary friend.

153
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:45,913
It's your bead.

154
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:48,487
You didn't catch me to kill me?

155
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:51,791
I caught you to take out your bead
so you wouldn't cause trouble.

156
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,453
What did I do?

157
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:56,503
A so-called gumiho is scaring
students at school,

158
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:59,626
stealing hamburgers, and
digging around for pop tins.

159
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:00,792
Aren't you ashamed?

160
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:02,729
People don't know it's me doing that.

161
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:07,901
It seems you asked Cha Dae Woong
to help you become a human,

162
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,175
and you got rejected.

163
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,627
I didn't ask him.

164
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:15,933
I didn't even get to bring it up.

165
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,967
You had high expectations,

166
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,173
you must have been very disappointed
when you didn't even get to ask him.

167
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:26,230
Dae Woong said he was friends with me,

168
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:30,648
but he must have hated me
because I'm a gumiho.

169
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:34,113
He asked me to disappear.

170
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:38,187
So what are you going to now?

171
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,515
Have you given up on being a human?

172
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,237
I don't know yet.

173
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:47,786
Here's a red bottle and a blue bottle.

174
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:52,935
If you drink the red bottle, you've chosen
to try to stay here and become a human.

175
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:58,270
If you drink the blue bottle,
you'll return to the Three Gods Temple.

176
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:02,651
If you need time,
stay here and think about it.

177
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,027
Can I stay here?

178
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:09,347
This is an animal hospital;
I can look after a fox like you.

179
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,955
Let's make some cool action.

180
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:32,347
Yes!

181
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:34,775
Action!

182
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:36,347
Action!

183
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,821
[Do Do Agency.]
You know our agency.

184
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:44,519
Yes!

185
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,290
It's Hae In noona's agency.

186
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:47,339
Bingo!

187
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,955
Most of our country's top stars
are represented by this agency.

188
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:54,891
I believe in your potential.

189
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:58,553
<i>How do you feel about working with us?</i>

190
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,196
That's great!

191
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:06,993
Do Do Agency is the best in the country!

192
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:10,785
Forget about inspecting the contract,
you need to sign it immediately!

193
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:15,077
I got cast in the main role for a highly-
anticipated film on my own,

194
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,975
if I sign now, won't they say
it was thanks to a big agency?

195
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:22,871
I don't like that so I'm thinking about it.

196
00:18:22,991 --> 00:18:26,158
If the movie flops, you're screwed!

197
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:27,449
You!

198
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:30,477
Are you saying my dad's movie will flop?

199
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,418
I'm sorry.

200
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,908
Speaking of that, you can't even dream
about a car like this with your salary.

201
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:38,297
Why did you come to look at cars?

202
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:42,962
Because the salary is my allowance
and grandfather will buy me a car.

203
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,834
Hey!

204
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,062
Shouldn't you buy something for your
grandfather with your first paycheck?

205
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:51,063
Of course I'll buy my grandfather underwear!

206
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:55,588
I like that car.

207
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:04,881
Salary contract, agency contract,
and a car contract too.

208
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:08,279
Now I have so many reasons
to sign things.

209
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:11,245
I'll have to make a cool signature.

210
00:19:19,077 --> 00:19:21,934
It's not a big injury, right?

211
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:24,498
Were you in a major accident recently?

212
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:25,708
Huh?

213
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:29,261
Ah, yes.

214
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:31,923
But it should be all healed.

215
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,844
It is healed, but you must
have been badly hurt.

216
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:41,120
Your bones haven't been healed for long
so you need to be especially careful.

217
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,254
It doesn't hurt much.

218
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:48,511
I need to start a movie soon,
it won't affect me right?

219
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:50,528
Yes, it should be fine.

220
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:53,261
It just can't be an extreme action movie.

221
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,159
And if it's an extreme action movie?

222
00:19:57,692 --> 00:20:02,554
If you overexert yourself, forget the action
movie, you won't even be able to walk.

223
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:04,347
What?

224
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,843
Then how long will it take
for me to get better?

225
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,782
You'll have to rest for a few months.

226
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:12,467
A few months?

227
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:15,489
I need to start action practice
immediately, next week!

228
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:19,337
Then you have to give up on that movie.

229
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:27,774
You'll have to give up this movie.

230
00:20:28,398 --> 00:20:32,004
You seemed so fine, I didn't know
you were hurt that badly.

231
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:33,720
Yeah.

232
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:39,556
I was fine thanks to Mi Ho.

233
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:41,254
Mi Ho?

234
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:43,397
Bead.

235
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,813
I need Mi Ho.

236
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:54,536
Mi Ho left, what should I do?

237
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,238
This is the only thing that
smells like meat in his house.

238
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:13,961
You don't even like humans, why do you keep
watching that thing with lots of humans?

239
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:18,696
It tells you all about humans
without having to encounter them.

240
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:21,600
Really?

241
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:23,949
I should have studied by watching that.

242
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,557
I should study now.

243
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,985
What are they doing?

244
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,841
They just keep chasing after the ball.

245
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:36,650
It's called soccer.

246
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,900
When the World Cup starts, all everyone
in the world just watches that ball.

247
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:45,077
Then it would be so much fun
to go and pop that ball!

248
00:21:46,823 --> 00:21:48,635
But I won't.

249
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:51,740
What's that?

250
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:54,545
Why does that old woman keep
yelling at that young woman?

251
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:57,895
That's called a mother-in-law
and a daughter-in-law.

252
00:21:58,088 --> 00:21:59,519
That just what they do.

253
00:22:01,008 --> 00:22:03,621
Now the young woman is yelling.

254
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:15,187
I know that.

255
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,185
They're mating.

256
00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:22,969
Why?

257
00:22:23,363 --> 00:22:24,514
Wow!

258
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:25,752
Cows!

259
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:27,752
There are so many!

260
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,741
Do they all belong to that person!

261
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,147
Why?

262
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:34,435
Are you going to find them
if you find out who he is?

263
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:37,897
Is there any way I could find out?

264
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:41,630
I don't know what you'll do
so I'm not telling you.

265
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,845
I want to eat you so badly.

266
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:58,104
They're not for eating.

267
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:03,393
I'm not going to eat them!

268
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:06,805
Aren't you keeping them here
so you can eat them?

269
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:09,460
This isn't a restaurant,
it's a hospital. A hospital!

270
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,938
And I don't eat meat at all.

271
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:14,740
Ah right.

272
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,955
You didn't have any meat at your house.

273
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:23,695
I want to eat meat so much.

274
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,663
I don't have meat.

275
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,503
This isn't even as good as
the temple, right?

276
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,205
It doesn't work on him.

277
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,683
He has a lot of money!

278
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:06,596
I'm going to go eat some meat.

279
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,205
Ah yum!

280
00:24:12,257 --> 00:24:16,070
You ate ten servings of Han Woo*
beef ribs by yourself! [*Korean-bred]

281
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:19,482
There's a mountain smell coming from
the meat here so it's even more delicious.

282
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:22,259
You really know the taste of Han Woo.

283
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:25,976
<i>It's delicious because it's
soft and tender, right?</i>

284
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,870
<i>It's the best kind of Han Woo.</i>

285
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:35,167
But you have money to pay with, right?

286
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:39,980
I don't have money.

287
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:44,352
I ate like a human so
I'm going to pay like a human.

288
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:46,843
Let's clean.

289
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:01,512
That's good, right?

290
00:25:05,116 --> 00:25:06,551
Miss!

291
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,510
Would you like to work at our store?

292
00:25:10,903 --> 00:25:13,094
I'm not planning on creating
any attachments yet.

293
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:22,085
I ate a lot of meat so I need
to drink bubbly water.

294
00:25:26,098 --> 00:25:31,665
I can hit you and make you throw up bubbly
water but I want to handle it like a human.

295
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:42,805
Yup, it's here.

296
00:25:43,963 --> 00:25:45,504
Here it is!

297
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:57,497
You saw that?

298
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:11,229
I need to take care of you like a human too.

299
00:26:13,985 --> 00:26:15,859
Don't tell anyone.

300
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:17,698
Shh!

301
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,240
I think I'm doing a good job pretending to
be a human and not showing I'm a gumiho.

302
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:36,393
But if I become a real human,
that would be better.

303
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:50,901
Then I'll have someone else next to me too.

304
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:57,277
It would have been nice if it was Dae Woong.

305
00:27:08,323 --> 00:27:11,836
She lived here for several days,
she must have left something behind.

306
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:26,451
How could these nine coupons be
the only things she left behind?

307
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:33,532
If she collected nine, she should have
collected the last one too.

308
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:37,314
Why was she in such a hurry
to disappear so suddenly?

309
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:46,030
No.

310
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,910
Mi Ho could have said where she was going
during the time I can't remember.

311
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:54,576
Let's remember.

312
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,216
We did hoy hoy.

313
00:27:57,403 --> 00:27:59,036
Then after...

314
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:02,597
What did we do?

315
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,624
Let's remember subconsciously.

316
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:08,219
Remember while sleeping. While sleeping.

317
00:28:08,308 --> 00:28:10,366
Red Sun!

318
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:11,807
Red Sun!

319
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,108
Red Sun!

320
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,250
Gu Mi Ho.

321
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:29,867
How could you leave like that?

322
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,236
You said you were my friend.

323
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,260
Friend?

324
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,069
Mi Ho.

325
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:45,081
You're my friend, right?

326
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:46,362
Yeah.

327
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:51,491
Then can you do me a favor?

328
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:52,788
What?

329
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:56,592
Mi Ho.

330
00:28:58,424 --> 00:29:04,585
Can you please disappear?

331
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:12,692
I told Mi Ho to disappear.

332
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:17,761
She left because I told her to leave.

333
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:36,730
<i>I don't know love yet
so I can't come closer</i>

334
00:29:36,824 --> 00:29:47,856
<i>But why does my foolish heart
keep fluttering?</i>

335
00:30:00,054 --> 00:30:03,890
I tried to look like Angelina Jolie
but something's off.

336
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:07,449
I upped my height and upped my curves.

337
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:09,900
Ah lips!

338
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:12,254
I need to create Jolie lips.

339
00:30:18,602 --> 00:30:21,722
It's not enough to just add lipstick.

340
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,057
Should I flex and stretch them a bit?

341
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:25,840
Ah... goo.

342
00:30:25,984 --> 00:30:28,059
Would you like to eat ahgujjim*?
[*steamed monkfish]

343
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:30,087
U..

344
00:30:30,244 --> 00:30:31,691
U..

345
00:30:31,861 --> 00:30:33,765
Udon soup.

346
00:30:34,313 --> 00:30:35,188
U!

347
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:37,072
U pushes them out the best.

348
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,107
U!

349
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:39,631
Udon.

350
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:45,636
Oh my God, what do I do? What do I do?

351
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:48,419
I finally upped my lips and it landed here?

352
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,056
<i>Then it will spread more.</i>

353
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:09,042
Lipstick contains wax, oil, alcohol, and
pigment so it does not erase well.

354
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:11,489
Huh?

355
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:14,790
I didn't do it on purpose.

356
00:31:14,903 --> 00:31:16,241
It was an accident.

357
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:21,656
I'm not a pervert who goes around
kissing the butts on statues.

358
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:26,820
I am not someone who thinks of others
as perverts but..

359
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,765
if someone else saw you keeping your hands

360
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,529
on the statue's butt for a long time,
they could misunderstand.

361
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,652
So remove your hands.

362
00:31:38,727 --> 00:31:39,851
Please leave!

363
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:41,690
I'll take care of it.

364
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:43,780
Remove them.

365
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:48,556
If you remove them, I'll take care of it.

366
00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:08,228
Now we can hide it for a little bit.

367
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:13,564
I will cleanly handle it later.

368
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:18,389
As I've always lived with action in my life,

369
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,071
there are always Icy Hot patches
all over my body.

370
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:29,366
I always thought you had a strong smell,
that was Icy Hot?

371
00:32:29,987 --> 00:32:32,626
I thought it was cologne.

372
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:37,932
I am not a classy man who wears cologne.

373
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:41,331
I am a rough man who puts on Icy Hot.

374
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:43,629
I like rough things.

375
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:51,752
I like the rough Icy Hot smell and I like
eating apples roughly with the skin on.

376
00:32:51,848 --> 00:32:57,506
And I like showering roughly by
scrubbing with a exfoliating towel.

377
00:32:58,304 --> 00:33:01,328
I didn't know you liked
rough things so much.

378
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:04,730
I thought of you as a graceful,
pure, innocent person.

379
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:11,266
For example like the American,
Audrey Hepburn.

380
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,149
I'm not Hepburn.

381
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:21,733
I'm like a rough and tough Jolie.

382
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,837
Jolie...

383
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,492
Jolie...

384
00:33:26,914 --> 00:33:28,758
Well...

385
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:35,986
Would you like to eat a bowl of udon soup
in a place that makes good udon soup?

386
00:33:41,581 --> 00:33:43,444
I'm sorry. I can't.

387
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:47,222
Are you very busy?

388
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,430
I feel very uncomfortable.

389
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:53,355
Jolie is Pitt's woman.

390
00:33:53,469 --> 00:33:56,804
I do not associate with women
who have partners.

391
00:33:56,851 --> 00:34:02,851
Jolie is Pitt's woman and you are
like a Jolie who cannot approach me.

392
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,864
<i>I love you, you fool</i>

393
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:12,737
<i>I want to be with you</i>

394
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:19,156
<i>Honestly, I want to send you
all of my heart</i>

395
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:23,407
<i>But I stop in front of you</i>

396
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:33,594
What are you doing here?

397
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,139
I came because I had something to ask.

398
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,512
Ask.

399
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,604
What's the filming schedule?

400
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:47,774
If possible, I was wondering if I could
film my part last, at the very end.

401
00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:51,803
What are you saying right now?

402
00:34:57,697 --> 00:35:02,315
Look me in the eyes and say it again.

403
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:09,841
I'm a little lacking in sword practice so
I thought if we filmed after I improved...

404
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,167
And it's a small opinion you can ignore.

405
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:21,568
I am not the kind of person who
ignores people's opinions.

406
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:23,662
Do not worry.

407
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:32,329
And tomorrow you will begin severe,
bone-breaking training at my action school.

408
00:35:34,535 --> 00:35:36,706
Severe training?

409
00:35:36,854 --> 00:35:37,529
Why?

410
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:39,009
Are you scared?

411
00:35:39,185 --> 00:35:40,336
No!

412
00:35:40,551 --> 00:35:44,237
I should practice until my bones break!

413
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,202
<i>Dae Woong.</i>

414
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,590
- Yes?
- In the plaza outside,

415
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:56,230
there's a naked statue and there's
a small problem on its butt.

416
00:35:57,219 --> 00:36:02,911
Instead of taking care of it myself, better
that you, the nephew, take care of it.

417
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:03,464
Huh?

418
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:07,688
First, go to the bathroom and grab a sponge.

419
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:09,057
Yes.

420
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:10,795
<i>And by the way..</i>

421
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:22,780
Your aunt may get embarrassed so
keep it a secret from your uncle.

422
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,590
Uncle?

423
00:36:28,545 --> 00:36:31,523
I don't have an uncle.

424
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:35,768
You have an aunt but
you don't have an uncle?

425
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:37,044
Yes.

426
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:39,989
My aunt isn't married yet.

427
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,765
Uncomfortable?

428
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,277
Uncomfortable?

429
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:04,661
Did it make you that uncomfortable that
I dressed like this to look good to you?

430
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:07,013
Forget it!

431
00:37:07,153 --> 00:37:10,277
You think you don't make me uncomfortable?

432
00:37:10,383 --> 00:37:15,741
The way you dress is ridiculously
uncomfortable too!

433
00:37:27,865 --> 00:37:33,487
I made a huge mistake due to
a big misunderstanding.

434
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,338
Hello?

435
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:41,678
Is this the temple?

436
00:37:41,818 --> 00:37:44,242
That fox drawing that you were
desperately worried about...

437
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:46,926
Did it return to normal?

438
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,715
Ah yes.

439
00:37:50,993 --> 00:37:52,596
She didn't return.

440
00:37:54,244 --> 00:37:55,492
Figures.

441
00:37:55,628 --> 00:37:58,218
She said she didn't want to go there.

442
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:01,723
This foolish memory.

443
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,933
Oh right!

444
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,709
The voicemail Mi Ho left.

445
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,742
Wait, where was it?

446
00:38:16,437 --> 00:38:17,935
It's here.

447
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,977
Did you hear about the Wraps Restaurant
owner's affair?

448
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,401
They said he took her into the restaurant
office and lived with her for years!

449
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:25,336
- Oh my god!
- No way!

450
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:27,699
<i>You should have seen when his wife
found out the truth,</i>

451
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:33,267
<i>ripped out all their hair, and threw a fit!</i>

452
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:42,052
Did Dae Woong eat a chicken
with the coupons I left?

453
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:45,206
He couldn't have because
there were nine.

454
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:48,296
It would have been nice
if I'd got him the last one.

455
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:48,948
Madam Kang.

456
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:50,351
Your phone's ringing.

457
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:51,852
Hold on.

458
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:02,461
What's she want?

459
00:39:13,295 --> 00:39:14,146
Hello?

460
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:17,094
Hello?

461
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:24,474
Now it's all ten.

462
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:28,269
But Dae Woong's not here.

463
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,521
I guess Dae Woong won't come here anymore.

464
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:02,359
I really, really miss Dae Woong.

465
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:09,202
<i>Dae Woong.</i>

466
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:13,850
<i>I can see things that are really
far away and I can hear well,</i>

467
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:19,668
<i>but since I can't see or hear you,
you must be very far away.</i>

468
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:32,529
<i>I've lived a very long time so I didn't know
how to keep track of time,</i>

469
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:38,466
<i>but after I met you, my heart
began keeping track of time.</i>

470
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:42,526
<i>The times when you were next to me
and I thought</i>

471
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:47,625
<i>"A little longer, a little longer",
went by very fast.</i>

472
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,060
<i>But the times when I can't see you
and I think</i>

473
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:53,634
<i>"I miss you, I miss you", are too slow.</i>

474
00:40:58,094 --> 00:41:00,095
<i>You know, Dae Woong?</i>

475
00:41:00,455 --> 00:41:03,023
<i>It feels like my heart has been
bewitched by you</i>

476
00:41:03,108 --> 00:41:06,272
<i>and is keeping track of time on its own.</i>

477
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:12,881
It's Dae Woong!

478
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,744
It smells like Dae Woong.

479
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:24,223
He's getting closer!

480
00:41:30,995 --> 00:41:33,946
Dae Woong is coming towards me!

481
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:48,187
It's really him.

482
00:41:48,581 --> 00:41:50,916
She's really here.

483
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:03,552
You came to find me?

484
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:05,417
Yes!

485
00:42:06,598 --> 00:42:08,221
You were really looking for me?

486
00:42:08,327 --> 00:42:09,868
I said yes!

487
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:14,880
Thank goodness I found you.

488
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:29,606
Now...

489
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:40,011
How did I start preparing
Gu Mi Ho's meals too?

490
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:44,095
But how do I feed this to her?

491
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:44,786
<i>Cheers!</i>

492
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:46,288
<i>Cheers!</i>

493
00:42:48,403 --> 00:42:52,449
Do you know how surprised and sad I was
after you disappeared?

494
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,970
I saw you leaving really happily.

495
00:42:58,653 --> 00:43:01,271
I won't deny it since you saw it.

496
00:43:05,593 --> 00:43:09,495
Yes, after you disappeared,
I was really happy at first.

497
00:43:09,665 --> 00:43:13,286
But it was really only for a moment.

498
00:43:13,504 --> 00:43:16,280
You really felt empty after I disappeared?

499
00:43:16,408 --> 00:43:17,621
Of course!

500
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:19,353
What kind of relationship did we have?

501
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:22,787
I had your precious bead!

502
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:27,716
You left and maybe it was because the bead
was gone but I felt empty inside.

503
00:43:27,807 --> 00:43:31,101
I realized that I was happiest

504
00:43:31,304 --> 00:43:34,676
when I shared a special friendship with you
while holding on to the bead.

505
00:43:35,037 --> 00:43:38,636
I really, really missed you too.

506
00:43:38,777 --> 00:43:39,794
Really?

507
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:43,024
Than shall we go back to before?

508
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:43,646
Yes!

509
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:47,809
If you tell me to stay here,
I really like staying here.

510
00:43:47,903 --> 00:43:51,153
Then in celebration of going
back to before: hoy hoy!

511
00:43:51,277 --> 00:43:52,930
Hoy hoy!

512
00:43:53,324 --> 00:43:54,052
Mi Ho.

513
00:43:54,127 --> 00:43:55,181
Would you like to drink more soda?

514
00:43:55,313 --> 00:43:57,843
When you drink soda,
you drink at least five.

515
00:43:57,938 --> 00:43:58,448
No!

516
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,841
There's some here.

517
00:43:59,977 --> 00:44:02,559
You left that here last time
so it's not cold.

518
00:44:02,662 --> 00:44:03,459
Here.

519
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:05,736
Drink this.

520
00:44:06,428 --> 00:44:09,718
You came by here, too?

521
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,212
Huh?

522
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:14,322
Yeah.

523
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,696
I stopped by in case you came back.

524
00:44:22,524 --> 00:44:25,533
You really did look for me!

525
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:29,682
Did you come every day?

526
00:44:30,993 --> 00:44:33,475
I just came by a couple times.

527
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:37,910
When a person disappears,
you can figure they'll show up eventually.

528
00:44:38,823 --> 00:44:40,837
But when you disappeared,

529
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:45,597
it seemed like you were gone completely
and I could never see you again.

530
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:53,359
But I thought you might come back
if I was here so I came every day.

531
00:44:56,212 --> 00:45:01,983
Anyways, it's a relief that I can
drink soda with you like this again.

532
00:45:07,097 --> 00:45:08,611
Dae Woong.

533
00:45:08,925 --> 00:45:16,523
Then can you hold on to my bead again
and be with me?

534
00:45:17,026 --> 00:45:18,442
Of course!

535
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:21,122
It's not even my first time, I'm confident!

536
00:45:21,206 --> 00:45:24,329
Can you hold on to it for a long time?

537
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:28,923
When I had the bead I felt refreshed
in the morning and slept well at night.

538
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:31,515
I'm a bead person.

539
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:33,939
That's such a relief!

540
00:45:34,703 --> 00:45:37,832
While we're at it, I'm ready
so give it to me. Here.

541
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,668
What do I do?

542
00:45:45,837 --> 00:45:48,137
I don't have the bead right now.

543
00:45:48,591 --> 00:45:49,921
What?

544
00:46:03,038 --> 00:46:03,754
Hey!

545
00:46:03,865 --> 00:46:06,425
How can you take that precious thing out
and leave it around?

546
00:46:06,561 --> 00:46:08,920
Just wait a second, I'll go get it quickly.

547
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:09,572
Yes.

548
00:46:09,698 --> 00:46:10,607
Go get it quickly.

549
00:46:10,731 --> 00:46:11,590
Okay.

550
00:46:13,206 --> 00:46:14,020
Should I go too?

551
00:46:14,158 --> 00:46:18,033
I'm special so I'll run quickly.

552
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:25,000
Dae Woong.

553
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:28,994
Even if I'm a little late,
you'll be here right?

554
00:46:29,093 --> 00:46:29,650
Yeah, yeah!

555
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,679
I'll go get my luggage again and stay here.

556
00:46:33,843 --> 00:46:36,182
Bring the bead carefully
and if you run too quickly,

557
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:39,118
you can tell you're not a human,
so be careful.

558
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:45,748
Come back quickly.

559
00:46:48,169 --> 00:46:49,334
Wow.

560
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:51,954
She's already over there!

561
00:46:52,206 --> 00:46:56,433
Wow, my Mi Ho is scarily fast!

562
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,681
I should go home quickly, too,
and get my luggage.

563
00:47:07,011 --> 00:47:08,699
It's cold.

564
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:12,361
Do I have to heat it up when she comes back?

565
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:20,384
It's been a long time since I've waited
for someone to come back.

566
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:27,492
Dae Woong came back.

567
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:29,577
Dae Woong came back to me!

568
00:47:34,263 --> 00:47:38,647
What kind of movie do you film
that requires staying overnight?

569
00:47:38,806 --> 00:47:40,096
Grandfather.

570
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:42,951
National athletes go into the athletes'
village before the Olympics, right?

571
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:48,457
Well, action actors get overnight training
at the action school before a movie.

572
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:49,705
How long?

573
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:52,598
Hmm..

574
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,143
3-4 days, one week?

575
00:47:55,276 --> 00:47:57,942
No, I think it'll be enough
by the full moon.

576
00:47:58,054 --> 00:48:00,260
I'm not allowed visits during
this time, so don't come.

577
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:02,021
I'll call often.

578
00:48:02,565 --> 00:48:03,312
Okay.

579
00:48:03,518 --> 00:48:05,480
Practice hard!

580
00:48:08,024 --> 00:48:12,905
This is the first time you've told me
"work hard", and let me leave the house.

581
00:48:13,513 --> 00:48:17,538
I caught you because you cut school
and ran away!

582
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:20,868
Why would I hold you back when you say
you're going to work hard?

583
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:22,247
Grandfather!

584
00:48:22,355 --> 00:48:25,055
I'm going to work hard enough
for my bones to break!

585
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,128
You can't work hard enough
for your bones to break!

586
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:30,717
Be smart, be smart about it!

587
00:48:30,846 --> 00:48:31,745
Okay.

588
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:35,879
Then I'll be smart, be smart about it.

589
00:48:40,027 --> 00:48:40,680
Come on.

590
00:48:40,746 --> 00:48:41,886
It's heavy!

591
00:48:42,178 --> 00:48:42,788
It's okay.

592
00:48:43,306 --> 00:48:44,468
I have strength.

593
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:45,667
Min Sook.

594
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:46,836
Min Sook.

595
00:48:47,068 --> 00:48:53,463
Dae Woong's luggage is heavy,
take him to the action school.

596
00:48:55,028 --> 00:48:55,714
Huh?

597
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,790
I'm not going there.

598
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:00,688
Father.

599
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,687
Don't even say the A of Action
in front of me anymore.

600
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:05,845
Hey!

601
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:10,984
As she gorging on that stuff,
she must have gotten dumped again.

602
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,222
Grandfather.

603
00:49:12,381 --> 00:49:14,719
So what if aunt can't get married?

604
00:49:14,847 --> 00:49:17,358
I'll succeed and take care of her
to the very end.

605
00:49:17,448 --> 00:49:18,472
Don't feel uncomfortable about it!

606
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,104
Uncomfortable?

607
00:49:20,196 --> 00:49:23,345
Do I make you uncomfortable too?

608
00:49:25,516 --> 00:49:27,653
That, that, that...!

609
00:49:34,835 --> 00:49:36,123
Min Sook.

610
00:49:37,085 --> 00:49:38,631
Stop eating ice cream.

611
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:39,991
Your stomach will hurt!

612
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:41,847
Grandfather!

613
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:42,434
Aunt!

614
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:44,837
Bye!

615
00:49:49,972 --> 00:49:52,208
<i>You didn't forget about our
dinner plans today, right?</i>

616
00:49:52,388 --> 00:49:53,635
<i>See you later!~</i>

617
00:49:53,715 --> 00:49:55,091
Oh right, noona!

618
00:49:56,289 --> 00:49:57,634
What do I do?

619
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,742
I'm meeting Dae Woong later, and tell him
to hurry up with the agency contract.

620
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:07,892
I met him because you recommended him,
but after seeing him, he's pretty awesome.

621
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:14,230
If this movie does well, Dae Woong and I
will become very different.

622
00:50:14,802 --> 00:50:16,683
Is he really your school hoobae*?
[*junior]

623
00:50:16,706 --> 00:50:20,472
You can't start a scandal together and
cause trouble after we help you two out!

624
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,221
He's just a hoobae.

625
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:26,337
Do you think I'd do something so stupid
during an important time like this?

626
00:50:26,347 --> 00:50:29,362
Hae In, you're smart so if you two
did start dating,

627
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:32,304
<i>- you'd manage so even I wouldn't know.
- Dad! Let's go shopping!</i>

628
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:33,302
<i>Let's go shopping.</i>

629
00:50:33,384 --> 00:50:34,752
You head out first, Director.

630
00:50:34,853 --> 00:50:36,677
Oh, shall I? Okay.

631
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,931
<i>Hello Director.</i>

632
00:50:41,307 --> 00:50:43,034
Ah, hello.

633
00:50:43,324 --> 00:50:45,655
You must be going somewhere with Seon Nyeo.

634
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:47,596
I'm going shopping with dad.

635
00:50:49,076 --> 00:50:49,812
Daughter.

636
00:50:50,261 --> 00:50:52,692
Shopping is something you do alone.

637
00:50:53,393 --> 00:50:55,811
Seems like today will be hot too.

638
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,345
<i>Dad!</i>

639
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,227
Seon Nyeo!

640
00:51:00,304 --> 00:51:01,574
Then go with me.

641
00:51:01,695 --> 00:51:02,541
With you?

642
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:05,188
I was going to buy Dae Woong
a celebration present.

643
00:51:05,317 --> 00:51:06,955
A celebration present?

644
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,911
Ah, you don't know what happened
to Dae Woong?

645
00:51:11,382 --> 00:51:13,142
What happened?

646
00:51:13,526 --> 00:51:17,829
Dae Woong got hurt so he can't
do the movie anymore.

647
00:51:17,994 --> 00:51:20,386
He must not have told you yet.

648
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:23,426
He can't do the movie anymore?

649
00:51:33,238 --> 00:51:34,381
Please give me these couple rings.

650
00:51:34,498 --> 00:51:35,062
Sir.

651
00:51:35,185 --> 00:51:37,633
These are also bestsellers.

652
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:40,507
I don't have time to choose a pair,
so please just give me these.

653
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,895
You must be in a hurry.

654
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:43,064
Yes.

655
00:51:43,255 --> 00:51:45,652
It's someone whose heart
I must hurry to grab.

656
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:48,009
- Please wrap it quickly.
- Yes.

657
00:51:52,627 --> 00:51:56,590
I'll have to convince noona well with this
so she doesn't misunderstand.

658
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,297
Hmm?

659
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,290
Wow!

660
00:52:05,509 --> 00:52:08,000
This is totally Mi Ho's style.

661
00:52:08,614 --> 00:52:12,420
I got my contract payment so
let's get something for Mi Ho, too.

662
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:14,136
- Please give me this!
- Yes!

663
00:52:19,314 --> 00:52:20,246
Huh?

664
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,918
What are you in a hurry to say?

665
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,051
Dae Woong.

666
00:52:25,182 --> 00:52:26,814
I heard you can't do the movie.

667
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:28,799
I heard everything from Seon Nyeo.

668
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,448
Noona!

669
00:52:30,613 --> 00:52:31,361
Don't worry!

670
00:52:31,574 --> 00:52:32,414
I can do it!

671
00:52:32,577 --> 00:52:34,880
It's not something you can just
insist you can do.

672
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:37,348
I heard the doctor told you to give up!

673
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,516
I'm okay.

674
00:52:41,008 --> 00:52:44,943
It almost became a problem but
I found a way to take care of everything.

675
00:52:45,643 --> 00:52:48,890
I had something to tell you anyway...

676
00:52:48,996 --> 00:52:50,595
<i>I'm not okay.</i>

677
00:52:50,711 --> 00:52:53,119
You should have told me first
about something like that.

678
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:55,462
I didn't even know that and
recommended you to the agency.

679
00:52:55,552 --> 00:52:58,510
How does that make me look?

680
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,804
I was trying to give you an opportunity
even while worrying

681
00:53:10,956 --> 00:53:13,410
about you and me having
a special relationship.

682
00:53:13,597 --> 00:53:16,248
Now what do I do?

683
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:23,396
I'm still new, I don't want to be looked
down on for going against company policy.

684
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:27,963
What if you had lied about leaving the movie
and signed the contract?

685
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:32,812
I would have been misunderstood
as tricking the agency for my boyfriend.

686
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:38,278
I'll make sure you're not misunderstood.

687
00:53:40,194 --> 00:53:42,224
I'll make sure you don't get misunderstood

688
00:53:42,314 --> 00:53:46,120
about me being your boyfriend
or you introducing me

689
00:53:46,229 --> 00:53:48,590
so don't worry.

690
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:32,080
I wasn't trying to trick noona.

691
00:54:37,225 --> 00:54:43,089
The person I was really trying to trick
was Mi Ho.

692
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:51,641
You already decided?

693
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:53,748
I thought you would
think about it a bit longer.

694
00:54:53,876 --> 00:54:57,230
Dae Woong said he would hold on to my bead.

695
00:54:57,554 --> 00:55:01,407
What if Cha Dae Woong can't wait 100 days
and goes to another woman

696
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:04,348
Or runs far away with your bead
before the end?

697
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:08,546
I trust Dae Woong.

698
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:16,596
The girl who looked like you, Kil Dal,
said that too.

699
00:55:16,812 --> 00:55:20,556
She wanted to become a human
and she loved a human.

700
00:55:21,012 --> 00:55:25,958
But in the end she was betrayed by him
and disappeared without a trace.

701
00:55:26,084 --> 00:55:29,457
You could die like that too.

702
00:55:32,507 --> 00:55:38,014
Can you really endure death?

703
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:43,146
I can do it.

704
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,065
Fine.

705
00:56:17,205 --> 00:56:19,034
I'll let you go.

706
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:21,803
<i>But I'll give you some advice.</i>

707
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:25,289
Don't tell Cha Dae Woong that you're trying
to become a human.

708
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,681
<i>He perceives you to be quite easy.</i>

709
00:56:27,973 --> 00:56:34,996
He needs to stay a little bit afraid
so that he won't just run away.

710
00:56:35,932 --> 00:56:39,720
I can't tell him, right?

711
00:56:46,071 --> 00:56:51,909
If you drink my blood, you will slowly die.

712
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:59,152
<i>You will slowly be emptied
of your gumiho energy.</i>

713
00:57:03,144 --> 00:57:07,292
And if the energy gained from a human
by the bead

714
00:57:07,973 --> 00:57:12,703
<i>fills you again,</i>

715
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:21,099
you will become a human.

716
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:47,852
Why isn't Mi Ho coming?

717
00:57:49,211 --> 00:57:52,925
Did she disappear again?

718
00:58:01,224 --> 00:58:02,034
Huh?

719
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:05,989
Mi Ho!

720
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:07,669
When did you come?

721
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:10,772
You should have called me when you got here.
What are you doing?

722
00:58:10,957 --> 00:58:11,972
Dae Woong.

723
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,732
I brought the bead.

724
00:58:15,908 --> 00:58:20,941
So this is the fox bead that was in me?

725
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:22,220
Yeah.

726
00:58:23,393 --> 00:58:26,889
You can hold on to this, right?

727
00:58:27,252 --> 00:58:28,338
Huh?

728
00:58:31,084 --> 00:58:32,082
Yeah.

729
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:36,983
While you're holding on to my bead,
you can't go far from me.

730
00:58:37,076 --> 00:58:43,076
You can't share your chi with another woman
and you need to stay by me, only with me.

731
00:58:44,117 --> 00:58:44,959
I know.

732
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:49,004
If I'm getting your bead,
I'll have to keep that promise.

733
00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:54,436
Can you keep it for 100 days?

734
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,812
- 100 days?
- Yes!

735
00:58:56,978 --> 00:58:59,475
You have to hold on to it
for 100 days this time.

736
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:02,679
You cannot give up in the middle, ever!

737
00:59:02,765 --> 00:59:03,475
Hey!

738
00:59:03,576 --> 00:59:05,745
100 days is too long!

739
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:07,645
You're telling me not to meet any
other women for 100 days

740
00:59:07,735 --> 00:59:09,662
and to just stay by your side?

741
00:59:09,733 --> 00:59:13,259
Hey, what are you, my girlfriend?

742
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:17,533
If that's what a girlfriend is, fine!

743
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:19,795
I want to be your girlfriend!

744
00:59:19,951 --> 00:59:20,982
Hey!

745
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:23,256
How can a gumiho be a human's girlfriend?

746
00:59:23,364 --> 00:59:24,425
Does that make sense?

747
00:59:24,548 --> 00:59:25,478
Why doesn't it?

748
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,909
I can do it too!

749
00:59:27,046 --> 00:59:29,198
Make me your girlfriend!

750
00:59:29,277 --> 00:59:30,810
You said you felt empty when I left.

751
00:59:30,907 --> 00:59:32,209
You said you looked for me.

752
00:59:32,287 --> 00:59:36,160
You said you were worried I disappeared.

753
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:37,918
Dae Woong!

754
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,727
Let me be your girlfriend.

755
00:59:41,334 --> 00:59:42,950
Never!

756
00:59:53,052 --> 00:59:54,710
I'm going crazy.

757
00:59:58,043 --> 01:00:00,087
No matter how much I need the bead,

758
01:00:00,288 --> 01:00:04,190
how can I become a gumiho's boyfriend?

759
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:11,149
How could she think of such
a punishing thought?

760
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:22,582
Dae Woong.

761
01:00:25,185 --> 01:00:26,732
<i>I'll leave.</i>

762
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:34,487
I'm going back to where I was.

763
01:00:36,214 --> 01:00:41,831
If I leave this time, I won't be able
to come out into the world again.

764
01:00:41,924 --> 01:00:44,843
<i>I won't come to you ever again.</i>

765
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:50,600
Then I can't see you again?

766
01:00:52,268 --> 01:00:53,628
Yeah.

767
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,174
Then you can't see me again.

768
01:00:58,398 --> 01:01:02,033
You're leaving now?

769
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:03,942
<i>I'll leave.</i>

770
01:01:05,059 --> 01:01:07,418
<i>Be well, Dae Woong.</i>

771
01:01:12,095 --> 01:01:14,565
There's something you've misunderstood.

772
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:22,627
Searching because I felt empty and being
worried because I thought you disappeared...

773
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:25,402
It wasn't because of you.

774
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,875
It was because of the bead.

775
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:32,203
I needed the bead so I tricked you.

776
01:01:32,285 --> 01:01:37,338
Can you still give me the bead?

777
01:01:39,244 --> 01:01:40,542
Yeah.

778
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,192
Don't you even feel bad?

779
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:48,446
It's still okay?

780
01:01:49,528 --> 01:01:53,752
It would be nice if you said you needed me,

781
01:01:53,899 --> 01:01:57,827
but the bead is a part of me
and you won't disappear.

782
01:01:57,916 --> 01:01:59,448
It's better now.

783
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:03,524
If you like the bead that much,

784
01:02:03,551 --> 01:02:05,096
you won't leave me while you have it.

785
01:02:09,716 --> 01:02:13,533
Is it really 100 days?

786
01:02:13,765 --> 01:02:16,857
Yes, it's 100 days.

787
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:19,444
It can't even be 101 days?

788
01:02:19,573 --> 01:02:20,787
It's exactly 100 days.

789
01:02:20,896 --> 01:02:21,444
Yes.

790
01:02:21,555 --> 01:02:23,594
Exactly 100 days.

791
01:02:24,501 --> 01:02:30,425
Since it's come down to this, I'll close
my eyes and just do it for 100 days.

792
01:02:31,237 --> 01:02:35,159
Then I'm your girlfriend now?

793
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:42,548
Even though you're a gumiho,
you're still a girl.

794
01:02:43,114 --> 01:02:44,980
Don't you have any pride?

795
01:02:50,321 --> 01:02:52,345
Anyway, this isn't right.

796
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,805
You said you'd let me!

797
01:02:57,898 --> 01:03:00,434
Let me be your girlfriend!

798
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:26,045
Since I'm a human, I'll do this human-style.

799
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,102
Gu Mi Ho.

800
01:03:31,957 --> 01:03:34,126
Please be my girlfriend.

801
01:03:56,687 --> 01:04:02,989
From now on, Gu Mi Ho is Cha Dae Woong's
girlfriend for 100 days.

802
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:25,872
The most painful death for a human is not
their own, it's the death of a loved one.

803
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:39,837
I didn't tell her what happens when he
returns the bead he's kept for 100 days.

804
01:04:47,912 --> 01:04:49,254
What's that?

805
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:53,777
It's something I have to drink in exchange
for taking out my bead for a long time.

806
01:04:57,692 --> 01:04:58,572
Here.

807
01:04:58,878 --> 01:05:00,101
One shot!

808
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:12,473
<i>The death you must endure after
100 days when you become a human...</i>

809
01:05:12,589 --> 01:05:13,580
<i>will be Cha Dae Woong's death.</i>

Let's keep our distance.

817
01:05:35,536 --> 01:05:36,581
Woong!

818
01:05:36,785 --> 01:05:38,470
I don't have the confidence
to see your face.

819
01:05:38,546 --> 01:05:40,072
<i>You have no fear in your eyes.</i>

820
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:44,886
I am not the type of person who'd sacrifice
the seriousness of the moves out of fear.

821
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:47,084
<i>I just have to endure 100 days,
then I'll have reached the end.</i>

822
01:05:47,218 --> 01:05:49,525
After a 100 days, I can become a human too!

823
01:05:49,671 --> 01:05:53,837
<i>He was blatantly wearing a ring that was
unmistakably a couple ring.</i>

824
01:05:54,023 --> 01:05:57,204
Cha Dae Woong is like lightning.
He has another girlfriend already!

825
01:05:57,303 --> 01:05:58,158
Couple ring?

826
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,465
What are you doing with
your tails spread out?

827
01:06:00,611 --> 01:06:02,369
You're Cha Dae Woong sunbaenim,* right?
[*senior]

828
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,162
Your name?

829
01:06:03,248 --> 01:06:03,942
It's Mi Nyeo.

830
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:05,225
<i>Go Mi Nyeo.</i>

831
01:06:05,226 --> 01:06:07,226
What'd you do with the ring?!
