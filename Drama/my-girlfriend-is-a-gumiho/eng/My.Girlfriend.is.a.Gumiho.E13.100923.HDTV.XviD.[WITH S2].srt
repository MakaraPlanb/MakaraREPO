3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,570
Why didn't you tell me?

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,990
Why didn't you tell me
that you were going to die?

5
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,439
I'll... protect you.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,190
I too... will protect you.

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,430
There are only 51 days left.

8
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,030
But today's not over yet.

9
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,070
So there are 52 days left.

10
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,710
You don't want the days to pass quickly?

11
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,270
It's because each day I get to
spend with you is so precious.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,000
We can't let this precious day
pass just like this.

13
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,930
Let's go out.

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,139
Okay.

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,589
Let's go for a walk.

16
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,180
No.

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,980
To go on a date with you, Mi Ho, I've fought
obstacles and traveled a difficult road.

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,679
So go on a date with me.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,960
Please.

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,070
Okay.

21
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,360
You said that if I were stabbed
with this knife,

22
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,170
I'd immediately die and fade away, right?

23
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,350
Because you found out...

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,480
are you now thinking of disappearing?

25
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,159
Um... this cow-colored one, and the
pig-colored one and the chicken-colored one.

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,299
Please mix them up well.

27
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,809
A lot of the cow-colored one.

28
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,520
A lot of the cow-colored one, please.

29
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,180
Wow!

30
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,839
Honey, you're tired, aren't you?

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,810
Yeah, a little.

32
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,739
Oh, I'm tired.

33
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,069
- Woong-ah!
- Oh, I'm tired.

34
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,079
Woong-ah, are you tired?

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,549
Oh, yeah.

36
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,739
Oh, Mi Ho! You don't have to!

37
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,790
Mi Ho, let me down!

38
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,100
Woong-ah, if you're tired, feel free
to tell me anytime. I'll piggyback you.

39
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,140
O- okay.

40
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,050
You've lost some of your tails but I see
you haven't lost your strength.

41
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,159
I still have five of them left.

42
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,620
I'm an oh*-mi-ho.
[*Oh = five]

43
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,119
I want to eat the cow-colored one first!

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,450
All right, eat a lot!

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,029
Honey, say ah!

46
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,830
Ah!

47
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,059
Mi Ho, me too, ah!

48
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,370
I'm done!

49
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,269
Hey, you downed that in one shot?

50
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,879
Ah that was delicious!

51
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,980
I feel like I'm about to lose a tail!*
[*from happiness]

52
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,309
My Mi Ho has quite an appetite.

53
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,240
It figures the cow-colored one
is the most delicious out of these, too.

54
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,630
Aigoo, please. How childish.

55
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,259
Woong-ah, what are they doing?

56
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,600
That?

57
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,059
Well they put their hands together
like this...

58
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,139
...and show the other person
that they love them.

59
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,310
Ah, so it's similar to this then.

60
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,390
Hey, that's just cautiously
sending a small display of love.

61
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,160
There are ones that are this big too!

62
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,539
Do you like it?

63
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,710
Yeah!

64
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,940
Hey! I'm shooting you a heart of love
but you just imitate a cow yet again?

65
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,729
This isn't a cow!

66
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,990
This is something I learned from auntie.

67
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,530
These are my heart antennae that are always
pointing towards the one my heart is with.

68
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,729
Is that really what it means?

69
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,140
Yeah!

70
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,349
Ah so that's why Director Ban was
always doing this at the set every day.

71
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,879
Wow... Director's always telling me
to not focus on anything else...

72
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,699
...and just concentrate on the action!

73
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,200
But he's had his share of distractions!

74
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,859
Wait a second... this, this...

75
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,010
Does this mean that Director is going
to secretly come back to meet my aunt?

76
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,490
Min Sook!

77
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,330
I was so lonely
as I was filming in the desert.

78
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,380
Then I suddenly heard your voice.

79
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,990
So you did receive the signal
that my heart sent off.

80
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,190
Beep beep, beep beep.

81
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,049
That's right!

82
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,100
That's how I called for you.

83
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,490
Min Sook...

84
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,260
Oh...

85
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,950
I didn't have time to wash off the sweat...

86
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,240
...that I shed while I was in the desert.

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,480
I- it's okay.

88
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,699
Oh, Director!

89
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,920
Oh...

90
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,550
Why don't we...

91
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,590
Let's go sweat out the sweat
that you shed in the desert at the sauna!

92
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,469
Now that I see you, Min Sook,

93
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,590
I'm reminded of a cute lamb I saw
while I was in the desert.

94
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,180
You're like Lawrence of Arabia, Director.

95
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,419
If you have sunglasses on,
you look like Chow Yun Fat.

96
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,639
And with the towel on,
you look like Lawrence.

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,889
There's nothing that doesn't suit you.

98
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,320
When I grow a mustache,
I've been told I look like...

99
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,989
Now what kind of Gable was it?

100
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,590
Ah, I was told I resemble Clark Gable.

101
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,039
That's right, that's right!

102
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,959
Then I want to be Vivian Leigh.

103
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,010
What?

104
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,019
That's right!

105
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,920
Vivian Leigh.

106
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,859
Please drink some.

107
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,210
Ah yes.

108
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,620
Cheers.

109
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,539
Now this is called a sauna.

110
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,379
Since our stomachs are cold
from the ice cream...

111
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,289
...we can cover them
and just lay here.

112
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,539
Sauna*? That's a funny name.
[*literally, Heat Treatment Room]

113
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,550
They say people come here to get steamed!

114
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,479
If it were the old times...

115
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,459
...people would have to be cautious
about bringing you here because...

116
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,659
...you could have misunderstood and thought
this was a place for people to get steamed.

117
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,849
That's right, I almost assumed wrong!

118
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,169
Look, it says that they'll roast you there.
[We roast you until you're nice and brown!]

119
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,499
And there you can get heated.
[Please heat yourself moderately]

120
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,359
And there you can get chopped!
[You can chop your whole body here!]

121
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,440
You can steam, roast, heat and chop!

122
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,060
This place seems scarier than a gumiho
who eats people's livers!

123
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,259
Then shall we get a start on steaming,
roasting, heating, and chopping?

124
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,560
Should we?

125
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,150
Let's go there first!

126
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,850
[Please heat yourself moderately]

127
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,429
Since we've come in here,

128
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,299
you've become Steamed Fox.

129
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,299
Since you're Woong,
you're Steamed Bear.

130
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,519
Oh, you.

131
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,490
[Please heat yourself moderately]

132
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,799
Woong-ah! It's too hot!

133
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,469
It's so hot I feel like my tails
are going to catch on fire!

134
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,529
Really?

135
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,340
You don't even have that many tails left
so we can't have that.

136
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,509
Let's go cool your butt off.

137
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,770
Let's go!

138
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,239
Ah, it's so nice and cool!

139
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,150
- You're cool now?
- Yes!

140
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,549
Then does that mean your tails
have calmed down?

141
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,409
Wooooooonnnngggg-ahhhh.

142
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,560
Wow!

143
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,900
Why does he have sunglasses on
when we're at a sauna?

144
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,389
It's Director Ban!

145
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,860
Director Ban?!

146
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,450
I can't let him see that I'm here! Let's go.

147
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,570
Director!

148
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,339
It's my aunt!

149
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,070
Have some eggs!

150
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,720
Have some eggs.

151
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,719
Director, since you went through so much...

152
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,799
...your square jaw
has become as oval as this egg.

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,880
You need to take care of your health
so have all of these eggs.

154
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,569
You should leave your body in the hands
of these massage chairs, Min Sook.

155
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,800
It's quite good
at getting every square inch.

156
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,080
They must be a couple.

157
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,250
They look so sweet.

158
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,919
Although I'm not the type of person to speak
badly of someone within earshot,

159
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,880
I always want to tell off those young kids
glued to each other these days.

160
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,499
But it's a common tendency
of young people today...

161
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,460
...to disregard what others think and
openly express their love so passionately.

162
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,290
Look deeply into my eyes.

163
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,220
Although I don't express it as openly...

164
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,370
...the love inside my heart
is at bursting point.

165
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,490
So please don't envy them so much.

166
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,400
Oh, Director!

167
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,180
I didn't tell him I was home yet,
so I can't get caught.

168
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,569
Your aunt must have
kept her heart's antennae up...

169
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,349
...and called him every day
for him to have heard and come back.

170
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,030
You're probably right.

171
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,030
We shouldn't listen to any more.
Let's keep covered and go.

172
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,910
When we were apart,
the time didn't seem to pass at all.

173
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,940
But now that we're together,
several hours flew by.

174
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,540
Yeah, now that we're together,
the time is passing really quickly.

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,450
What?
Becoming a shriveled grandma scares you?

177
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,450
No.

178
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,410
I, too, want to be with you for that long.

179

I take back the bead, they say you'll die.

192

In order to keep you safe,
I have to disappear.

193
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,870

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,750

After I disappear...

197
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,310
- Mi Ho! - ... please don't be too shocked
and don't be in too much pain, okay?

198
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,490
Even then, please still call for me
once in a while like you are now.

199
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,730
Then I'll remain alive in you forever.

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,810
Right?

201
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,210
You'll remember me forever, right?

202
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,780
I found you!

203
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,430
You were here?

204
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,450
Yeah, I was here.

205
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,700
By your side.

206
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,860
So Dae Woong left also?

207
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,300
He was really worried because
he had left Mi Ho all by herself.

208
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,299
It was a big turn off seeing
Cha Dae Woong treat girls so poorly...

209
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,259
...but seeing the way he treats her now
makes him look so handsome.

210
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,890
When he has to go back,
he wants to bring Mi Ho with him.

211
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,950
He wants to bring Mi Ho with him?

212
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,579
I, the actress, have to go
in a few weeks...

213
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,929
...so why would the stand-in go now?

214
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,869
And also, how can she leave the country?

215
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,299
That's ridiculous.

216
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,210
Mi Ho has a passport.

217
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,809
What?

218
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,390
Dae Woong already paid for
the plane ticket too.

219
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,679
I always thought Mi Ho's name
was unique but...

220
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,969
...she has another name that's more normal.

221
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,829
What is it?

222
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,649
I think it was Park Sun Ju.

223
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,360
Anyway, it was an ordinary name.

224
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,170
Park Sun Ju?

225
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:30,110
Seon Nyeo, do you want to go
to the desert with me?

226
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,860
No, it'll mess with my complexion.

Did that person do this?

235
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,040
Did you make her a passport so that
she could follow Dae Woong wherever he went?

236
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:25,010
It wasn't so that she could go with him,
rather so that I could take her far away.

237
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,029
I won't let her go with him.

238
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,129
Dae Woong wants to go with her!

239

Go scare Cha Dae Woong
so I won't have to do anything to him.

I think we're going to have to
put this off for now.

00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,360
His goatee is cute too!

348
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,750
His hair grew a lot already.

349
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,399
Mi Ho's association registration
is all ready.

350
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,119
Thanks.

351
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,589
Hey, she's going to be going regardless.

352
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,570
Is it that great that you're taking her
just a little earlier?

353
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:46,170
Yeah. Mi Ho gets sick once in a while,
so I have to stay by her side all the time.

354
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,750
Anyway, thanks for this!

355
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,680
Dae Woong!

356
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,070
That bead of hers that you have in your...

357
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,180
...is it really safe?

358
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,349
Noona, I already told you not to interfere
in Mi Ho's and my business.

359
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,330
I'm not acting this way because of any
residual feelings I might have for you.

360
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,070
I'm truly worried about you, that's all.

361
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,250
That kid Mi Ho...

362
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,200
...I really believe she planned something
with Park Dong Ju and is hiding it from you.

363
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,099
You know that too, Noona?

364
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,589
Dae Woong, you're in danger.

365
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,240
I'm certain that you're stuck between
the two of them and that you're being used!

366
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,440
You're right.

367
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,510
Mi Ho is using me right now.

368
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,470
It's true, right?

369
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,750
Because she needs me,
I told her to use me as much as she wants.

370
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,380
That's everything, right?

371
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,260
Are you really going to follow
Cha Dae Woong and go?

372
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,040
It's because it hurts.

373
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:32,440
When my tails disappear, it hurts so much
that I have to be by Dae Woong and the bead.

374
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,270
So the pain is lessened
when you're with Cha Dae Woong, right?

375
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,620
That means I won't be able to stop you
from going.

376
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,700
You said that if you go tomorrow,
you'll be back in a month, right?

377
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,700
You need to come back no matter what, okay?

378
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,260
I know.

379
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,779
I have to go out for a little while.
Do you want to stay here?

380
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,370
Okay, I'll stay here. Go ahead.

381
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,240
Thank you.

382
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,210
Of course.

383
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,220
Don't touch it!

384
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,199
Just what are you trying to do?

385
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,160
Teacher Dong Ju, I need your knife.

386
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,030
So if I try to force the bead out of him...

387
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,740
...will you kill yourself with that knife?

388
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:43,340
Instead of becoming human,
you'd rather die?

389
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,060
To save Cha Dae Woong?

390
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,600
I need to keep Dae Woong safe.

391
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,750
We're going to have to buy another album.

392
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,520
A really big one.

393
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,790
That's quite a grand love you have...

394
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,390
...but it's too one-sided.

395
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,160
You're saying you love Cha Dae Woong enough
that you'd die for him,

396
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,970
but would he do the same?

397
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,389
From what I can see, it doesn't seem so.

398
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,749
Dae Woong loves me.

399
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,540
Then why don't you try asking him?

400
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,540
Would he be willing to die for you?

401
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,060
You're not certain of that, are you?

402
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,389
You're not certain of that...

403
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,659
... so isn't it unfair that
you're preparing yourself for death?

404
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,400
Since you're going to die
without him knowing,

405
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,700
he won't recognize the importance and since
you didn't leave a lasting impression...

406
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,910
...he'll forget about you in no time.

407
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,940
And once he forgets you...

408
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,500
...another woman will take your place.

409
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,169
He won't forget me that quickly,
and he'll long for me.

410
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,210
He won't ever forget me,
and he'll love me for the rest of his life.

411
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,520
You have such a fantasy of love.

412
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:27,040
That's probably why you made such
a ridiculous decision to die for love.

413
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:33,460
It seems to you that the person you love
would die for you, right?

414
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,800
But he won't ever be able
to give up his life.

415
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,320
It seems to you that
he'll remember you forever, right?

416
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,430
He'll be quick to forget about you.

417
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,550
It seems to you that he'll think about you
and only you, right?

418
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,610
He'll be immersed in another love.

419
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,430
It seems like you decided to die
because of a fantasy about love,

420
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,170
but you need to get over that.

421
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,380
Then you'll see it's unfair and
you won't be able to die after all.

422
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:08,070
It's not unfair to me at all.

423
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,030
Try finding out for sure.

424
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,240
Because regret won't mean anything
after death.

425
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,240
Why did Teacher Dong Ju have to go
and say something like that?

426
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,270
I had already made up my mind...

427
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,460
[China/Mongolia]

428
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,500
Woong-ah!

429
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,669
I have something I want to ask you.

430
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,899
Huh?

431
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,209
Imagine we're both drowning in the ocean
and there's only one piece of wood.

432
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,610
- Uh-huh...
- And neither of us can swim.

433
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,890
Then would you give me that piece of wood?

434
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,769
How big is that piece of wood, exactly?

435
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,080
It's so small that
only one person can hold onto it.

436
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,629
If I give it to you, then what about me?

437
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,430
You said I can't swim.
Then am I supposed to just die?

438
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,980
Then you wouldn't give it to me?

439
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,630
You have nothing to worry about,
I'm a good swimmer.

440
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,420
Dae Woong!

441
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,550
Imagine that...

442
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:34,989
...there was a fire here
and only one of us could escape.

443
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,250
Who would you have escape first?

444
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,250
Think about it carefully.

445
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,700
How would we have time to think in a fire?
We'd just run as fast as we could.

446
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,510
I'd make sure that you got out first though.

447
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,810
That's because you're a gumiho, of course,
you'd make sure the human was safe.

448
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,130
You have nothing to worry about;
there won't ever be a fire here.

449
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,210
Dae Woong!

450
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,889
Imagine that...

451
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,169
Another one?

452
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:12,030
If you and I were dangling off a cliff and
there's only one rope to climb to safety...

453
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:16,109
Then would you grab the rope first?

454
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,150
Or would you give it to me?

455
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,510
I don't like mountains so there's no reason
why I'd be dangling from a cliff.

456
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,140
Mi Ho, you've begun worrying about
pointless things, you know that?

457
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,699
Are you starting to worry
because your powers are ebbing away?

458
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,689
That's not it; I just want to know
who you'd give the rope to.

459
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,200
Would you give it to me?

460
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,739
All right, I'll give it to you then.

461
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,079
You can have it all to yourself.

462
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,840
Tell me the honest truth.

463
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,479
You don't really want to give it to me,
do you?

464
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,120
You want it for yourself, don't you?

465
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,299
I said I'd give it to you! You can have it!

466
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,509
Tell me the truth!
You wouldn't give it to me.

467
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,789
You don't care as long as
you're alive, right?

468
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,950
Of course I want to stay alive,
who in the world wants to die?

469
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,639
Mi Ho, you have no reason to worry about
such pointless things.

470
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,789
I'm going to take a short nap,
so you should go take one too.

471
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,190
I'm going to sleep now!

472
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,860
Aigoo.

473
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,830
Saying that he'd die in my place
isn't the only way he can show me his love.

474
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,560
That's just a fantasy.

475
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,950
That's right,
I'm not hoping for anything like that.

476
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:39,260
I just want him to keep remembering me.

477
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,430
That's it.

478
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,309
Let's go shopping for some things
to bring to China.

479
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,360
You're going to have to buy
another pair of sneakers, right?

480
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,549
Woong-ah, you bought me a pair
before you left. The white ones.

481
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,060
You don't remember?

482
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,770
Ah, did I?

483
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,800
It must have slipped my mind.

484
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,070
You don't remember?

485
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,600
You forgot?!

486
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,770
Even though it hasn't even been a month?

487
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,990
I'm sorry.

488
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,119
Then aside from sneakers,
is there anything else you need?

489
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,799
Woong-ah, do you remember what chased us
when you first saw me?

490
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,610
Umm... a boar!

491
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,770
Then do you remember what you said
when you first saw me?

492
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,710
I said you were a demon.

493
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:35,740
No, you said, "Wow, you're pretty. "

494
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,139
Hey that was said
in a moment of shameless ogling.

495
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,089
Okay, fine, I'll give that a pass.

496
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:45,470
Then do you remember what kind of tree
I perched you on?

497
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,970
Tree?

498
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,509
A tree is just a tree...

499
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,089
You don't remember if the tree's leaves
were pointy or round?

500
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,490
Hey, who in the world
can remember things like that?

501
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,869
I guess no one
would remember things like that.

502
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,409
What's going on with you?

503
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,760
Is your memory fading along
with your powers?

504
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,089
Man, that's not good...

505
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,070
No! I have a good memory.

506
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,690
I remember everything.

507
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,100
Mi Ho!

508
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,060
It's normal for him not to remember
every little thing.

509
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,780
But... he will start to forget
more and more, right?

510
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,790
Dae Woong said he has a punishable memory.

511
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,729
Do you know a good fortune teller?

512
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,040
Fortune teller?

513
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,269
I know a shaman that was in my dad's movie.

514
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,830
Will my place be filled by
The Hater or Merong?

515
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,840
Mi Ho! Let's go.

516
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,269
Woong-ah,
today let's go where I want to go...

517
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,159
...and have fun
and never forget anything, okay?

518
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,349
Let's do it.

519
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,299
Where do you want to go?

520
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,230
Ah, where I said I wanted to go yesterday.

521
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,099
W- where?

522
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,210
I said just yesterday.

523
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,670
You don't remember?

524
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,029
So where is that?

525
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,409
The zoo!

526
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,379
I said yesterday
that I wanted to go to the zoo!

527
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,310
A- ah, the z- zoo...

528
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,240
Of all the places I said yesterday,
I couldn't think of the zoo.

529
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,599
H- hey, but that's possible of me.

530
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,299
Why are you getting so mad?

531
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,740
If you can't even remember what I said
yesterday, what on earth will you remember?

532
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,099
Mi Ho...

533
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,729
You'll forget everything,
and not give me the rope.

534
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,190
And be with The Hater and Merong,
aren't you?

535
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,380
Then... then it'll be unfair for me!

536
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,410
Mi Ho!

537
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,140
Mi Ho!

538
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,400
Oh my, I guess they fight too.

539
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,489
I know, right?

540
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,390
Maybe it was good I backed off before
I got a charm to use against them.

541
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,170
Unni, were you going to use a charm
to force them to break up?

542
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,130
Even you aren't Jang Hee Bin*, Unni.
[*legendary femme fatale]

543
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,240
That's not it.

544
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,570
Ahjumma.

545
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,010
If someone passes away...

546
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,279
...do people forget about them completely
and continue living their lives?

547
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,169
Of course, people that are alive
have to keep living!

548
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,600
As I work hard in this chicken shop, I don't
think about the person who left before me.

549
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,679
Aigoo, if I wallowed in thoughts of him...

550
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,910
...do you think I'd be able to
get on with my life and survive?

551
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,090
Woong-ah!

552
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,490
Woong-ah!

553
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,710
Woong-ah, are you inside?

554
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,460
Don't come in!

555
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,310
Dae Woong, I'm sorry.

556
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,139
I'm really sorry.

557
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,779
I was wrong.

558
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,239
Don't come in yet!

559
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,949
Woong-ah, don't be mad anymore!

560
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,889
Let's talk face-to-face!

561
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,440
No!

562
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,350
You're really mad, aren't you?

563
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,580
Aish!

564
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,670
Man, I was almost done too!

565
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,190
What is this?

566
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,289
Kimbap.

567
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,350
We need some
if we're going to go to the zoo.

568
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,570
I bought some bubbly water too.

569
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,960
Woong-ah...

570
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,029
We went to the zoo.

571
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,370
Really?

572
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,829
To the zoo?

573
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:31,399
Yes. At the zoo,
we saw a big Dae Woong bear...

574
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,680
...a baby bear, another bear
that looked like Ddoong Ja, and a fox too.

575
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,910
Aigoo.

576
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,020
You were at the sauna yesterday,
weren't you?

577
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,150
It was you, wasn't it?!

578
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,899
How could-

579
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,239
Your grandfather
wanted so badly to see you.

580
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,659
How could you go see your girlfriend
as soon as you get back?

581
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,469
My word, they say that when a man falls
for a woman, he can't see anything else...

582
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,919
I don't think you should be one to talk.

583
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,749
From what I heard,
Seon Nyeo desperately missed her dad.

584
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:14,939
Y- you can't tell his daughter
that he came to me first, okay?

585
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,299
He was in such a hurry that
he came to see me and went back to China.

586
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,439
Aunt, I came to be a good grandson
to grandfather.

587
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,879
I brought Mi Ho so that grandfather
would help me make...

588
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,450
...progress on the life plan
we came up with.

589
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,060
Life plan?

590
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,740
We have one.

591
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,790
Ah, grandfather needs to be able
to help me a lot...

592
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,040
Really?

593
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:50,290
When I see that Dae Woong went to the zoo
because you said you wanted to,

594
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,390
I can see that you're very special to him.

595
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,800
Why?

596
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,890
Dae Woong was enjoying himself
at the zoo, too.

597
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,080
Dae Woong's mom and dad
were on their way back from there...

598
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,439
...when they got into their accident.

599
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,149
Then does Dae Woong dislike the zoo?

600
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,710
Of course.

601
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,010
Whenever they went on picnics at school...

602
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,879
...if he heard they'd be going near the zoo,
he always said he didn't want to go.

603
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,560
Of course it'd bother him.

604
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,860
But I guess its okay when he goes with you.

605
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:35,700
Dae Woong said that he couldn't really
remember his mom and dad well.

606
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,340
Since it happened when he was young...

607
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,730
he wouldn't be able to remember much.

608
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,819
Where should I put this, Aunt?

609
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,199
Put it right there.

610
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,390
We have to make sure they're arranged well.

611
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,760
I was only hoping you'd remember me.

612
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,900
I didn't think about whether
the memories might be painful for you.

613
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,560
Meat.

614
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,769
Now there's exactly half the time left.

615
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,280
Yeah, there are 50 days left.

616
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,570
You might even become a person
while we're in China.

617
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,539
No, no. It's a notable time in history
that a gumiho is becoming a human.

618
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,040
So of course you need to become a person
on Korean ground.

619
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,310
Wherever we are, it doesn't matter
as long as I'm next to you.

620
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,710
Woong-ah, during the 50 days we have left,
let's make as many good memories as we can.

621
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,060
Since you're only my gumiho girlfriend
until here.

622
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,880
Even though I'm really sorry about you
feeling pain...

623
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,620
...I want to give you a lot to
remember me by.

624
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,659
Then it won't be unfair for me at all.

625
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,950
Mi Ho.

626
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,420
Is it unfair to you that
you're giving up being a gumiho?

627
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:23,029
You're going to gain an incredible 50 years
by giving up 500.

628
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,710
By Cha Dae Woong's side.

629
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,880
Don't feel like it's unfair.

630
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,090
Yeah, it's not unfair at all.

631
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,589
More than 500 years or 50 years...

632
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:41,610
...if these next 50 days are that
much more beautiful, that's fine with me.

633
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:47,120
Since there's a lot of luggage,
we need to call a van.

634
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,929
Byung Soo, are these forms
all I need to take with me?

635
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:50,879
Yeah.

636
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,299
But when is Mi Ho coming?

637
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,340
She's going separately because
she has people she needs to see first.

638
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,250
We arranged to meet at the airport later.

639
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,879
Goodbye, Grandfather.

640
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,289
All right, go on.

641
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,500
Go and work hard before you come back,
all right?

642
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:07,599
No, don't work too hard.

643
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,140
Given the circumstances,
just do what you can.

644
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,380
Share this with Dae Woong...

645
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,830
...and give this
and this to Director Ban, okay?

646
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,840
Yes.

647
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,660
I'll give these to him on your behalf, too.

648
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:29,390
Aunt, take care.

649
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,360
Ddoong Ja, since you're
Dae Woong's best fried...

650
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,330
...take good care of him, okay?

651
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,830
Bye.

652
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:48,459
There. Since our chicken is fresh
before fried, it's tasty, isn't it?

653
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,899
Yes! It's very delicious.

654
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,779
Isn't it great?

655
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,920
Yes, it's so good.

656
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,970
Bye, Ahjumma.

657
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,460
Oh! The Hater.

658
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,220
Hey, don't go with Dae Woong.

659
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,510
If you're by his side, I feel like
something bad will happen to Dae Woong.

660
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:23,350
Tell him you can't go,
and stay here cleaning the action school.

661
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,050
I'm going to go.

662
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,980
Each day I get to spend with Dae Woong
is precious to me.

663
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,960
If you go, I'm going to tell everyone
that you're a gumiho.

664
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,199
Do whatever you want.

665
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,010
I have proof that I'm a citizen, a passport,
and a driver's license.

666
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:47,649
Even then if you go around telling people
that I'm a gumiho...

667
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,850
...they'll all say you're crazy.

668
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,440
The only one who's crazy is Dae Woong!

669
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,879
How in the world did you bewitch him?

670
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,350
Should I teach you?

671
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,010
Because I liked him.

672
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,030
Because I liked him so, so, so, so, so much,
he liked me back.

673
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,160
If you want to bewitch someone, just say
that you like him so, so, so, so, so much.

674
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,510
Like this.

675
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,269
What kind of sign is that?

676
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,960
I'm teaching you a really great sign
so you should use it too.

677
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:26,870
'Bye, Hater.

678
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,579
What the...?

679
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,210
Oh, Dae Woong.

680
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,080
I said my goodbyes and am all packed.

681
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:41,070
I'll go to where we get on the plane.

682
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,790
Are you with Byung Soo?

683
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,740
Okay.

684
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,420
I guess I won't be able to come back here.

685
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,470
Goodbye to this place, too, then.

686
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,819
I had something I wanted to tell you
if I saw you again, Teacher Dong Ju.

687
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,190
I'm glad.

688
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:20,330
By leaving this way, you're planning on
disappearing while you're there, right?

689
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:37,670
So does that mean that you've decided...

690
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:40,171
to die in Cha Dae Woong's place?

691
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,540
Teacher Dong Ju...

692
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:48,509
Does saying I'll die in Dae Woong's place
seem that pathetic to you?

693
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:51,000
Saying that you're going to...

694
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,890
...die for a worthless human
seems foolish to me.

695
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,950
But I think I'm cool!

696
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:07,169
Since I'm a gumiho
and can't become human after all,

697
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,790
I like that I can give all that I can
to the person I love.

698
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:18,959
I think you came all the way here
because you wanted to try and stop me,

699
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,470
but just leave me be.

700
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,770
I don't want you to try and stop me,
Teacher Dong Ju.

701
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,680
I...

702
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:33,100
...believed that love was doing what the
other person wanted me to, and once I did...

703
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,850
...I spent a thousand years regretting it.

704
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,720
I don't want to repeat
the same mistake again.

705
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,120
I'm not your Kil Dal, Teacher Dong Ju.

706
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,070
I'll go now.

707
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,020
Bye.

708
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,020
Dae Woong's probably getting ready
to leave right now.

709
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,699
I told you I wouldn't be able
to stop them.

710
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,179
She said that she was going to go
no matter what.

711
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,840
At this point the only thing left to do
is tell Cha Dae Woong.

712
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,090
Tell Dae Woong what?

713
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,410
You know that that person is in possession
of the fox bead, right?

714
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:27,970
I know.

715
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,559
I heard that thanks to the fox bead,
he can't be injured so he's completely safe.

716
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,810
If the fox bead remains in his body,
he'll be safe.

717
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:41,340
But Cha Dae Woong and the fox
made a promise to each other.

718
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,840
He'll keep the fox bead for a hundred days
and then return it to the fox.

719
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:52,440
That's the way a gumiho can become human.

720
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,599
She's going to become human?

721
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,400
But there's something that guy doesn't know.

722
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:03,560
If the fox bead that comes into possession
of a human is taken out of his body,

723
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:06,290
that person will die.

724
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,480
What do you mean by that?

725
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,990
Just like he promised the gumiho,
if he returns the bead after a hundred days,

726
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,250
it means Cha Dae Woong will die.

727
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:32,070
Dae Woong is going to die?

728
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,820
Those two haven't left yet.

729
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:41,150
Go stop Cha Dae Woong
so they won't leave together.

730
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,149
Is it heavy?

731
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,790
I feel like I'm going to die.

732
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,110
Let's go!

733
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,110
Let's go.

734
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,619
Driver, to Incheon Airport please.

735
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,000
All right.

736
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,119
I can't let you leave.

737
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,110
Dae Woong's going to come now.

738
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,169
I'm going to go with him.

739
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,260
You're waiting for Cha Dae Woong?

740
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,930
He won't come.

741
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:04,279
I told you to stop interfering
in our business.

742
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,979
I told you that you were being used
and tricked, didn't I?

743
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,709
I was right.

744
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:11,199
You need to leave that girl's side
and run away immediately!

745
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,359
What are you talking about?

746
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,309
I have to go and board the plane.

747
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,840
You can't go!

748
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:20,220
You can't be with her.

749
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,220
- Noona!
- You!

750
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,670
If you stay with her... you'll die.

751
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:32,510
What?

752
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,770
Since he found out that he's going to die...

753
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,159
...Cha Dae Woong will not appear
by your side again.

754
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,649
He'll probably run away from you
to somewhere far away.

755
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:44,840
Why did you do it, Teacher Dong Ju?

756
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,650
Why did you tell Dae Woong?

757
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:53,530
I was trying to prevent him
from finding out.

758
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:59,219
I didn't want to force him to choose...

759
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:03,280
...between life and death because of me.

760
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,079
But why did you do it?

761
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,809
Why?!

762
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,290
You can eventually catch a person
who runs away...

763
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:17,640
...but not someone's consciousness
if she throws it away.

764
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:23,190
You're in your love fantasy so deep...

765
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:26,800
...that you're about to make
a stupid choice.

766
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,640
I'm trying to break that fantasy.

767
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,959
Humans never risk their lives
for something like love.

768
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,219
That's enough.

769
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,770
You know that too,
that's why you can't ask Cha Dae Woong...

770
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,760
...if he's willing to die for you.

771
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:49,740
If he tells you the truth that
he wants you to die instead of him...

772
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:53,770
...that grand love will crack.

773
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,140
Cha Dae Woong won't come to you.

774
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,110
Even if he coolly comes now...

775
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:05,449
once he's actually facing death,

776
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:09,100
he'll double back and run away.

777
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:15,189
Lose this fantasy of love
and protect yourself.

778
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,099
Teacher Dong Ju, you're really cruel.

779
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,060
All I've done is shown you reality
instead of fantasy.

780
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:27,439
Through this situation
in which one of you must die.

781
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,930
Are you telling me that because
my love is all a lie and a fantasy...

782
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,059
...you want me to break it off
and run away to live?

783
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,120
Cha Dae Woong won't come.

784
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:44,750
If you realize this and accept it,
you'll be able to keep on living.

785
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:55,390
If Mi Ho takes the bead I'll die,

786
00:55:56,330 --> 00:56:01,270
and if she doesn't, she'll die?

787
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,130
Dae Woong...

788
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,530
the fact that Park Dong Ju had me
tell you this,

789
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:09,331
didn't seem like it was because
he wanted to help you.

790
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:16,280
It's probably because he's telling me to
leave Mi Ho and run away if I want to live.

791
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,550
Dae Woong, where are you going?

792
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,470
To Mi Ho.

793
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:26,739
Are you crazy?!

794
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,540
Why are you going there?

795
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,370
He said you're going to die!

796
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,210
Are you saying you'll die
because of a worthless monster like her?!

797
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,770
I won't die!

798
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,000
I promise you I won't.

799
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,630
Cha Dae Woong isn't coming.

800
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,650
Just leave everything to me.

801
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:53,130
Go to Japan with me.

802
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:59,480
After that, getting the bead back
from Cha Dae Woong,

803
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,890
I will investigate how to do it.

804
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:06,000
Okay.

805
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:11,260
I'll do what you say, Teacher Dong Ju.

806
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,320
All right.

807
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,830
Since there are still 50 days left...

808
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,650
try and change the decision you made.

809
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,739
We can leave for Japan immediately.

810
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,530
There should be tickets available.

811
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,880
Excuse me.

812
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,100
Where is the ticketing office?

813
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,160
It's okay with me if Dae Woong doesn't come.

814
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,420
No. He shouldn't come.

815
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:24,760
Because my heart isn't a broken fantasy
but something real.

816
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,390
Mi Ho!

817
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,150
Dae Woong!

818
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,530
Are you just going to run away?!

819
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,730
Even though I'm here?!

820
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,310
So when a hundred days are up,

821
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:37,440
one of us has to die?

822
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,810
Since something so ridiculous is our fate,

823
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:49,380
we're supposed to calmly accept it
or run away from each other?

824
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:52,650
I can't do that.

825
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,970
I won't!

826
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:07,980
I won't wait for the day
that one of us has to die.

827
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,399
I don't want to either.

828
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,330
Today marks exactly half of
the hundred days that have passed.

829
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,360
Mi Ho.

830
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,940
Take the bead from me right now.

831
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,440
You want me to take the bead from you
right now?

832
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,609
Then what?

833
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:33,770
I don't know what's going to happen.

834
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:39,630
But that punk probably doesn't know either.

835
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:49,980
So we should make the decision
and go with it.

836
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:55,990
I'll lay my life on the line,
and you'll give up on becoming a human.

837
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:58,700
And we're going to go with it.

838
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:04,310
We don't know if we'll live or die.

839
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:06,890
Then...

840
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,100
the two of us are grabbing the one rope.

841
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:19,080
Mi Ho... I love you.

842
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,740
So I won't die in order to save you.

843
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:27,990
You shouldn't do it either.

844
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,400
Dae Woong... I love you.

845
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:35,880
I won't die on your behalf either.

846
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,650
So neither should you.

847
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:45,040
This is the decision I can make
as the person that loves you.

848
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:51,990
Even though I'm not sure of the outcome,
we're in it together.

849
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,790
If we live, we'll both live.

850
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:01,590
And if we die, we'll both die.
