Episode 11

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,570
Mi Ho.

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,810
Drink some soda and then practice.

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,560
What the hell are you doing?

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,139
<i>Someone fell down!</i>

8
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,430
<i>How did it happen?</i>

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,940
What's going on?

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,479
What happened?

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,920
Over there! Over there!

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,339
Get out of the way! Mi Ho!

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,400
Miss Mi Ho, are you okay?

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,380
Noona, are you crazy?

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,559
Was it was her?

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,549
Quickly call an ambulance!

17
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,950
Yes!

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,809
Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,649
<i>Hurry!</i>

20
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,730
Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,769
Mi Ho, are you okay?

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,149
<i>Mi Ho, wake up!</i>

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:23,899
Are you okay?

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,999
Mi Ho, wake up!

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,279
<i>Mi Ho!</i>

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,819
Mi Ho, wake up!

27
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,130
Mi Ho!

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,600
What happened to the ambulance?!

29
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,150
- Ambulance...
- Byung Soo.

30
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,400
There's no need to call
the ambulance.

31
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,559
I can just take care of her.

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,729
How can you do it?

33
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,359
She became unconscious and fell
from such a high place.

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,259
It was definitely a hard fall.

35
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,169
What do you mean she doesn't
have to go to the hospital?

36
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,839
Mi Ho isn't injured because she fell down.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,099
I know her condition very well;
she doesn't need to go to the hospital.

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,639
Even so, she should still get looked at.

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,190
Director!

40
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,130
<i>What's going on?</i>

41
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,250
What's happening?

42
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,420
Mi Ho...

43
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,879
Who are you?

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,939
Your actions just now were very foolish.

45
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,500
Your chi caused the bead's chi
to become unclear so...

46
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,210
She'll want to kill you.

47
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,499
What?

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,130
If you want to live, then run away.

49
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,370
Mi Ho!

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,570
What kind of person is he?

51
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,780
You...

52
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,970
What are you doing?

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,050
Die.

54
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,019
Mi Ho, you can't do this!

55
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,520
Don't be like this.

56
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,050
Get out of the way.

57
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,620
Die.

58
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,390
You can't, Mi Ho.

59
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm sorry, Mi Ho.

60
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,970
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,849
Since using human methods
won't work with you,

62
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,920
I'll warn you in a way you can understand.

63
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,559
If you dare to act this foolishly again,

64
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,630
when that time comes, I'll kill you.

65
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,729
This incident caused by your greed
and jealousy,

66
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,210
shattered all of her expectations
and hope.

67
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,480
You're extremely lucky.

68
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,420
Miss Eun Hae In.

69
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,870
See you again next time.

70
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,020
Is the bead okay?
You should check it carefully.

71
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,670
It's not broken.

72
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,299
It just got a bit damaged.

73
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,370
It didn't crack, did it?

74
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,800
We can't see it
and have no way to confirm it.

75
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,130
You're hurt, too.

76
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,879
Because of me, you got hurt.

77
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,920
It's not because of you.

78
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,660
It's because of me.

79
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,750
Woong.

80
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,880
Today, I almost killed her.

81
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,400
I might've even done something to you.

82
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,930
Just like she said.

83
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,080
I'm an hateful and scary monster.

84
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,800
No, Mi Ho, you're not a monster.

85
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,969
You're not scary at all.

86
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,550
Didn't I say that I don't hate
being together with you?

87
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,170
And also, you can't like me.

88
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,640
Dae Woong.

89
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,619
That woman ran away
because she's afraid of me,

90
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,569
And you ran away because
you're afraid of my feelings for you,

91
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,430
Isn't that the same thing?

92
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,000
I kept forgetting about my temperament.

93
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,760
And I followed you around.

94
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,410
Woong, you must have been really scared.

95
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,280
I... think that I'm even scarier.

96
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,610
Always forgetting,
always letting you come to my side.

97
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,220
I think that I'm scarier.

98
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,910
Dae Woong,

99
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,680
She was angry because...

100
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:01,881
she found out that the ring
used to belong to her.

101
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,460
So it's not because of you.

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,600
All this happened because of me.

103
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,810
Ring.

104
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,650
Woong.

105
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,710
I'm sorry for sticking to you.

106
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:26,040
But, I can't possibly leave you immediately.

107
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,289
I'm sorry about that as well.

108
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,360
Why are you saying sorry?

109
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,660
Letting other people see you like that,
there's nothing wrong about it.

110
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,179
Humans are like that too.

111
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,389
If you think your boyfriend
is having an affair,

112
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,549
you start to turn monster-like.

113
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,920
It's considered normal to cause trouble
and become angry.

114
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,660
You only did something
that a girlfriend should do.

115
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,440
You wait here.

116
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,150
I'll go... and find your ring.

117
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,430
Where did I drop it?

118
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,340
Dae Woong! Is Mi Ho okay?

119
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,260
What's the matter with you?

120
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,680
Something unexpected happened.

121
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,999
Ah, Byung Soo.

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,369
I lost a ring that looks exactly like this.

123
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,349
Help me find it.

124
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,289
You need to attend to your injury first.

125
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,780
That's not important right now.

126
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,729
Right now her heart's been hurt a lot,

127
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,630
so I have to heal that first.

128
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,960
In order to do that,
I have to find the ring fast.

129
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,469
I let Dae Woong see the monster side of me.

130
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,480
For Cha Dae Woong,
who knows your identity,

131
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:24,090
no matter how much you act like a human,
or even if you turn into a human,

132
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,780
he'll see you as a gumiho to the end.

133
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,940
Even if I'm a gumiho,

134
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,520
even if I'm different,

135
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,309
I still hoped that he'd like me.

136
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,790
<i>If I really, really liked him</i>

137
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,880
I hoped that he'd like me, too.

138
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,960
Figures, it won't happen for me.

139
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,459
If you don't have expectations,
you won't get hurt.

140
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,060
Give up on expectations
that can never happen.

141
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,390
After I've waited 100 days,

142
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,300
do I really have to leave Dae Woong?

143
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,300
I've never thought about that before.

144
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,969
You have to.

145
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,159
Starting from now, without Cha Dae Woong,

146
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,300
you have to start preparing
for your life as a human.

147
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,130
<i>Dae Woong.</i>

148
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,829
This place needs to be tidied up.
They're making us leave.

149
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,430
Let's look for it next time.

150
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,939
From now on, your abilities
will start to disappear little by little.

151
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,930
I've already felt it.

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,630
I can't smell or hear as far as before.

153
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,120
That truly seems to be the case.

154
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,530
You're about to go through
your second death.

155
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,920
But the bead has been damaged so
I'm worried.

156
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,560
I can endure it.

157
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,660
Go rest.

158
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,030
I'm leaving.

159
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,299
Hello Mr. Cha Dae Woong.

160
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,240
We've met before, right?

161
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,170
I'm Park Dong Ju.

162
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,879
The doctor who took care
of our Ddoong Ja last time,

163
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,870
turned out to be
Teacher Park Dong Ju.

164
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,310
I heard from Mi Ho
that you treat her very well.

165
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,060
I have to go home with Mi Ho.

166
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,270
I'll take my leave.

167
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,690
<i>Last time, I knew you were Cha Dae Woong.</i>

168
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,840
I apologize for acting like I didn't know.

169
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,029
You recognized me?

170
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,589
I saw you before when I took Mi Ho home.

171
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,279
I also heard a lot about you from Mi Ho.

172
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,330
I hear you're her boyfriend.

173
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,900
Yes, I'm her boyfriend.

174
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,170
You're very clear about that.

175
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,240
Yes, I've heard it all.

176
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,060
I heard that you guys
have a love contract of 100 days.

177
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,120
Ah, should I have pretended that I
didn't know about that?

178
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,850
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,740
I'll take my leave.

180
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,120
What the... Love contract?

181
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,259
<i>This time a really good item came out.</i>

182
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,080
Yes, the interest rate is
extremely high, too.

183
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,600
Everyone else is working diligently to live.

184
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,640
But ever since I came to the human world,

185
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:25,441
other than liking Dae Woong,
I haven't done anything.

186
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,050
Starting from now, I should practice
living without Dae Woong.

187
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,980
Love contract.

188
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,960
I really did say that before.

189
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,609
Hey, didn't I tell you to wait for me?

190
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,039
Why did you leave first by yourself?

191
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,079
The bus came so I just went on.

192
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,060
I went to the ahjumma's fried chicken shop
on the way.

193
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,140
Did you find the ring?

194
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,280
I couldn't find it.

195
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,519
I'll go tomorrow and find it no matter what!

196
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,250
Forget it, it's okay if you don't find it.

197
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,940
What?

198
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,090
It's okay if you don't wear
your ring, either.

199
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,200
Our contract involves the bead,
not the ring.

200
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,400
<i>In the future, don't let it get damaged.</i>

201
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,369
Protect my bead well.

202
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,600
<i>I'll protect the bead well and</i>

203
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,890
I'll find the ring.

204
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,179
And I will still wear this.

205
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,790
Ok.

206
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,930
What's that?

207
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,989
The fried chicken shop's ahjumma
said that...

208
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,689
each pair of eyes is worth 100 won,
so I brought them home to stick it on.

209
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,190
I really want to live a human life
so I have to earn money.

210
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,809
What?

211
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,489
From now on, I'm going to study hard
and become smart.

212
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,500
And I'm going to work a lot
and earn a lot of money.

213
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,249
When I came into this world,
I didn't have any plans.

214
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,829
I only followed you, and liked you.

215
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,150
<i>I only believed you, and only lived
to look good to you.</i>

216
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,380
From now on...

217
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,940
I have to prepare ways to
learn how to live without you.

218
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,519
Mi Ho, don't strain yourself.

219
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,500
It's not like you can go to a real school.

220
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,450
Nor can you find a proper job.

221
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,560
I've thought of a good method. Don't worry.

222
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,829
Mi Ho, do you want to eat meat?

223
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,279
In order to restore the bead,

224
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,179
I'll buy you really delicious
Grade A beef.

225
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,170
And then to drink a bowl
of strong beef bone soup.

226
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,280
No, it's ok. I bought food
for myself already.

227
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,289
What's that? It's not meat!

228
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,009
I haven't earned enough money
to buy meat yet.

229
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,090
I can eat eggs instead of meat.

230
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,469
I'll buy meat for you.

231
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,130
Until when?

232
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,999
Until all those days have passed

233
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,279
You want me to eat the meat
you bought and then leave?

234
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,779
I don't want that anymore.

235
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,860
I'll figure it out myself so,
you don't have to buy meat for me.

236
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,820
When the bead was damaged,
did it affect my reliability as well?

237
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,379
Why'd you call me here?

238
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,249
After being threatened,
you're very obedient.

239
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,380
You'll come when I tell you to come
and leave when I tell you to leave.

240
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,190
You'll shut up when I tell you to shut up.

241
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,959
From now on,
I'll never go near her again.

242
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,909
I'll quit the movie too!

243
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,050
I won't tell anyone about you or her so...

244
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,010
Just... let me go.

245
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,030
I can't just let you go like this.

246
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,910
I have something I need you to do.

247
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,870
In order for her heart to drift
from Cha Dae Woong,

248
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,669
I need you to cut in
and cause trouble between them.

249
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,299
You're telling me to separate them?

250
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,710
This isn't disadvantageous for you either.

251
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,940
Since you still like Cha Dae Woong.

252
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,559
Why... should I do that?

253
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,930
Oh, I forgot to threaten you about
not asking questions.

254
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,130
You're not thinking of doing anything
to Cha Dae Woong right?

255
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,129
I have no interest in Cha Dae Woong.

256
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,209
So the reason why I called you today,

257
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,919
is to tell you, don't avoid me
because you're afraid of me.

258
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Just do what you normally do.

259
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,090
But you can't continue today's behaviour.

260
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,220
What exactly are you?

261
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,759
Are you the same thing as her?

262
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,260
I told you to not ask questions but,

263
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,850
I'll tell you this.
I'm at least half human.

264
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,220
Just like you.

265
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,840
Mi Ho, I have something to say.

266
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:03,380
I wasn't going to say this; I don't want to
make excuses and sound stupid as a man,

267
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,420
but to resolve the misunderstanding
today, I'm going to tell you everything.

268
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,970
I...

269
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,309
was the victim of noona's plot.

270
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,730
I wasn't the one trying
to share the chi first!

271
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,369
No, I didn't accept it at all.

272
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,970
I know.

273
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,319
You knew that the bead
would be damaged and...

274
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,039
I believe you wouldn't do
something like that on purpose.

275
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,699
Then what's the problem?

276
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,859
I didn't cheat on you on purpose,

277
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,290
And I said that I'd keep on
buying meat for you...

278
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,069
So why are you making me feel so uneasy?

279
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,970
Even though you don't like another woman,

280
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,550
you can't like me either.

281
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,200
Even though you can give me meat,

282
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,000
you can't give me your heart.

283
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,949
After you saw me like that, earlier today,
I knew for sure.

284
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,930
I'm a gumiho.

285
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,040
And it's wrong of me to ask you like me.

286
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,609
<i>From now on, I won't ever make you worry,</i>

287
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,210
or lie, or make things
difficult for you anymore.

288
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,120
So after 100 have passed, I'll leave.

289
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,850
Fine! If you want to leave then leave.

290
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,870
Ok.

291
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,910
Since this is so petty, I wasn't going to
bring this up either, but...

292
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,969
Is that why you told
Teacher Dong Ju?

293
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:57,090
That we'd agreed to a 100-days-relationship?
Seems you told Teacher Dong Ju everything.

294
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:03,189
Then after 100 days, will you
go to Teacher Dong Ju?

295
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,100
I told you not to ask
about Teacher Dong Ju.

296
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,029
I get it. I get it!

297
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,990
<i>You definitely have to
keep your promise!</i>

298
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,099
You can't even stay for 101 days.

299
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,490
When exactly 100 days have passed,
just leave.

300
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,130
As expected...

301
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:32,250
He won't say that he'll like me.

302
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,310
<i>Blue and white porcelain.</i>

303
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,739
<i>Where am I going to find a prop like that?</i>

304
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,680
<i>Shopping...</i>

305
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,750
Why's it so expensive?!

306
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,119
Byung Soo,
just let me enter the filming site.

307
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,660
Aren't you friendly with
the security guards?

308
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,019
I have to find the ring no matter what!

309
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,040
All right, wait a sec,
I have to find something.

310
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,159
This blue and white porcelain?
I'll give you my grandpa's.

311
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,899
Let me go find the ring.

312
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,219
Really?

313
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,019
Ok! I'll call them right now.

314
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,030
Phone... Oh yeah.

315
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,370
<i>After you had an affair,
I thought about my life.</i>

316
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:32,550
I was an idiot for always believing
in you and only looking at you.

317
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,599
- How is that an idiot?
- I'm going to go back to school.

318
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,360
And I'm going to earn money.

319
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,799
She's exactly like someone...

320
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,750
Okay, if you're going to find your own life,
then go!

321
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,940
He shouldn't be like that.

322
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,919
I'll send you the divorce papers.

323
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,200
Ah, they can't be like that!

324
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,950
If it continues like that,
then won't they...

325
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,650
Dong Won, let's go.

326
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,020
Dong Ju?

327
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,470
I knew it would end up like that!

328
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,160
Where the heck did it go?

329
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,990
Where'd it roll?

330
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,510
Now that the bead has been damaged,

331
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,050
the second death will be extremely painful.

332
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,450
What's going on?

333
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,950
Is it because of the bead?

334
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,670
Is Mi Ho okay?

335
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,569
Byung Soo, I'm leaving first.

336
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,189
What? What about the ring?

337
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,469
I'll come back tomorrow and look for it.

338
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,800
I'm leaving.

339
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,419
Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

340
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,500
Mi Ho! Open the door!

341
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,140
<i>Mi Ho, open the door.</i>

342
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,870
<i>Open the door.</i>

343
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,830
I didn't bring the key with me.

344
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,500
Mi Ho, Mi Ho!

345
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,230
Mi Ho!

346
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,750
Mi Ho!

347
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,219
Mi Ho, are you okay?

348
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,100
Wake up, Mi Ho. Mi Ho.

349
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,090
Because it's so late there's nowhere
to buy medicine, so I came here.

350
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,510
She's in so much pain,
at least a painkiller...

351
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,770
Wait a moment.

352
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,509
I don't know if it'll be of any help.

353
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,880
Is she in severe pain?

354
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,750
Yes.

355
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,170
Ddoong Ja is in severe pain.

356
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,930
Thanks.

357
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,130
Continue... to stay by her side.

358
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,029
Don't leave her.

359
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,230
Always stay at her side.

360
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,830
That will be more effective
than that medicine.

361
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,170
Mi Ho, go "ahhh".

362
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,450
Mi Ho.

363
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,130
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,140
Woong.

365
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,800
<i>I'm okay now.</i>

366
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,720
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

367
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,240
<i>Did you worry a lot, Teacher Park Dong Ju?</i>

368
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,390
Teacher Dong Ju?

369
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,409
I think the medicine that
Teacher Dong Ju gave me was helpful.

370
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,409
I didn't feel pain for the entire night.

371
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,780
Is that because of Teacher Dong Ju?

372
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,000
- It's because of me.
- When I'm pain next time,

373
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,740
I think it'll be best
if I stayed at Teacher Dong Ju's.

374
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,300
Dae Woong? Dae Woong's sleeping right now.

375
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,879
I have to go.

376
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,189
After I'm finished everything,
I'll go to the hospital.

377
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,700
Wait for me.

378
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,769
Did you sleep well?

379
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,439
I didn't sleep well.

380
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,209
In order to nurse you yesterday,
I didn't sleep at all!

381
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,210
Really? Then go sleep some more.

382
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,310
Hey, this will make me sound petty, so
I'm wondering whether I should say it but,

383
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,480
the person who ran over there
to get medicine for you was me!

384
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,960
Also, the person who
grasped your hand tightly

385
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:14,761
while you were in pain
was also me.

386
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,439
The person who worked hard was me.

387
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,750
The person who reaps the rewards
is Teacher Dong Ju?

388
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,180
Thank you.

389
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,930
I know that you thought about me
and worried for me.

390
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,330
Really, thank you so much.

391
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,209
But, are you really okay?

392
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,160
I'm okay.

393
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,780
I'm so much better, I lifted you with
one hand and took you to the second floor.

394
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,380
If you're tired,
then sleep some more. I'm leaving.

395
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,330
Where are you going?

396
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,810
The movie that I didn't finish filming
yesterday, I have to go do it.

397
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,169
Will you be okay?

398
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,699
Don't worry.

399
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,889
That woman has been scared
half to death yesterday.

400
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,090
She won't be bothering me anymore.

401
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,530
- Wait a minute, I'll go with you.
- No!

402
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,310
I'll just go by myself.

403
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,280
Hey!

404
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,340
<i>Woong.</i>

405
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,170
<i>Because I like you too much,</i>

406
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:32,471
<i>I can't stop liking you now.</i>

407
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,790
<i>And I can't pretend
to not like you now, either.</i>

408
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,670
<i>I can only not let you see that I like you.</i>

409
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,090
<i>I can only stop begging you to like me.</i>

410
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,260
<i>If I want to slowly leave your side,</i>

411
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,020
<i>I still need to run.</i>

412
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,700
Like the super glue coming unstuck,
she seems to be distancing herself from me.

413
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,029
Coming to a movie studio,
it feels like that I've become an actor.

414
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,750
I'm very excited.

415
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,070
The movie with Min Sook as the leading role
has already started filming in my heart.

416
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,339
Look into my eyes.

417
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,360
Is the film rolling?

418
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,480
I can see it, our movie.

419
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,389
What about this?

420
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,250
This goes behind the room.

421
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,660
Today I want to film an important scene
where Miss Min Sook will be introduced.

422
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,050
It's the highlight
of our movie, right?

423
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,550
I'm so nervous.

424
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,570
Dad!

425
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:24,170
Today I planned to introduce you to
a very important person.

426
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:28,030
If we're to talk about her...

427
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,949
- Min Sook. Min Sook.
- What am I going to do?

428
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,420
Min Sook!

429
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,090
Why are you just leaving like this?

430
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,239
Then what do you want me to?

431
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,119
I was disgraced in front of
your daughter and the crew.

432
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,580
How can I say who I am?!

433
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,320
Why can't you say it?

434
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,930
"I'm Director Ban's woman,"
why can't you say that?!

435
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,990
That you're the main actor of the movie

436
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,660
In Director Ban's heart,
why can't you say it?

437
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,519
You don't think it was embarrassing?

438
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,160
No, definitely not embarrassing.

439
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,779
Doesn't it smell?

440
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,050
What?

441
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,500
No, it definitely doesn't.

442
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,460
The first time I saw Min Sook,
you gave off a light fragrance.

443
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,690
Director.

444
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:05,210
Now, I have to start preparing for ways
to live without you.

445
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,159
Should I start preparing for life
without her, too?

446
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,580
After 100 days have passed, I'll leave.

447
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,100
How many days are left?

448
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,260
What the...
This many days have already passed?

449
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,820
How come there's so many with Xs on them?

450
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,980
There's definitely been a mistake.

451
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,770
Yes, this is about right.

452
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:53,560
But, will she still leave in the end?

453
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:07,869
That place is really beautiful;
we should go there together sometime.

454
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,720
That's a foreign country so,

455
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,340
Mi Ho and I won't be able
to go together, right?

456
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:23,000
But there might be someplace
similar to that in Seoul.

457
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,499
<i>Cut!</i>

458
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,790
Very good! It's perfect!

459
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,099
It's a bit too bad though.

460
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:48,889
It would've been better
if we'd got a solo shot of the face.

461
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,490
Right?

462
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,499
This scene has concluded.

463
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,290
Prepare for the next one.
We'll try to get it in one shot.

464
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,219
I'm a bit tired.

465
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,190
You worked hard, you worked hard.

466
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,740
Hae In Noona! Come in.

467
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,559
You were really good.

468
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,060
Thanks.

469
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,520
What's wrong with you?

470
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,100
You're scarier when you smile.

471
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,870
Actually, I don't want to
smile at you at all.

472
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,230
But, because I'm scared of dying,
I tried to smile a bit.

473
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah, if you don't want to die,
from now on,

474
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,379
don't be like yesterday.

475
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,160
Until when?

476
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,930
Tell me a specific time until when.

477
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,830
When are you going to leave Dae Woong?

478
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,840
In less than three months.

479
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,740
There aren't many days left.

480
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,969
If it's only that much...

481
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,670
Even if I leave, Dae Woong
won't go to you anyway.

482
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,520
Woong knows that you're really mean.

483
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,029
But still... I'm a human.

484
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,660
I'm better than you.

485
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,060
Ok. Because I'm not human, I know
all sorts of things.

486
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,500
Ommabarani. Hoy, hoy. Hoy.

487
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,759
What are you doing?

488
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,350
Starting from now,
you'll become uglier and uglier.

489
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,340
Your face will be as
swollen as a steamed bun.

490
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,779
Your nose hairs will be this long.

491
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,709
Your nostrils will be this big.

492
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,759
Your lips will become thick as well.

493
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,690
Ommabarani. Hoy, hoy. Hoy!

494
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
I used an incantation on you.

495
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,159
You can't do stuff like that!
Are you kidding me?!

496
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,710
Wait and see.

497
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,320
Be careful.

498
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,459
Manager!

499
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,510
Give me a mirror.

500
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,220
I wish I really knew how to
do stuff like that. Hoy, hoy.

501
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,979
<i>Mi Ho.</i>

502
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,570
<i>Fill this out please.</i>

503
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,649
Mi Ho, don't do this as a part time job.

504
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,690
The director is letting you join the union
and you'll have to fill this out.

505
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,249
Do I have to fill everything out?

506
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,889
Of course, they're all very easy.

507
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,790
Fill it out and give it to me
by tomorrow please.

508
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,190
If it were Park Sun Ju,
she could fill all this out.

509
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,570
Tomorrow will be Park Sun Ju's birthday.

510
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,130
Birthday?

511
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,360
The day the human is born?

512
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:03,460
You get to get that too.
I'll celebrate it.

513
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,300
They're very alike, very alike.

514
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,610
As soon as Mi Ho comes back,
I'll go there with her.

515
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,880
She said that she's going to stop by
Teacher Dong Ju's place.

516
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,370
Then is she going to be late?

517
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,750
Is that Mi Ho?

518
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,259
Mi Ho, you're back?!

519
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,879
What?
Are you disappointed that it's not Mi Ho?

520
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,239
Grandpa, it's you.

521
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,230
"Woong oppa".

522
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,109
Grandpa, what did you come here for?

523
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:50,639
I came to take you and Mi Ho
out for a delicious meal.

524
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,790
But, why is that door broken?

525
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,309
Something happened.

526
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,000
Where did Mi Ho go?
Why are you here by yourself?

527
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,289
Grandpa, call Mi Ho.

528
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,480
Call her and tell her to
come back quickly.

529
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,809
Grandpa?

530
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,469
Yes, Mi Ho.

531
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,799
Come back quickly.

532
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,010
Let's go out and eat together.

533
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,929
I'm about to go eat dinner with a friend.

534
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,270
She can't! Hurry home!

535
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,569
I came especially for you,
let's go eat together.

536
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,699
If I come back now, it'll take a while.

537
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,920
Can't we eat next time?

538
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,050
Tell her that you're not feeling well.

539
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:40,680
Mi Ho, my body isn't that great anymore
and coming out once is hard.

540
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,409
Then I'll come back. Wait for me please.

541
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:47,310
Okay, come back quickly.

542
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,850
Grandpa's the best!

543
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,030
Now you come back?!

544
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,789
Where's grandpa?

545
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:06,519
Grandpa waited for you, but he was
really, really, really hungry and left.

546
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,520
Really? That's why I said that I'd be late.

547
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,259
Before grandpa left he told me
to buy you something delicious.

548
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,540
Let's go out.

549
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,470
I found a pretty nice place.

550
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,760
What's wrong with this?

551
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,000
It's been erased.

552
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,559
It should be up to here.

553
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,989
What? I think it's right.

554
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,110
No, it's been erased.

555
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,690
It doesn't go up to there.

556
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,649
Stop it!

557
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,159
It ended here!

558
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,300
It's supposed to be up to here.

559
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:49,470
And... today's passed too, so...

560
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:00,870
Mi Ho, you're treating this so coldly.

561
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:04,790
Woong, I'm hungry, too.

562
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,059
Let's not go out,
I'll just eat something here.

563
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,649
What?
No! We have to go out!

564
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,840
I said I found someplace nice!

565
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:15,419
Once you go there you'll really like it too!

566
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,689
Forget it. I have to finish sticking
the eyes on the dolls and

567
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,879
I have to drop them off tomorrow.

568
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,770
And I have books to study.

569
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,050
If it's such a nice place,
then go by yourself and come back.

570
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,049
Mi Ho, what are you watching?

571
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,019
I'm watching the news and studying.

572
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,209
There are even things like this?

573
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,160
You're really busy, Mi Ho.

574
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,139
Mi Ho, have you really quit eating meat?

575
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,440
Yes, for now, I think I have to.

576
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,930
That's harsh, Mi Ho.

577
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:06,620
A difficult to understand Mi Ho.

578
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,420
Mi Ho.

579
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,640
My friend Mi Ho
is a ruthless gumiho.

580
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:26,690
Really. Really! Mi Ho
is a very fierce gumiho.

581
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,170
Mi Ho, look at this.

582
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:49,379
We said we'll go visit this
beautiful place together,

583
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,499
Right?

584
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,789
Yeah.

585
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,660
But didn't you say that
it's in a foreign country so I can't go?

586
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,880
I found a place
that's exactly the same as this.

587
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,490
Really?

588
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:03,130
Where is it?

589
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,019
It's a church next to our school.

590
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,889
It's exactly the same.

591
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,029
It even has the pointed roof
and a clock tower.

592
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,730
At first glance, it even looks more
beautiful than this place.

593
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,940
I'll take you there tomorrow.

594
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:18,240
It'll be so much fun if we go there.

595
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,129
Let's go there, take the same picture
and hang it under here!

596
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,769
Wouldn't that be great?!

597
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:24,960
Yes!

598
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,740
No...

599
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,900
I don't want to go.

600
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,820
Why?!

601
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,250
I have an appointment.

602
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:41,129
The appointment is that important?

603
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,340
Yes.

604
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,990
Postpone the appointment!
Can't you come with me?

605
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:52,990
In order find a similar place,
I spent the whole day searching tirelessly.

606
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,269
Think of how hard I worked.

607
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,179
Can't you just go there together with me?

608
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,960
After 100 days I have to leave but

609
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:04,490
if I go to those places with you,
it'll be more difficult for me later.

610
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:08,009
I said I'm practicing
drifting away from you.

611
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,330
The practice that you speak of

612
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,269
is just you rejecting
everything I give you...

613
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,490
You don't even look at me
when I'm talking.

614
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,870
And you won't go anywhere I suggest.
Is that how it's going to be?

615
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,910
- Yes.
- Then you don't need any of this.

616
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,160
Leaving takes only a moment.

617
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,090
You don't need any practice.

618
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,419
Those damn 100 days.

619
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,909
After they're passed, you'll stay here and
I'll return to my house.

620
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,540
If we don't see each other,

621
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,940
we'll just separate completely!

622
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,260
Practicing is...

623
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,570
really painful.

624
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,030
It's more painful than my tails falling off.

625
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,830
I forgot about the ring.

626
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,410
I want to go...

627
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,980
I really want to go.

628
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,930
Hey, did you sleep here?

629
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,090
Oh, yes.

630
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,810
What about the ring? Did you find it?

631
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,800
I couldn't find it.

632
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,879
Hey, I'm kind of busy so...

633
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,350
can you go get a document from Mi Ho?

634
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:40,479
Document?

635
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,599
Yeah.

636
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,609
An union application. Director said
that he has to receive it by today.

637
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,599
Go get it for me, please, I'm begging you.

638
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,440
Application?

639
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,900
Everything can be filled out like this.

640
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:06,470
If I'm able to fill this out completely,
will I be considered perfectly human?

641
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,000
Today is the day when Park Sun Ju was born.

642
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,210
So will I become Park Sun Ju?

643
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,220
One moment please.

644
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,750
Ah, found it!

645
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:08,879
Let's talk.

646
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,950
I have nothing to say to you, Noona.

647
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,460
She said that
she'll leave within three months.

648
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,400
She said she's leaving pretty soon,

649
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,780
and asked me to endure until then.

650
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,840
This is the truth.

651
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,149
She's spreading the word
throughout the streets.

652
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,819
You know it, too?

653
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:32,069
Then when the time comes,
you'll really be free from her, right?

654
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,690
Yes, she said she'll let go of me.

655
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,549
That's great.

656
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,629
No, I don't want to be released by her.

657
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,629
I'm going to ask her
to continue holding onto me.

658
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,360
And secure me tightly.

659
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,240
You've been bewitched by her.

660
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,100
That's right.

661
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:56,810
I've been bewitched by her.
I've lost my senses.

662
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,669
So the noona whose senses are intact,
don't try to understand.

663
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,570
And don't interfere either.

664
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,830
I'm truly about to become insane.

665
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,339
What's this?

666
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,059
Happy birthday.

667
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,030
Go "hooo" and blow them out.

668
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,579
Congratulations on your birth.

669
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,300
Miss Park Sun Ju.

670
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,330
Ah, she left again.

671
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,800
She left her cell phone at home again.

672
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,269
[Teacher Dong Ju: Please go to Yusun
building, 15th floor's "City in the Sky"]

673
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:03,379
Is he trying to do what
he couldn't yesterday,

674
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,480
at the City in the Sky?

675
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,780
Is this the document
Byung Soo was talking about?

676
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:19,140
She shouldn't have much to write...

677
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,960
Park Sun Ju?

678
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,909
Oh, this outfit I borrowed
from a person called Park Sun Ju.

679
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,920
Who's Park Sun Ju?

680
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,000
Is she Park Dong Ju's relative?

681
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,820
What's this?

682
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:53,740
Why is Mi Ho called Park Sun Ju?

683
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,830
Teacher Dong Ju.

684
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:03,040
I'll only accept the day I was born as
Park Sun Ju as a present.

685
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,199
Everything else, after I've become human,

686
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,349
I'll fill it out.

687
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:11,769
I'm a person who has
limitless time and money.

688
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:17,490
I'm just giving some of the excess,
meaningless things, to you.

689
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,489
So you don't need to feel burdened by them.

690
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,309
It's not because of that.

691
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,280
I just want to do it.

692
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:27,349
If after I've become human... if I weren't
going to do anything, only receive...

693
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,749
I might as well have stayed at
the Three Gods Temple and not come out.

694
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,530
You're determined to leave Cha Dae Woong.

695
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,390
If you're going to live relying on yourself,

696
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,149
you don't think it'll be too hard?

697
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,920
No matter how hard it is,

698
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:42,610
I'll slowly get better and I'll become more
and more like a human.

699
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,840
Even if it's going to take a while,

700
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,399
Wouldn't I be able to return
to Dae Woong's side?

701
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,840
When that time comes,

702
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,200
Cha Dae Woong won't be
in this world anymore.

703
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,210
What?!

704
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,559
Why won't Dae Woong
be in this world anymore?

705
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,030
When that time comes,

706
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,890
he'll be in another world
that you can't go to.

707
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,720
And be with other people.

708
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,750
That's true, he said before
that leaving takes only a moment.

709
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,409
Today's your birthday.

710
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,620
Do you have anywhere you want to go?

711
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,000
Doesn't matter where it is,
I'll take you there.

712
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:40,110
Oh, places that I want to go...

713
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,979
there is one.

714
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,730
Then let's go together.

715
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,660
No, I'm not going there.

716
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:54,910
Teacher Dong Ju,
there's still a lot of food leftover.

717
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,730
And the cake is great too but,

718
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:01,130
let's stop the birthday celebrations.

719
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,580
I want to go.

720
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:05,540
Okay then.

721
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:09,760
You don't need to worry about this;
Go first.

722
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:14,690
Okay, I'm leaving.

723
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,430
Where's Mi Ho?

724
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,330
She left first.

725
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,370
Who's Park Sun Ju?

726
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,010
What are all of these?

727
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,990
Park Sun Ju is...

728
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,649
a name I gave her as a present,
so the gumiho may live as a human.

729
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,050
You also...

730
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:32,300
know what Mi Ho is?

731
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,280
That's right.

732
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,630
I knew from the very beginning.

733
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:42,720
Because half of me,
is not human, like her.

734
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,369
In order for her to survive on her own
after she leaves you,

735
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:03,159
<i>she's taking one step at a time to prepare.</i>

736
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,850
So, when she says she'll leave,

737
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,580
you just need to let her go.

738
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,240
Practicing, preparing everything...

739
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,350
and all I need to do is let her go?

740
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,220
That's right.

741
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,580
Because you're a human,
of course you have to do that.

742
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,970
You'll do it right?

743
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,639
<i>But because you found out too early,</i>

744
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,630
She'll have to leave without
time to practice and prepare.

745
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,970
Going to leave.

746
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:09,220
Park Sun Ju.

747
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:13,940
It's a really common name.

748
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,590
After she becomes Park Sun Ju,

749
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:25,710
does she plan on living with Park Dong Ju
for thousands of years?

750
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,480
If she never comes back here again,

751
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,030
what am I going to do?

752
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:00,880
Instead of losing my temper yesterday,

753
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:04,400
we should've at least gone
to that place together.

754
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,789
I like you.

755
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,580
I'm going to follow you.

756
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:50,590
Oh, now that I've become friends with you,
I'm so happy!

757
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:56,330
Because I like you.

758
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:03,850
Woong! I really, really, really,
really like you!

759
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:10,700
Can't you like me?

760
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,720
Mi Ho.

761
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:17,290
I like you.

762
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,720
I like you.

763
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:27,800
I like you.

764
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:50,280
This place is really beautiful.

765
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,180
It was a good idea to come here.

766
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,360
Mi Ho.

767
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,460
Don't leave.

768
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,640
Don't leave me.

769
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,970
Stick to me.

770
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,550
Even though I'm different from you,
is it okay?

771
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,580
<i>It's not okay.</i>

772
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:21,039
It's outrageous.

773
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,770
And also absurd.

774
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,650
It's not okay to the point that
I think I've gone crazy but...

775
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,450
But I like you.

776
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,990
I don't like you because
it's okay to like you.

777
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,090
It's because I like you,

778
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,600
that everything's okay.

779
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,140
Dae Woong.

780
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:51,640
Because you like me,

781
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:55,130
I can tell you this now.

782
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,230
I am going to turn into a human.

783
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:07,950
Turn into a human?

784
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:12,040
With the bead that you're holding
for 100 days,

785
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,670
I can become human.

786
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:23,260
You,

787
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:28,470
in order to become human, you used me?

788
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:35,150
Because you needed me, you liked me?

789
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,740
It didn't matter who it was,

790
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:42,960
but because I liked you,
that's why I needed you.

791
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,620
I didn't like you because I needed you.

792
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:50,330
It's because I liked you,
that I needed you.

793
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:13,440
If you need me, then just use me.

794
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,070
Take everything and use it.

795
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:22,070
In return,
take responsibility for me.

796
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:16,160
You'll really become human?

797
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,289
Yes.

798
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:20,599
When you return my bead that
you've protected for 100 days,

799
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,520
I'll become human.

800
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:29,149
But, why didn't you tell me before?

801
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:33,649
If you'd liked me, then I was planning
to tell you I'm becoming human.

802
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:35,739
<i>But you said that you
definitely didn't like me.</i>

803
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,860
<i>So I couldn't say it.</i>

804
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:42,949
Then after you've become a human,
you'll be Park Sun Ju?

805
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:44,170
Yeah.

806
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,380
I'm just borrowing a name.

807
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,369
Today is Park Sun Ju's birthday.

808
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:53,659
I received a birthday present
and a birthday cake.

809
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,880
And blew out birthday candles.

810
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,490
You did everything.

811
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,160
You heard the Happy Birthday
song, too, right?

812
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,889
Happy Birthday song?

813
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:06,029
I didn't hear that.

814
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:09,920
The most important thing was left out!

815
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:15,350
This cool singer,
Singer Cha, will sing it for you.

816
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:20,629
Happy birthday to you.

817
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:22,130
Happy...

818
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:26,320
Ah, this doesn't seem right.

819
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,610
I'll sing a special one for you.

820
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:43,380
Look at this side

821
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,010
Look at that side.

822
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,920
It can't be understood.

823
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:54,510
Mi Ho. Mi Ho.

824
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,830
My friend Mi Ho.

825
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:03,500
Is a cute gumiho.

826
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:06,290

827
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:11,680
My beautiful friend Mi Ho.

829
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,669
Mi Ho is.

830
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:19,550
I like, I like.

831
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:26,099
The Yuh-Chin* I like.

01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:11,299
You seem to be coveting the fox's bead...

844
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,349
The tree that I lived in
has been chopped down.

845
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,829
I had no choice
but to come to the human's world.

846
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:18,569
She can only leave if you let her go.

847
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:22,549
Mi Ho doesn't even want to leave and
I definitely don't want her to leave either.

848
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:25,089
<i>I'll be fine.</i>
