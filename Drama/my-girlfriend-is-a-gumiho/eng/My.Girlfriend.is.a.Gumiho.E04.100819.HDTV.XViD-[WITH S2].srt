Episode 4

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,535
Why did it start moving?

5
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:24,512
Dae Woong! Dae Woong!

6
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,805
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

7
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:37,397
Dae Woong!

8
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,983
Dae Woong! Woong!

9
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:50,802
Dae Woong!

10
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:53,373
Woong!

11
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,002
Woong.

12
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:52,294
<i>Rain on a clear day
is called fox rain.</i>

13
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:54,939
<i>It's the rain that
will fall when I'm sad.</i>

14
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,346
How's that possible?

15
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:08,803
As if it snows when she gets a runny nose,
or there's a typhoon when she sneezes.

16
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:10,117
That's impossible.

17
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,879
I'm very happy that I became
friends with you!

18
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:17,340
What friend?

19
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,763
I'm her source of food and I finally
managed to escape from danger.

20
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:29,255
Promise me, don't let it get damaged,
protect it well.

21
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,713
Why is it raining on a clear day?
Grasping people without letting go?

22
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,249
Why? Why?

23
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,760
Because of the water, my aura
is getting weaker and weaker.

24
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,863
Plus the bead isn't beside me.

25
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:20,822
I can't keep on crying.

26
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:28,567
It's quite strange, what's wrong with you?

27
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,329
What's wrong?

28
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:39,817
So scary!

29
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:42,850
That noona is scary.

30
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:45,074
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

31
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:47,275
<i>So scary!</i>

32
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:51,696
<i>Customer, are you alright?</i>

33
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,187
<i>I say, Miss!</i>

34
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,380
<i>Oh, what to do?</i>

35
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,258
<i>With my aura weakened, my face
has already started to change.</i>

36
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:10,868
<i>Terrible, terrible.</i>

37
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,960
<i>Hey!</i>

38
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:17,085
Hey! What exactly did you do to my child?

39
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:18,675
Customer, did something happen?

40
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:22,182
The girl who went in there just
now made my child cry.

41
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:25,197
<i>Hey, open the door!</i>

42
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:29,898
<i>I say, you make someone else's child
cry but you don't utter a single word?</i>

43
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,850
<i>You said that she looked like a monster?</i>

44
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,051
<i>Yes, it really was scary.</i>

45
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,967
What exactly did she look like to be
able to scare a child to this degree?

46
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:52,185
I didn't see her. She was hiding the
entire time and wouldn't come out.

47
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:57,265
I saw. She didn't look like a human.
She became really scary.

48
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,669
Monster? Change?

49
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:03,036
Is it Mi Ho?

50
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:23,402
It can't be... Mi Ho?

51
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:29,347
Mi Ho.

52
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:34,011
Why are you staying down there?
How did you change into this?

53
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:42,570
<i>Pretty!</i>

54
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:46,991
I almost forgot about you and left you here.

55
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,483
Let's go.

56
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:54,108
Oh, so it's Pretty.

57
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,047
Then, where exactly is Mi Ho?

58
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:02,941
<i>Mi Ho!</i>

59
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:04,902
<i>Oh, it's Dae Woong!</i>

60
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:12,176
Customer, if you still won't open
the door, we're just going to enter.

61
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:13,230
Go get the key.

62
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,394
Who is it exactly?

63
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,227
I don't know. There's a woman who
went inside but won't come out.

64
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,231
- Is it Mi Ho? Is Mi Ho in here?
- Dae Woong!

65
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:34,690
What are you doing here?

66
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:36,373
<i>Come out quickly.</i>

67
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,217
<i>Is it because you're angry at me?</i>

68
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:39,845
Well, didn't I come back?

69
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:41,417
Come out quickly!

70
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:43,803
<i>I can't go outside right now.</i>

71
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:46,700
<i>Once you see what I look like,
you'll definitely be frightened.</i>

72
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,124
Why?

73
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:52,175
It can't be that your tails came out.

74
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:56,003
It's okay, I've already
seen them a couple times.

75
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,372
I'm already used to it.
I won't get scared.

76
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:59,148
<i>It's not the tails.</i>

77
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:03,962
<i>My aura has been weakened,
which caused the change.</i>

78
00:07:04,082 --> 00:07:05,738
What part changed?

79
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,754
Open the door first. I'm the only one
here right now so it's okay.

80
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,749
<i>You will definitely get scared.</i>

81
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:18,329
What is there to be scared of...

82
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:23,474
<i>See, I told you that you'd get scared.</i>

83
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,029
You're right, it is kind of scary.

84
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:36,230
<i>It's this key, right?</i>

85
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,968
<i>It should be. Let's go.</i>

86
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:41,039
Before the other people rush over,
let's leave this place.

87
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,649
Here, we'll drape this over you.

88
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:50,963
Come out quickly.

89
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:00,348
Wrap it more tightly, tighter.

90
00:08:00,468 --> 00:08:03,160
But how did you transform into this?

91
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,742
<i>Why did you drag me here and leave?</i>

92
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:11,088
I didn't, I just left temporarily.

93
00:08:11,593 --> 00:08:13,258
It's the boat that left me.

94
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:15,839
<i>Even if I did leave temporarily,</i>

95
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,418
you should've eaten your fill of grilled
meat on the boat. Be more courageous.

96
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:23,833
<i>But you ended up crying and transforming
into something this scary.</i>

97
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:27,385
Don't let other people see. Wrap it tightly.

98
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,642
<i>Is it because I cried that you came back?</i>

99
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:31,418
Rain on a clear day,

100
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:33,582
it ruined the moods of all
the people out on excursions.

101
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:35,968
<i>So that means you can't cry.</i>

102
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,667
Let's find a place with no people first.

103
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:46,260
Customer! Customer! Customer!

104
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:47,217
<i>Customer!</i>

105
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:49,640
<i>You can't take that away with you!</i>

106
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:19,125
Mi Ho, are you okay?

107
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:20,291
<i>Yes.</i>

108
00:09:21,197 --> 00:09:23,565
It'll be okay if I walk holding you
like this for the entire way.

109
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:25,864
Let's go.

110
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,172
<i>Woong!</i>

111
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,028
You changed back?

112
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,784
Yes! Because you've returned to my side!

113
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:39,708
So I was able to change back!

114
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,696
It's good that you're back.

115
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:48,232
No.

116
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,774
Stay like this for a little longer.

117
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:57,214
<i>My aura is too weak.</i>

118
00:09:57,334 --> 00:10:00,470
I have to hold the bead for a little longer.

119
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:02,359
Ah...

120
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:05,393
how wonderful.

121
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:15,536
Okay now?

122
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,276
No, just a little more.

123
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:22,105
How much longer?

124
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:23,881
Just a little more.

125
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,914
I want to stay like this for awhile.

126
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,238
Helping me fix this, and even delivering
to a far-away place like here,

127
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,920
I am so thankful, Park Dong Ju.

128
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:51,404
I looked into it some more. It should be
possible to restore this picture.

129
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:52,325
You're saying...

130
00:10:52,808 --> 00:10:57,997
that the fox in the picture
can be recovered?

131
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,915
Yes. Wait patiently.

132
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,208
I will bring the fox back into that picture.

133
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:07,589
You have to succeed.

134
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,914
Before that happens, the new disciples
will start to arrive and swarm together.

135
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:15,351
The third grandmother won't be
lonely anymore, either.

136
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:19,378
After waiting for a while, we will
be able to see it, right?

137
00:11:19,498 --> 00:11:21,952
Yes, it has to return to its original form.

138
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,403
Child, this is Dae Woong's luggage.

139
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,185
Take this to him.

140
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:38,289
Dae Woong's independent mind is
currently ready to cause trouble.

141
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:42,518
<i>If the seedling is that girl,</i>

142
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:45,810
just add some fertilizer to
allow it to grow up quickly.

143
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,626
Let them be together.

144
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,381
What independent mind?

145
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,823
Making me run such a long distance.

146
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:57,249
At least the arguments
have stopped for now.

147
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:00,721
Why can't Dae Woong just stay independent
forever and I stay in love forever?

148
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,025
Don't know if Director Ban will
like the lunchbox I made.

149
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:21,226
I stayed up all night to make this
lunchbox, so I didn't get any sleep.

150
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,378
The sun is practically gone.

151
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:47,301
I can't be sleepy.

152
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:51,110
When will the director come?

153
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:56,520
I still have to ask Dae Woong about
how the results turned out today.

154
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,412
Dae Woong didn't make it
to the audition in time.

155
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:03,587
It's all that girl's fault by causing an
incident and messing it up.

156
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:07,161
For this audition,
he even prepared seriously.

157
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,024
<i>That woman is the embodiment of misfortune!</i>

158
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:12,094
He was late because he was buying
the outfit for Hae In sunbae.

159
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:13,635
Why did you start blaming Mi Ho?

160
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:21,573
Seon Nyeo,

161
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:25,537
I heard that Director Ban already
picked someone for the female lead.

162
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,319
Do you know who it is?

163
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,344
He saw a mysterious woman,
and has been obsessed ever since.

164
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:43,721
I clearly saw her here at this garbage can.

165
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:48,352
<i>That figure who flew towards
the sky with nothing.</i>

166
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,506
Could it really just be a dream?

167
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:55,648
Real Action, my dream.

168
00:14:58,322 --> 00:15:02,606
Where... where is it?

169
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,785
Chicken again?

170
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:22,512
When are we going to eat beef?

171
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,000
Things didn't go very smoothly today.

172
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,444
Within this short period of time,
we can only live eating this.

173
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:32,889
Hey, you're still asking me to buy beef
for you to eat in this type of situation.

174
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:34,653
That's really shameless.

175
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:38,029
Didn't you say that I'm not human,
so it's okay for me to be shameless?

176
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,947
You can be shameless, but you
should still use your eyes.

177
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,761
I have no money, my dreams have been
shattered, how am I supposed to have beef?

178
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:46,949
Your dreams have been shattered?

179
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:48,276
<i>Yes.</i>

180
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:52,584
The first gate I have to pass in becoming
a big international action star,

181
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,306
has been closed right in front of my eyes.

182
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:56,736
Action?

183
00:15:58,742 --> 00:15:59,726
Then what is it?

184
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:04,774
There is such a thing.
It's something I'm very skilled at.

185
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:07,169
Ah, so it's running away!

186
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,311
Even though in your eyes,

187
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:12,890
I'm the type of person who only knows
how to run away,

188
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,823
how to buy you meat to eat
all the time, and seems feeble.

189
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:19,362
But in women's eyes, I'm pretty handsome.

190
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:23,095
Speeding on a motorcycle,
running when I'm exercising,

191
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:29,034
when I'm about to fly with suspensions,
the women will all faint.

192
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,142
Woong, not only humans,
but even I can be put in a trance.

193
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:37,032
Really?

194
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:41,321
So, that means scholarly people's
insights are the same.

195
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:45,756
I mean, even when our dog Ddong Ja sees me,
the sound of her bark is different.

196
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:49,207
Dae Woong, if you start
practicing martial arts,

197
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:51,491
you will definitely be really handsome.

198
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,218
Of course.

199
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,204
Shall I show you?

200
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:03,472
Action.

201
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:14,555
Before I can continue looking for that
woman, I need to find a washroom.

202
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,180
It's very serious.

203
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:20,808
My name in the movie is Hyun Woo.

204
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:23,092
He's a chivalrous swordsman
nicknamed Black Rain.

205
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:46,530
Chase me. You've chased me to here.

206
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,826
I really took on a lot of trouble.

207
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:07,684
So this is... this is your final outcome.

208
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:11,918
Dae Woong! You were so great!

209
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:14,003
It's really amusing!

210
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:16,745
This was originally supposed to
be performed for the audition.

211
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,329
It's all in the past now.

212
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:24,420
- Eh, what a pity
- Eh, what a pity.

213
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,107
How depressing.

214
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:31,391
How... depressing.

215
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,247
So infuriating!

216
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,438
So infuriating!

217
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:42,725
Forget it, tweh tweh tweh!

218
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:44,753
Forget it, tweh tweh tweh!

219
00:19:44,873 --> 00:19:46,555
What a bunch of crap! Crap, crap, crap!

220
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:48,653
What a bunch of crap! Crap, crap, crap!

221
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,098
Don't care anymore, just leave it as it is.

222
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:55,921
Don't care anymore, just leave it as it is.

223
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:03,126
Oh my God, what to do?

224
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:05,595
Woong, the wall is cracking.

225
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:07,729
Don't touch it.

226
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:10,106
What to do about this?

227
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:12,148
Someone's coming.

228
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:22,581
<i>No matter where I turn,
I can't find a washroom.</i>

229
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,884
I have no choice.

230
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,618
What to do? I feel a bit uneasy.

231
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:51,181
The crack in the wall is really severe.

232
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,118
I'm sorry.

233
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:14,731
So, Trench Coat Hero,
let's straighten things out.

234
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:19,184
You ruined their wall, and then you took
your pants off in front of that woman?

235
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:19,797
Is that right?

236
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,487
I'm not that type of a person.

237
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:24,901
I just peed at the foot of that wall.

238
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:25,643
Hey you,

239
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:28,280
so you're saying that you used your super,
invincible pee to knock over their wall?

240
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,062
<i>Then why aren't you saying that your fart
can blow a bunny into the sky?</i>

241
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:32,176
It probably can.

242
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:33,885
Are you trying to joke with me now!? You!

243
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:37,967
You're just wearing a trench coat,
but you made their wall collapse!

244
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:40,567
<i>And you even took your pants off
in front of that woman, didn't you?</i>

245
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:42,755
You're a typical complete whacko.

246
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:45,930
Please look carefully into my eyes.

247
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:50,487
I'm definitely not that type of person.

248
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:54,851
I can accept the accusation of
peeing in inappropriate places.

249
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:58,015
<i>If you demand compensation because
I peed in an inappropriate place,</i>

250
00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:01,766
and caused a wall to collapse,
any amount is okay.

251
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:05,301
But you calling me a whacko.

252
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:08,161
I definitely will not accept that.

253
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:09,869
You really aren't explaining truthfully!

254
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:13,727
Honestly, I only peed.

255
00:22:14,172 --> 00:22:17,125
And it wasn't even pee
I held in for a long time,

256
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:19,081
but only a normal amount of time.

257
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:22,145
How am I supposed to believe that? Huh?

258
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:27,888
Well...

259
00:22:30,135 --> 00:22:31,584
I saw it.

260
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:34,830
It's true that this gentleman
only peed.

261
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,367
If you hadn't seen me today,
I would've been in big trouble.

262
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:51,576
Thank you.

263
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:56,857
As long as you're fine,
I'll be at ease, Director Ban.

264
00:22:57,414 --> 00:22:58,826
Director Ban?

265
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,987
Do you know me?

266
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:05,406
Yes, I'm Cha Dae Woong.
I'm Ban Seon Nyeo's friend.

267
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:06,632
Cha Dae Woong. Cha...

268
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,484
Ahh...

269
00:23:09,428 --> 00:23:13,606
So, that really popular person
at the action school is you.

270
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:15,388
Yes.

271
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:19,323
Originally I should've met you at
the Moonlight Swordsman audition.

272
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:21,663
Unexpectedly, I met you here.

273
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:26,405
I heard that you weren't able to participate
in the audition because you were late.

274
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,980
Saying this in a place
like this is kind of...

275
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:33,449
I really respect you, Director.

276
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:36,049
I feel extremely honored
to be able to meet you.

277
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,261
Letting you see me in such
an embarrassing state,

278
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:43,210
and hearing you say that you respect me,

279
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,133
I haven't lived for nothing.

280
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:57,014
Look carefully into my eyes.

281
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:02,685
This meeting today is a secret
between the two of us.

282
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:07,538
Can you swear on your name as a man?

283
00:24:10,998 --> 00:24:12,187
Okay.

284
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:20,102
I will contact you.

285
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:23,324
Give you another opportunity.

286
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:27,743
I'll give you a call.

287
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:30,900
Thank you! Thank you!

288
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:38,368
- Leave safely!
- You should go back too.

289
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:54,964
Mi Ho, let's go!

290
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:55,884
<i>Wait a moment.</i>

291
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,682
What are you doing?

292
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:01,874
What are you doing with
something that dirty?!

293
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:03,449
I told you before that you can't just
pick up something and eat it!

294
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,121
Spit it out and throw it away!

295
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,797
Fine, if you throw that away,
I will buy you beef.

296
00:25:09,362 --> 00:25:12,351
I always make you buy meat for me to eat.
I feel embarrassed.

297
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,097
You said that you'd buy meat for me.

298
00:25:14,217 --> 00:25:16,007
It seems that things have
made good progress.

299
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:17,678
I can tell.

300
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:19,832
That's right.

301
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:30,319
Before, I never wanted to care,

302
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:33,105
but you really look too distressed.

303
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:37,940
When gumiho doesn't have the bead,
she'll be exhausted,

304
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,834
become weak and also become dirty.

305
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:46,145
Let's go, buy meat for me!

306
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:49,487
Buy meat and also something else.

307
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:55,741
<i>Mi Ho,</i>

308
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,460
we'll buy meat on the way back.

309
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,025
I'm going to buy what you need
the most first. Let's go.

310
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:27,501
This, dip it in water first.

311
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:32,429
Then squeeze this on it.

312
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:34,936
Here, hold it.

313
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:37,482
It's not edible!

314
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:39,673
It's delicious!

315
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,988
First go like this. Then go up and down.

316
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,758
Up down, up down, like this, like this.

317
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,577
Okay?

318
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:53,196
Use water.

319
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:02,590
Spit it out.

320
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:07,341
It's not supposed to be eaten!

321
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,365
It's delicious!

322
00:27:13,872 --> 00:27:17,752
Use this, like this, wipe it like this.

323
00:27:18,105 --> 00:27:21,466
Use this one or that one? Just come out
when you're finished washing.

324
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:25,574
Hey! You can't eat this.

325
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:27,245
It tastes good!

326
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:30,808
It tastes really good.

327
00:27:48,238 --> 00:27:49,594
Here, open your hands.

328
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:56,271
Pat like this.

329
00:27:58,257 --> 00:27:59,130
<i>Oh, it tastes good!</i>

330
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,210
I beg you, don't eat any more!

331
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,566
Seeing her like this almost makes
her seem like a normal person.

332
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:21,372
Today, because of you, I truly want
to become a real person.

333
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:26,411
It seems like you're in a good mood,
Miss Gu Mi Ho.

334
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:30,738
Then why don't you say when you're going
to take that bead inside me away?

335
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:33,337
I feel that my body's great.

336
00:28:33,457 --> 00:28:35,157
How long do I still need to
keep that bead inside of me?

337
00:28:35,277 --> 00:28:36,717
<i>You should know.</i>

338
00:28:37,961 --> 00:28:39,409
Well, that...

339
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:41,852
it should've healed a lot.

340
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:47,169
Then I'll come there to
be properly examined.

341
00:28:48,321 --> 00:28:51,607
How much longer until I
can take the bead out?

342
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:58,119
Today I did too much work,
I'm a little tired.

343
00:28:59,395 --> 00:29:01,697
Ah, I'm sleepy, I want to rest.

344
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:06,847
Hey, what about the meat?

345
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:09,546
Leave it there, I'll eat it later.

346
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,979
Eat it later?

347
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,609
Seems like you're really tired.

348
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:35,578
I don't want to harm you.

349
00:29:37,238 --> 00:29:39,466
I hope you can return obediently.

350
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:55,339
Can the fox really return to the picture?

351
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:12,675
He's almost fully recovered.

352
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:16,958
But if I tell him that, he'll let me
take the bead and go back.

353
00:30:18,365 --> 00:30:20,426
Run! The boar's coming!

354
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:07,334
If I said that I'm going to stay here
and catch mosquitoes,

355
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:09,335
he'll think that I'm annoying, right?

356
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:17,053
Because I'm not human.

357
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:29,658
Hae In! Congratulations!

358
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:33,502
You got the role as Lady Seo In!

359
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:35,619
That's good.

360
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,846
But the person who'll play the lead
role hasn't been decided yet?

361
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:42,018
Ah, not yet.

362
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,013
Director,

363
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:49,578
before filming starts, I want to practice
a bit at Director Ban's Action School.

364
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:52,917
You don't have any fighting scenes,
there's no need.

365
00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:56,241
You still want to act the lead role?

366
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:58,439
Well, it hasn't been decided yet.

367
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,322
In the last advertisement I filmed,
I did kung fu moves.

368
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,417
Also, I practiced fencing
for a period of time.

369
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:06,813
I want the director to see my strong points.

370
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,687
It's good that you're putting in effort,
but don't strain yourself.

371
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:17,723
That's too much!

372
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:22,049
I tried out for role of my dreams
but it ended up in Hae In unni's hands.

373
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:25,008
And I'm just playing
some maid or servant.

374
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:27,014
It wouldn't matter if I didn't want it,

375
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:29,149
but isn't my old dad being way too
harsh on his daughter?

376
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,504
After all, it's the job in which
Director Ban exerts all his effort.

377
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:33,900
He can't ruin it.

378
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,292
What?

379
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:40,183
Of course, you're prettier
than Hae In noona,

380
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:42,654
but your acting skills aren't that good.

381
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:46,423
Hey, even still... Maid Number One?

382
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:50,579
I'll get you into as many scenes as possible,
and also give you lots of screen time.

383
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:54,201
Stop joking. You're youngest rank in the production.
What can you possibly do?

384
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:57,617
But during action scenes,
the youngest power is the best.

385
00:32:57,737 --> 00:32:59,010
At least...

386
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,151
I'm better than Dae Woong, who wasn't
even able to participate in the audition.

387
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:08,044
If you're not going to use my abilities,
let the Director give him another chance.

388
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:12,285
My old dad makes decisions quickly,
he won't show any mercy.

389
00:33:14,235 --> 00:33:17,744
That Cha Dae Woong,
I wanted to see him today.

390
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,586
You changed your plan? Did something happen?

391
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,606
Ah, did you receive care from someone?

392
00:33:30,022 --> 00:33:35,147
Do you know, in this action movie,
who will die first?

393
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:38,404
It's the type of people
who cause disturbances,

394
00:33:38,524 --> 00:33:40,280
meddle in other people's business,
and spread rumors.

395
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,399
<i>Five minutes after the movie
starts, that person will die.</i>

396
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,117
So you just go and prepare well.

397
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,282
Oh my, oh my!

398
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:59,999
Why is he getting himself involved?

399
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:03,368
He'll definitely be the first to get shot.

400
00:34:07,324 --> 00:34:08,921
Min Sook,

401
00:34:09,224 --> 00:34:12,826
recently you're always watching movies
with waving swords and firing guns.

402
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:16,373
<i>Are you dating a person
who likes to fight?</i>

403
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:18,682
What are you talking about?

404
00:34:18,802 --> 00:34:20,369
When dating a person who loved fishing,

405
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,795
you watched the fishing channel every day.

406
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:26,374
When you dated a baduk* player, you
watched the baduk channel. [*Korean chess]

407
00:34:26,494 --> 00:34:30,048
Are you dating a person who fights,

408
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,944
so you're watching fighting movies?

409
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:37,305
Father, it's not fighting.
It's action, action.

410
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:39,681
Don't even know the difference.

411
00:34:42,444 --> 00:34:48,033
So the man who Min Sook is obsessed
with recently is related to action.

412
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,238
Hmm, action. If only Dae Woong was here...

413
00:34:56,731 --> 00:34:59,628
Maybe I'll discuss it with Dae Woong.

414
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:10,844
"My reliable child, Dae Woong."

415
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:12,039
<i>I need to talk with you.</i>

416
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,837
<i>Come home just once.</i>

417
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:16,522
This... What is this?

418
00:35:16,642 --> 00:35:18,341
<i>Reliable? Talk?</i>

419
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:21,134
What's wrong with Grandpa suddenly?

420
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:25,149
Is he sick?

421
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:29,430
Woong!

422
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:33,998
Today, you have to perform what
you've been practicing well.

423
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:35,279
Of course I will.

424
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,754
Let's go.

425
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,372
I'm not going.

426
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:44,420
Don't let me mess it up again.
I'm not going with you.

427
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,422
You're letting me go by myself?

428
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:47,462
Yes.

429
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,710
Yesterday you said that
you're not eating meat,

430
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,343
and today you're saying
that you're not coming,

431
00:35:51,686 --> 00:35:53,070
are you feeling sick anywhere?

432
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,395
If I wait for you, you will
definitely come back.

433
00:35:58,268 --> 00:35:59,364
Right?

434
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:02,304
Yes.

435
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,406
Thanks for letting me go.

436
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,894
Then, I'm leaving.

437
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:10,897
Okay.

438
00:36:18,353 --> 00:36:21,658
Mi Ho, if you're hungry, don't search
in the garbage cans.

439
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:24,496
Use this and buy some chicken or something.

440
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:25,870
Okay.

441
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:27,801
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

442
00:36:35,865 --> 00:36:38,614
Mi Ho, if something happens, you
know my phone number right?

443
00:36:38,734 --> 00:36:39,839
Remember to call me.

444
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:40,953
Okay.

445
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,397
If today goes smoothly,
I'll buy beef for you.

446
00:36:44,517 --> 00:36:45,883
Wait for me.

447
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:46,904
Okay.

448
00:36:47,424 --> 00:36:48,854
I'm really leaving.

449
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:49,705
Okay.

450
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:07,498
A couple days before, she was sticking
to me like gum,

451
00:37:07,618 --> 00:37:10,042
now she suddenly wants to be separated.

452
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,555
Feels like I lost something.

453
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,294
What am I doing?

454
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,306
I think I've been influenced by her.

455
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:30,908
This won't do! Have to be clear-minded,
clear-minded!

456
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:41,716
Dae Woong, you should be fully recovered.

457
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:44,569
The bead can be removed.

458
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:49,525
Afterward, can I continue to stay here?

459
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:57,492
When you come back tonight,
I'll have to ask.

460
00:37:59,893 --> 00:38:02,433
I probably won't be going
to the hospital today.

461
00:38:02,923 --> 00:38:04,446
For now, let Mr Tae Jun store it for me.

462
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:07,930
Okay. Are you going to meet someone?

463
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,065
I'm going to send someone
to a far-away place.

464
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:13,426
Before that, I'll buy her good food to eat.

465
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:15,954
Then you're going on a date!

466
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:18,127
Have a good time.

467
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,330
Date?

468
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:25,606
I'm going to trick the fox over here.

469
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:28,428
That could count as a date.

470
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:33,502
Last night, my house's wall collapsed.

471
00:38:33,622 --> 00:38:35,749
Did you see it? Did you see it?

472
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:37,566
Although it was pretty dark, but who am I?

473
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:41,165
My eyesight, how worse can it be?

474
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,152
That man was a serious specimen!

475
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:45,526
<i>Who was it? Tell me too!</i>

476
00:38:45,646 --> 00:38:49,924
Also, recently there seems to be a cat.

477
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:54,133
Turning the garbage outside
into a huge mess.

478
00:38:54,253 --> 00:38:59,240
My nephew's friend works for municipal
government, so I have some connections.

479
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,394
<i>So typical of you, Madam Kang!</i>

480
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:09,160
Who's that girl? Never seen her before.

481
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:14,377
Miss! What are you doing over there?

482
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:24,620
Miss, why are you looking
through my garbage?

483
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,032
Ah, found it!

484
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:27,591
I've collected 10!

485
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:30,281
<i>Miss.</i>

486
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,252
You can't take the free coupons you find
in the fried chicken shop's garbage can!

487
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,144
A young girl like you,
how can you be so shameless?

488
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:37,093
Give it to me. It's mine.

489
00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:40,380
Quite a young age, but not
using formal language.

490
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,603
You lived overseas, right?

491
00:39:41,723 --> 00:39:43,404
Give it to me! I finally found it with
great difficulty.

492
00:39:43,524 --> 00:39:45,558
Give it to me! It's mine!

493
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:50,615
What? Found from other people's
garbage cans, how can it be yours?

494
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:54,010
A beggar so early in the morning,
how disappointing.

495
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,372
Leave quickly! Get far away from here!

496
00:39:57,492 --> 00:39:58,811
Give it to me!

497
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:07,987
I finally collected 10 of these and I
can soon exchange them for chicken.

498
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:10,354
You're going to take the last one away?

499
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:14,785
Let go.

500
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,548
Okay! I'll give it to you!

501
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:45,180
Omo! She seemed so weak,
and you lost like this?

502
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:49,613
Weak Miss? You go try it!

503
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:52,565
Looking into her eyes,
I almost peed my pants!

504
00:40:57,532 --> 00:40:59,705
She's not a normal person.

505
00:41:01,216 --> 00:41:04,502
Using this, I can eat chicken
with Dae Woong!

506
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:13,595
Oh, that person.

507
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,665
He really did come find me.

508
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:22,712
Don't even know to be scared when fighting
with a human. You really can bear it.

509
00:41:22,832 --> 00:41:26,645
You're more powerful, you have everything.

510
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:30,953
You have a name, an address,
and even a credit card.

511
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,435
Ah, your name is Park Dong Ju.

512
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:37,756
Right now, it's Park Dong Ju.

513
00:41:38,183 --> 00:41:40,783
Oh! You even have one of these.

514
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,692
Nowadays everybody has one.

515
00:41:46,406 --> 00:41:48,504
We're not people, though.

516
00:41:57,996 --> 00:42:00,763
We may be inspected at any time,
so you should fasten your seatbelt.

517
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:01,989
What?

518
00:42:08,982 --> 00:42:12,287
We can't risk being investigated,
because we're not human.

519
00:42:15,481 --> 00:42:16,999
What exactly are you?

520
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,025
I'm Park Dong Ju, also the President
of the veterinarian clinic.

521
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,256
Do you want to see where I live?

522
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:29,229
It filmed pretty well.

523
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:31,160
We've already inspected the
video camera carefully.

524
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,813
<i>What does Director think about it?</i>

525
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:37,917
Tomorrow, since there are some difficulties
with filming, can you come along?

526
00:42:38,037 --> 00:42:39,867
Yes, I can do that.

527
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:44,089
Then, let's start tomorrow. Just drop by.

528
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:49,072
Then... that means I've been accepted?

529
00:42:49,685 --> 00:42:51,709
Why, you don't want to?

530
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:54,179
How could I not?

531
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:56,215
I'll try hard! Thanks!

532
00:42:58,257 --> 00:42:59,724
<i>Hey, congratulations!</i>

533
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:04,066
No, now it's the rising star of the
next generation, Star Cha!

534
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:06,294
Thanks.

535
00:43:08,008 --> 00:43:11,964
Of course, even Director Kim was
accepted into a performing troupe.

536
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:17,764
That's right, in the future, this drama's
leading actor is celebrity Cha.

537
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,902
Of course, isn't it one of
Director Kim's films?

538
00:43:22,106 --> 00:43:23,573
And then what?

539
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:30,117
Okay then, newcomer, go buy some drinks.

540
00:43:30,237 --> 00:43:33,162
Do you want to die? Do you
even know who my father is?

541
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:37,514
Yes, Seon Nyeo, what do you want to eat?

542
00:43:38,993 --> 00:43:41,314
I'll see and buy every single one for you.

543
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:47,895
Tonight is beef dinner.

544
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:51,330
I'm coming right now, Gu Mi Ho.

545
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,928
Is it possible that Mi Ho ran out again?

546
00:43:56,597 --> 00:43:58,361
<i>What's running out?</i>

547
00:43:58,481 --> 00:43:59,958
Oh, Noona!

548
00:44:00,078 --> 00:44:01,536
Dae Woong, congratulations!

549
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:03,244
I heard that you've been accepted.

550
00:44:03,364 --> 00:44:05,120
I knew you could do it.

551
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:10,245
Actually, I didn't really want
to come, but they called me.

552
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:14,179
Maybe because they saw the others, but
none of them had the same talent as me.

553
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:16,463
<i>Ah, how great! My Dae Woong.</i>

554
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,620
Noona, drink this.

555
00:44:23,477 --> 00:44:27,265
Now that you've really became an actor,
you're not letting me touch you?

556
00:44:27,908 --> 00:44:32,365
It's because of summer and sweat.
I'm afraid that you'll get dirty.

557
00:44:32,485 --> 00:44:33,924
Drink something cold.

558
00:44:35,347 --> 00:44:38,188
Tonight, let's go celebrate each
other and eat supper together.

559
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:40,119
Supper?

560
00:44:41,196 --> 00:44:43,053
If today goes smoothly,
I'll buy beef for you.

561
00:44:43,173 --> 00:44:44,509
Wait for me.

562
00:44:44,629 --> 00:44:45,623
Okay.

563
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:49,576
What?

564
00:44:49,696 --> 00:44:53,160
Other than me, is there someone else
you have to celebrate with first?

565
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:57,635
Oh... My grandpa!

566
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,531
My grandpa said that there's
something he needs to discuss.

567
00:45:05,222 --> 00:45:09,006
Because he's getting older,
he's relying on his grandson more.

568
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:11,188
And I can also tell him this good news.

569
00:45:11,991 --> 00:45:15,370
Well, since it's celebrating with
the family, then I'll just make way.

570
00:45:16,752 --> 00:45:20,726
Noona, definitely next time.
We'll celebrate next time.

571
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:27,250
<i>Wow, you're really living
just like a human!</i>

572
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:34,756
How did you get here like this?

573
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:38,711
Not caring about human matters,
not making friendships,

574
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:41,939
not staying too long in any one place...

575
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:47,052
switching jobs and names constantly.

576
00:45:47,813 --> 00:45:49,410
For how long?

577
00:45:50,308 --> 00:45:52,072
A long, long time.

578
00:45:52,192 --> 00:45:57,105
Compared to the time you've been
in the picture, even longer than that.

579
00:45:57,225 --> 00:46:01,057
I have to be like you and live
in the human world.

580
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:04,269
Why don't you tell me what's
best for me to do?

581
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:08,825
But don't you want to merge with humans?
Isn't that why you came to live out here?

582
00:46:08,945 --> 00:46:12,635
<i>If you want to live like me, you can't have
any relationships with humans at all.</i>

583
00:46:13,366 --> 00:46:19,067
You can't become friends. You can't even
have a family or a loved one.

584
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:22,446
But...

585
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:25,120
I can still be together with humans.

586
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,309
No.

587
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,714
People who are living splendidly,
and you who live using the bead,

588
00:46:29,834 --> 00:46:32,963
can't be together. Definitely not.

589
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:41,550
Living like me, and living at the
Three God's Pavilion, like you...

590
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:42,882
is completely different.

591
00:46:44,253 --> 00:46:45,905
Why don't you just go back?

592
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:51,885
I wanted to live here.

593
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:56,722
I really... I really really
don't want to go back.

594
00:47:04,397 --> 00:47:06,421
You're that unwilling?

595
00:47:07,393 --> 00:47:09,454
Even if you die?

596
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:14,531
If you don't have to go back anymore,

597
00:47:15,886 --> 00:47:17,520
are you willing to die?

598
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,175
There aren't many days left where
I still have to stay with Mi Ho.

599
00:47:28,731 --> 00:47:29,920
She's about to leave soon.

600
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,997
Why?

601
00:47:31,461 --> 00:47:35,175
She and I can't truly be together.

602
00:47:35,295 --> 00:47:36,400
If I have to say why,

603
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,477
although I became very
good friends with her,

604
00:47:38,597 --> 00:47:40,965
in the end I still feel that
we're not suitable.

605
00:47:41,085 --> 00:47:42,599
What does that mean?

606
00:47:43,965 --> 00:47:47,196
The worlds that we're living in
aren't the same.

607
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,564
Living...

608
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:56,591
Is Miss Mi Ho... rich?

609
00:47:58,361 --> 00:48:01,128
If she's Gu... perhaps the family
makes these sort of things?

610
00:48:03,122 --> 00:48:07,578
It can't be, otherwise Cha Dae Woong
wouldn't let her go like this.

611
00:48:11,463 --> 00:48:14,787
She didn't give me a call. Seems
like she didn't get into trouble.

612
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:20,606
I wonder if there're still ribs or beef
tenderloin in the fridge at home?

613
00:48:21,374 --> 00:48:26,091
That means you're going to be
an actor in that movie?

614
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:29,489
Didn't I say that already?
Didn't I tell you that I can do it?

615
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:32,908
Director Ban said that he
had his eye on you.

616
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,680
Aunt, how did you get acquainted
with Director Ban?

617
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:40,283
I mean,

618
00:48:41,174 --> 00:48:44,925
it's because he's the director
of many famous action films.

619
00:48:45,045 --> 00:48:48,729
Also, he's directing your
drama, so that's how I know.

620
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:50,381
Action?

621
00:48:51,948 --> 00:48:53,099
Why?

622
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,817
It's nothing, it's nothing.

623
00:48:56,716 --> 00:49:00,281
Right now, movies have brought
our family back to life.

624
00:49:02,598 --> 00:49:05,328
After a few more days, I can come home.

625
00:49:05,448 --> 00:49:06,906
I can come back, right Grandpa?

626
00:49:07,026 --> 00:49:08,818
No problem, no problem.

627
00:49:08,938 --> 00:49:12,529
This type of circumstance is called
returning into welcoming arms.

628
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:16,667
Come back together with that woman.

629
00:49:18,698 --> 00:49:21,335
Grandpa, she...

630
00:49:24,324 --> 00:49:25,847
We'll decide on something.

631
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:27,054
What?

632
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:30,122
Grandpa, is there still meat in the fridge?

633
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:32,097
Can I take some with me?

634
00:49:32,822 --> 00:49:36,737
If you, in the body of a gumiho, can
collect a human's spirit when you die,

635
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,196
<i>you can become a human.</i>

636
00:49:39,825 --> 00:49:41,430
Can become human?

637
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,243
If you want that, first...

638
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:45,887
you must have something that can
kill your gumiho body,

639
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:48,508
and also a person who is willing
to share their spirit with you.

640
00:49:48,628 --> 00:49:50,543
You have to meet these two conditions.

641
00:49:51,782 --> 00:49:54,574
Something that can kill me?

642
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:08,975
My blood can kill you.

643
00:50:09,095 --> 00:50:11,277
This dagger can also kill you.

644
00:50:11,936 --> 00:50:16,080
After drinking my blood, the process
is very slow. It's a very slow death.

645
00:50:17,453 --> 00:50:19,532
You can kill me?

646
00:50:19,652 --> 00:50:22,964
Your fox bead can absorb a human's spirit.

647
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:24,996
I know that.

648
00:50:25,116 --> 00:50:26,289
Drinking my blood,

649
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:29,884
with the fox bead that has been
tainted with hundreds of people's spirits,

650
00:50:31,075 --> 00:50:33,065
you will be able to turn into a person.

651
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,731
Why are you telling me this?

652
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:45,857
Because I remember a girl named Kil Dal
who looked like you.

653
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:49,969
Kil Dal wanted the same thing as you.

654
00:50:52,405 --> 00:50:54,307
She once had the same wish as you.

655
00:50:58,407 --> 00:51:00,100
Did she turn into a human?

656
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,073
The part where you need to die,
I can help with that.

657
00:51:13,193 --> 00:51:16,932
But is there a human who could hold
your fox bead for you...

658
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:18,863
for 100 days?

659
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:22,542
Well, that...

660
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:25,699
Right now, the person beside
you called Cha Dae Woong,

661
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:27,463
will he help you?

662
00:51:30,426 --> 00:51:32,265
Humans are untrustworthy.

663
00:51:33,702 --> 00:51:36,840
So forget what I said just now and go back.

664
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,201
Go back to the place you came from.

665
00:52:09,934 --> 00:52:11,722
<i>Dying...</i>

666
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:14,275
<i>Is that like disappearing?</i>

667
00:52:17,913 --> 00:52:21,604
<i>I just want to remain at his side.</i>

668
00:52:30,759 --> 00:52:33,243
Unni's role is a girl sideline defender,

669
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:36,089
why are you practicing martial arts
moves with us?

670
00:52:36,209 --> 00:52:38,549
Regardless of why,
it's always good to learn.

671
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:42,337
You have your eyes on that
still-up-for-grabs female lead, right?

672
00:52:44,434 --> 00:52:48,863
If Hae In Unni becomes the female lead,
then I can get your role!

673
00:52:48,983 --> 00:52:50,376
That'd be great!

674
00:52:50,999 --> 00:52:53,358
This is the director's enormous
and ambitious breakout!

675
00:52:57,579 --> 00:52:59,251
When is the director coming back?

676
00:52:59,371 --> 00:53:00,977
He should almost be done warming up.

677
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:02,686
Let's start practicing with this.

678
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:05,805
Wait a minute. I'll practice later.

679
00:53:11,962 --> 00:53:15,137
Looks like she wants to practice
in front of the director.

680
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:22,089
I have a headache. It feels stuffy.

681
00:53:33,758 --> 00:53:35,504
That woman is Real Action.

682
00:53:37,787 --> 00:53:39,180
My Dream.

683
00:53:46,161 --> 00:53:48,278
Oh, it's Director Ban.

684
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:05,297
Miss, excuse me, did you see me
a couple of nights ago?

685
00:54:11,738 --> 00:54:13,038
There's definitely no mistake.

686
00:54:13,158 --> 00:54:17,251
Wearing a white dress, and with long hair.

687
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,961
That person... is her?

688
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,114
Miss, have a chat with me.

689
00:54:31,391 --> 00:54:33,039
Miss!

690
00:54:47,021 --> 00:54:48,470
Real Action.

691
00:54:49,776 --> 00:54:51,484
Ah, she's really fast.

692
00:54:51,918 --> 00:54:55,186
A person like her... how is it possible?

693
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,815
When Mi Ho sees this still freshly
frozen beef, she'll jump for joy.

694
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:09,688
Oh, Noona!

695
00:55:09,808 --> 00:55:12,102
Dae Woong, let's meet up.

696
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:13,903
I have something to ask you.

697
00:55:15,027 --> 00:55:16,903
Right now?

698
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,463
<i>You're at your grandpa's house, right?</i>

699
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,078
<i>I'll come over immediately.</i>

700
00:55:20,198 --> 00:55:21,527
You're coming over?

701
00:55:21,647 --> 00:55:23,585
It's too inconvenient.

702
00:55:24,142 --> 00:55:26,240
It's inconvenient for me
to go out right now.

703
00:55:28,246 --> 00:55:29,323
Really?

704
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:44,008
Why?

705
00:55:45,037 --> 00:55:48,491
Are you in the middle of supper
with your grandpa?

706
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:52,167
Yes, we're just preparing to eat.

707
00:55:52,919 --> 00:55:54,980
And it's inconvenient to go out.

708
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,246
When it's nighttime I'll come find you.

709
00:55:57,366 --> 00:55:58,304
I'll see you then.

710
00:55:58,424 --> 00:56:00,567
<i>No need, let's just meet now.</i>

711
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:02,071
<i>I'm here.</i>

712
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:03,018
What?

713
00:56:17,835 --> 00:56:18,967
Noona...

714
00:56:20,286 --> 00:56:22,143
Is this place your grandpa's house?

715
00:56:24,694 --> 00:56:26,161
What is that?

716
00:56:27,386 --> 00:56:32,028
Ah, you were planning on holding a
celebration supper with your girlfriend?

717
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:38,273
Why was that person chasing me?

718
00:56:39,822 --> 00:56:42,180
He sounds very important to Dae Woong.

719
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:46,284
Good thing I didn't get discovered.

720
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:49,912
Oh, Dae Woong told me to call him
if something happened.

721
00:56:52,983 --> 00:56:55,861
Ahjumma! Can I use your phone?

722
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:00,744
Don't call for too long.

723
00:57:09,053 --> 00:57:10,725
Dae Woong,

724
00:57:11,924 --> 00:57:13,390
I know very well that you
don't think of her that way,

725
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:16,702
but I still feel that I'm
being dragged down.

726
00:57:17,478 --> 00:57:19,892
About her always being intertwined
with you, and not letting go,

727
00:57:20,012 --> 00:57:21,861
I tried to be understanding.

728
00:57:25,038 --> 00:57:27,154
But I really can't take it anymore.

729
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:31,592
Noona, I owe her a huge debt.

730
00:57:31,712 --> 00:57:34,560
<i>So I promised her that I'd be together
with her for a short period of time.</i>

731
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,417
Also, there aren't many days left.

732
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:37,958
Dae Woong...

733
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,459
You...

734
00:57:41,294 --> 00:57:42,965
like me, right?

735
00:57:48,901 --> 00:57:50,813
Did I misunderstand?

736
00:57:50,933 --> 00:57:52,187
No, you didn't.

737
00:57:53,116 --> 00:57:54,620
These kinds of words,

738
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,445
I've always longed for the day when you'd
officially say them to me of your own will.

739
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:02,620
<i>I already thought of an answer.</i>

740
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:06,700
But seeing you recently,

741
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,021
I started to question whether
I should believe you.

742
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:14,069
I don't know if my answer
is still the correct one.

743
00:58:19,844 --> 00:58:23,818
Don't make me continue to waver like this.

744
00:58:42,806 --> 00:58:44,923
Break up cleanly with her.

745
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:47,447
And then hold onto me.

746
00:58:54,651 --> 00:58:58,699
<i>If you keep putting it off,
I won't continue to wait for you.</i>

747
00:59:01,459 --> 00:59:04,708
Then your answer will be gone.

748
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:17,749
He even brought back meat.

749
00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:20,497
Seems like things went smoothly,
he didn't mess it up.

750
00:59:21,481 --> 00:59:23,227
Where did Dae Woong go?

751
00:59:26,512 --> 00:59:28,221
Ah, it'll definitely be delicious.

752
00:59:28,592 --> 00:59:30,263
No, I have to endure it.

753
00:59:30,383 --> 00:59:32,971
I have to wait to eat it together with
Dae Woong once he gets back.

754
00:59:34,661 --> 00:59:36,183
Where did he go?

755
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,600
I even called him and left a
message a while ago.

756
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,104
Did he not hear it?

757
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:17,033
<i>One new message.</i>

758
01:00:17,153 --> 01:00:18,497
<i>Dae Woong,</i>

759
01:00:18,617 --> 01:00:22,768
<i>that director was chasing me just
now, but I ran away from him.</i>

760
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,043
<i>Oh, also,</i>

761
01:00:26,488 --> 01:00:29,942
<i>I have an extremely important
thing to ask you today.</i>

762
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,994
<i>If I were to remain here forever,
would you be okay with it?</i>

763
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,448
<i>If you're okay with that,</i>

764
01:00:38,975 --> 01:00:42,038
<i>I have a method which will
allow me to stay here forever.</i>

765
01:00:43,624 --> 01:00:45,425
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

766
01:00:45,545 --> 01:00:48,210
<i>Dae Woong, come back quickly as
soon as you've bought the meat!</i>

767
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,507
Oh! It's Dae Woong's scent!

768
01:01:06,985 --> 01:01:08,229
Dae Woong!

769
01:01:15,154 --> 01:01:16,806
Why are you here?

770
01:01:16,926 --> 01:01:18,435
Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?

771
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:20,514
<i>It's Mi Ho.</i>

772
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:23,968
Mi Ho, I drank liquor.

773
01:01:25,504 --> 01:01:27,751
Ah, you really drank a lot.

774
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,985
The moon has risen already.

775
01:01:32,641 --> 01:01:34,832
Why don't you spread out all your tails?

776
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:36,522
Let's play hoy hoy, okay?

777
01:01:37,154 --> 01:01:38,175
Woong...

778
01:01:39,351 --> 01:01:40,985
Hoy hoy.

779
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,845
Hoy hoy.

780
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:50,888
Mi Ho.

781
01:01:52,243 --> 01:01:54,639
You remember the time you agreed
to be friends with me?

782
01:01:55,686 --> 01:01:57,098
Then,

783
01:01:58,472 --> 01:02:00,681
can you do me a favor?

784
01:02:01,016 --> 01:02:01,963
What favor?

785
01:02:03,963 --> 01:02:05,449
Mi Ho,

786
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,181
I'm begging you...

787
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:13,664
disappear, okay?

788
01:02:18,722 --> 01:02:20,541
I'm begging you, Mi Ho.

789
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,608
I really feel like I'm about to die.

790
01:02:27,723 --> 01:02:30,062
<i>So I'm begging you,</i>

791
01:02:31,325 --> 01:02:33,367
disappear from my sight.

792
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,561
Leave now.

793
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:01,474
Dae Woong...

794
01:03:04,452 --> 01:03:08,221
Actually, you have already fully recovered.

795
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:15,384
I won't let you suffer.

796
01:03:16,851 --> 01:03:18,188
I'm leaving.

797
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,223
Ah, my stomach hurts.

798
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:11,509
When did I get back?

799
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:13,663
Mi Ho!

800
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,613
Was it you who put me on the bed?

801
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:25,219
Mi Ho, where are you?

802
01:04:29,151 --> 01:04:30,321
Mi Ho!

803
01:04:45,844 --> 01:04:46,958
Mi Ho!

01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:17,504
<i>Dae Woong said that he's friends with me.</i>

812
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:20,921
<i>Looks like because I'm a gumiho,
he still doesn't like me.</i>

813
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:22,849
<i>Gu Mi Ho has finally left my side!</i>

814
01:05:22,969 --> 01:05:24,817
<i>This day has finally arrived.</i>

815
01:05:24,937 --> 01:05:27,714
Before she changes her mind and comes back,
I have to hide myself.

816
01:05:27,834 --> 01:05:29,364
<i>If you drink the contents in the red bottle,</i>

817
01:05:29,484 --> 01:05:31,963
It means that you've chosen to
become human and stay here.

818
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:33,542
<i>If you drink the contents
in the blue bottle,</i>

819
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:35,136
<i>You will return to the Three Gods Pavilion.</i>

820
01:05:35,256 --> 01:05:38,274
But why does it feel so empty?
Like I've lost something?

821
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:41,412
Apart from the bead, did she take
something else from my body?

822
01:05:41,532 --> 01:05:43,123
Do you feel sad?

823
01:05:43,243 --> 01:05:44,627
How could I be sad?

824
01:05:44,747 --> 01:05:45,927
Before I would have been happy to die.

825
01:05:46,047 --> 01:05:50,158
My friend, Gu Mi Ho,

826
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:53,760
<i>is a scary gumiho.</i>

827
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,392
Dae Woong won't ever come here again, right?

828
01:05:56,512 --> 01:05:59,604
Don't tell Cha Dae Woong that
you're going to become human.

829
01:05:59,724 --> 01:06:01,569
You're only taking in my bead
with the thought...

830
01:06:01,677 --> 01:06:03,751
of being together with me?

831
01:06:04,196 --> 01:06:06,453
A gumiho became human.

832
01:06:06,573 --> 01:06:07,843
<i>I was going crazy!</i>

833
01:06:07,963 --> 01:06:12,095
<i>Although I needed the bead, how
could I be Gu Mi Ho's boyfriend?</i>
