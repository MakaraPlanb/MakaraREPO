4
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:15,566
Then…

5
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:18,601
Open your eyes wide and look at me.

6
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,652
See how I am right now…

7
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,440
See how I feel right now…

8
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:49,368
I…

9
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,709
couldn’t stop.

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,761
Then you…

11
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:01,348
are still dying?

12
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:04,398
I will…

13
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:08,678
disappear.

14
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:16,807
There’s only one left?

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,040
The deaths...

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,590
haven't stopped?

17
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,538
I couldn’t stop it.

18
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:29,367
My desire to be human…

19
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:31,653
I couldn’t stop it.

20
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:52,656
It isn’t over yet.

21
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:54,428
Please…

22
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:56,862
Stop.

23
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,926
I won’t ask you...

24
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,990
to be with me at my final hour.

25
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:09,155
<i>I won’t ask you to watch
over the ending either.</i>

26
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:13,835
I’ll stay by Teacher
Dong Ju’s side…to the end.

27
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,501
Do you know how hard it was to cut you off?!

28
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:19,634
Why I sent you away?!

29
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,923
It’s not just because of love.

30
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:24,450
Even after we broke up,

31
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:28,072
my hopes of living as a
human never disappeared.

32
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:30,367
<i>If I had stayed by your side…</i>

33
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:34,360
I would have blamed you for making
such a dangerous choice,

34
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,424
and the half a life you have left…

35
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:40,182
I might have begged you to
give me the rest of it...

36
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:42,749
like a real monster.

37
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:49,499
If we can do it now, let’s do it.

38
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:54,658
Take it.

39
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:59,130
Kill you and stay alive?

40
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,726
That's…

41
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:05,078
treating me like a real monster!

42
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,112
I’m …

43
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,200
not going to be remain as a good memory,
nor a painful one.

44
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:22,297
<i>I’m going to disappear…
from your heart completely.</i>

45
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:25,407
I’m going to go to Teacher Dong Ju so…

46
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:27,291
<i>let me go.</i>

47
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:30,842
I can’t!

48
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:32,528
I won’t!

49
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,477
<i>Just be a monster.</i>

50
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,482
You’re a gumiho!

51
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:38,930
You’re a gumiho that eats people’s livers.

52
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:41,112
And I’m the person you bewitched,

53
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:43,814
who will give up his liver and heart.

54
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:46,535
<i>And his everything.</i>

55
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:49,531
<i>So if there is a way…</i>

56
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:52,714
Even if you have to rip it all out…

57
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,250
Take it.

58
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:58,304
Take it all!

59
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,122
You’re really a dumb human…

60
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:09,524
who's been bewitched by gumiho.

61
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:17,812
<i>Fine.</i>

62
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:20,028
<i>Let’s do that.</i>

63
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:22,804
I’ll come back to take it.

64
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:25,645
Wait for me.

65
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,114
Then…

66
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:31,088
you’ll die.

67
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:49,429
You came back.

68
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,509
I worried that you wouldn’t come back.

69
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:57,710
I need to ask a favor… from Teacher Dong Ju.

70
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:03,099
<i>I can’t let him die…</i>

71
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,240
<i>Please…kill me.</i>

72
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,427
What…favor?

73
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:16,489
I’m sorry, Teacher Dong Ju…

74
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,797
<i>I’m sorry….</i>

75
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,067
<i>I’m so sorry…</i>

76
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:26,863
I don’t want to…

77
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,390
hear those words ever again.

78
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:34,680
Please.

79
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:38,042
So you won’t disappear…

80
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:41,487
stop your desire.

81
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:47,007
I can’t stop my desire.

82
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:51,832
Nor can I become half-
human like Teacher Dong Ju.

83
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:54,948
Because inside me,

84
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:57,698
there is no more human chi.

85
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,323
There’s one more gumiho life left,

86
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:04,573
so I’m sure the human chi
is still there too.

87
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:06,210
No, it isn’t.

88
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,572
For a while…

89
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,413
I haven’t kept it inside my body.

90
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:16,905
What...

91
00:06:19,156 --> 00:06:21,565
does that mean?

92
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,941
The bead…

93
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,568
You took it out?!

94
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:41,450
Since when?

95
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:47,166
Since I left Dae Woong.

96
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,215
<i>This is half of Dae Woong’s life.</i>

97
00:06:57,723 --> 00:07:00,178
<i>I can’t become human,</i>

98
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,442
nor can I stay by his side so…

99
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:05,323
I can’t let this get hurt.

100
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:09,171
From…

101
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,815
the moment you came to my side,

102
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,114
you had already given up?

103
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:20,719
This is it.

104
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:23,470
This is all I can do to protect Dae Woong.

105
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,738
This…

106
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,130
<i>needs to go back to Dae Woong…</i>

107
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:33,938
Help me.

108
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,928
Cha Dae Woong will not take this back,

109
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,323
and lose the last chance
you have to survive.

110
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:44,936
There’s no way.

111
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:52,821
So… Teacher Dong Ju must let me go.

112
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:58,259
And…

113
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,892
help me with what I want.

114
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:10,077
Dae Woong can't refuse.

115
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,986
To make him take it back,

116
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:16,119
lie for me.

117
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:34,306
Lie?

118
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:46,281
Mi Ho said she would come.

119
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:48,589
But you came?

120
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,831
This is the last chance to keep her alive.

121
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:53,970
<i>In this bead,</i>

122
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:56,497
<i>half your life is contained.</i>

123
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,293
The rest of it…

124
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:02,353
fill it up.

125
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:14,141
Until the last moment,

126
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,495
if you keep the bead to the end
and die for her,

127
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:22,452
the bead will absorb the rest
of your chi.

128
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,866
Are you the one…

129
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,039
who will kill me?

130
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:37,011
And after that…if you give this to Mi Ho,

131
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:40,905
then will Mi Ho live?

132
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:43,731
Yes. She might…

133
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,558
be able to become human.

134
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:51,266
<i>I'll understand if you refuse.</i>

135
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,530
<i>Because you’re human.</i>

136
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:55,959
If you say you can’t-

137
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:17,211
Protect Mi Ho well.

138
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,171
And on the 100th day,

139
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,939
come alone.

140
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:28,665
Taking out the bead and giving it to Mi Ho…

141
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,080
I believe you’ll do it well.

142
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:55,791
He did not hesitate,

143
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:59,001
nor refuse.

144
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:07,927
You said my love was a fantasy, didn't you?

145
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:10,717
Teacher Dong Ju was wrong.

146
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:12,497
It’s real.

147
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:17,435
You’re right. You were right.

148
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:19,513
When Dae Woong’s like that…

149
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:22,566
how could I be by his side?

150
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,615
I don’t even hope for that much.

151
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:29,545
I’m really okay now.

152
00:11:33,305 --> 00:11:35,604
Teacher Dong Ju,

153
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,405
let’s go far away,

154
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:41,346
and never come back.

155
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,088
Promise me.

156
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:47,624
<i>Even after I disappear,</i>

157
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:51,442
until Dae Woong

158
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,617
lives his whole life…

159
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:58,353
don’t ever show up
in front of Dae Woong again.

160
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:20,151
You don’t look too good.

161
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,565
<i>It’s an important scene today.</i>

162
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,073
Will you be okay?

163
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:25,065
Yeah.

164
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,389
Once I finish this scene…

165
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,478
we’re done filming right?

166
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:37,771
That’s good.

167
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:39,687
At least I was able to finish this.

168
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:43,879
Exactly! Forget everything
and just work hard.

169
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,861
If today’s scene comes out well,
you’ll become huge.

170
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:48,106
The lines looked really long.

171
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:49,808
Have you memorized them?

172
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,336
Yeah.

173
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:54,066
I remember it all.

174
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:15,845
At first, when your tears
drenched my clothes,

175
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:21,893
I thought I should just wait
and let them dry.

176
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:28,138
<i>But those tears became
bigger clouds and wind,</i>

177
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:33,588
<i>and are falling as a rain
that stops my feet.</i>

178
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,678
<i>While getting drenched by the rain
that can’t be stopped or avoided,</i>

179
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:43,985
<i>where am I supposed to go?</i>

180
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:46,063
<i>I lost my way.</i>

181
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:50,082
<i>Even though I want to run far away,</i>

182
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,722
you stay on my mind, and I keep coming back.

183
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:55,912
I want to protect you,

184
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,706
and I want to treat you well.

185
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:05,453
This is good.

186
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:09,183
While you were by my side,

187
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:12,689
I couldn’t treat you well…

188
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,711
but I’m able to protect you.

189
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:18,096
You’re late.

190
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:21,007
It’s time, let’s go.

191
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:23,941
Is this really...

192
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:27,089
the path you want to take?

193
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,772
This is what I want.

194
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:33,711
In the past,

195
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:38,259
I believed doing what the
other person wanted was love.

196
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:42,241
And after doing it for her,

197
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:45,904
I regretted it for a thousand years.

198
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:51,548
I tried not to make the same mistake twice,

199
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,055
but once again…

200
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:00,334
I have to do what you want.

201
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:07,079
I’ll do what you really
want to do in your heart.

202
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,957
This is it.

203
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,874
This is all I can do to protect you.

204
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:28,203
Because I

205
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:31,780
am not someone

206
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,336
whose death could save you.

207
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:42,391
And so,

208
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,652
I did what I can do.

209
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:51,090
I told Cha Dae Woong…

210
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:55,154
that it was a lie.

211
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:07,960
It was a lie?

212
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,389
I was ready to die for her and…

213
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:17,250
there’s absolutely no way to save her?

214
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,936
Why are you always

215
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:33,649
showing Dae Woong the things
I try to hide from him?

216
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,989
Why?!

217
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,309
I had no choice.

218
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:41,329
I mocked you, calling your love a fantasy.

219
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:44,202
And then I saw it was real.

220
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:48,538
Do you really believe…that it’s real?

221
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:51,734
Lying, saying it’s not real…

222
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,871
I couldn’t do that anymore.

223
00:17:57,248 --> 00:18:00,013
I already told Cha Dae Woong

224
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:07,013
the truth.. that we can’t
stop your death, and hurt him.

225
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:14,316
Since you can’t hide it anymore,

226
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:19,045
you can stop now.

227
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,215
Teacher Dong Ju...

228
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:24,268
You’re so cold.

229
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:26,787
You’re so mean.

230
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:30,145
<i>You’re so mean but…</i>

231
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,173
Thank you.

232
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:50,752
I’ll be the only one leaving.

233
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,412
You…

234
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:54,923
should stay by his side.

235
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:59,761
<i>The person that should
protect your last moment…</i>

236
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:05,949
is him.

237
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:23,504
Go.

238
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:56,620
You are really…

239
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:59,832
a mean gumiho.

240
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,687
You bewitch someone,

241
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:05,197
make him give up all his chi and soul…

242
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:08,357
and now you’re ripping my heart apart,

243
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:11,574
making me hurt.

244
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:14,925
You’re a really scary gumiho.

245
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:16,943
I’m sorry.

246
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,153
But still,

247
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,639
even though it’s...

248
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,259
scary and painful for you…

249
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,046
Can I…

250
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:29,360
keep staying by your side?

251
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,910
<i>Right here…</i>

252
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:58,552
was the gumiho who wanted to find a
husband and live in the human world.

253
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:02,568
But because of the rumor that she
eats the liver of the people she sees,

254
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:06,869
she was engulfed in pain and
sadness. This is that gumiho’s seat.

255
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,422
Looking at the gumiho’s
picture that disappeared…

256
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:12,123
does that mean she really
went to find a husband?

257
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:13,783
I don’t know…

258
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:16,841
If the Three Gods Grandmother Made a
promise that if she finds a husband,

259
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:21,405
<i>she’ll be allowed to live in
the human world, then maybe…</i>

260
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,091
However,

261
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,593
if someone becomes the gumiho’s husband,

262
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:27,946
they say she’ll eat his liver!

263
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:31,738
If that happens, it’s the same
thing as throwing your life away…

264
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,888
Would she be able to find
a husband like that?

265
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:38,790
If gumiho was able to find a
husband who’ll give up his life,

266
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,265
then the Three Gods Grandmother
would keep her promise too, right?

267
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,571
<i>Of course!</i>

268
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:44,386
<i>The Three Gods Grandmother said</i>

269
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:50,387
if she finds a husband, then she’ll
be allowed to live in the human world!

270
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:53,856
<i>Then later if she says “I never said that!”</i>

271
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:56,940
<i>Well…that can’t happen right?</i>

272
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:58,692
That’s true!

273
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:06,571
Well… a promise is a promise
so I guess I have to keep it.

274
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:09,640
I don’t feel good about this.

275
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,689
I guess I should leave now.

276
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,250
Let’s stop talking about a
gumiho who’s not even here,

277
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,465
since it’s so heartbreaking.

278
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:23,088
Let’s have a look upstairs.

279
00:22:23,356 --> 00:22:25,114
Let’s go.

280
00:22:26,117 --> 00:22:28,812
But, the grandmother that was just here,

281
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:31,152
isn’t she a part of the temple as well?

282
00:22:31,153 --> 00:22:32,199
No.

283
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,424
Wait…didn’t she come with you?

284
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:37,135
No.

285
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:39,053
Who is she?

286
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,925
I don’t know.

287
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,985
Well…you know, a lot of
people come to our temple so…

288
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:01,095
<i>I’m sorry.</i>

289
00:23:01,954 --> 00:23:03,696
Thank you.

290
00:23:14,823 --> 00:23:16,474
Are you okay?

291
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:18,190
I’m sorry.

292
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:24,181
Thank you.

293
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:32,907
Thank you or sorry…

294
00:23:32,923 --> 00:23:36,188
Which one do you think is better?

295
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,422
“Thank you”...

296
00:23:50,192 --> 00:23:52,718
would be better.

297
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:55,652
Is that so?

298
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:58,891
Then you’ll be fine.

299
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:16,124
Yeah…really!

300
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:26,721
Right now…

301
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:30,056
the fact that you’re by my side…

302
00:24:30,774 --> 00:24:32,930
is the happiest thing.

303
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:35,559
Right now…

304
00:24:35,637 --> 00:24:37,885
the fact that you’re by my side…

305
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:40,281
is the happiest thing.

306
00:24:55,248 --> 00:24:56,608
I’m good at stuff like this.

307
00:24:56,709 --> 00:25:01,106
Wah! My Mi Ho’s got some
amazing knife skills!

308
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:03,282
Wah!

309
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:08,080
Ahhh!

310
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:10,117
Ahhh!

311
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:13,845
Mmm…. Yummy!

312
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,877
Yummmy!

313
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:17,489
Mi Ho! Eat some of this too….

314
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,742
Ah! I really don’t like this…

315
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:22,503
Koreans equal kimchi!

316
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,281
Just try it.

317
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:26,594
Then, if I eat this…

318
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:29,037
give me a kiss here.

319
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:33,031
Why, you little…manipulating me over food.

320
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:34,836
<i>I…</i>

321
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:36,795
am going to do it here.

322
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:37,719
Yay!

323
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,780
Then I’m going to eat this and this
…all of it!

324
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,102
- Wah!
- Wah!

325
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:48,777
Wow! This perfectly suits my aunt’s taste.

326
00:25:48,878 --> 00:25:50,667
We picked a perfect present!

327
00:25:50,768 --> 00:25:55,583
But it doesn’t seem to
match the director does it?

328
00:25:56,647 --> 00:26:00,301
A man… should match his taste to his wife's.

329
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:01,424
This is good.

330
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:02,772
I like it too.

331
00:26:02,873 --> 00:26:06,197
The teacup is a cow color
so I like it even more.

332
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:09,274
We should’ve bought one too, huh?

333
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,547
Maybe we should’ve…

334
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:19,592
This seems like it’ll break easily.

335
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:23,038
We should buy one that doesn’t break.

336
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,103
Yeah.

337
00:26:26,204 --> 00:26:28,022
Let’s buy one that doesn’t break.

338
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:32,145
One that never breaks.

339
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:34,093
Congratulations!

340
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:35,664
- Thanks.
- This is our Dae Woong.

341
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:38,265
- Oh! Congratulation
- Yes..

342
00:26:42,974 --> 00:26:44,687
<i>Congratulations!
Congratulations!</i>

343
00:26:44,788 --> 00:26:47,088
Oh my... Thank you, thank you

344
00:26:47,185 --> 00:26:48,401
Dae Woong!

345
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:50,155
Thanks for coming!

346
00:26:50,257 --> 00:26:51,646
Go in first.

347
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:54,092
Oh!

348
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:56,136
Don’t I look…

349
00:26:56,237 --> 00:26:59,604
too old to be a bride?

350
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:00,915
You’re really pretty!

351
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:02,714
You’re a fashionista!

352
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,724
Yeah?

353
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,711
Oh! I’m so nervous!

354
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:12,633
I haven’t eaten all day
and now my legs are shaking!

355
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:18,221
- Drink some of this.
- Ok.

356
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:22,760
Don’t you have to eat?

357
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:25,187
This is fine.

358
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:29,057
When I get nervous, I get indigestion.

359
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:32,156
I cannot fart in the wedding hall!

360
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:36,117
I’ll go bring something
that won’t make you fart.

361
00:27:44,237 --> 00:27:45,346
Director.

362
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,281
One moment.

363
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:49,082
Just a moment.

364
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:55,088
I’ll hold onto the sunglasses and the coat.

365
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,835
Look into my eyes.

366
00:27:58,936 --> 00:28:00,322
Am I…

367
00:28:00,423 --> 00:28:02,721
shaking in front of everyone?

368
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:07,146
Yes. You’re shaking…Uncle.

369
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:10,095
I’m not the kind of person
who shakes in front of others.

370
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,142
It’s not my first wedding either.

371
00:28:12,243 --> 00:28:14,010
You have to think about

372
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:17,262
my aunt who’s marrying for
the first time, and be strong.

373
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:20,482
You’re right, Nephew.

374
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:26,497
Let’s gather our strength
together and make an active family.

375
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:43,824
<i>The groom is entering.</i>

376
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:04,729
<i>The bride is entering.</i>

377
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:55,807
Oh!

378
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,936
Is our Gae Lan* okay?
[*Egg]

379
00:30:02,454 --> 00:30:06,571
It’s okay! Our Gae Lan is okay.

380
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:08,163
Min Sook?

381
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,510
Is there a Gae Lan* in your stomach?

382
00:30:11,691 --> 00:30:13,634
<i>There is!</i>

383
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:18,927
My grandson! Gae Lan!

384
00:30:20,424 --> 00:30:22,361
My brother?!

385
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:23,790
Gae Lan?!

386
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:25,260
G…Gae Lan?

387
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:27,287
You’re totally ewww, Dad!

388
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:29,488
You little...

389
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:32,356
Good job, Min Sook!

390
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,870
<i>Good job! Good job!</i>

391
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:38,166
Ban son-in-law!

392
00:30:39,593 --> 00:30:41,770
Ban son-in-law!

393
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:47,834
Hooray! Hooray!

394
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:50,175
Hooray!

395
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:57,167
<i>Ok, we’ll take the family picture.</i>

396
00:30:57,226 --> 00:30:58,307
<i>- Family members, look towards the camera.
- Come here.</i>

397
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:01,372
<i>Nephew…look this way please.</i>

398
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:03,467
<i>Ok thank you!
Here we go.</i>

399
00:31:03,568 --> 00:31:05,471
<i>One…two…</i>

400
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:18,694
Wow.

401
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:21,170
500 years ago I also…

402
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:24,124
dressed like that and waited for a husband.

403
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,344
What are you doing?

404
00:31:39,403 --> 00:31:41,201
Are you done taking pictures?

405
00:31:41,302 --> 00:31:42,797
Yeah.

406
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:46,556
You...

407
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,807
were watching that?

408
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,610
Just 'cause I was remembering old times.

409
00:31:51,831 --> 00:31:53,313
A long time ago,

410
00:31:53,314 --> 00:31:56,178
I was told that if I found a husband,
I could live in the human world.

411
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,963
So I dressed like that and
waited for a husband.

412
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,491
Why?

413
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:04,827
Are you sad you weren’t able
to find a man 500 years ago?

414
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:06,660
If I'd found a husband back then,

415
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:08,891
I wouldn’t have been locked in the picture,

416
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:11,986
and I wouldn’t have come
back out and met you.

417
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:14,261
I’m not sad at all.

418
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,282
You,

419
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:22,523
said you really wanted to do that, right?

420
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:27,632
Let’s go.

421
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:37,725
<i>Ok, I’m going to take the picture.
Both of you, smile!</i>

422
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:41,601
You’re much prettier than the bride
and groom that got married today.

423
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:44,456
<i>Ok, here we go!</i>

424
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:46,264
<i>One…two…</i>

425
00:32:57,301 --> 00:33:00,930
After 500 years,

426
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:03,984
I was able to get a real husband!

427
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:06,344
He’s so handsome,

428
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:09,497
And he likes me so, so, so,
so, so, so, so, so, so, so much.

429
00:33:09,598 --> 00:33:12,718
He was willing to give me everything.

430
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:15,890
I found a husband like that.

431
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:40,643
Today is…

432
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,272
the last day.

433
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,996
Don’t ever count the minutes.

434
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:54,071
Don’t cry.

435
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:57,862
Smile.

436
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,195
And watch her to the end.

437
00:34:30,138 --> 00:34:31,283
Mi Ho!

438
00:34:31,384 --> 00:34:33,243
Should we go on a date?

439
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:35,407
Is there anywhere you want to go?

440
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:36,855
Woong…

441
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:39,984
You haven't slept the entire week.

442
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:41,924
Aren’t you tired?

443
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:43,984
I’m fine!

444
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:45,389
I’m…

445
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,968
not sleepy at all!

446
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:49,444
I even washed my face!

447
00:34:49,507 --> 00:34:51,973
Woong, come here.

448
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,609
Wow! So handsome!

449
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:15,078
You’re really handsome!

450
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:19,411
You’re so, so, so, so, so,
so, so, so, so handsome!

451
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:27,330
Woong, I’m sorry…

452
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:31,718
but even if you’re sleepy, endure it.

453
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:35,276
And stay with me like this till the end.

454
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:39,471
Yeah…

455
00:35:40,732 --> 00:35:45,325
I can even challenge the
Guinness World record!

456
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:47,521
I’m not sleepy at all!

457
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:48,680
What’s Guinness?

458
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:50,590
Mmm…

459
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:54,641
It’s the number one best thing.

460
00:35:54,731 --> 00:35:56,174
Yeah?

461
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,153
To me, you’re

462
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:01,301
like Guinness, the number 1 best!

463
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:06,189
What should we do?

464
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:09,839
We need to go to the best place.

465
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:11,317
Should we…

466
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:12,984
go see a movie,

467
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:14,952
like we did on our first date?

468
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:16,896
Should we?

469
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:20,891
Byung Soo gave me a lot of tickets,
we’ll be able to watch anything.

470
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,590
Hold on.

471
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:37,726
Umm…this is tomorrow…

472
00:36:40,016 --> 00:36:42,546
This one’s for next week.

473
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:47,330
This is tomorrow, too.

474
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:49,481
It’s be nice if it was today.

475
00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:55,320
Spending time in a movie theater…

476
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:57,557
It’s wasting time!

477
00:36:57,627 --> 00:36:59,903
Yeah! It’s wasting time!

478
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:03,999
Then… should we go say “hi”
to the chicken ahjumma?

479
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,727
You want to? She is your be-pu*!
[*BF; best friend]

480
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,531
Aigoo, what should we do?

481
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:17,009
I came to the countryside today
with my friend.

482
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,728
I’ll go back to Seoul tomorrow,
I’ll see you then.

483
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:22,508
Oh…okay ahjumma.

484
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:29,213
The chicken ahjumma says
she’ll be back tomorrow.

485
00:37:30,011 --> 00:37:33,694
Woong, you go instead of me.

486
00:37:33,714 --> 00:37:36,584
And say hello to her for me next time.

487
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:41,121
Mmm…

488
00:37:42,758 --> 00:37:45,446
Then what should we do?

489
00:37:47,038 --> 00:37:50,492
Should we go to my house and eat?

490
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:54,251
Auntie and Uncle will be back tomorrow.

491
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:59,323
And Grandpa went to a
friend’s house until tomorrow.

492
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:03,609
Oh yeah…

493
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:05,761
Why is everyone...

494
00:38:05,835 --> 00:38:07,268
gone until tomorrow?

495
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,478
Yeah.

496
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:13,370
There is… no tomorrow.

497
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:24,039
Let’s go out.

498
00:38:25,008 --> 00:38:26,801
<i>Today…</i>

499
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:30,164
There’s still a lot of time left.

500
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:33,363
Oh yeah! The water
fountain we saw last time…

501
00:38:33,464 --> 00:38:35,148
You really liked it, right?

502
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:36,576
<i>Should we go see that?</i>

503
00:38:36,677 --> 00:38:40,566
Even if we watch it during the day,
it’ll be cool.

504
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:44,601
Yeah! It sounds cool! It’ll be amazing!

505
00:38:54,075 --> 00:38:56,615
We’re doing repairs today so
the water’s not coming out.

506
00:38:56,716 --> 00:39:00,111
It’ll be all fixed tomorrow
so come back tomorrow.

507
00:39:00,345 --> 00:39:02,743
<i>Wait a sec…where did I put it?</i>

508
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:06,019
Woong, let’s go.

509
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:10,478
We can’t tomorrow.

510
00:39:10,513 --> 00:39:12,898
If it’s not today…

511
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:15,488
we can’t!

512
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:17,380
Woong, it’s okay.

513
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:20,361
It’s okay if I don’t see it.

514
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:55,407
Mi Ho…

515
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:00,135
Let’s go.

516
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:20,260
<i>Wow! It’s amazing!</i>

517
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:24,271
Like the fountain last time,
the fire shoots out!

518
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:28,605
Compared to that stupid water fountain,

519
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:29,882
This is much better.

520
00:40:29,983 --> 00:40:32,038
Yeah! It’s much better!

521
00:40:32,113 --> 00:40:35,230
And, you don’t like water.

522
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:37,548
I don’t like water!

523
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:40,969
That one,

524
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:43,259
<i>is going up like the shape of your tails.</i>

525
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,124
Woong! I’m so happy, I think
my tail is going to pop out!

526
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:50,507
- Really?
- Yeah!

527
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:52,438
Even though I only have one,

528
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:55,185
it feels like it’s going to
pop out like this!

529
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:56,965
Should we light

530
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:57,957
one more?

531
00:40:58,058 --> 00:40:59,492
Yeah!
Again!

532
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:01,657
Again! Again! Again! Again! Again!

533
00:41:06,158 --> 00:41:07,758
Here.

534
00:41:17,446 --> 00:41:19,192
Wow…

535
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:32,025
In here…

536
00:41:32,434 --> 00:41:35,386
when I first saw your tails…

537
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:39,275
I was really scared.

538
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:41,208
Yeah.

539
00:41:41,748 --> 00:41:43,724
This is where,

540
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,929
you first saw me, really saw me…

541
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,134
So let’s stay here.

542
00:41:49,682 --> 00:41:51,042
This place is good.

543
00:41:51,143 --> 00:41:53,031
Ok.

544
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:54,678
Let’s stay here.

545
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,382
At first,

546
00:41:56,483 --> 00:41:59,034
was I really that scary?

547
00:41:59,037 --> 00:42:00,433
Yeah.

548
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,126
You were really scary.

549
00:42:07,457 --> 00:42:10,602
But compared to back then,

550
00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:14,731

I told you to use a gumiho!

697
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:01,665

how much the C.G. would be?!

a cell phone chain.

702
00:54:17,779 --> 00:54:20,794

00:56:14,598 --> 00:56:16,603
I’m trying it.

731
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,472
Are you…

732
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:22,144
still waiting for her?

733
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,560
Of course.

734
00:56:28,998 --> 00:56:32,069
She still hasn’t disappeared.

735
00:56:33,442 --> 00:56:38,861
Ah! Soon, there’s going to be
a solar eclipse.

736
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:41,166
Oh really?

737
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,984
Normally, the moon and
the sun can never meet.

738
00:56:45,012 --> 00:56:46,757
But against the odds,

739
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:49,404
the moon and the sun overlap
each other and become one.

740
00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:51,849
That is a solar eclipse.

741
00:56:54,132 --> 00:56:57,492
When the heavens lose their mind,

742
00:56:57,508 --> 00:57:01,338
a crazy time will come… soon.

743
00:57:02,227 --> 00:57:07,079
A time when the heavens… go crazy?

744
00:57:07,503 --> 00:57:11,224
If you wait a little bit, it’ll come soon.

745
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,547
It’s starting.

746
00:57:23,576 --> 00:57:24,690
The moon is...

747
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:27,416
covering the sun.

748
00:57:41,328 --> 00:57:45,730
When the heavens… lose their mind.

749
00:57:59,632 --> 00:58:01,521
Who’s this?

750
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:03,885
<i>Oh?</i>

751
00:58:03,986 --> 00:58:06,376
This isn’t mine.

752
00:58:06,436 --> 00:58:08,455
This is…

753
00:58:08,545 --> 00:58:10,566
Mi Ho’s!

754
00:58:12,148 --> 00:58:15,487
There’s no reason for this phone to ring.

755
00:58:16,642 --> 00:58:18,911
Has it gone crazy?

756
00:58:24,476 --> 00:58:26,198
Hello?

757
00:58:28,702 --> 00:58:30,273
Hello?

758
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:33,165
<i>It’s me.</i>

759
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:36,027
<i>It’s me, Dae Woong.</i>

760
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,356
Is it really you?

761
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:43,635
Is it really...

762
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:45,755
you, Mi Ho?

763
00:58:45,819 --> 00:58:48,380
<i>Yes. It’s me.</i>

764
00:58:50,324 --> 00:58:51,754
Where…

765
00:58:51,855 --> 00:58:53,692
are you right now?

766
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:56,745
<i>I’m watching you, right now.</i>

767
00:59:04,218 --> 00:59:05,446
Where are you?

768
00:59:05,547 --> 00:59:06,864
Where are you?

769
00:59:07,065 --> 00:59:08,920
<i>Are you looking for me?</i>

770
00:59:09,121 --> 00:59:12,120
<i>You won’t be able to see me yet…</i>

771
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:14,229
Where are you?!

772
00:59:14,393 --> 00:59:16,862
<i>So close…</i>

773
00:59:26,185 --> 00:59:27,281
Mi Ho!

774
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:29,361
Where are you?

775
00:59:29,562 --> 00:59:30,933
Come out! Please!

776
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,560
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

777
00:59:32,832 --> 00:59:34,495
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

778
00:59:36,275 --> 00:59:38,393
Where the hell are you?!

779
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:40,839
<i>By your side.</i>

780
00:59:40,928 --> 00:59:42,785
<i>I’m…</i>

781
00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:45,352
<i>right by your side.</i>

782
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:02,014
The solar eclipse...

783
01:00:02,136 --> 01:00:04,213
has ended.

784
01:00:28,231 --> 01:00:30,574
What the hell?

785
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:33,838
She didn’t come back?

786
01:00:36,865 --> 01:00:39,005
Mi Ho…

787
01:00:41,535 --> 01:00:43,673
You said the heavens went crazy!

788
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:47,020
Then shouldn’t Mi Ho come back to me?!

789
01:00:47,371 --> 01:00:50,008
Was it a joke?

790
01:00:51,156 --> 01:00:53,760
It’s not fair…

791
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,832
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

792
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,988
Woong!

793
01:01:39,578 --> 01:01:40,787
You...

794
01:01:40,888 --> 01:01:43,352
became even more handsome.

795
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:46,859
You...

796
01:01:46,942 --> 01:01:49,720
really have a lot of fears!

797
01:01:49,816 --> 01:01:52,187
You thought I
disappeared with the moon?

798
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:54,073
Are you…

799
01:01:55,419 --> 01:01:57,495
real?

800
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,980
You’re real.

801
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,831
Then are you…

802
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,261
a ghost now?

803
01:02:18,362 --> 01:02:20,188
I’m not a ghost.

804
01:02:20,264 --> 01:02:22,648
Right now, I’m…

805
01:02:26,929 --> 01:02:28,985
It doesn’t matter,

806
01:02:29,021 --> 01:02:33,423
whether you’re a ghost,
or a gumiho, or a human…

807
01:02:33,815 --> 01:02:36,145
It doesn’t matter.

808
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:37,658
As long as,

809
01:02:37,759 --> 01:02:40,357
you’re in front of me,
it’s fine.

810
01:02:40,475 --> 01:02:43,069
As long as you’re back,

811
01:02:43,957 --> 01:02:46,207
that’s enough.

812
01:03:06,836 --> 01:03:08,218
Woong

813
01:03:08,387 --> 01:03:11,417
Sorry for making you wait so long.

814
01:03:11,597 --> 01:03:12,693
No…

815
01:03:12,794 --> 01:03:17,510
I thought I would have to
wait at least 50 years for you.

816
01:03:19,181 --> 01:03:22,137
Mi Ho, thank you.

817
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:24,651
For coming back like this…

818
01:03:24,982 --> 01:03:26,699
thank you so much.

819
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,868
Woong,

820
01:03:27,969 --> 01:03:31,879
Aren’t you curious whether
I’m a gumiho or a human?

821
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,492
I told you it doesn’t matter.

822
01:03:33,593 --> 01:03:34,920
It’s okay!

823
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:36,215
Really?

824
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,519
Even if I still have all nine tails,

825
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,934
it’s really ok?

826
01:03:41,682 --> 01:03:44,053
It’s okay but…

827
01:03:44,323 --> 01:03:46,476
I am curious.

828
01:03:46,577 --> 01:03:48,285
Yeah?

829
01:03:48,307 --> 01:03:49,578
Then, since the moon’s up

830
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:51,196
should we do “Hoy! Hoy!” and

831
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:53,428
check if the tails are there or not?

832
01:03:53,944 --> 01:03:55,767
Should we?

833
01:04:03,124 --> 01:04:06,126
I’m pretty nervous!

834
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,352
Even if all nine tails pop up,

835
01:04:11,453 --> 01:04:13,131
I won’t get scared.

836
01:04:13,132 --> 01:04:15,074
You sure?

837
01:04:18,745 --> 01:04:19,610
Hoy!

838
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:21,165
Hoy!

839
01:04:21,266 --> 01:04:25,534
Oh! You don’t have tails anymore!

840
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:28,535
You’ve become a human!

841
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:33,093
What the…You hated me
being a gumiho, huh?

842
01:04:34,987 --> 01:04:38,663
Honestly, right now I’ve
become pretty popular so

843
01:04:38,766 --> 01:04:40,536
maintaining a gumiho girlfriend

844
01:04:40,537 --> 01:04:42,057
would be kind of overwhelming.

845
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:44,563
<i>Oh no! Then what do we do?</i>

846
01:04:44,664 --> 01:04:45,913
<i>We’re in trouble!</i>

847
01:04:46,014 --> 01:04:47,229
<i>Why?</i>

848
01:04:48,548 --> 01:04:50,238
Honestly,

849
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:53,172
I still have one tail left!

850
01:04:53,462 --> 01:04:55,475
What?!

to my child?

863
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:42,867
<i>Are laws created before humans?
Just follow the laws no matter what?</i>

864
01:05:43,168 --> 01:05:45,068
Follow them and what? Die?

866

<i>citizens that the nation will not protect.</i>

869
01:05:56,773 --> 01:06:00,073
That's the reason I became President.
