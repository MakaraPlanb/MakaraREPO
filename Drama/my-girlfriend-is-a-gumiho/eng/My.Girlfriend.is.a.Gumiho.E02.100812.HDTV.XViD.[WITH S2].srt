<i>Cha Dae Woong! Live locked up
until you become a real person!</i>

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,896
<i>There's something you need to do.</i>

5
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:13,545
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

6
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,787
<i>Draw tails on that fox, nine of them.</i>

7
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:17,397
<i>Nine?</i>

8
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:23,908
The fox is gone!

9
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:31,157
<i>You drew the tails, so I won't let you die.</i>

10
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:32,313
<i>Ghost, I shun thee!</i>

11
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:33,905
<i>I'm a gumiho.</i>

12
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:36,009
You're following me around
because you're crazy, right?

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,288
I didn't lie.

14
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:41,423
I'm going to leave, so try smelling me out.

15
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,659
And take the bead or whatever back out!

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,709
Then I'll believe you.

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,514
Then I'll follow you.

18
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:48,346
I'll follow you and make you believe.

19
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:52,197
Then you're dead.

20
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,511
Episode 2

21
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:03,918
She came.

22
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:06,804
She really came.

23
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:13,172
You really found me.

24
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:17,454
I told you I could find you.

25
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:20,246
It was a bit difficult.

26
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:32,139
You're pretty awesome.

27
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:35,867
I told you I'm a gumiho.

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,085
The moon is about to come out.

29
00:01:45,123 --> 00:01:47,009
I told you I'd show you
when the moon comes out.

30
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,274
Moon?

31
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:28,679
You really have nine tails.

32
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:30,468
Because I'm a gumiho.

33
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:34,370
Now give me my bead back.

34
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:11,477
You were alive thanks to my bead.

35
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:14,682
Now you're going to die.

36
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:42,261
I saved you, but you abandoned me, so..

37
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:44,407
I don't know you either.

38
00:03:51,408 --> 00:04:00,708
<i>~ I keep being haunted by you
so I can't just leave ~</i>

39
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:06,509
<i>~ My heart hurts so much ~</i>

40
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,710
<i>~ because of this impossible love ~</i>

41
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:40,812
<i>~ The day when my pain is buried away
When will that day come to me ~</i>

42
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:46,637
You came back once, so
I came back once too.

43
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:54,315
<i>~ What are you saying I should do
with my pathetic and foolish self ~</i>

44
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,083
He still thinks he can run away.

45
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:36,008
If I want to keep him by my side,

46
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:38,846
I'll need to scare him a bit.

47
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:45,643
You think I can't see you
if you hide over there?

48
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:46,851
I'm a gumiho.

49
00:05:46,986 --> 00:05:49,133
I need to get out of here.

50
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,288
That's it.

51
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:46,733
Should I help you?

52
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,034
I almost made it.

53
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:51,579
I almost made it.

54
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,480
What should I do?

55
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:34,027
Ah, it's hot!

56
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:51,739
Why'd it stop?

57
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:53,148
You can't stop here.

58
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:54,793
Go! Go!

59
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:55,890
See.

60
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:57,670
There's no point running away.

61
00:07:57,793 --> 00:08:01,826
I didn't take a single step
but you're right above me.

62
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,138
Move! Move!

63
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,495
How nice.

64
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:07,417
I can just keep my mouth open and catch you.

65
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:10,233
You can't! No!

66
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,993
My phone.

67
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:18,098
Yes, I have my phone!

68
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,731
<i>It's Grandfather.</i>

69
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:23,814
Yes, I have to tell Grandfather to save me.

70
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:26,253
No!

71
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:27,722
Hello?

72
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:28,849
Cha Dae Woong?

73
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,084
<i>Cha Dae Woong?</i>

74
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:32,009
<i>Ah, Cha Dae Woong!</i>

75
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:35,219
<i>Ah, why aren't you talking?</i>

76
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,624
It's looking for Cha Dae Woong.

77
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,925
Huh?

78
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:40,676
Who are you?

79
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,409
Why are you picking up Dae Woong's phone?

80
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:45,653
<i>- Where's Dae Woong?
- Dae Woong?</i>

81
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:50,925
Dae Woong, what are you doing?

82
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:53,866
Dae Woong is on top of me.

83
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,167
Huh?

84
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:58,168
Aigoo...

85
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:59,917
Father.

86
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:01,957
What did Dae Woong say he's doing?

87
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:03,958
- Oh...
- Oh, oh my...

88
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:06,398
Father, what's wrong?

89
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:13,483
I must have lived too long.

90
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:15,739
<i>Stop and come down.</i>

91
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:16,845
<i>No!</i>

92
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:20,822
I'd rather hang here and die
than fall and get eaten by you.

93
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:24,463
If you don't come down, should I go up?

94
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,495
I'm a gumiho.

95
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,780
I'll pick you and eat you!

96
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,369
What am I, an apple?
For you to pick me and eat me?

97
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,270
Fine.

98
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:48,646
I acknowledge that you're a gumiho.

99
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,588
You picked me, so... eat me.

100
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,602
I can really eat you up?

101
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,913
As you eat me, remember this...

102
00:09:56,985 --> 00:10:00,412
Because there are gumiho in the world,
there should be ghosts too.

103
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:03,883
<i>I may die at your hands a human, but...</i>

104
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:08,984
I'll come back a spiteful ghost
and get my revenge.

105
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,916
Why do you keep telling me to
eat you up and not to spare you?

106
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:18,475
I don't want to beg to someone like you!

107
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,185
Really?

108
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,951
I was going to spare you if you asked.

109
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:27,053
Spare me.

110
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:29,731
Please.

111
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:34,651
<i>2380, 3380, 4380.</i>

112
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:37,227
They all said he was looking for his aunt.

113
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:40,587
Then... 5380?

114
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:44,220
<i>Will this be the aunt?</i>

115
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,108
<i>Hello?</i>

116
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:48,094
Aunt?

117
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:49,632
Is this Dae Woong?

118
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,347
Dae Woong, where are you?

119
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:54,509
Auntie, this is Dae Woong's friend.

120
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:57,759
Dae Woong's friend?

121
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,671
I can't get in touch with him,
can I double-check his cell phone number?

122
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:15,540
It's late so I couldn't get a cow.

123
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,803
If you calm your hunger with chicken,

124
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,904
<i>I'll definitely buy you a cow tomorrow.</i>

125
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:23,232
<i>Then...</i>

126
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,933
are you saying that you need
to be by my side...

127
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:27,990
until you get back that grateful bead...

128
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:30,878
inside of me that's healing me?

129
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:37,231
Then...

130
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:39,132
how about you stay where you were,

131
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,533
and when the time comes,
I'll come back to return...

132
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:44,080
That wouldn't work.

133
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,198
<i>You said you didn't like that.</i>

134
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,676
Oh, this terrible memory.

135
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:49,822
I must be punished.

136
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,582
But right now,

137
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:57,952
I got kicked out of my house,
and have nowhere to go.

138
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:02,180
And I have no money.
I really don't have any.

139
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:07,685
So I think it'll be difficult to attend
to someone as important as you..

140
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:10,842
But I'll have to do my best.

141
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:12,665
Dae Woong!

142
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:18,928
While my bead is in your body,
I can't let you go.

143
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,493
You're mine.

144
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,829
Yes, Miss Gumiho.

145
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:29,688
I'll go in and quickly find
a place for you to sleep!

146
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:33,689
<i>Yup, I'll go find a place for her to sleep.</i>

147
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:54,389
First, I must survive.

148
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:59,066
If I keep bringing her meat and
keep her full, she won't eat me.

149
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:02,990
But I must still prepare for the worst.

150
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:23,924
It gets chilly at night.

151
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:27,639
You're wearing that because you
think I might still eat you up?

152
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:30,114
It's just chilly.

153
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:35,767
I'm that scary?

154
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:38,754
I saved you and I didn't
do anything to you.

155
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:40,478
Still...

156
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,538
You could get hungry during the night.

157
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,958
And if a human's liver is right next
to you, you might want to eat it.

158
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:54,864
Did you ever see me eat a human's liver?

159
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:57,377
Did you ever see me eat a liver?

160
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:59,491
You're a gumiho.

161
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:03,968
Yeah, I'm a gumiho.

162
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,877
Watch your liver.

163
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:10,579
I'm going to sleep.

164
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,945
It's been 500 years since I've
slept lying down like this.

165
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:23,211
What's wrong with her?

166
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,191
She's not even a human?

167
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:30,376
It's hot.

168
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:44,121
If she's with Cha Dae Woong,
she'll be easy to catch.

169
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:46,662
It'll end more dully than I thought.

170
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:53,910
Long time no see.

171
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,934
You should have stayed where you were.

172
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,958
Why did you have to come out
into the human world?

173
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:08,792
<i>It's not a good place for you.</i>

174
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,820
It was fun being with him all day.

175
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:25,879
I'll get to stay with him
until he's all healed,

176
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:27,994
so it'll keep being fun.

177
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:44,222
I caught them all so they can't eat you!

178
00:15:44,364 --> 00:15:49,805
Neither I nor the mosquitoes will eat you,
so sleep comfortably.

179
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,141
<i>Wow!</i>

180
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:07,873
The world became prettier,
like a flower garden!

181
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,448
Dae Woong's not picking up.

182
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,575
Although he's had accidents here and there,

183
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:31,126
he's never had a accident with a woman yet.

184
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,803
He ended up going there.

185
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:37,489
That worthless punk.

186
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:39,290
Not even worth a carp.

187
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:41,612
Should I go over there?

188
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:43,097
Forget it.

189
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:46,806
Just make sure to cut off his credit card.

190
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:51,721
An easy girl like her will run out
when his money does.

191
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:57,176
What did she say into Dae Woong's
phone for you to act like this?

192
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:02,253
Forget it!

193
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,154
It's not something to say to
someone who hasn't been married.

194
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:06,577
Father!

195
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:09,885
Why are you bring up my marriage again?

196
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,585
Wait and see.

197
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:13,780
I'll do it!
I'll do it!

198
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:23,046
My old daughter is always stuck
at home without a man...

199
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:28,500
and my young grandson left home,

200
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:30,770
and with a girl...

201
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:36,155
It's all my fault.

202
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:38,257
The only things I've raised right...

203
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:41,797
are all of you.

204
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,622
Aunt.
My card was declined.

205
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:45,702
What happened?

206
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:47,838
<i>You're with a girl, right?</i>

207
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:49,489
How did you know?

208
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:54,787
You ran away and you were with that
girl for three days and two nights?

209
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:56,631
Something came up.

210
00:17:56,673 --> 00:17:59,718
I'll tell you later so please
activate my card!

211
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:02,782
If I save your card, my card will die.

212
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:04,610
Aunt, if I don't have money, I'll die!

213
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:07,107
Then end things with that girl
and come home.

214
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:07,873
I'm hanging up.

215
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:10,015
Aunt! Aunt!

216
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,599
<i>How are you going to pay?</i>

217
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,047
I'll do it.

218
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:19,269
You said it was 120,000 Won, right?

219
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,414
It's 127,000 Won.

220
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:22,545
Huh?

221
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:25,589
She just added a bowl of gal
bi tang* [*beef rib stew].

222
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:32,294
<i>She took it in one shot!</i>

223
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:36,245
She must seem so pretty
because she eats so well!

224
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:37,628
<i>Yeah.</i>

225
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:42,329
She eats so well, I'm going to die.

226
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:46,142
Wow.
The houses got so big.

227
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:48,774
<i>And there are a lot of people!</i>

228
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,582
Yeah.

229
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:55,806
Why did it happen to me
out of all these people?

230
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,756
This isn't even enough to pay
for her gal bi tang dessert.

231
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:03,361
What should I do?

232
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:05,534
Dae Woong, let's have this too?

233
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,456
What now?

234
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:13,452
Yes, what would you like?

235
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:15,657
This. This bubbly thing.

236
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:17,450
Buy me this.

237
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:19,625
Soda?

238
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:24,825
How did she know you should
drink soda after eating meat?

239
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:34,247
Why isn't it coming out?

240
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,014
Did it eat my money?
Aish...

241
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:43,340
Wow, now even the vending
machine is messing with me!

242
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:45,677
Am I that easy?

243
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:47,551
Why me, why?

244
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,198
<i>There are so many people!</i>

245
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:50,585
<i>Why did it happen to me?</i>

246
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:52,486
<i>Why? Why?</i>

247
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:54,936
What am I, a sucker?

248
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:57,326
What am I, a sucker?

249
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,159
Wow!

250
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:01,804
We're in trouble.

251
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:03,205
- Oh, oh...
- Wow...

252
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:04,406
Yah...

253
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:06,284
<i>Mi Ho! Run for it!</i>

254
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:08,343
Mi Ho! Run for it!
Run for it!

255
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:13,750
I need to get married before
Dae Woong matures.

256
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,023
Oh! I started this morning
with a headache...

257
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:19,070
because of Father and Dae Woong.

258
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:41,947
Is there something wrong?

259
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:49,490
It seems like something's
caught in your throat.

260
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,696
Spit it out.

261
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:55,558
Excuse me!

262
00:20:55,937 --> 00:20:59,441
Excuse me!
Come to your senses.

263
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:04,867
Please spit it out.

264
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,438
It isn't coming out...
One more time then.

265
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,007
Is it out?

266
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:18,086
Thank you.

267
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:20,681
No problem.

268
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:36,242
From now on, please eat your ice
as it melts slowly.

269
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:38,443
Then.

270
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:56,503
If I had been less disgusting,
I would have asked him his name.

271
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,889
This is why I can't get married.

272
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:10,722
<i>So this is a college.</i>

273
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,678
Do you even know what a college is?

274
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:13,901
I know.

275
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:17,683
I heard people come to the temple
and pray to get into college.

276
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:20,856
I was curious what kind of place it was
because they wanted to go so badly.

277
00:22:20,957 --> 00:22:23,385
It's really nice!

278
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:27,936
You even go to college,
you're really impressive.

279
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:29,211
Yeah.

280
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:31,153
College is an impressive place.

281
00:22:31,204 --> 00:22:35,163
So you can't make it obvious
that you're a gumiho.

282
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:38,852
If you jump up high and kick like before,

283
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:42,893
everyone here is really smart, so they'll
figure out immediately that you're a gumiho.

284
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:43,938
Okay.

285
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,017
I'll pretend I'm a human.

286
00:22:48,392 --> 00:22:51,801
But if I just stay still...

287
00:22:51,902 --> 00:22:54,338
you can't tell I'm a gumiho, right?

288
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:56,091
Yeah.

289
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,110
So please just stay still.

290
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:09,020
It's been a long time since
I've been at school.

291
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,638
I don't even come here for class
and now I'm here to borrow money.

292
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:22,822
It's all because of her.

293
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:26,997
Dae Woong!

294
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,062
<i>- Woong!
- Yeah...</i>

295
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:32,297
Everyone has a sack,

296
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:34,851
but we're the only ones
that don't have anything.

297
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:38,861
Because we didn't come here to study.

298
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:44,614
Should I meet Mi Soo first?
He got the most free drinks from me.

299
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:47,497
Money?

300
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,860
Why are you asking to borrow money?

301
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,332
I have a reason.

302
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,505
Please give me what you have.

303
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:55,695
I don't have any money.

304
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,835
<i>I left my wallet at home.</i>

305
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,620
Really?

306
00:23:59,863 --> 00:24:02,219
Oh well, there's nothing we can do.

307
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,775
And it's a friend's request... I'm sorry.

308
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:05,603
No.

309
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,278
I'm more embarrassed about
making this kind of request.

310
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,657
No, it's fine.

311
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:13,238
<i>If I had money, I would
definitely lend it to you.</i>

312
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:15,296
It's right here!

313
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,084
<i>What's this?</i>

314
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:18,900
There's a lot of money here.

315
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:20,101
It smells like money.

316
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:22,469
It's not a wallet, it's my cellphone.

317
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,991
<i>~ It's a snake! It's a snake! ~</i>

318
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:29,592
<i>~ It's a snake that's good for
your body and tastes good too! ~</i>

319
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,442
Pick up.

320
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:39,543
He's supposed to be your friend,
why did he lie to you?

321
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,311
We're not very close.

322
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,641
There's another friend I'm closer with.

323
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,667
I only have this.

324
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:51,024
Take this at least...

325
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:54,227
There's a lot here.

326
00:24:57,905 --> 00:24:59,080
Forget it.

327
00:25:04,861 --> 00:25:05,980
<i>Where would I have money?</i>

328
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:08,006
I really don't have a single cent.

329
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,230
I don't even have money for lunch.

330
00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:12,591
<i>I have to drink faucet water later.</i>

331
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:17,720
This is his and there's a lot of money.

332
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:20,145
I'm leaving.

333
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:25,463
He's lying.

334
00:25:25,564 --> 00:25:26,648
He has a lot of money.

335
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:28,409
Don't you believe me?

336
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:30,454
Fine!
You have a great sense of smell!

337
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:32,869
He's supposed to be your friend
and he's lying to you,

338
00:25:33,027 --> 00:25:34,751
why aren't you saying anything?

339
00:25:35,537 --> 00:25:37,739
Are you scared of him?

340
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:46,577
You said you didn't have
a single cent, right?

341
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:51,526
Here, buy lunch with this.

342
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:53,970
- What's that?
- Why did you give him money?

343
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:55,584
He's lying to you!

344
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:59,053
Sometimes it's easier for people
not to know rather than to know,

345
00:25:59,154 --> 00:26:01,954
<i>and sometimes it's less humiliating to
act like you don't know, even if you do.</i>

346
00:26:02,054 --> 00:26:05,026
You don't even know,
don't interfere in people's business.

347
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:07,827
You're not even a person.

348
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:16,724
Hey, why did a kid who tried
to borrow money give you money?

349
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,826
<i>I don't know, he usually
has a lot of money.</i>

350
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:21,880
<i>If you hang with him,
you can mooch a lot of free food.</i>

351
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,882
He's our sucker.

352
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,048
What?

353
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:26,605
Sucker?

354
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,244
He said it's easier not to know.

355
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,569
I shouldn't tell him.

356
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:50,340
Hey.

357
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:52,914
You can't come in here.

358
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,278
<i>You need this to go in,
but you don't have one.</i>

359
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:57,335
Then make one for me too.

360
00:26:57,422 --> 00:26:58,867
You can't.

361
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:00,814
You're not a person, so you can't.

362
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:02,136
<i>Look.</i>

363
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,889
Do you have a name? Nope.

364
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,299
Do you have a phone number? Nope.

365
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,314
A department? Nope.

366
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:09,817
You don't have anything,
how can you get one of these?

367
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:11,332
Right.

368
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:14,750
This is only for people.

369
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:16,287
Not for you.

370
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:18,553
Fine.

371
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:20,504
But you!

372
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:24,000
Stop looking down on me
because I'm not a human.

373
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:29,151
I'm scared of you because
you're not a human.

374
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:37,031
I'll go in and find a way to make
money to buy you meat, so wait here.

375
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:47,896
I want to go where only people go.

376
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:05,441
The alarm is ringing because of this book!

377
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:13,295
Where was that book?

378
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:18,496
<i>~ I must have lost my mind then ~</i>

379
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:22,497
<i>~ How can I leave you? ~</i>

380
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:24,098
<i>~ I only love you, I'm really sorry ~</i>

381
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:26,274
Gumiho! Where's gumiho stuff?

382
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:30,149
<i>~ I only love you, I'm really sorry ~</i>

383
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,050
<i>~ I must have lost my mind then ~</i>

384
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:36,151
<i>~ How can I leave you? ~</i>

385
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:36,964
Ghosts.

386
00:28:38,265 --> 00:28:42,565
<i>~ I miss you so, I miss you ~</i>

387
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,904
I'm going to do research.

388
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:45,668
How to get rid of her.

389
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:47,795
It'll show up if I look for it.

390
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:52,770
Crosses get rid of vampires,
a rooster cry gets rid of virgin ghosts,

391
00:28:52,871 --> 00:28:55,271
what will get rid of a gumiho?

392
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:04,895
If I call out Cha Dae Woong,
the fox should come too, right?

393
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:08,043
I don't know if I'll be able
to catch her alive.

394
00:29:23,518 --> 00:29:24,717
What's this?

395
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:27,265
Why are these all just legends?

396
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:30,274
Don't these people even know about gumihos?

397
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:33,092
It seems like they've never
even seen one before.

398
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:38,853
Why did something that hasn't even been
written about appear in front of me?

399
00:29:40,524 --> 00:29:43,598
Why did I even go to that temple
to start with?

400
00:29:45,954 --> 00:29:47,582
Right, that temple!

401
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:49,298
CheonBoSa.

402
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,442
<i>CheonBoSa</i>

403
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:55,620
There's an article in the news.

404
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,027
<i>CheongBoSa - What In The World?
Fox In Painting Disappears</i>

405
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:02,014
<i>That's the painting I drew on!</i>

406
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:03,856
<i>That's right.</i>

407
00:30:03,957 --> 00:30:06,478
That fox that looked like a dog.

408
00:30:08,426 --> 00:30:10,661
It disappeared?

409
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,546
<i>Draw tails on that fox.</i>

410
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:13,699
<i>Nine of them.</i>

411
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,495
I thought I needed to scare you
to get you to draw the tails.

412
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,679
<i>I was freed, thanks to you.</i>

413
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:24,239
So she got out because I drew that?

414
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:29,825
Wow.

415
00:30:29,935 --> 00:30:31,258
They're really good.

416
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,325
<i>So that's what they do
makeup with these days.</i>

417
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:38,319
I want some red paint, too.

418
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:44,615
<i>You should be careful!</i>

419
00:30:44,716 --> 00:30:45,591
<i>Miss.</i>

420
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:46,557
Hand me the ball.

421
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:47,401
Give it here.

422
00:30:47,502 --> 00:30:49,413
Those guys from earlier.

423
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:50,996
- She's pretty.
- She's pretty.

424
00:30:55,911 --> 00:30:58,344
- She's pretty.
- Talk to her.

425
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:04,741
I saw you earlier.

426
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:06,564
You were with Dae Woong, right?

427
00:31:07,456 --> 00:31:08,982
Yeah.

428
00:31:09,013 --> 00:31:12,647
I'm Dae Woong's friend, too.

429
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,823
You follow him around,
mooch free food, and lie.

430
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:17,244
Is that a friend?

431
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:23,587
Is Dae Woong your sucker?

432
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:32,525
- You're bleeding.
- Blood!

433
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,235
<i>- What's wrong with her?
- Hey, wake up.</i>

434
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:45,195
I follow him around and mooch
free food, too.

435
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:50,924
But I'm not a person and I'm
not a friend, so it's okay!

436
00:31:54,023 --> 00:31:54,894
Yeah.

437
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:59,319
She told me from the start,
why didn't I get it?

438
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,363
<i>Woong!</i>

439
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,975
Dae Woong!

440
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:03,437
Of course she found me.

441
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:05,102
Let's go!

442
00:32:09,938 --> 00:32:11,067
Oh, it's Dae Woong.

443
00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:12,912
Really?
Dae Woong!

444
00:32:16,593 --> 00:32:19,117
Who's that girl next to him?

445
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:20,221
I don't know.

446
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:21,575
Who is it?

447
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,056
Where is this?

448
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:28,806
I have something to ask you.

449
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:32,552
That place you were trapped in,
was that the painting in the temple?

450
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:33,483
Yeah.

451
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,591
I got out because you drew the tails.

452
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:40,192
The fox in the painting was you?

453
00:32:45,737 --> 00:32:47,659
Let me see real quick...

454
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,452
Lower that real quick.

455
00:32:51,543 --> 00:32:52,801
<i>Why?</i>

456
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:54,339
<i>What's this?</i>

457
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:55,712
It's true.

458
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:57,717
You did this, right?

459
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:00,547
Yeah, I did it.

460
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:03,029
I did everything.

461
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:06,704
I am agonizing over why
this happened to me.

462
00:33:06,975 --> 00:33:09,296
But it was all my fault.

463
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:15,520
That's why I gave you my
most precious thing.

464
00:33:17,489 --> 00:33:20,580
And that's why you need to be by my side?

465
00:33:21,236 --> 00:33:23,136
Don't feel too agonized,

466
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:26,137
and just think of it as taking
responsibility for your actions.

467
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:32,155
What are you doing here?

468
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:34,759
<i>Give what and take responsibility for what?</i>

469
00:33:34,876 --> 00:33:36,016
Can't you see?

470
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:41,005
She gave him a precious thing, so she's
telling him to take responsibility!

471
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:45,230
Cha Dae Woong, I didn't see you
like that, but you're really low!

472
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,922
What did I do?

473
00:33:47,957 --> 00:33:50,147
Hey, Cha Dae Woong.

474
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:54,978
I didn't see you like that,
but you're really cool.

475
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:57,785
<i>Of course. You should take responsibility.</i>

476
00:33:57,815 --> 00:33:59,826
What did I do?

477
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:15,710
I even cut off Dae Woong's credit card,
why isn't he crawling in?

478
00:34:15,932 --> 00:34:20,136
He's not the kind of kid who
can stay outside without money.

479
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:21,728
Hey.

480
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:26,452
Can you live and eat in the action
school, or fashion school...

481
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:28,622
or whatever it is?

482
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:35,398
He's in love,
he could probably live anywhere.

483
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:38,068
Love's like that.

484
00:34:38,372 --> 00:34:41,188
Are you writing poems again?

485
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:42,989
Did you get dumped by some guy again?

486
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,918
<i>You wrote poems every time that happened.</i>

487
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:48,390
I didn't even get to start.

488
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:50,829
It's hot, it's hot!

489
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,217
Bring me some more ice!

490
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,171
Father.

491
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:02,862
Please be careful...

492
00:35:02,897 --> 00:35:04,712
and eat your ice as it melts slowly.

493
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,056
She's already really into someone already.

494
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,687
<i>You're already really into her, right?</i>

495
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:26,359
<i>Seeing as how you've left home without
any money and you're living with her,</i>

496
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,460
<i>you're totally bewitched.</i>

497
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:29,870
It's not like that.

498
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:32,363
I'm with her because of
something I can't say.

499
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,187
You can't tell anyone else.

500
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:38,860
Is that the girl that followed you
around saying she's a gumiho?

501
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:42,087
Yeah, her name is Mi Ho.

502
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:44,832
<i>Last name Gu, first name Mi Ho.</i>

503
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:46,459
<i>Oh, her name?</i>

504
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:50,822
It's okay to just say Mi Ho,
but it's weird because her last name is Gu.

505
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,023
<i>What the heck is Gu Mi Ho?</i>

506
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:58,435
She really hates people
knowing she's Gu Mi Ho.

507
00:35:58,455 --> 00:36:00,882
So take out the Gu and just call her Mi Ho.

508
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:02,265
Really?

509
00:36:02,342 --> 00:36:06,163
But aren't you a bum because
you got kicked out?

510
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:10,543
<i>Use this at least.</i>

511
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,938
You have Mi Ho too,
it's rough without money.

512
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:15,899
Thanks, Byung Soo.

513
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:19,232
I was really humiliated over and over again.
There's no one else but you.

514
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,533
<i>Why are you being so sappy?</i>

515
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:24,147
<i>It seems like you're changing
because of a woman.</i>

516
00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:26,601
I need to formally introduce
myself to Mi Ho.

517
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:29,090
Not now!

518
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:31,425
You said you have work.
Go quickly!

519
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:33,419
<i>Are you saying you want
to be alone with her?</i>

520
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:34,666
Then I'll introduce myself later.

521
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,699
Mi Ho, see you next time.

522
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:38,534
- I'm leaving.
- Okay, bye!

523
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:40,135
Ah, why?

524
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,945
Did you just tell him that I'm a gumiho?

525
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:46,473
He doesn't know anything
about your identity.

526
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:48,910
Byung Soo is my friend.

527
00:36:48,994 --> 00:36:50,703
Don't touch my friend.

528
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:52,791
No, it's not like that.

529
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:54,512
My name.

530
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:58,614
You said my name was Mi Ho.

531
00:36:58,873 --> 00:36:59,656
Name?

532
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:03,246
You said I didn't have a name
because I wasn't a person,

533
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:06,747
but why did you say my name was Mi Ho?

534
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:11,255
He kept calling you Mi Ho,
and it seemed like a name,

535
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:12,968
so I just said it was your name.

536
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:17,857
You just said it was my name?

537
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:19,080
Yes.

538
00:37:19,181 --> 00:37:20,478
You said you wanted to be like a person.

539
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:21,946
Then you need a name!

540
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,023
<i>Mi Ho!</i>

541
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,987
It sounds pretty and it holds your identity.

542
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:27,289
It's perfect as your name!

543
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,501
Mi Ho!

544
00:37:28,602 --> 00:37:30,921
So my name is Mi Ho!

545
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:32,026
Yeah!

546
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:33,174
A name's not much.

547
00:37:33,275 --> 00:37:34,872
A name's what I call you by.

548
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,243
I'll call you Mi Ho from now on.

549
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:38,128
Wow!

550
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:40,773
I really like you saying my name is Mi Ho!

551
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:42,356
Okay.

552
00:37:42,446 --> 00:37:46,365
Then Mi Ho, you can't be scary
to my friend Byung Soo.

553
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:48,891
Yeah! I really won't touch your friends!

554
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,789
Let's continue talking about that painting.

555
00:37:58,091 --> 00:37:59,368
Hold on.

556
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:01,865
Hello?

557
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:04,017
You're class of '09,
student Cha Dae Woong, right?

558
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:08,969
There's a package here at the department
office, can you come pick it up now?

559
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:16,754
A package?

560
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,062
<i>This knife will let me know
when they get close.</i>

561
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:26,653
As to which one is the gumiho.

562
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:54,829
<i>That kid is Cha Dae Woong,</i>

563
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,130
but there's no response.

564
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:01,867
Wasn't he with the fox?

565
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:10,946
She's close.

566
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:20,448
That's...

567
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,696
a chicken!

568
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,173
Found her.

569
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:43,520
How do they have the same face?

570
00:41:15,212 --> 00:41:17,293
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

571
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,714
I'm really sorry.

572
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,142
I destroyed her with my own hands.

573
00:42:12,177 --> 00:42:14,088
She's not her.

574
00:42:15,768 --> 00:42:18,798
They merely have the same face.

575
00:42:31,108 --> 00:42:33,048
Where's the package?

576
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:35,242
It was a prank call.

577
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:40,182
I have bad luck because of that gumiho.

578
00:42:40,283 --> 00:42:43,783
How do I get rid of her?

579
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:50,752
Where did she go?

580
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:52,490
Did she disappear on her own?

581
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:54,091
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

582
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,298
Figures!

583
00:42:57,022 --> 00:42:58,493
A chicken came when it was called.

584
00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:00,350
Call a chicken for me, too.

585
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:05,165
Hey, you said you came out of a painting.

586
00:43:05,171 --> 00:43:06,131
Go in there and eat it.

587
00:43:06,232 --> 00:43:08,175
I can't go in!

588
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:09,959
You can't?

589
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:13,272
Oh, right, you said you were
caught and locked in.

590
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,567
Then where's the Three Gods
Grandmother who locked you in?

591
00:43:21,576 --> 00:43:23,615
Is she at the temple?

592
00:43:23,712 --> 00:43:25,001
Why?

593
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:26,885
So you can tell her I'm here?

594
00:43:26,986 --> 00:43:28,916
No!

595
00:43:30,514 --> 00:43:33,316
Is she really at the temple?

596
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:34,494
Nope.

597
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,589
And a person like you can't call her.

598
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:39,497
Just call the chicken.

599
00:43:39,595 --> 00:43:43,315
<i>She's got to have a weakness.</i>

600
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,458
Mi Ho, you want to eat chicken?

601
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,657
Shall we talk while we merrily
eat chicken together?

602
00:43:53,902 --> 00:43:56,100
<i>You said you like soda
because it's bubbly, right?</i>

603
00:43:56,131 --> 00:44:00,092
If you try this, you'll be really surprised.

604
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:01,338
Here.

605
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:02,939
- Wow... wow!
- Oh...

606
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,340
- Ah...
- Oh, my...

607
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,105
Here.
Drink it quickly!

608
00:44:09,348 --> 00:44:12,602
You really know how to drink beer!

609
00:44:12,665 --> 00:44:13,925
Cheers!

610
00:44:14,345 --> 00:44:15,430
Cheers!

611
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:16,523
Chug it.

612
00:44:20,665 --> 00:44:22,973
You need to drink it right.

613
00:44:22,995 --> 00:44:24,657
<i>Here...</i>

614
00:44:24,858 --> 00:44:26,658
<i>Drink it quickly!</i>

615
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,577
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

616
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,900
Cheers!

617
00:44:31,601 --> 00:44:34,801
<i>~ Only my tears fall ~</i>

618
00:44:34,902 --> 00:44:38,802
<i>~ Only my tears fall ~</i>

619
00:44:38,903 --> 00:44:42,903
<i>~ How can I leave you ~</i>

620
00:44:43,004 --> 00:44:48,004
<i>~ I miss you so, I miss you ~</i>

621
00:44:48,027 --> 00:44:51,517
Rock paper scissors shoo!

622
00:44:51,614 --> 00:44:53,270
I won.

623
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,637
Rock paper scissors shoo!

624
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:03,908
Want to play one more time?

625
00:45:04,298 --> 00:45:06,796
Rock paper scissors shoo!

626
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:11,344
This is my first time drinking such
fascinating alcohol since I grew fur!

627
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,344
The foam is like clouds.

628
00:45:15,745 --> 00:45:16,945
Wow...

629
00:45:16,953 --> 00:45:20,621
People get close as they share drinks,

630
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:23,022
and as you and I share drinks,

631
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:27,223
I feel like the distance
between us has gotten so small.

632
00:45:27,312 --> 00:45:29,278
It was worth buying alcohol.

633
00:45:29,379 --> 00:45:33,846
You... don't like me because
I stick to you...

634
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:35,831
and mooch.

635
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,475
To be honest, while we're drinking,

636
00:45:43,576 --> 00:45:47,076
I was really scared at first, because
you said you were going to eat me up.

637
00:45:47,176 --> 00:45:51,505
And in my current situation, it's true
that it's a burden to pay for meat.

638
00:45:51,606 --> 00:45:56,606
But as you saw today,
my close human friends betrayed me.

639
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:59,864
You... blackmailing me honestly,
and proudly ripping me off,

640
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,846
are much better than those humans!

641
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:07,145
But I'm not a person.

642
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:09,025
So what if you're not a person?

643
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:13,529
You're much prettier than most women.

644
00:46:14,618 --> 00:46:18,547
When I first saw you,
I was really surprised.

645
00:46:18,585 --> 00:46:20,360
Because you were so pretty.

646
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:27,558
Honestly, I don't really like that.

647
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:32,607
I need to be moderately pretty to
seem human, but I can't really do that.

648
00:46:32,668 --> 00:46:36,564
You know I want to be like a human, right?

649
00:46:36,635 --> 00:46:40,618
That's why I'm saying you're
beyond the limits of humans.

650
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:42,019
You run faster than Usain Bolt.*
*Fastest man in the world

651
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,372
You jump higher than Isinbayeva.*
*Famous Russian pole vaulter

652
00:46:43,473 --> 00:46:44,862
<i>You eat more than Kang Ho Dong.*
*Korean Entertainer</i>

653
00:46:45,146 --> 00:46:47,257
You're really special.

654
00:46:48,904 --> 00:46:51,187
You really think that?

655
00:46:52,846 --> 00:46:54,441
If you don't eat me,

656
00:46:55,052 --> 00:46:59,486
I'd really like to be close with
a special being like you.

657
00:46:59,514 --> 00:47:03,131
I'm not going to eat you up! Really!

658
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:08,220
Then would you like to be friends?

659
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:09,521
Friends?

660
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:10,422
Yeah, friends!

661
00:47:10,534 --> 00:47:13,772
I'm not even human, can we be friends?

662
00:47:13,835 --> 00:47:14,769
Why not?

663
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,969
As long as our feelings match!

664
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:20,481
Friendship goes beyond nations
and beyond race!

665
00:47:20,511 --> 00:47:24,319
The alien ET and the green
dinosaur Doo Li are all friends,

666
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,120
why can't my friend Gu Mi Ho do it?

667
00:47:27,206 --> 00:47:30,712
How did they become friends?

668
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:33,707
Well...

669
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:38,854
If you do this and say "Hoy hoy",
you're friends.

670
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:40,501
<i>Hoy hoy?</i>

671
00:47:40,602 --> 00:47:41,415
Touch it.

672
00:47:41,516 --> 00:47:43,085
Hoy hoy!

673
00:47:43,186 --> 00:47:45,142
Hoy hoy!

674
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,766
Now we're friends.

675
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:50,462
I really like being friends with you!

676
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,368
Hoy hoy!

677
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,978
Hoy hoy!

678
00:48:00,882 --> 00:48:02,225
Hoy hoy!

679
00:48:02,773 --> 00:48:04,709
Hoy hoy!

680
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,385
Doctor.

681
00:48:21,427 --> 00:48:23,100
Doctor.

682
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,642
Yes?

683
00:48:25,342 --> 00:48:27,849
What's been wrong with you all day?

684
00:48:27,886 --> 00:48:31,125
You said you were looking for something,
is it because you couldn't find it?

685
00:48:31,255 --> 00:48:34,984
I did find it, but I couldn't catch it.

686
00:48:35,034 --> 00:48:37,536
But you must have seen what it looks like.

687
00:48:37,637 --> 00:48:39,009
Yes.

688
00:48:39,055 --> 00:48:43,845
But it was nothing like I expected.

689
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:53,053
I was so surprised, I just lost it.

690
00:48:53,376 --> 00:48:55,303
Don't be too disappointed.

691
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:57,689
<i>If you found it, you'll catch it soon.</i>

692
00:48:57,752 --> 00:48:59,258
I'm leaving.

693
00:48:59,294 --> 00:49:00,352
Yes.

694
00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:28,547
I'll have to watch that fox some more.

695
00:49:28,775 --> 00:49:33,999
When I see her,
I can be sure that she's not Gil Dal.

696
00:49:34,736 --> 00:49:35,965
What?

697
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:40,283
You rode in the storage
of the bus I was riding?

698
00:49:40,646 --> 00:49:45,325
I thought you teleported or flew over!

699
00:49:51,626 --> 00:49:52,979
I can't do stuff like that.

700
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,900
I gave my bead to you.

701
00:49:54,998 --> 00:49:58,308
Ah... because it's here,

702
00:49:58,713 --> 00:50:00,957
you can't show off your abilities?

703
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,840
Then, can you smell and hear...

704
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,331
as well as dogs?

705
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,506
I'm better than dogs!

706
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:15,496
Of course.

707
00:50:15,781 --> 00:50:20,316
Anyway, the more I learn about you
the more I feel a sense of closeness.

708
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:23,856
It seems like you're not
that different from me.

709
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:27,536
You have some flaws and you
have some weaknesses, right?

710
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:29,896
I don't have anything like that.

711
00:50:30,584 --> 00:50:32,474
Really?

712
00:50:34,645 --> 00:50:39,772
Then is there nothing you're
scared of or dislike?

713
00:50:40,277 --> 00:50:42,331
There is.

714
00:50:43,631 --> 00:50:45,353
Water.

715
00:50:45,511 --> 00:50:46,545
Water?

716
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:51,810
I dislike water so much, but because
I don't have my bead right now, it's scary.

717
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:55,736
Water.

718
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,634
My friend is scared of it,
so I should drink it all.

719
00:51:00,665 --> 00:51:02,866
Not that kind of water.
Lots of water!

720
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:07,310
When there's a river or ocean,
I can't feel any energy, so it's scary.

721
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:11,183
Then I won't be able to
go to a waterpark with you!

722
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:13,266
Playing in the water is
the best during the summer.

723
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:15,357
That's unfortunate.

724
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:19,365
Do you want some water?

725
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,881
Mi Ho, can you hear me?

726
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:34,913
Mi Ho.

727
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,390
She can't hear this far.

728
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:41,278
She's not as big a deal as I thought.

729
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:45,931
I have to dunk her in water...

730
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:47,530
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

731
00:51:48,777 --> 00:51:49,328
Why?

732
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:53,156
I feel so good,
my tails are about to pop out!

733
00:51:53,245 --> 00:51:56,782
You're my friend, so will you see it again?

734
00:51:56,882 --> 00:51:59,010
Your tails?

735
00:52:00,713 --> 00:52:01,591
Let's go out quickly.

736
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:03,161
I'll show you.

737
00:52:03,592 --> 00:52:05,862
My tails are itching to pop out.

738
00:52:06,004 --> 00:52:07,914
I can't hold it, let's go out!

739
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:09,384
Wait...

740
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:14,124
I'm not ready to go that far.

741
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:19,336
You've already experienced it once.

742
00:52:19,698 --> 00:52:22,601
You should get used to it
in our relationship.

743
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:27,247
Let's formally spread our tails
and do hoy hoy one more time!

744
00:52:27,265 --> 00:52:29,216
<i>The moonlight is great.</i>

745
00:52:30,431 --> 00:52:31,272
<i>Mi Ho!</i>

746
00:52:31,373 --> 00:52:32,110
Gently!

747
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:33,738
Slowly!

748
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:35,674
Be considerate to me.

749
00:52:41,051 --> 00:52:42,416
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

750
00:52:45,227 --> 00:52:47,283
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

751
00:52:51,006 --> 00:52:52,058
Dae Woong.

752
00:52:52,352 --> 00:52:55,568
It's breakfast, so let's eat cow.

753
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:01,556
Dae Woong.

754
00:53:01,857 --> 00:53:04,650
It's lunch, so let's eat cow.

755
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:06,473
Cow again?

756
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:11,679
Okay, let's eat cow.

757
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,849
<i>If we're going to eat again
I should clean it well.</i>

758
00:53:16,924 --> 00:53:18,013
<i>Dae Woong.</i>

759
00:53:18,276 --> 00:53:20,215
It's dinner, so let's...

760
00:53:23,977 --> 00:53:25,908
Let's eat chicken!

761
00:53:26,023 --> 00:53:27,997
Let's eat cow!

762
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:36,409
Cow Caught Today

763
00:53:39,014 --> 00:53:39,838
Look!

764
00:53:39,939 --> 00:53:41,709
<i>They said they caught a cow here today.</i>

765
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,090
Mi Ho!

766
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:44,718
No cow today.

767
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:45,419
Huh?

768
00:53:45,461 --> 00:53:48,246
Breakfast, lunch, dinner, cow, cow, cow!

769
00:53:48,278 --> 00:53:49,424
She's singing for cow.

770
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:50,499
No!

771
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,794
No cow today.

772
00:53:51,805 --> 00:53:53,585
Eat chicken, chicken!

773
00:54:01,342 --> 00:54:03,099
<i>Be careful!</i>

774
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:17,026
Let's eat cow today.

775
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:19,494
Woong!

776
00:54:19,682 --> 00:54:21,349
Yeah.

777
00:54:21,932 --> 00:54:24,000
Cow cow cow cow cow!

778
00:54:34,214 --> 00:54:35,572
<i>Yesterday, the day before yesterday...</i>

779
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:38,616
<i>I saw him for two days in a
row in this department store,</i>

780
00:54:38,717 --> 00:54:41,017
<i>so he might come today, too.</i>

781
00:54:42,293 --> 00:54:46,951
I want to show him my normally
graceful and calm self.

782
00:55:00,905 --> 00:55:04,325
It still hasn't been sold.

783
00:55:18,164 --> 00:55:20,447
Doo Hong, did you wait long?

784
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:23,465
Did you buy everything you wanted?

785
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:26,726
I picked a lot, that's okay, right?

786
00:55:30,712 --> 00:55:32,214
Let's get some clothes for you too.

787
00:55:32,315 --> 00:55:34,498
I don't like these clothes.

788
00:55:35,955 --> 00:55:39,217
I don't need it.

789
00:55:48,819 --> 00:55:50,748
<i>Is it someone you know?</i>

790
00:55:55,562 --> 00:55:57,530
One moment.

791
00:55:58,109 --> 00:55:59,179
Dad!

792
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:08,658
I'm so embarrassed for having expectations.

793
00:56:19,123 --> 00:56:21,309
Are you looking something for your husband?

794
00:56:22,604 --> 00:56:23,915
Yes.

795
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:28,418
<i>This is new and it comes in two colors.</i>

796
00:56:28,476 --> 00:56:30,605
<i>It's a product a lot of
young people are buying.</i>

797
00:56:30,626 --> 00:56:32,359
What are you doing?

798
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:37,286
<i>Are you looking for something
for your husband?</i>

799
00:56:37,387 --> 00:56:38,882
<i>Yes.</i>

800
00:57:01,404 --> 00:57:02,575
<i>Even.</i>

801
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:14,674
<i>Even.</i>

802
00:57:19,908 --> 00:57:21,008
Byung Soo.

803
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:24,151
You can play for a hundred days,
you'll never beat her.

804
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:27,874
<i>Odd.</i>

805
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,585
<i>You're really good.</i>

806
00:57:36,243 --> 00:57:39,295
<i>If I tried to throw her
into the water like this..</i>

807
00:57:39,312 --> 00:57:41,711
<i>I would die first.</i>

808
00:57:42,847 --> 00:57:46,957
I can't think of a method, and I don't
have much money left to buy meat.

809
00:57:47,085 --> 00:57:50,036
I'm going crazy.

810
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:52,896
I have to get money first,
where am I going to get it?

811
00:57:52,997 --> 00:57:54,391
Stop feeding them!

812
00:57:54,492 --> 00:57:56,735
If you give them random stuff,
you'll get in trouble with the caretaker.

813
00:57:56,836 --> 00:57:58,524
Those carp are expensive.

814
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:01,080
They're cheap.

815
00:58:01,243 --> 00:58:05,799
I know because my grandfather
has really expensive carp.

816
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:08,740
That's right!

817
00:58:08,766 --> 00:58:09,759
Carp!

818
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:13,006
Mi Ho!

819
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:14,671
<i>Stay here with Byung Soo.</i>

820
00:58:14,772 --> 00:58:16,971
I'll go earn some meat money!

821
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:32,613
Ddoong Ja, it's me.

822
00:58:32,714 --> 00:58:34,158
<i>Ddoong Ja, quiet!</i>

823
00:58:34,164 --> 00:58:35,257
That's right.

824
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:36,948
Ddoong Ja, hand.

825
00:58:37,212 --> 00:58:38,788
That's right.

826
00:58:38,884 --> 00:58:41,807
If Grandfather comes out because of you,
things will get rough for me.

827
00:58:41,908 --> 00:58:43,708
Oh my...

828
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:49,306
My Ddoong Ja got fatter
since I haven't seen you!

829
00:58:50,837 --> 00:58:53,616
I'll go take care of business,
you stay here.

830
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:07,730
The bigger it is,
it should be more expensive.

831
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:10,696
No, the more colorful and pretty,
the more expensive.

832
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,484
Which one's the prettiest?

833
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:27,191
Got it!

834
00:59:27,296 --> 00:59:28,541
Wait.

835
00:59:29,055 --> 00:59:31,315
Let's go to a place with
better water than here.

836
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:34,259
Oppa will take you to a nice place.

837
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:38,764
<i>And where is that, Oppa?</i>

838
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:40,644
Grandfather.

839
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:46,394
The punk who ran away and crawled
back home is stealing my carp?

840
00:59:46,574 --> 00:59:47,949
Grandfather...

841
00:59:48,928 --> 00:59:50,935
I had a bad dream,

842
00:59:51,036 --> 00:59:56,036
so I came here and a carp was dead
and floating in the pond.

843
00:59:56,514 --> 00:59:59,934
It's unlucky and looks bad,
so I scooped it out.

844
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:04,498
It's moving.

845
01:00:04,499 --> 01:00:06,596
It was definitely dead.

846
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:08,562
You bastard!

847
01:00:08,663 --> 01:00:10,494
It's alive!

848
01:00:10,548 --> 01:00:11,617
Was he pretending to be dead?

849
01:00:11,718 --> 01:00:13,978
Grandfather, he's alive.

850
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:17,742
You're really dead this time!

851
01:00:18,432 --> 01:00:20,172
It bit me!
The carp bit me!

852
01:00:20,273 --> 01:00:21,798
- What?
- I'm bitten!

853
01:00:21,899 --> 01:00:23,715
I think my finger's going to get cut off!

854
01:00:23,716 --> 01:00:25,790
Then pull your finger out!

855
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:27,762
Pull it out!
Pull your hand out!

856
01:00:27,863 --> 01:00:29,481
- I took it out.
- Eh?

857
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:35,065
<i>Cha Dae Woong!</i>

858
01:00:35,592 --> 01:00:37,032
You bastard!

859
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:37,736
<i>Dae Woong.</i>

860
01:00:37,837 --> 01:00:39,060
- Bye, Aunt!
- Dae Woong!

861
01:00:39,161 --> 01:00:40,012
Stop right there!

862
01:00:40,113 --> 01:00:41,672
- Oh, my!
- Aren't you stopping, you bastard!

863
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:42,665
Father!

864
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:44,062
<i>- Father!
- Dae Woong!</i>

865
01:00:45,463 --> 01:00:46,735
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

866
01:00:46,831 --> 01:00:47,831
Grandfather, I'll be right back!

867
01:00:47,932 --> 01:00:48,760
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

868
01:00:48,881 --> 01:00:49,748
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

869
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:50,632
I'll give you money.

870
01:00:50,733 --> 01:00:53,004
- I'll give you money, give me back my carp!
- Father!

871
01:00:53,105 --> 01:00:54,755
- Dae Woong!
- Father, be careful!

872
01:00:54,882 --> 01:00:56,279
- Seeing as how he's chasing me,
- Father!

873
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,080
it must be really expensive!

874
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,625
Dae Woong!

875
01:01:13,217 --> 01:01:14,690
Doctor.

876
01:01:15,242 --> 01:01:16,324
Please...

877
01:01:16,877 --> 01:01:19,542
please save him.

878
01:01:21,338 --> 01:01:25,648
We can't do anything about this.

879
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,268
Must I send you away like this?

880
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,093
Father.

881
01:01:39,394 --> 01:01:40,594
Huh?

882
01:01:41,606 --> 01:01:45,060
You rotten bastard.

883
01:01:56,622 --> 01:01:58,037
<i>Fine.</i>

884
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:00,997
Let's talk when we get home.

885
01:02:03,942 --> 01:02:05,739
Get in.

886
01:02:05,903 --> 01:02:07,727
I can't go.

887
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,243
What?

888
01:02:09,844 --> 01:02:12,323
If I'm away from that girl, I'll die.

889
01:02:12,409 --> 01:02:15,575
So just give me some money.

890
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:20,873
You're completely bewitched
by that girl, right?

891
01:02:20,939 --> 01:02:23,083
What kind of girl is she?

892
01:02:23,184 --> 01:02:25,679
I can't tell you for your sake
and Aunt's sake.

893
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:29,088
Then bring her home.

894
01:02:29,189 --> 01:02:30,625
<i>Yes.</i>

895
01:02:30,844 --> 01:02:33,879
Let me see that girl that you like.

896
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:34,836
I can't!

897
01:02:34,937 --> 01:02:36,227
Hey!

898
01:02:36,374 --> 01:02:40,449
I need to see her in order to
marry you off or take her in!

899
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:41,639
Am I crazy?

900
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,524
Why would I marry her?

901
01:02:43,651 --> 01:02:45,784
I'm just going to live with her
for a bit then send her off.

902
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:46,885
What? What?

903
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:51,123
You punk!

904
01:02:56,768 --> 01:02:58,665
Grandfather.

905
01:02:58,835 --> 01:03:01,691
You worthless thing.

906
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,561
Fine.

907
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:07,006
Live doing whatever you want!

908
01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:15,936
You were wrong.

909
01:03:16,197 --> 01:03:20,299
Grandfather, you don't even know.

910
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:26,138
I got hit by Grandfather.

911
01:03:28,178 --> 01:03:29,893
Cha Dae Woong.

912
01:03:30,726 --> 01:03:31,313
Yeah.

913
01:03:31,414 --> 01:03:34,278
How long are you going to stay in the night
guard's room at my dad's action school?

914
01:03:34,379 --> 01:03:35,586
You said I could stay for as long as I want.

915
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:36,905
<i>The situation has changed.</i>

916
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:40,255
You can't stay there with that girl.

917
01:03:40,286 --> 01:03:41,576
Get out.

918
01:03:42,177 --> 01:03:43,245
Bye.

919
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:45,737
I don't have anywhere to go,
what's wrong with her?

920
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:47,378
Oh, and..

921
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:50,271
I just saw Hae In Unni.

922
01:03:50,392 --> 01:03:51,321
Hae In Noona?

923
01:03:51,322 --> 01:03:53,673
She was with Byung Soo and your girlfriend.

924
01:03:53,774 --> 01:03:54,885
What?

925
01:03:59,174 --> 01:04:01,047
Noona can't see her.

926
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:02,590
She can't misunderstand!

927
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:07,711
You're not a student at our school?

928
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,148
Then Byung Soo, is she your girlfriend?

929
01:04:10,177 --> 01:04:13,915
Well, no...

930
01:04:14,092 --> 01:04:16,340
Then who is she?

931
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:18,777
My name is Mi Ho.

932
01:04:18,978 --> 01:04:20,205
Mi Ho.

933
01:04:20,431 --> 01:04:21,621
Mi Ho?

934
01:04:21,955 --> 01:04:23,967
Mi Ho, you can hear me right?

935
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,186
<i>Don't say anything to her.</i>

936
01:04:25,287 --> 01:04:27,580
Oh, it's Dae Woong!

937
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:29,925
Dae Woong?

938
01:04:33,959 --> 01:04:35,245
You know Dae Woong?

939
01:04:35,346 --> 01:04:37,975
Yeah, I'm his friend!

940
01:04:40,266 --> 01:04:42,310
You were Dae Woong's friend?

941
01:04:43,132 --> 01:04:45,207
Noona! Noona!

942
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:51,770
Then are you Dae Woong's girlfriend?

943
01:04:52,332 --> 01:04:53,882
I'm his friend.

944
01:04:56,277 --> 01:04:57,311
Noona!

945
01:04:58,412 --> 01:04:59,812
<i>No, she's not!</i>

946
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:03,485
She's definitely not my girlfriend.

<i>Are you going to pair off with that girl?</i>

956
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:27,381
Are you getting jealous right now?

957
01:05:27,482 --> 01:05:29,576
The gumiho's doing all kinds
of crazy things!

958
01:05:29,613 --> 01:05:30,828
<i>So you're single?</i>

959
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:33,029
<i>Ban Doo Hong, my fated other half?</i>

960
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,498
<i>She was a woman with a husband.</i>

961
01:05:39,045 --> 01:05:40,877
<i>We can't do this.</i>

962
01:05:41,085 --> 01:05:43,404
<i>You couldn't wait and tried to pair off?</i>

963
01:05:43,529 --> 01:05:48,133
You naive thing who couldn't keep
a promise, and tried to pair off...

964
01:05:48,387 --> 01:05:50,767
I want to be a star.

965
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:53,959
He contacted me because
he wanted to be a star.

966
01:05:53,985 --> 01:05:55,386
<i>Are you the one who called me?</i>

967
01:05:55,387 --> 01:05:57,037
<i>Hurry up and find your bead.</i>

968
01:05:57,138 --> 01:05:59,492
<i>What are you going to do
if he runs far away?</i>

969
01:05:59,593 --> 01:06:01,114
<i>He promised not to run away.</i>

970
01:06:01,201 --> 01:06:02,775
Why are you doing this?

971
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,722
Stay still.

972
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:07,163
Noona!

973
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:08,619
It's all because of her.

974
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,323
What did you do?

975
01:06:10,364 --> 01:06:13,153
<i>Don't trust a human's promise.</i>

976
01:06:13,332 --> 01:06:15,168
Dae Woong!

977
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:18,004
<i>He abandoned me and left.</i>
