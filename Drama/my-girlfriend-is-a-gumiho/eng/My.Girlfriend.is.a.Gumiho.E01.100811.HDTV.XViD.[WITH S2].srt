00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,625
Dae Woong!

00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:26,742
<i>Woong!</i>

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,127
Dae Woong!

7
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:31,645
Oh, right, right.

8
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,833
Oh, oh yeah.

9
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:34,758
Oh, what? I can't hear you very well.

10
00:00:35,012 --> 00:00:36,856
Oh, ahhhh.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,385
Dae Woong.

12
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:44,575
Oh geez.

13
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:46,675
Oh, you came?

14
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:48,529
Didn't you see me earlier?

15
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,564
I kept calling your name.
Didn't you hear me?

16
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:51,539
I didn't see you.

17
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:53,288
I was on the phone.

18
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:55,298
Ahh, that must be.

19
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,303
Unless you wanted to die, you wouldn't have
pretended not to see or hear me, right?

20
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:00,593
Of course not.

21
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:03,421
I want to live.

22
00:01:03,618 --> 00:01:07,540
Let's go. I found something really amazing.

23
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:13,435
<i>This is my girlfriend.</i>

24
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,995
<i>My incredibly beautiful girlfriend that
makes all the other guys jealous.</i>

25
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,470
Hurry up.

26
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:40,606
What is it this time? Where are we going?

27
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,591
Today is really a special day.

28
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,253
What kind of day?

29
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,027
Woong, at this restaurant,
they just caught a cow.

30
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,459
Today, I want to eat a freshly-caught cow.

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,223
Beef again?

32
00:01:56,502 --> 00:01:57,935
<i>You can't!</i>

33
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,993
Mi Oh, I really have no money.

34
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:02,733
It can't be beef today.

35
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:05,111
It can't?

36
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:14,216
Then, I'm going to want to eat you.

37
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:22,482
How tasty.

38
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:26,021
<i>This isn't just talk.</i>

39
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:30,144
Fox, fox, what are you doing?

40
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:31,902
I'm eating.

41
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:33,996
What dish?

42
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:36,480
A Dae Woong dish.

43
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,777
Is it dead or alive?

44
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:44,805
It's alive!

45
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,419
Dae Woong, I gotta eat a cow,
so I don't eat you up!

46
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:59,384
<i>My girlfriend, who wants to eat me up,
is a gumiho.</i>

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,770
Episode 1

48
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,039
Am I cool?

49
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,933
You're cool, totally cool!

50
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:58,802
Put me down quickly. It hurts.

51
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:01,475
Ah, okay! Let him down, let him down!

52
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,045
Ow!

53
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:07,220
<i>Hey, I must totally be an action god!</i>

54
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,892
The wire can't follow my movements.

55
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:13,307
When you just glance at it,
doesn't it look like I'm flying?

56
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:15,657
Um, yeah.

57
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:20,032
Is the ice cream good?
Should I order some chicken too?

58
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:21,377
Yeah, sure.

59
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:24,638
But, just 'cause we put it on the internet,

60
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,139
do you think you can become a UCC* star?
[*Korean YouTube]

61
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:28,783
What if,

62
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:33,536
instead, you do some martial arts dance,
and Star King! How about being on Star King?

63
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:35,689
That's for the general public.

64
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,614
I'm going to debut as a celebrity soon and
that wouldn't be good for my image.

65
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:39,780
That's true.

66
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,112
Let's do it one more time.

67
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:46,148
Oh, Noona!

68
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:48,879
Are you at school now?
I'll be right there.

69
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:51,013
Just count to a hundred.

70
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:52,771
I gotta go.

71
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,117
Hey.

72
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:19,073
Noona.

73
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,275
Dae Woong.

74
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,900
<i>Moonlight Swordsman</i>

75
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:29,174
Then, you're going to audition for this
movie too?

76
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,404
I got to the final cut.

77
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,563
They say with the number of candidates,
the odds are like 150 to 1.

78
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:41,050
But I think the actual competition
looks more like 2 or 3 guys.

79
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,955
That's great!

80
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:47,064
I'm so proud of you, little Dae Woong.

81
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:52,487
You won't be able to just touch
me when I'm famous.

82
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:54,262
So, do it all you want while you can.

83
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:57,832
Here. Touch the face,
and smack me in the shoulder.

84
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,148
Shall I hug you once too?

85
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,798
I'm already so awe-stricken that
I don't think I could hug you.

86
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:12,304
I'm really going to be so famous that
you'll be awe-stricken.

87
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:15,067
Wait and see. It'll happen.

88
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:19,360
<i>I'm done preparing for the audition.</i>

89
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:24,275
Analyzing this script, I can totally see
the character's state.

90
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:26,769
The subject of a man's professed love.

91
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:31,110
My heart is hot.

92
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,436
...is hot. Aw, hot! Aw hot!

93
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:37,179
Isn't your audition in 4 days?

94
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:40,793
- Is it okay if your hair is all kinky?
- Ah, I didn't think of that.

95
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:44,155
I better get the neutralizer applied
right away.

96
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:45,788
Dae Woong.

97
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:50,756
But, are the perms really free here because
this is your grandfather's building?

98
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,591
Well, basically it's taken
as part of the rent.

99
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:57,998
You can eat at and enjoy all the shops in
the building if you drop Dae Woong's name.

100
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,796
I'm going to have to be
close friends with you.

101
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,411
Ay...

102
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,469
3 of us.

103
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:08,689
Oh! Oh!

104
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,303
Grandpa!

105
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,409
You punk.

106
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,992
I heard you came to get free hair
styling again.

107
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:17,593
And you even brought your friends.

108
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:23,094
Ay, Grandfather, what do you mean free?

109
00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:25,372
I was going to pay. I have money.

110
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:26,772
Money?

111
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,251
That money wouldn't be the tuition
money I gave you, would it?

112
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:34,105
Uh, tuition?

113
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:38,312
The school called letting me know
that I hadn't paid the tuition.

114
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,200
What did you do with the tuition
money I gave you?

115
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:43,736
Ah, I put it in the account and
forgot all about it.

116
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,799
As soon as my hair is done,
I'll go and pay it immediately.

117
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,704
Where do you think you're going?

118
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:50,151
I heard you bought a motorcycle
with that money.

119
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,942
Your aunt told me everything.

120
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:55,615
Where have you hidden the motorcycle?

121
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:58,074
Okay, all right, I'll hand over the
motorcycle. I will. I will.

122
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:58,917
Let's go then.

123
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:02,577
Just a second, just a second, Grandpa.
I gotta neutralize.

124
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:05,025
My hair. If I leave it like this,
it will get kinky.

125
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:09,868
Kinky? Forget kinky?
I just want to shave it all off, you punk.

126
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:14,072
Okay. I get it, so please just let go.
Who says I'm not going?

127
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:16,386
Let me just neutralize my hair first.

128
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:19,944
Seriously, if this gets totally kinky,
are you going to take responsibility?

129
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:23,191
Yes, Grandfather, please let him put
on the neutralizer.

130
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:26,133
If it gets too late,
he will get completely kinky.

131
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:32,875
Go and put on that neutralizer or fertilizer
or whatever it is, you punk.

132
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,745
Okay.

133
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:41,308
Cha Dae Woong!

134
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,498
Aye, what about my hair?

135
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,561
I'll have to find a salon.

136
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:04,256
<i>5572, 5572! Please pull over.</i>

137
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,274
<i>5572! 5572, please pull over to
the side of the road!</i>

138
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,800
Please just ticket me quickly.

139
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,514
I have to get my hair taken care
of before I can wear a helmet.

140
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:23,657
- You'll have to come with me
to the station. - Excuse me?

141
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:27,173
- The motorcycle has been reported missing.
- Excuse me?!

142
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:29,250
I've had this a week...

143
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:34,147
I won't try to run away.
Just let me go to a salon.

144
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:37,268
Or find me some neutralizer.

145
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:39,597
A lot of time has already passed!

146
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:43,203
I'm going to be movie star.
I have an important audition.

147
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:47,292
If my hair gets totally kinky,
I'll sue the government for damages!

148
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:48,961
Dae Woong.

149
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:50,170
Aunt!

150
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:55,282
Let's go out.
Your grandfather is waiting for you.

151
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,148
Grandpa?

152
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:10,890
First, go and get your hair unrolled.

153
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:20,258
Father, you've gone too far this time.

154
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:25,531
How could you have your one and only
grandson jailed for theft of a motorcycle?

155
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:29,646
Still, I let him off easy and released him
because he's my grandson.

156
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:36,545
I tried hard to talk him out of it, but he
insisted on acting school, so I sent him.

157
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:41,645
But, what? He spends his tuition
money on a motorcycle?!

158
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:47,159
You're the one who felt sorry for him losing
both parents so young, so you spoiled him.

159
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,863
You...

160
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:51,257
Just wait and see.

161
00:10:51,377 --> 00:10:54,676
This time, I'm going to really set
my mind to it,

162
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,766
and make a human out of my grandson.

163
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:06,494
Grandpa, I'm sorry...

164
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:12,038
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:17,031
It's all been prepared.

166
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:18,179
Let's go.

167
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:19,990
What?

168
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,784
Spartan Academy?

169
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:25,138
- Why would I go there?
- Get locked up and study.

170
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:26,846
Then go back to college.

171
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:29,286
Grandfather! I can't.

172
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:31,402
I have an audition in a few days!

173
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:33,759
Think of it as enlisting and study.

174
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,019
Come up to Seoul as soon as possible.

175
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,633
You have no choice.

176
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:38,745
I'm not going.

177
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,306
Aunt, stop the car.
There's no way I'm going.

178
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,717
- Step on it.
- Aunt, don't step on it!

179
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:44,008
Cha Dae Woong!

180
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:48,905
Live locked up until you become
a real person!

181
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:01,400
Please come here.

182
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:09,686
Now this is a painting where a gumiho,

183
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:15,236
who struggled to be a human for hundreds
of years, is trapped.

184
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,393
<i>And the Three Gods Grandmother
next to her...</i>

185
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:24,047
She has a lot of virtues.

186
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:32,828
As you know, she pairs up all men and women
and she sends us the babies!

187
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:37,206
That's the very famous Three Gods
Grandmother.

188
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:44,429
And that gumiho is a fox spirit followed
and obeyed the Three Gods Grandmother.

189
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,997
You said she's a gumiho but it doesn't
have any tails!

190
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:51,776
Originally, she had all nine tails.

191
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:57,171
But she was incredibly pretty!

192
00:12:57,816 --> 00:12:59,986
That was the problem.

193
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:45,791
<i>That gumiho came down to the world of
humans and wanted to live as a human.</i>

194
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,690
<i>But her unearthly beauty became a problem.</i>

195
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,385
- Lady!
- Miss!

196
00:13:57,705 --> 00:14:01,691
<i>The civil servants who needed to study
stopped their writing.</i>

197
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,896
Lady, please tell me your name.

198
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:10,155
<i>And the farmers who needed to farm
stopped their planting.</i>

199
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:19,117
<i>And the merchants who needed to sell
stopped working.</i>

200
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:24,253
<i>They were all bewitched by the gumiho
and could do nothing at all.</i>

201
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:38,698
<i>The women couldn't bear to see the men like
that and went to the Three Gods Grandmother.</i>

202
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:46,295
<i>Three Gods Grandmother was in a dilemma</i>

203
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:49,595
<i>and she thought that if she found a
husband for the gumiho,</i>

204
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:52,346
<i>the problem would be solved.</i>

205
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:56,109
<i>So she found a man to be
the gumiho's husband.</i>

206
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:06,175
<i>But the women didn't want to give up their
husbands or sons to be husband to the gumiho</i>

207
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:07,906
Excuse me! I heard this gumiho eats
men's livers!

208
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:11,333
<i>spread strange rumors about the gumiho.</i>

209
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:15,171
I heard she's trying to eat a hundred men's
livers and become a human!

210
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:21,130
So Three Gods Grandmother cut off
all the gumiho's nine tails,

211
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:27,731
and trapped her in this painting, so she
could never come out into this world again.

212
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:32,359
It's unfortunate for that gumiho.

213
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:35,200
She couldn't get a husband
and got locked up.

214
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,160
Why don't you get your tails and come
take away my husband?

215
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:48,283
Let's stop making fun of the tailless,
husbandless gumiho and go make an offering.

216
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:49,969
- Yes, Monk.
- Yes!

217
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:55,924
That's strange.

218
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:58,342
The sausage I put here is gone!

219
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:00,423
You must have dropped it somewhere.

220
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:03,606
- Temple food is delicious,
let's go quickly. - Yes, yes.

221
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,638
That fake monk!

222
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:15,154
Why did he bring them all here
and piss me off again?

223
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:17,929
When he was a young monk, he was cute.

224
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,067
Then he got old and chatters even more.

225
00:17:20,187 --> 00:17:23,138
He doesn't even know and keeps
telling someone else's story!

226
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:33,364
It only smells like meat, it's not
even real meat.

227
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,872
I want to eat real meat!

228
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:44,776
Why are you doing this, it's embarrassing!

229
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:48,751
I'm not going to run away!
You took away my cellphone and wallet!

230
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,066
Let me pee by myself!

231
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,840
Then take one shoe off.

232
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,088
- Grandfather!
- It won't stop you peeing, hop on one foot.

233
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:09,514
Happy?

234
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:30,812
Go.

235
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:35,054
I've seen a lot of action movies but never a
main character scaling walls on one foot.

236
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:38,606
It won't work with action.

237
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:00,133
Cha Dae Woong!

238
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,242
Dae Woong!

239
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:05,749
Dae Woong!

240
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:07,329
Dae Woong!

241
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:08,816
What?

242
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,529
I'm sorry.
Dae Woong!

243
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:12,623
Dae Woong!

244
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:14,112
Oh my, that punk!

245
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:16,488
You did that?

246
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:20,558
That punk!

247
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:31,979
How am I going to find that punk?

248
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:46,358
- What were you doing?
- He didn't come out, father!

249
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:49,193
<i>If he didn't come out then where did he go?</i>

250
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,541
If you didn't see him either,
where did he go?

251
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:01,719
<i>Cha Dae Woong!</i>

252
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:07,365
<i>Cha Dae Woong!</i>

253
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:21,039
<i>Anyways, I took that land because
I didn't want that to happen.</i>

254
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,760
Where is this place?

255
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:33,425
I'm thirsty and hungry and my legs hurt.

256
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:38,097
Was I too rash in running away?

257
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:48,997
<i>Excuse me? Excuse me?</i>

258
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,604
What?

259
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:53,072
Monk, can you give me a ride?

260
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,287
Huh, what? Um.

261
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:56,927
Thank you!

262
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,156
Monk, I ate well!

263
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:03,281
Okay.

264
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,852
Sleep in this room.

265
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:11,813
But there are a lot of people praying
nearby, so you need to sleep quietly.

266
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:15,168
Ah, Monk...

267
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:18,394
May I use a phone?

268
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,233
Aunt?

269
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:22,299
I'm sorry.

270
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,538
This isn't it either.

271
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:28,890
<i>I had her number saved,
so I can't remember her new number.</i>

272
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,556
4380?

273
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,641
Huh?

274
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,390
Oh, there's no signal,
no signal again.

275
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:44,190
It keeps losing the signal.

276
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:47,400
Should I go further out?

277
00:22:05,243 --> 00:22:06,678
I'm getting a signal!

278
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:08,489
I'm getting a signal!

279
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,460
Hello? Aunt?

280
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:35,444
I'm sorry.

281
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:45,950
Oh, the battery's almost out.

282
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,816
It has to be 2380.

283
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,691
Please be it, please be it.

284
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,732
Oh my god.

285
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:03,172
My liver almost fell out.

286
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:07,864
Hello?

287
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,855
<i>Can you hear my voice?</i>

288
00:23:09,975 --> 00:23:12,280
I can hear it well.
I'm Dae Woong, is it you, Aunt?

289
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,461
<i>Phew, you can hear me well.</i>

290
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:18,567
- I'm sorry.
- Wait!

291
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:20,705
<i>Keep listening to me.</i>

292
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:21,997
Huh?

293
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:24,666
Why?

294
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:25,768
Who are you?

295
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:28,119
I finally got through.

296
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:30,415
I have something to talk to you about.

297
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:33,089
Are you trying to phone date
with a wrong number?

298
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:36,634
I'm busy.

299
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:38,480
I'm not interested.

300
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:41,561
You're a young man!

301
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:43,388
You're cuter with your hat off.

302
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:49,261
Does this get video chat?

303
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:56,973
This...

304
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:58,805
The battery's dead.

305
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,849
But why does it still work?

306
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:21,095
Hello?

307
00:24:21,215 --> 00:24:22,555
<i>Why are you calling me?</i>

308
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:24,664
<i>I'm still watching you.</i>

309
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,072
Are you looking for me?

310
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:32,670
You won't be able to see me.

311
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:42,415
No!

312
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:43,792
Keep listening.

313
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:46,085
If you run away, I'll get angry.

314
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:49,770
Why are you doing this to me?

315
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,820
<i>There's something you need to do for me.</i>

316
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,359
<i>Come in here.</i>

317
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:02,398
<i>Come in.</i>

318
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:20,200
<i>You see the painting in front of you, right?</i>

319
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:24,878
<i>Yes.</i>

320
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:26,474
A grandmother...

321
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:27,966
and a dog.

322
00:25:28,364 --> 00:25:30,222
<i>It's not a dog, it's a fox.</i>

323
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:31,804
I'm sorry!

324
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:35,022
<i>The fox in the drawing has no tails.</i>

325
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:36,868
<i>Draw tails on the fox.</i>

326
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:38,155
<i>Nine of them.</i>

327
00:25:38,614 --> 00:25:39,707
Nine?

328
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:41,764
<i>Yes, nine.
Draw quickly.</i>

329
00:25:57,128 --> 00:26:00,444
But if I scribble on this kind of
cultural property,

330
00:26:01,034 --> 00:26:02,486
I'll get arrested!

331
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:05,057
<i>- Don't worry about it and draw!
- Yes.</i>

332
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:26,769
<i>Draw quickly!</i>

333
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:28,656
<i>Quickly, quickly, quickly!</i>

334
00:26:32,595 --> 00:26:34,450
There, the Three Gods!

335
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,352
Go to the Three Gods!

336
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:49,764
<i>What happened?</i>

337
00:27:55,218 --> 00:27:56,164
The fox!

338
00:27:57,232 --> 00:27:59,005
The fox has disappeared!

339
00:28:00,405 --> 00:28:02,737
<i>How could this happen?</i>

340
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,963
Hey.

341
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,371
Hey.

342
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,627
Are you dead?

343
00:29:06,297 --> 00:29:08,432
You're really hurt.

344
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:11,463
Do you feel like you're going to die?

345
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,377
You drew my tails so I won't let you die.

346
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:34,178
If I save him, he'll be very useful.

347
00:30:14,806 --> 00:30:16,061
What the?

348
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,873
Why am I hung up here?

349
00:30:20,977 --> 00:30:24,044
I fell down the hill yesterday
while I was running away,

350
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:26,537
but I'm fine.

351
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:29,192
<i>You woke up?</i>

352
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:36,569
She's pretty!

353
00:30:36,689 --> 00:30:41,420
The boar tried to eat you,
so I put you up there so he couldn't.

354
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:44,177
Come down now.

355
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:47,096
Who are you?

356
00:30:47,627 --> 00:30:50,542
I'm me. You don't remember?

357
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:54,942
- Who? - You don't remember
talking to me yesterday?

358
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:57,123
When?

359
00:30:58,163 --> 00:31:01,858
You're even cuter in the bright light.

360
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:04,436
I'm not interested.

361
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,750
<i>You're a young man!</i>

362
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:09,090
<i>You're cuter with your hat off.</i>

363
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:17,541
Go away, ghost!

364
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,302
Ghost, I shun thee!

365
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:21,938
I'm not a ghost.

366
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,202
True, a ghost wouldn't come out in
the bright daylight.

367
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:40,099
She's a person.

368
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,200
Do I really look like one?

369
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:50,317
Was there really a drawing here?

370
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:54,695
Of course. It was always here,
but it suddenly disappeared!

371
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,734
It doesn't look like there are any signs
of being deliberately rubbed out.

372
00:31:58,978 --> 00:32:02,163
That dog has been barking
fiercely since earlier.

373
00:32:02,283 --> 00:32:04,830
He's a Sapsal dog that we've been
raising in the temple,

374
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,162
but he's been barking like
that since last night.

375
00:32:10,414 --> 00:32:13,446
By the way, a young man stopped
by last night.

376
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:17,284
It seems like he came into the
Three Gods Temple.

377
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:19,760
Then could he have done this?

378
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,272
There are no signs of human touch.

379
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:27,438
I'm not suspecting him, I'm worried.

380
00:32:28,577 --> 00:32:30,621
Yesterday's incident was all a prank.

381
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,719
You watched me while hiding and
played a prank?

382
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,253
I thought you were a phone ghost,
do you know how surprised I was?

383
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:38,867
Seriously...

384
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:40,644
I have nothing to say.

385
00:32:40,764 --> 00:32:45,308
I thought I needed to scare you
to get you to draw the tails.

386
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,640
Right, the tails!

387
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,677
Hey, I scribbled on temple art
because of you!

388
00:32:51,797 --> 00:32:54,421
It looked really old.

389
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:56,484
What do I do now?

390
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,368
You made me do it, so
you take responsibility.

391
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,023
Go explain yourself at the temple.

392
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:11,921
- I don't want to go to that temple.
- Of course you don't.

393
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,482
Then why'd you make me scribble
on the painting?

394
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:16,593
I was trying to leave!

395
00:33:16,713 --> 00:33:20,711
I was caught by Grams and I've been
locked up in there way too long.

396
00:33:21,138 --> 00:33:22,415
Figures.

397
00:33:23,592 --> 00:33:27,253
You were locked up because
you're a troublemaker. I knew it.

398
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:30,183
Your grandmother locks you up in a temple?

399
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:33,252
I have a similar grandfather,
so I understand your situation,

400
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:36,435
but you can't pull that kind of prank
and run away!

401
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:38,283
It was so frustrating!

402
00:33:39,192 --> 00:33:40,960
How long were you locked up?

403
00:33:41,192 --> 00:33:42,939
Five hundred years.

404
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,593
- Five hundred years?
- Yeah.

405
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:54,923
I was caught by Three Gods Grandmother,

406
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:58,014
and I was locked up for over five
hundred years!

407
00:34:02,186 --> 00:34:05,733
Your grandmother is Three Gods Grandmother?

408
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:10,802
Then who are you?

409
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:13,040
I'm...

410
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:17,512
a gumiho.

411
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:25,820
Gumiho?

412
00:34:29,017 --> 00:34:33,075
So that's why you told me
to draw nine tails?

413
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:34,039
Yeah.

414
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,704
I escaped thanks to you.

415
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,459
But I helped you too.

416
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:43,116
The reason you're not hurting is
because of the fox bead

417
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:46,530
I put in there.

418
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:47,878
You...

419
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:49,169
You...

420
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,110
You're crazy!

421
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,798
<i>I'm going crazy.</i>

422
00:34:53,153 --> 00:34:56,275
So I listened to a crazy girl
and did crazy stuff?

423
00:34:57,268 --> 00:34:59,770
She's sick so she won't have to
take responsibility.

424
00:35:00,505 --> 00:35:02,824
I'm going to have to take all the blame!

425
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:04,475
You don't believe me!

426
00:35:04,595 --> 00:35:06,978
You're alive because of me.

427
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:09,638
I'm going to die because of you.

428
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:13,328
If you're crazy, stick a flower in
your hair to show it!

429
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:15,738
Why are you pretending to be normal?

430
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:18,182
You said you're a gumiho, right?

431
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:21,006
Then keep your tails with you or something!

432
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:22,510
You can't see them now.

433
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,661
You can see them when the moon comes out.

434
00:35:24,781 --> 00:35:25,630
Moon?

435
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,075
I'm going crazy.

436
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:31,267
I'll show you when the moon comes out.

437
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:35,354
I see you scare easily, so don't get scared!

438
00:35:35,474 --> 00:35:37,437
I'm so scared!

439
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:41,168
How much crazier will you get when
the moon comes out?

440
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,598
Where are you going?

441
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,846
I'm going to Seoul.

442
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:50,742
You go over there.
Don't follow me.

443
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,727
Go over there.

444
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:54,895
Shoo!

445
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:04,915
That boar is over there.

446
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:07,544
He's going straight to the boar.

447
00:36:12,227 --> 00:36:14,075
Now she's not following me.

448
00:36:15,814 --> 00:36:18,397
Why is she feeling up someone else's body?

449
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:22,964
Where should I go?

450
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,006
What's that?

451
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,588
It's a boar!

452
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,346
What do I do about her?

453
00:37:18,394 --> 00:37:19,919
He has come.

454
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,600
Run! It's a boar!

455
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,980
<i>I must have lost my mind then</i>

456
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,036
<i>How can I leave you?</i>

457
00:37:32,156 --> 00:37:36,247
<i>I only love you
I'm really sorry</i>

458
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:39,586
<i>Only my tears fall</i>

459
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:43,625
<i>I must have lost my mind then</i>

460
00:37:43,745 --> 00:37:47,710
<i>How can I leave you?</i>

461
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:51,590
<i>I miss you so
I miss you</i>

462
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,273
<i>Please forgive me</i>

463
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:57,835
<i>I must have lost my mind</i>

464
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,270
It's not following anymore, right?

465
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,767
You don't hear anything, right?

466
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,163
It hasn't left yet.

467
00:38:11,283 --> 00:38:13,840
- It's rustling around over there.
- Shh!

468
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,472
Then let's wait quietly.

469
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:39,918
Now go back to the temple.

470
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:43,444
And there are boars on the mountain,
don't wander around.

471
00:38:43,564 --> 00:38:45,797
I'm not scared of boars at all.

472
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:48,294
Yeah.

473
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,946
How would you know to be scared?

474
00:38:52,335 --> 00:38:53,391
Still...

475
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,385
The world is a scary place.

476
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:57,475
If you wander around messily like this,

477
00:38:57,595 --> 00:38:59,633
people will know how sick you are.

478
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,750
If you meet a bad person,

479
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,989
you'll be in big trouble!

480
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:14,262
Come here.

481
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:24,649
You're quite useful.

482
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:27,162
I'm glad I saved you.

483
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,320
Yeah. I'm glad I helped you too.

484
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:31,604
I feel much better.

485
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,871
Go to the temple and beg the monk
not to punish you too much.

486
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:37,214
I'm leaving.

487
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,890
<i>Be careful.</i>

488
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,639
Did you go everywhere Dae Woong
might have gone?

489
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,108
Yes.

490
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:58,662
Why did you say you were going to forcefully
lock up a kid that hated it so much?

491
00:39:59,092 --> 00:39:59,910
What?

492
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:06,701
Get rid of Dae Woong's motorcycle
and pay for his tuition.

493
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:09,844
<i>That punk will come back
after he checks on that.</i>

494
00:40:12,455 --> 00:40:13,301
Wait.

495
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:17,133
Did I just lose again this time, too?

496
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:21,070
Cha Dae Woong's motorcycle was sick!

497
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,368
If I had known this would happen,
I would have gotten at least one ride.

498
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,137
Cha Dae Woong rebelled and ran away,

499
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:29,507
he's tougher than I thought!

500
00:40:30,913 --> 00:40:32,578
If I rebel and run away too,

501
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:34,960
will I seem tough?

502
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,903
Forget it!

503
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:38,214
You'll seem like a delinquent.

504
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:40,969
Being tough is cool if you've got the looks.

505
00:40:41,614 --> 00:40:45,704
Dae Woong's perm might have made
his hair look like curly ahjumma hair.

506
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:47,670
Would he still be cool?

507
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:49,392
Curly?

508
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:53,419
It must be so cute!

509
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:59,551
If he ran away to me, I could hide him.

510
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,445
You have to tell me if he contacts you.

511
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,908
<i>- Hello.
- Welcome.</i>

512
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:11,929
You suffered a lot coming this far.

513
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:17,038
- It seems he's calmed down now.
- Really?

514
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:21,446
I'm sorry for making you come so far.

515
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:24,129
He was acting so wildly.

516
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:28,244
I was worried he caught a bad
disease or something.

517
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:32,445
He's the precious Sapsal dog
that you gave us.

518
00:41:32,565 --> 00:41:35,598
I happened to have some business to
handle so I was coming nearby.

519
00:41:35,856 --> 00:41:39,788
But did something happen in the temple
last night?

520
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:46,432
The drawing of the fox in the
painting suddenly disappeared.

521
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:51,804
Does that mean it disappeared
or does it mean it was erased?

522
00:41:51,924 --> 00:41:54,094
I guess you could say it ran away.

523
00:42:00,014 --> 00:42:05,421
I even made the Sapsal dog watch it.

524
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:08,361
But it ran away.

525
00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:13,030
Someone must have helped it.

526
00:42:14,656 --> 00:42:15,726
Who was it?

527
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:23,043
That necklace was expensive,
how could he only give me 200,000 won?

528
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:35,218
She followed me here!

529
00:42:36,169 --> 00:42:40,348
I'd already guessed it would,
but the world has really changed a lot.

530
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:02,927
<i>She really is very pretty.</i>

531
00:43:05,158 --> 00:43:06,144
Hello?

532
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:08,688
Yes, that's HanGong University's
Drama Department Office, right?

533
00:43:08,808 --> 00:43:11,501
Yes, I'm Class of '09, Cha Dae Woong.

534
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:14,750
I would just like to check if my
tuition has been paid.

535
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,987
Yes, Cha Dae Woong.

536
00:43:17,216 --> 00:43:18,846
Yes, I'll wait.

537
00:43:23,474 --> 00:43:28,811
I'm rushing back to prepare for my audition,
but I feel uncomfortable about her.

538
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:30,901
Forget it!

539
00:43:31,021 --> 00:43:34,177
What does she know about me to
possibly rat me out?

540
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:36,003
Ah yes!

541
00:43:37,017 --> 00:43:39,015
The tuition was paid?

542
00:43:39,313 --> 00:43:40,702
Thank you!

543
00:43:43,627 --> 00:43:45,303
It's been taken care of.

544
00:43:45,578 --> 00:43:47,794
Now I can just go and eat comfortably.

545
00:44:06,406 --> 00:44:07,175
Hey!

546
00:44:07,623 --> 00:44:09,287
Why do you keep following me?

547
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:11,388
- Take me to eat too.
- What?

548
00:44:11,508 --> 00:44:14,277
Buy me some meat.

549
00:44:14,636 --> 00:44:18,187
<i>I haven't eaten meat once since
I was trapped in the temple.</i>

550
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:20,860
I want to eat meat so much.

551
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:26,148
Especially cow.
I want to eat cow so much.

552
00:44:30,788 --> 00:44:33,030
Miss Gumiho?

553
00:44:33,891 --> 00:44:36,599
You and I don't even know each other.

554
00:44:36,934 --> 00:44:39,571
While we're both sane, let's part nicely.

555
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:40,647
Goodbye.

556
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:43,499
Buy me some cow, Dae Woong!

557
00:44:46,548 --> 00:44:47,302
You...

558
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:49,457
How do you know my name?

559
00:44:49,577 --> 00:44:52,686
You said you're HanGong University's
Drama Department, Class of '09.

560
00:44:52,806 --> 00:44:54,605
Cha Dae Woong.

561
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:08,857
You have incredible hearing.

562
00:45:09,465 --> 00:45:11,743
I was pretty far away but you heard that?

563
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:13,465
Because I'm a gumiho.

564
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:14,828
Figures.

565
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:19,420
What you lack here must be made up
for by other senses.

566
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:26,543
I bought you this meat, so you can't
ever tell anyone at the temple about me.

567
00:45:26,812 --> 00:45:31,462
You can't tell anyone that I'm a
gumiho either. If you do, you'll die.

568
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:33,991
Then we've promised each other.

569
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:36,681
Whoever tells is in big trouble.

570
00:45:39,426 --> 00:45:40,681
I can't wait!

571
00:45:43,236 --> 00:45:44,599
No, I can't.

572
00:45:45,425 --> 00:45:47,164
This isn't human-like.

573
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:57,286
You're a gumiho.

574
00:45:57,818 --> 00:46:00,803
Then you should eat raw meat,
why are you trying to cook it?

575
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:02,525
I'm pretty human-like.

576
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:06,311
- I've worked really hard to be a human.
- I see.

577
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:10,293
My grandfather's always telling me
to become more human too.

578
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,633
Avoid raw meat and become human.

579
00:46:12,753 --> 00:46:14,596
That's really easy.

580
00:46:14,716 --> 00:46:16,215
It's not easy.

581
00:46:16,335 --> 00:46:19,078
It's not easy at all to become a human.

582
00:46:23,935 --> 00:46:25,783
It's all done!

583
00:46:36,831 --> 00:46:37,864
Is it good?

584
00:46:40,354 --> 00:46:44,521
It must have been hard for someone who loves
meat like you to get treatment in a temple.

585
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,740
Should I call your home?

586
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:49,795
Where are your parents?

587
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:54,663
I don't have anything like that.

588
00:46:54,783 --> 00:46:56,465
I don't have anyone.

589
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:05,900
You don't have parents either?

590
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,374
Because I'm not a person.

591
00:47:09,212 --> 00:47:10,073
Right.

592
00:47:10,682 --> 00:47:12,404
You said you're a gumiho, right?

593
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:17,157
How can I have a serious conversation
with this girl?

594
00:47:22,203 --> 00:47:24,350
Hey! You ate all the meat?

595
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:27,022
She's trying to eat all the meat by herself.

596
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,640
Give me my meat!

597
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:40,394
Eat it and get lost.

598
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:46,206
I'm going to the bathroom.

599
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:52,054
News?

600
00:47:52,307 --> 00:47:54,006
The person that temple is
desperately looking for...

601
00:47:54,126 --> 00:47:56,703
She's at Dongbo Charcoal Galbi,* right now.
[*beef ribs]

602
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,383
I bought her meat and
I contacted the temple.

603
00:48:02,428 --> 00:48:04,609
I've done all my duty as a human.

604
00:48:13,573 --> 00:48:15,559
That's right.

605
00:48:16,975 --> 00:48:18,858
I still feel bad.

606
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:23,368
But it's a temple. How harsh can they be
to a crazy girl who scribbled a little bit?

607
00:48:29,301 --> 00:48:33,284
They said this is the bathroom,
but where is Cha Dae Woong?

608
00:48:39,132 --> 00:48:42,071
Why is there a chair in each room?

609
00:48:49,088 --> 00:48:51,786
It's not a chair, it's a well.

610
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:56,148
It's really white and pretty!

611
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:03,629
The well looks pretty,
but the water's not very clean.

612
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:05,546
My meat!

613
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,642
My meat!

614
00:49:11,163 --> 00:49:13,378
The well ate my meat!

615
00:49:15,261 --> 00:49:16,432
I'll get it out.

616
00:49:20,605 --> 00:49:21,891
<i>Monk, you're here?</i>

617
00:49:22,011 --> 00:49:23,131
<i>Now, now, now.</i>

618
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,914
It's the fake monk!

619
00:49:27,084 --> 00:49:28,450
I'll have to hide.

620
00:49:28,855 --> 00:49:31,943
The man's description seems like the
young man you described.

621
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,745
He must have been here.

622
00:49:33,865 --> 00:49:37,789
Yes, he came with a pretty woman friend.

623
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:41,483
Hah, how can a man and woman be friends?

624
00:49:42,003 --> 00:49:43,259
A woman?

625
00:49:43,379 --> 00:49:44,927
He was alone yesterday.

626
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:47,492
He must have gotten in touch with
his girlfriend and left.

627
00:49:47,966 --> 00:49:51,912
Then he must have borrowed this to call her.

628
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:54,710
Monk, I'll get going to Seoul now.

629
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,146
Okay, okay.

630
00:49:56,266 --> 00:49:59,554
I'll fix that cellphone for you in Seoul.

631
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,173
I'm always grateful to you.

632
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:04,074
- Then...
- Yes.

633
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:15,336
If I fix this, I'll find a clue to find it.

634
00:50:15,631 --> 00:50:18,716
Do you need to find another lost pet?

635
00:50:19,415 --> 00:50:21,747
It's a bit scary to call a pet.

636
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:23,559
It could be dangerous.

637
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:26,142
What's that?

638
00:50:26,262 --> 00:50:30,135
It's a type of mutant animal.

639
00:50:39,952 --> 00:50:42,356
<i>Cha Dae Woong's smell...</i>

640
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:46,365
is coming from there!

641
00:50:46,485 --> 00:50:48,536
I should follow him quickly.

642
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,568
It's that same thing!

643
00:51:20,612 --> 00:51:22,979
The water's bubbly!

644
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:36,716
This is the first time I've had such
amazing water since I had fur on my tails.

645
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:50,920
What the heck does it look like?

646
00:51:51,346 --> 00:51:53,355
I haven't seen it yet either.

647
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:55,328
But it will be really pretty.

648
00:51:56,351 --> 00:51:58,216
Enough to bewitch someone.

649
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:00,835
Yeah, Byung Soo.

650
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:04,742
If Dae Woong contacts you,
call me immediately.

651
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,769
Okay. Bye.

652
00:52:15,688 --> 00:52:17,984
Where did Dae Woong go?

653
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,373
I must have worried too much,
my stomach's not well.

654
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,319
Why is this happening?

655
00:52:34,989 --> 00:52:35,904
Oh my!

656
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:38,845
What if someone gets in?

657
00:53:19,313 --> 00:53:23,062
- It doesn't look good on me.
- I said it looks good on me.

658
00:53:24,029 --> 00:53:26,810
I'll definitely buy it next time.

659
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:31,976
What's that rotten smell?

660
00:53:35,918 --> 00:53:37,353
I'm sorry.

661
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,294
I'm not feeling well.

662
00:53:54,757 --> 00:53:56,049
<i>Thank you.</i>

663
00:53:56,169 --> 00:53:57,932
<i>No problem.</i>

664
00:54:03,221 --> 00:54:05,212
She's cute.

665
00:54:21,957 --> 00:54:25,024
The country has good air
but the sun is too strong.

666
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:27,661
I'll have to get some treatment in Seoul.

667
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:29,670
<i>Sir, please give me your ticket.</i>

668
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:35,185
You need to give me two.

669
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,351
Huh?

670
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:39,454
You have to give me the one for
the woman next to you.

671
00:54:43,695 --> 00:54:46,440
- Why are you here?
- I have to go with you.

672
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:57,388
I said I was going to Seoul,
so you followed me to the bus terminal?

673
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,845
I followed your scent.

674
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:03,056
You have the green tea
that fake monk likes in that bag.

675
00:55:03,176 --> 00:55:04,706
Give me some too.

676
00:55:04,826 --> 00:55:08,485
And there's a lump that smells like
meat and strawberries too!

677
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,763
Have you been following me and watching me?

678
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:16,847
You saw what I've been buying and eating?

679
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,739
I followed your scent.

680
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,959
Why did you follow me?

681
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:28,403
I like you.

682
00:55:28,523 --> 00:55:30,484
I'm going to follow you.

683
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:37,827
You were pretending to be crazy in order
to follow me, right?

684
00:55:37,947 --> 00:55:41,647
You catch people off guard by saying crazy
things, then cling to them?

685
00:55:43,344 --> 00:55:48,062
I've seen a lot of girls lie in order to
seduce men,

686
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:51,757
but this is the first time I've seen a woman
pretend to be crazy.

687
00:55:52,022 --> 00:55:53,224
<i>It's new.</i>

688
00:55:53,344 --> 00:55:56,685
It's fresh, but it's a bit frightening.

689
00:55:56,805 --> 00:55:59,071
It's scary.
You're like a stalker.

690
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:03,412
I didn't lie.

691
00:56:03,801 --> 00:56:06,510
Then you're really a gumiho?

692
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,586
Yeah.

693
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:12,480
You're a nine-tailed gumiho who seduces
men to bewitch them?

694
00:56:12,959 --> 00:56:17,749
And then you eat their livers and insides,
that kind of gumiho?

695
00:56:18,915 --> 00:56:20,834
I saved you.

696
00:56:20,954 --> 00:56:23,119
If I take out the bead I gave you,
you'll die.

697
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:25,666
She keeps acting like she's crazy!

698
00:56:28,698 --> 00:56:30,258
Then Miss Mi Ho...

699
00:56:30,378 --> 00:56:33,216
I'm going so find me by my scent.

700
00:56:33,336 --> 00:56:36,283
And when the moon comes out,
show me your tails.

701
00:56:36,403 --> 00:56:40,050
Oh and take back the bead.
Then I'll believe you.

702
00:56:43,683 --> 00:56:45,674
Then I'll follow you.

703
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,216
I'll find you and make you believe.

704
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:54,751
Then you'll die.

705
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:15,625
Is she really crazy?

706
00:58:13,685 --> 00:58:15,243
It's you guys...

707
00:58:15,363 --> 00:58:17,431
Why are you running so quickly?

708
00:58:22,687 --> 00:58:23,942
Here.

709
00:58:27,258 --> 00:58:29,500
Your aunt said to give it to you
if I saw you.

710
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,733
And she said not to come home until
she calms down your grandfather.

711
00:58:33,853 --> 00:58:36,197
Stay in the acting school's
night guard's room.

712
00:58:36,317 --> 00:58:39,533
I'll tell my dad so stay as long
as you'd like.

713
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,507
I'll go get the key.

714
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:46,084
Do I have to stay here?

715
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:48,918
Aunt should have gotten me a hotel room.

716
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,753
Aw, it smells.

717
00:58:57,658 --> 00:59:00,438
Dae Woong, what's wrong with your back?

718
00:59:01,712 --> 00:59:04,169
- What about my back?
- Where did you get hurt like this?

719
00:59:04,289 --> 00:59:05,584
This is really bad.

720
00:59:05,704 --> 00:59:09,028
- When did this happen?
- This is almost bone-deep.

721
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,700
- It really doesn't hurt?
- No, it doesn't hurt.

722
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:20,847
I rolled down a mountain yesterday.
Is that what it's from?

723
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:24,084
But why doesn't it hurt?

724
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:27,914
The reason you're not hurting is
because of the fox bead

725
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:30,999
I put in there.

726
00:59:31,645 --> 00:59:32,919
No way.

727
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:35,671
No way.

728
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:38,254
- What she said doesn't make sense.
- Why?

729
00:59:38,613 --> 00:59:40,030
<i>What who said?</i>

730
00:59:40,819 --> 00:59:41,913
Come here.

731
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:49,830
I met a weird girl today.

732
00:59:50,117 --> 00:59:54,584
But she said she was a gumiho.

733
00:59:55,373 --> 00:59:56,270
<i>Gumiho?</i>

734
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,231
Yeah.

735
00:59:57,644 --> 01:00:00,316
She said she saved me
and that she's a gumiho.

736
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:03,993
Oh, I promised not to tell.

737
01:00:04,113 --> 01:00:08,748
I said if I tell, I'll die.

738
01:00:11,438 --> 01:00:12,281
Hey.

739
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:15,762
If she's a gumiho, you really can't tell.

740
01:00:16,067 --> 01:00:20,354
In the old folktales, the gumiho said,
"Don't tell anyone you saw me".

741
01:00:20,474 --> 01:00:28,361
But the man told, "I saw a gumiho"
and she comes to eat his liver.

742
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:31,937
- There was a story like that?
- Hey.

743
01:00:32,057 --> 01:00:34,126
It's common knowledge.

744
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,646
I brought the key.

745
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:44,828
I'm going to work.
Sleep well.

746
01:00:44,948 --> 01:00:46,353
Hey... Stay a bit longer.

747
01:00:46,473 --> 01:00:49,277
Then, I'll stay a bit longer.

748
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:51,816
Stay where?

749
01:00:51,936 --> 01:00:54,453
Your father will worry if you're late.

750
01:00:54,573 --> 01:00:55,763
Let's go.

751
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,292
Dae Woong, watch your liver.

752
01:00:58,561 --> 01:00:59,924
You...

753
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,407
Hey, don't turn off the lights
when you leave.

754
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:25,944
<i>I'll find you and make you believe.</i>

755
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:28,940
<i>Then you'll die.</i>

756
01:01:33,097 --> 01:01:34,927
It's scary for no reason.

757
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:47,782
Let's not think about nonsense.

758
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:50,460
I'll tire myself out and
go to sleep quickly.

759
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:06,771
Why did this roll back?

760
01:02:11,047 --> 01:02:13,163
It must have bounced off a wall.

761
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:22,748
Why are those rolling
by themselves?

762
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,175
She came.

763
01:02:50,441 --> 01:02:52,324
She really came.

764
01:02:55,069 --> 01:02:58,423
You really found me.

765
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:01,012
I told you.

766
01:03:01,132 --> 01:03:02,824
That I can find you.

767
01:03:04,169 --> 01:03:05,981
It was a bit difficult.

768
01:03:13,378 --> 01:03:17,414
You're pretty awesome.

769
01:03:19,306 --> 01:03:21,297
I told you I'm a gumiho.

770
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:30,874
The moon is about to come out.

771
01:03:31,305 --> 01:03:34,210
I told you I'd show you
when the moon comes out.

772
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:36,596
Moon?

773
01:04:12,538 --> 01:04:14,403
You have nine tails.

774
01:04:14,941 --> 01:04:16,466
Because I'm a gumiho.

775
01:04:18,349 --> 01:04:20,215
Now give me my bead back.

01:04:50,694 --> 01:04:52,003
Am I that easy?

783
01:04:52,123 --> 01:04:53,474
<i>Why me, why?</i>

784
01:04:53,594 --> 01:04:56,149
<i>Why did I get caught?
Why? Why?</i>

785
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:58,302
<i>Yeah I'm a gumiho.
Watch your liver.</i>

786
01:04:58,422 --> 01:05:01,118
<i>First, I have to survive.
How to get rid of her.</i>

787
01:05:01,238 --> 01:05:02,410
<i>It'll show up if I look for it.</i>

788
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:04,725
<i>If she's with Cha Dae Woong,
she'll be easy to catch.</i>

789
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:06,644
<i>It'll end more dully that I thought.</i>

790
01:05:06,764 --> 01:05:09,460
<i>Then is there nothing you're
scared of or dislike?</i>

791
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:10,824
- Water.
- Water?

792
01:05:11,165 --> 01:05:12,008
Water.

793
01:05:12,128 --> 01:05:14,829
- Am I that scary?
- You might want to eat me.

794
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:17,358
Can I really eat you?
I was going to spare you.

795
01:05:17,478 --> 01:05:19,295
Then spare me.
Please.

796
01:05:20,568 --> 01:05:22,380
<i>Doo Hong.
Did you wait long?</i>

797
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,799
<i>I'm so embarrassed for having expectations.</i>

798
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:27,274
Are you looking for something
for your husband?

799
01:05:27,543 --> 01:05:30,233
I gave you my most precious thing.

800
01:05:30,353 --> 01:05:32,123
Think of it as taking responsibility
for your actions.

801
01:05:32,243 --> 01:05:33,396
You're mine.

802
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:35,603
<i>You're completely bewitched by
that girl.</i>

803
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:36,444
Am I crazy?

804
01:05:36,564 --> 01:05:38,651
I was just going to live with her a while.

805
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:40,767
- Stop right there you bastard!
- Father!

806
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,207
<i>Dae Woong!</i>
