Episode 14

4
00:00:17,988 --> 00:00:19,403
After the 100 days have passed,

5
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:25,514
one of us has to die?

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,305
Since something so ridiculous is our fate,

7
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:32,770
I'm supposed to calmly accept it,

8
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:36,195
or run away and save myself?

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,263
I can't do that.

10
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,378
I WON'T!

11
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:43,357
I don't want to either.

12
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:48,304
Today marks exactly half of
the hundred days passed.

13
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:50,829
Mi Ho...

14
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:56,492
Take the bead from me... right now.

15
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:01,339
You want me to take the bead right now?

16
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:03,547
Then what?

17
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:14,346
This is the only decision I can make
as the person who loves you.

18
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:18,663
<i>Even though I'm not sure of the outcome,
we're in it together.</i>

19
00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:20,826
Until the very end.

20
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:33,479
<i>I love you,
words from the bottom of my heart</i>

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:41,172
<i>I love you,
words I want to say a thousand times</i>

22
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:44,924
<i>Until now I haven't been able to tell you</i>

23
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:47,985
<i>So I want to start telling you more now</i>

24
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:50,453
Are you okay?

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,762
Yes, I'm okay.

26
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:56,008
Are you okay?

27
00:01:57,406 --> 00:02:02,462
That's great, that's really great.

28
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,533
Dae Woong.

29
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:09,357
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

30
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,934
Dae Woong!

31
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,387
Dae Woong!

32
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,551
Mi Ho.

33
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,731
Dae Woong!

34
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,841
Dae Woong! Dae Woong!

35
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:25,818
Dae Woong!

36
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:29,060
Dae Woong, Dae Woong!

37
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:30,479
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

38
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,783
Dae Woong...

39
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,290
Dae Woong...

40
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:51,340
Oxygen.

41
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:23,735
You've really made a fearless choice.

42
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,491
Dae Woong will live, right?

43
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:27,373
He won't die like this, right?

44
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,509
I don't know either.

45
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:34,446
Are you really okay?

46
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:39,825
Dae Woong, Dae Woong...

47
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:44,707
Mi Ho.

48
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,642
Dae Woong.

49
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,072
It can't be like this.

50
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,669
I have to give the bead back.

51
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,928
It's too late.

52
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:25,063
There's no way to turn back.

53
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,448
Cha Dae Woong has already transferred half
of his life to you along with the bead.

54
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:33,957
Whether he'll die immediately

55
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,482
or still live for a few months or
a few years,

56
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:41,649
<i>it all depends on the original length
of his life.</i>

57
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:50,906
Right now, there's nothing you can do.

58
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:56,854
If Dae Woong doesn't wake up again,

59
00:04:58,202 --> 00:05:01,571
then give me Teacher Dong Ju's knife.

60
00:05:03,308 --> 00:05:05,752
<i>Let go of that hand.</i>

61
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,602
Woong.

62
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:22,078
I'm fine.

63
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:26,930
So let go of Mi Ho's hand
and get out of here.

64
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:28,689
Dae Woong.

65
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:30,862
Woong.

66
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:41,586
Wherever my grandfather took me
to get my fortune told,

67
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,007
they all said that I'd live to 120.

68
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:50,196
So for the next 50 years,
there definitely won't be any problem.

69
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,539
How exactly it'll turn out,

70
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,438
we'll wait and see.

71
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:07,437
Thank goodness. 
Thank goodness. You're okay?

72
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:08,531
I'm okay.

73
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:22,193
This is the only decision I can make
as the person who loves you.

74
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,360
Am I following...

75
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:30,778
the decision made by a fearless human?

76
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,542
I told you I'm okay.

77
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:42,218
<i>A decision a person made for love...</i>

78
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:52,990
What? Dae Woong fainted at the airport?

79
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:56,377
Okay, I'll go to the hospital immediately.

80
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:59,065
Father, Father!

81
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,751
You're really okay?

82
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:08,322
No. I'm REALLY hungry!

83
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:11,702
We have to get out of here quickly
and eat.

84
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:15,059
You're really okay too, right?

85
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,505
Yeah 'cause I have the bead.

86
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:24,722
But what if the bead
restores the tails that I lost?

87
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:27,650
How can something that's already
gone reappear again?

88
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:31,924
Ah, you said...
you still have five left?

89
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,972
Yeah...I wish the tails
keep disappearing,

90
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:37,752
and leave only the human chi
you gave me.

91
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:39,328
Yeah...

92
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:41,162
Since I'm safe and sound,

93
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:43,379
you'll definitely be fine too.

94
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:48,291
On the 55th day, whether or not
the fifth tail will disappear,

95
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,139
we'll find out then, right?

96
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:57,927
It'll be okay even if it doesn't disappear.

97
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,326
I was ok nine-tails so,
who cares if it's five-tails?

98
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:03,887
Woong.

99
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,481
Come this way.

100
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:08,587
Father.

101
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:10,968
Our Dae Woong...

102
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:15,585
Thank goodness the bead went 
back you to safely.

103
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:17,233
Yeah.

104
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:19,023
I hope that it'll continue to be safe.

105
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,337
Your body's different from before...

106
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:24,285
Can you still go to China?

107
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:29,823
Honestly, I don't know what's gonna 
happen to the bead, so I'm a bit worried.

108
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:35,014
Let's delay our trip to China.

109
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,834
I'm worried about your condition so
I can't go either.

110
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:41,629
Since we're at the hospital, 
let's do a check up and

111
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,006
ask the director
to give us a bit more time.

112
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,030
Can we do that?

113
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,284
Right now, the condition of the bead
is the most important thing,

114
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:53,380
So we should avoid any risks.

115
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:56,630
Bead, you can't cause problems.

116
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:00,157
Grandpa, Aunt.

117
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:06,481
You said "bead", what do you mean by that?!

118
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,113
That's…

119
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,326
Explain it honestly!

120
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:15,325
You're gonna keep concealing from your grandpa
and lie?!

121
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,789
Because it's something that
Grandpa doesn't need to know.

122
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,853
What do you mean I don't need to know?

123
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:26,023
I already heard that the bead inside
Mi Ho being in danger, you punk.

124
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:26,849
Grandpa.

125
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,900
How can you conceal my great-grandson
from me?

126
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:33,842
What?

127
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:39,856
If you're having a child
then you should have told me.

128
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,954
"Bead" is the name?

129
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:45,038
Of course it's not!

130
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:49,344
So THAT'S why you did everything to
come back to Korea?!

131
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:50,905
No, it's not.

132
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:54,008
It's seriously not like that.

133
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:56,155
Cha Dae Woong.

134
00:09:56,256 --> 00:10:00,079
You still want to conceal it until
the very end?

135
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:04,494
- Then let's get it confirmed immediately.
- What?

136
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:06,972
Min Sook, this hospital has a
gynecology department, right?

137
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:07,836
Yes.

138
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:10,926
Take Mi Ho and get her examined.

139
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,962
Examination? I can't.

140
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:16,842
Grandpa, she can't get an examination.

141
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:18,624
There's no need to get an examination.

142
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:20,384
This punk…

143
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,785
You're right.

144
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:33,457
Right now, in Mi Ho,

145
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:40,307
there's a bead.

146
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,038
Mi Ho, are you okay?

147
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:47,865
What?

148
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:49,069
This isn't right.

149
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,935
Min Sook, you take her,

150
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:56,464
and check if the mother and the child
are both healthy.

151
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:58,905
Grandpa, they're very healthy.

152
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,916
Our bead is totally healthy.

153
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:03,369
Right?

154
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,936
Yes, our bead is healthy.

155
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:15,014
Congratulations, Cha Dae Woong.

156
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:20,542
You're telling the truth?

157
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:24,700
Dae Woong gave up half of his life to her?

158
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:25,712
That's right.

159
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:28,506
I believed that he would never
return the bead to her.

160
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:32,793
Instead he stopped all my
carefully laid out plans and did it...

161
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:36,194
That's unbelievable...

162
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:39,257
The Dae Woong I knew wasn't
that kind of person.

163
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:41,969
He's not the kind of person
who throws his life away like that!

164
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,016
He must have changed.

165
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,386
Even though I can't become human in the end,

166
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:48,401
but to be able to give my all to
the person I love,

167
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:50,216
I really like myself like this.

168
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:53,767
He met a person who can give
everything to him,

169
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:59,178
so he also turned into a person
who can be like that.

170
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:03,496
Then right now between the two of them,

171
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:05,227
you were unable to intervene either?

172
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:07,283
I'm not sure.

173
00:12:07,374 --> 00:12:09,880
Right now, the result is not out yet.

174
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,883
Because inside her body,
my blood still flows in her.

175
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:20,462
Eat a lot.

176
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:25,054
Today, we'll have Korean beef bone soup.

177
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:27,939
And tomorrow let's buy some fish 
to grill and eat.

178
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,533
I just like beef soup...

179
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:32,608
Really?

180
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:39,652
Then I'll ask for more Korean beef bone
soup from my friend in the countryside.

181
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:45,225
Mi Ho, live at our house from today on.

182
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:48,184
Why?

183
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:49,530
You said there almost was an accident,

184
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:51,870
we can't let her live by herself!

185
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:56,803
Anyways, don't you have to leave in a few days
to film the movie?

186
00:12:56,928 --> 00:13:01,117
During that time,
Mi Ho can stay at our house.

187
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,583
Since Grandpa has already
misunderstood the bead anyway,

188
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:09,583
Until you go to China,
let's stay here.

189
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:14,759
Then until that time,
we're going to live here together?

190
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,228
That's right.

191
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:21,045
Us two in one room?

192
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:23,440
In one room?

193
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:24,976
We can't.

194
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:29,273
Dae Woong, you already gave half
of your life to me.

195
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:31,140
<i>We don't even know what will happen,</i>

196
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:33,289
so I can't steal any more.

197
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,612
I've already given you half anyway,

198
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,607
it should be okay if I give you
a little more, right?

199
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:43,346
I think... that it'll be okay.

200
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,754
No.

201
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:47,377
After the 100 days have passed,

202
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:50,222
and after we comfirm everything's ok.

203
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:54,590
Dae Woong, we have to be careful
until then and bear with it.

204
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:57,127
<i>Woong, you have to bear with it.</i>

205
00:13:57,206 --> 00:14:00,088
You can't be blinded by thought of mating
and give up life so easily!

206
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,376
How am I blind?

207
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:03,978
And the one who has to bear it is you.

208
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,880
<i>Who's the one who takes the initiative
everyday?</i>

209
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:09,326
I've never had those kinds of
thoughts before.

210
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:11,401
I'm just like this because
I'm worried about you.

211
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:14,819
Woong, I have those thoughts frequently.

212
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:20,232
So in order for me to bear with it,
you'll have to stay in another room.

213
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:21,766
What?

214
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,308
Hey, this is my room.

215
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:24,405
Where do you want me to go?

216
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:26,852
Didn't you hear what Grandpa said?

217
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:31,000
Because I have the bead in my womb,

218
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:34,322
I have to show that I'm living
 comfortably.

219
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:36,190
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:48,973
Right, I already gave her half of my life,

221
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:51,254
what's one room?

222
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,354
Thank you for understanding Dae Woong's
situation, Director.

223
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,567
There's no way around this kind
of situation.

224
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,855
My dear real action Mi Ho's got a
baby, it's really too bad.

225
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:13,394
I can't see her action anymore.

226
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:19,793
Do you know what's more agonizing
and depressing than that?

227
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:21,972
<i>Please tell me.</i>

228
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:24,502
I, Cha Min Sook...

229
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,714
am about to become a grandaunt.

230
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:29,447
Min Sook.

231
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:32,320
<i>I've never been a wife, nor a mother,</i>

232
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,889
but I'm going to be a grandaunt!

233
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:38,473
If it's just that, then
don't be too worried about it.

234
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:41,435
You don't want me to worry too much
about it?

235
00:15:41,536 --> 00:15:45,915
Min Sook, that round face of
yours is like a doll's face.

236
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:51,824
No one will call Miss Min Sook "Grandaunt".

237
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:54,224
You cutie!

238
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:59,555
Yes, a round doll's face.

239
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,602
That's very comforting.

240
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,811
I'm hanging up.

241
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:13,789
Can't you just say that you want me
to become your wife?

242
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:24,864
What's wrong? What are you looking for?

243
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:27,588
I keep getting thirsty.

244
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,219
Really?

245
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:33,058
Is everything else ok?

246
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,510
My stomach feels nauseous,

247
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,253
and my head feels dizzy.

248
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:40,252
Why am I like this?

249
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:43,583
When you're pregnant, that's how it is.

250
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:50,794
How great it must be, feeling nauseous
and dizzy.

251
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,254
There's nothing wrong, right?

252
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:07,965
Why am I burning up? It's hot.

253
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:15,751
Byung Soo,

254
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:18,551
How come Dae Woong's not 
going to China?

255
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:22,564
After a few months,
you'll find out naturally.

256
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:28,166
Seon Nyeo, now, you have to 
completely give up on Dae Woong.

257
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:29,736
I gave him up a long time ago!

258
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:31,103
He doesn't even like me!

259
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:33,335
You thought that I'd always have
an unrequited love?

260
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:35,007
Do I look like an idiot?

261
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,264
Is that right?

262
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:41,366
Being like that is being an idiot.

263
00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:47,012
Always guessing whether
he really liked me or not,

264
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:49,245
Of course I would do that! It was 
smart of me!

265
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:53,722
<i>From the very beginning,
his heart and his ring were mine.</i>

266
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:58,872
I was only measuring the time
to accept them...

267
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:03,471
But as a result, something squeezed
between us.

268
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:05,254
What?

269
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:06,716
He fell for her because
she followed him around

270
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:08,547
telling him she really, really,
really liked him?!

271
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:16,168
Hanging on with no pride,
sticking to him shamelessly,

272
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:20,674
Saying you can give up your life,
being so pitiful and idiotic!

273
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:25,595
Could you guys do it?

274
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:28,894
That's right.

275
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:30,950
Humans can't do that.

276
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:34,444
Because she's not a human,

277
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:36,899
she's able to do things
that humans aren't able to do.

278
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:42,331
And pretending to be a human...

279
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:45,445
I definitely won't let you go easily.

280
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,959
Who sent this?

281
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,696
<i>Keep a close eye on Mi Ho.</i>

282
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:02,792
<i>You will see something like this.</i>

283
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:05,409
Keep a close eye on Mi Ho?

284
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,072
What is it?

285
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:25,499
Now the human chi and the gumiho chi,

286
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,147
<i>are half and half.</i>

287
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:31,048
If they can mix together well,

288
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:34,661
It'll be half human, half monster.

289
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:39,436
Will she turn into the same as me?

290
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:56,091
How am I supposed to keep a close
watch on Mi Ho?

291
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:08,796
Mi Ho, what are you doing?

292
00:20:08,797 --> 00:20:10,768
Give me your chi.

293
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,868
What's wrong with you, all of a sudden?

294
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,763
Didn't you say you'll bear it?

295
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,418
Mi Ho!

296
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,369
There isn't enough.

297
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,934
I have to quench this unbearable thirst.

298
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:28,243
Let's share our chi.

299
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:30,605
Mi Ho, what's wrong with you?

300
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:32,119
Be rational!

301
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,474
<i>Dae Woong, Mi Ho.</i>

302
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,919
It's Aunt.

303
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,157
Give me some chi. Let's share our chi.

304
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,016
Dae Woong.

305
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:56,369
Mi Ho, are you sleeping?

306
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,582
Dae Woong.

307
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,660
They're not here.

308
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:16,917
Where'd they go?

309
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:20,971
Dae Woong, is that you?

310
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:25,439
Mi Ho, calm down.

311
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,103
Come back.

312
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:29,224
Give me your chi.

313
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:36,746
Bear with it.

314
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,559
You have to bear with it, Mi Ho.

315
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:40,334
Right now, you're half human!

316
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:42,040
Half?

317
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:45,948
My tails have been reduced by half.

318
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:49,972
I had nine and it's been reduced to five.

319
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:55,400
If this continues, all my tails
will be gone.

320
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,803
You, didn't you say that you wanted
all your tails to disappear?

321
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:07,528
The one making my tails disappear and
infusing me with human chi is you, right?

322
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,459
Give me my tails.

323
00:22:11,035 --> 00:22:12,692
<i>Dae Woong, are you in here?</i>

324
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:14,577
<i>Dae Woong, Mi Ho.</i>

325
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:16,299
That's right.

326
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:17,975
I'll give you tails.

327
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:24,666
What are you guys doing in here?

328
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:28,236
Just looking at things.

329
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:31,711
<i>It's a tail.</i>

330
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:34,648
It's a fox's tail.

331
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:39,988
Hey, that fox's tail is very expensive.

332
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,795
She's just looking.

333
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:46,821
Tail.

334
00:22:46,885 --> 00:22:48,275
One,

335
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:50,476
<i>two,</i>

336
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:52,877
<i>three,</i>

337
00:22:53,678 --> 00:22:55,278
four.

338
00:22:56,426 --> 00:23:00,291
- You can't touch those carelessly!
- I'll take care of it, Aunt.

339
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:03,010
Aunt, you should go out now.
Go out quickly.

340
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:06,148
What are you doing?

341
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:07,891
- Go.
- Ok! Fine!

342
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,380
Mi Ho, Mi Ho.

343
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:19,954
She's sleeping...

344
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:26,568
Has she finally calmed down now?

345
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:35,614
<i>The real fox saved me...</i>

346
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,354
I'm speechless.

347
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:44,665
Why're they acting like a honeymoon couple!

348
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:51,960
She might as well just buy
nine sets of fox haired coats.

349
00:23:57,021 --> 00:24:01,115
This looks like some sort of tail too...

350
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:03,017
Is there a blue tail?

351
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,699
Mi Ho, come back to your senses.

352
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,047
Mi Ho, are you okay?

353
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:17,918
Why are you here?

354
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:21,097
Are you okay now?

355
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:26,478
Woong, you can't be like this.

356
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:28,126
We agreed to bear with it.

357
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:30,304
You couldn't bear with it
for that short time?

358
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:32,285
Hey, what did I do?!

359
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,554
Even me, a gumiho, can bear it.

360
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:36,950
You, a human, can't do this.

361
00:24:38,414 --> 00:24:42,425
Hey, it was you who pounced
on me with hungry eyes first.

362
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:44,544
I was sleeping, but you came in...

363
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:47,299
and said,
"Let's share our chi"

364
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,837
Me?

365
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:52,062
I was sleeping the entire time!

366
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,087
We were almost discovered by my aunt.

367
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:02,291
You really don't remember?

368
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,427
I don't remember.

369
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:08,948
Are these side effects?

370
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:10,463
I don't know.

371
00:25:10,564 --> 00:25:11,389
Why am I like this?

372
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:14,408
Don't be too worried.

373
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,719
It looked like you had a lot of energy earlier.

374
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:20,590
Yeah! It's probably cause 
you got back the bead,

375
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:24,087
So you have a lot of energy
and went a little overboard.

376
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:27,762
What if I keep going around like this?

377
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:30,813
I'll watch over you.

378
00:25:30,914 --> 00:25:32,984
Don't worry.

379
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:41,815
Woong.

380
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:48,027
What are we going to do if I keep 
changing like this everyday?

381
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:55,584
Then I'll just keep guarding you
like this everyday.

382
00:25:55,952 --> 00:26:01,633
Then everyday you won't be able to 
sleep and you'll be very tired.

383
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:05,731
But we can be together every day.

384
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,397
Woong.

385
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,579
Everything's going to be ok.

386
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:17,648
Everything's going to be ok, Mi Ho.

387
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,919
What's this?

388
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:29,868
Mi Ho likes eating meat,
why didn't you prepare some meat?

389
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,816
Why eat meat this early in the morning?

390
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,686
We'll eat meat at dinner.

391
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:37,443
Yeah, Mi Ho can eat
vegetables now, right?

392
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:38,146
Meat.

393
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:40,231
<i>Give me meat.</i>

394
00:26:44,315 --> 00:26:47,104
Mi Ho, where's the meat?

395
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,979
The meat's over there, over there.
Let's go.

396
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,253
Grandpa, Aunt, we're finished eating.

397
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:58,686
I told you, you should've
prepared some meat!

398
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,581
Seriously.

399
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:04,505
Meat, where did we put the…

400
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:07,474
Mi Ho, why are you starting to change
again in the morning?

401
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,262
Isn't it a bit strange?

402
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:10,931
Meat.

403
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:14,939
Mi Ho, Ddoong Ja isn't meat.

404
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,309
Tail.

405
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:20,573
Mi Ho, this is Ddoong Ja's tail.

406
00:27:25,263 --> 00:27:30,130
Then, let's go to the second floor
to look for meat.

407
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:31,866
Aunt, get some rest.

408
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,492
Ah, it's irritating my eyeballs, seriously.

409
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:47,698
Mi Ho's changing more frequently.

410
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:57,473
Mi Ho, again?

411
00:27:57,574 --> 00:27:59,344
Give me your chi.

412
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:06,041
Mi Ho, guess where I am!

413
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:07,962
Of course I'm here.

414
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,046
Let's go upstairs quickly.

415
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,983
<i>Grandpa, you worked hard.</i>

416
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,651
Be careful of bead.

417
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:33,616
Woong.

418
00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:34,643
Are you okay?

419
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:37,181
I changed again, didn't I?

420
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:41,237
Why am I always like this?

421
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:42,985
I don't want to be like this.

422
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:46,984
I keep praying that I won't be
like this but I'm still changing.

423
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:52,311
Is it becuase I'm changing
back into the gumiho?

424
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,799
It looks like we can't keep
living here.

425
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,130
If it goes on,
you'll be discovered.

426
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:00,121
Let's go back to the attic room.

427
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:04,903
But how about what grandpa's misunderstanding?
He's so happy.

428
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,076
We'll have to tell the truth.

429
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:12,497
It's better to tell the truth earlier.

430
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:15,169
I'm sorry, it's all because of me.

431
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,053
It's not because of you.

432
00:29:18,894 --> 00:29:21,498
I really hate myself.

433
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:32,815
I thought that you would know more
about Mi Ho's condition.

434
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:34,808
So I came to ask you.

435
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,961
Gumiho's instincts are probably surfacing.

436
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:43,209
I don't care if Mi Ho turns back
completely.

437
00:29:44,035 --> 00:29:47,296
But her life won't be threatened, right?

438
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:49,124
I don't know about that either.

439
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:53,036
I only know that right now, inside her body,

440
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,683
she has half gumiho chi and half human chi.

441
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,308
The thing that can kill these two chi,
my half human-half monster's blood,

442
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:04,884
is also in her body.

443
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:07,584
<i>If the two types of chi blend properly,</i>

444
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:11,967
she'll become the same as me,
half-human and half-monster.

445
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,359
The same… as you.

446
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:22,341
If only that will happen, 
my blood will stop killing her.

447
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:25,549
If that doesn't happen?

448
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:34,149
The gumiho chi and the human chi
will both be killed and disappear.

449
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,437
Is there a way to find out now
if the two chi's are blending?

450
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:48,253
Soon, on the 55th day,
the fifth death will come.

451
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,559
If the fifth tail doesn't disappear,

452
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:57,540
that means my blood has stopped killing her.

453
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:03,679
If her tail doesn't disappear then
that means she can continue to live, right?

454
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,407
If it disappears,

455
00:31:06,508 --> 00:31:10,808
she's destined to die after the 100 days.

456
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,562
Come quickly.

457
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,742
We're going to take a family portrait!

458
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:30,695
Family portrait?

459
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:31,969
That's right.

460
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,392
Grandpa said that we have to take a
family portrait together with the bead.

461
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:38,308
Hurry up and come in.

462
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:39,852
<i>Come.</i>

463
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:45,109
What do we do?

464
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:48,379
After we take the picture,
I'll tell Grandpa.

465
00:31:48,995 --> 00:31:50,408
Ok, here we go.

466
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,737
<i>Smile. 1, 2, 3.</i>

467
00:31:56,384 --> 00:31:58,117
What did you say?

468
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:04,536
Mi Ho... isn't pregnant.

469
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:12,635
Grandpa misunderstood the bead.

470
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:15,833
What? Misunderstood?

471
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:19,277
How dare you lie about something
like that?!

472
00:32:20,214 --> 00:32:24,162
I was wrong, Grandpa.

473
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,245
No, Director.

474
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:02,421
I didn't lie because I wanted
to postpone filming the movie.

475
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:04,586
I'm really sorry but...

476
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:08,150
I might have to stay for a few
more days before going back.

477
00:33:10,276 --> 00:33:11,899
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

478
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:17,214
Let me stay a few more days 
in the action school attic room.

479
00:33:18,653 --> 00:33:22,513
Why are you putting people in such
difficult situations?

480
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:25,057
My dad's really pissed off this time.

481
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:27,269
Please understand my situation, okay?

482
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:45,604
Wow, we've come back home!

483
00:33:45,705 --> 00:33:47,212
Feels good, right?

484
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:52,194
Grandpa, the director and your friends...

485
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:53,871
They're all mad at you, huh?

486
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:56,653
It's not because of you.

487
00:33:59,525 --> 00:34:01,048
It's all right.

488
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:02,970
Everything will get better.

489
00:34:12,145 --> 00:34:13,903
Bead...

490
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,611
My poor little bead.

491
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:24,276
I got the picture but...

492
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:27,517
If I take it to grandpa,
he'll probably get angrier.

493
00:34:27,618 --> 00:34:31,481
Usually at our age, 
even if we had a bead,

494
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:34,183
most people would lie and deny it.

495
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,788
But why did you lie about
a bead that doesn't exist?

496
00:34:40,025 --> 00:34:41,925
I had no choice.

497
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:45,217
Are you really planning on marrying
Mi Ho within this year? 

498
00:34:45,323 --> 00:34:47,827
Wasn't your dream to live a 
glorious single life until you're 40,

499
00:34:47,928 --> 00:34:50,495
And then have a child at 45 like Brad Pitt?

500
00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:52,594
Wasn't it like that?

501
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:58,639
I have to live twice as fast
as other people.

502
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,766
I don't have any time to waste.

503
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:15,622
Today is the day the fifth tail
is supposed to disappear.

504
00:35:15,723 --> 00:35:17,836
Even if you didn't come here to tell me,

505
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:19,516
I remember it clearly.

506
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,484
If her tail disappears tonight,

507
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:26,651
that means her death hasn't stopped
but is continuing.

508
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,852
Wow, it came out great!

509
00:35:48,953 --> 00:35:52,144
Grandpa was so happy at that time.

510
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:03,619
It has to blend properly no matter what.

511
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:07,247
It has to blend properly.

512
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:09,437
And please...

513
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:12,072
Just stop like this.

514
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:14,195
Woong, what's wrong with you?

515
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:16,623
What do you want to stop?

516
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:21,831
Are you telling me to stop
changing into that weird thing?

517
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:26,695
Woong, I'm sorry.

518
00:36:26,723 --> 00:36:29,415
I change unconsciously so...

519
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:32,062
<i>I can't make it stop.</i>

520
00:36:33,606 --> 00:36:37,496
What if my tails start to change too?

521
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:38,920
No, that won't do.

522
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:43,045
You have to stop right now
at five tails!

523
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:46,947
<i>Mi Ho.</i>

524
00:36:46,993 --> 00:36:49,955
There isn't much time left until
the 100th day.

525
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,533
Don't ever change and...

526
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:56,012
just persevere until
the end of the 100 days.

527
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,592
I'm so afraid that you'll change...

528
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,544
You can do it, right?

529
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,588
Looks like because of me,
he's really having a hard time.

530
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:36,996
There's still a lot of time until
the 100th day.

531
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:41,472
He can't get exhausted already.

532
00:37:56,967 --> 00:38:02,997
As long as nothing happens tonight...
If it passes smoothly, it'll be good.

533
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:06,634
Please blend well.

534
00:38:07,456 --> 00:38:09,518
And stop here.

535
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,841
My tail...

536
00:38:17,113 --> 00:38:18,873
Mi Ho, what's wrong?

537
00:38:26,878 --> 00:38:28,923
My tail's changed.

538
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,417
Mi Ho, what's wrong?

539
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:31,670
Did it start to hurt again?

540
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:33,726
<i>No, it doesn't hurt.</i>

541
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:35,815
<i>I have the bead.</i>

542
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:38,234
Then what's wrong?

543
00:38:46,836 --> 00:38:48,344
Mi Ho, hurry up and come out!

544
00:38:48,445 --> 00:38:49,906
Did something happen?

545
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:52,885
Dae Woong!

546
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:56,572
My tail has disappeared.

547
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:01,169
It's... gone?!

548
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,170
Yeah!

549
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:07,670
Recently I've been so weird 
so I worried that my tails would grow back...

550
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:10,406
<i>But one more disappeared, Woong.</i>

551
00:39:10,507 --> 00:39:12,956
I think I'm becoming a human!

552
00:39:15,327 --> 00:39:16,950
Really?

553
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:20,272
Woong, you're not happy?

554
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:22,984
I said I'm becoming a human!

555
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:28,770
Whether you're becoming a 
human or not, how do you know?

556
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:35,036
Woong.

557
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:41,798
Death isn't stopping.

558
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:46,980
What do I do?

559
00:39:59,602 --> 00:40:02,827
I thought that he'd be happy
my tail disappeared.

560
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,727
Did I make him uneasy again?

561
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,790
Woong.

562
00:40:32,757 --> 00:40:36,056
You go to sleep first.
I'll just be out for a bit.

563
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:38,934
Dae Woong.

564
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,265
Are you going out becuase you're afraid
that I might change back into my scary form?

565
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:45,232
If it's like that, stay here and
don't go.

566
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,031
I will stay outside.

567
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:50,048
<i>If you're feeling uneasy,
then lock the door.</i>

568
00:40:50,896 --> 00:40:52,864
Oh right...

569
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:55,127
Because of me last time, the lock's broken.

570
00:40:55,229 --> 00:40:58,628
I'm not uneasy because of that so
go inside.

571
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:02,735
I might be late so don't wait up
and go to sleep first.

572
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:23,023
To stop the death, we have to stop 
the gumiho and human chi from fighting.

573
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,804
So how can we stop it?

574
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:29,255
I can't go inside Mi Ho and tell them
not to fight and pull them apart!

575
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:31,442
You CAN stop it.

576
00:41:31,578 --> 00:41:35,880
If you leave her side, then it can happen.

577
00:41:35,981 --> 00:41:36,904
What?

578
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:41,002
The main reason why the gumiho chi
can't combine with the human chi...

579
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:44,426
is because her determination
to become human is too powerful.

580
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,183
And the one pushing her to become human...
is you.

581
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:59,242
Then you're saying...I'm pushing
her to die?!

582
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:01,874
That's right.

583
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:05,757
I... it doesn't matter to me if
she's a gumiho.

584
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:07,150
Mi Ho knows it too.

585
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:11,150
But you were happy with her,
that she'll become human...

586
00:42:11,251 --> 00:42:16,098
and didn't you plan your human lives
together?

587
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:19,614
As long as she continues planning
by your side,

588
00:42:20,694 --> 00:42:25,090
death can NOT stop.

589
00:42:39,403 --> 00:42:41,835
<i>You can't be by her side.</i>

590
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,754
When you are no longer by her side,

591
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:47,899
her desire to become human
will slowly disappear.

592
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:52,221
And she will be able to 
accept her current condition.

593
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:55,569
Didn't you say that if one lives,
the other one has to die?

594
00:42:55,666 --> 00:43:00,557
But now for both to live, we can't be
together and have to separate?

595
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:05,999
Your decision to be together
whether you lived or died,

596
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:11,719
Isn't it fortunate that we found a way
for both of you to live?

597
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:15,520
Once again, as the man who loves her,

598
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:20,510
think about what you can do...
choose carefully and decide.

599
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:30,234
If you leave, then I will stay by her side
so she can become like me

600
00:43:31,423 --> 00:43:34,287
and exist in this world.

601
00:43:43,374 --> 00:43:46,751
Only when I'm no longer by her side...

602
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:53,135
Mi Ho can live?

603
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:11,986
Dae Woong!

604
00:44:19,985 --> 00:44:22,036
Why didn't you sleep and come out here?

605
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:26,504
Woong, I feel much better after
the tail disappeared.

606
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:30,702
<i>My stomach doesn't feel nauseous
and my head isn't dizzy either.</i>

607
00:44:30,803 --> 00:44:34,263
Every time my tails disappear,
I'll get better, right?

608
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,423
You're really happy about that?

609
00:44:37,524 --> 00:44:40,260
Of course! My tails HAVE to disappear so

610
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:42,782
we can start our life plan together...

611
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:46,084
And we can make grandpa truly happy.

612
00:44:47,456 --> 00:44:50,763
Mi Ho, I like you just like this too.

613
00:44:50,864 --> 00:44:53,046
Didn't I say that it's all right?

614
00:44:54,412 --> 00:44:59,333
Can't you just give up those things
and stay by my side like this?

615
00:44:59,434 --> 00:45:02,355
Woong, don't give up.

616
00:45:02,456 --> 00:45:07,018
Teacher Dong Ju's blood that's in my body
will absorb all the gumiho chi,

617
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,883
and as long as the chi you gave me is safe,

618
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:11,324
I can become human.

619
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:13,643
What's so good about becoming human?

620
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:17,641
You'll feel pain, get old and die!

621
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:19,920
I want to do that.

622
00:45:21,107 --> 00:45:25,066
I want to do all of that 
by your side, with you.

623
00:45:26,313 --> 00:45:33,847
While I'm by your side,
I probably won't be able to stop you...

624
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:40,421
As long as you're by my side,
everything will be all right.

625
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,626
<i>If it just stops like this,</i>

626
00:45:50,113 --> 00:45:55,363
does that mean,
I too, will have a chance?

627
00:46:06,753 --> 00:46:13,335
<i>Back then, I didn't know about love</i>

628
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:17,861
<i>Staying by the side of someone</i>

629
00:46:17,977 --> 00:46:21,094
<i>I feel unfamiliar and scared
by this kind of thing</i>

630
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:28,653
<i>Only now, I understand love</i>

631
00:46:28,754 --> 00:46:32,251
<i>Saying that it wasn't love between us</i>

632
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:35,137
<i>Thanks for the trust you had in me</i>

633
00:46:37,025 --> 00:46:42,946
<i>Looking back now,
there were a lot of memories</i>

634
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:49,718
<i>I really didn't know that
it was actually love</i>

635
00:46:49,819 --> 00:46:56,785
<i>I love you
Words from the bottom of my heart</i>

636
00:46:56,886 --> 00:47:04,437
<i>I love you
Words which I would say a thousand times</i>

637
00:47:04,538 --> 00:47:08,281
<i>Until now I haven't given you anything</i>

638
00:47:08,382 --> 00:47:11,185
<i>So I want to start telling you more now</i>

639
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:17,104
<i>Words that I would like to tell only you</i>

640
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:25,477
<i>I love you
Words from the bottom of my heart</i>

641
00:47:25,578 --> 00:47:33,130
<i>I love you
Words which I would say a thousand times</i>

642
00:47:33,231 --> 00:47:36,853
<i>Until now I haven't given you anything</i>

643
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,904
<i>So I want to start telling you more now</i>

644
00:47:39,905 --> 00:47:44,672
<i>Words that I would like to tell only you</i>

645
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:47,597
Woong, this is our first time
driving and going somewhere fun.

646
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,557
It's great!

647
00:47:51,723 --> 00:47:53,982
But where are we going?

648
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,395
Are we going to the zoo again?

649
00:47:56,453 --> 00:47:58,530
<i>If we're going out, you
should've told me earlier.</i>

650
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:00,728
I could've prepared a lunchbox.

651
00:48:00,852 --> 00:48:02,977
I always wanted to roll kimbap.

652
00:48:03,078 --> 00:48:04,915
We're not going out to play.

653
00:48:05,057 --> 00:48:06,937
Then where are we going?

654
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,012
Are we going to Grandpa?

655
00:48:10,112 --> 00:48:12,500
Did Grandpa call us over to eat?

656
00:48:12,977 --> 00:48:14,499
No.

657
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:16,763
Then where are we going?

658
00:48:19,573 --> 00:48:22,492
We're going to Teacher Dong Ju.

659
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,305
Why are we going there?

660
00:48:28,604 --> 00:48:29,416
Mi Ho,

661
00:48:30,944 --> 00:48:34,611
I can't go on any longer.

662
00:48:36,155 --> 00:48:37,072
Woong.

663
00:48:38,194 --> 00:48:42,680
Do I... have to be by your side?

664
00:48:44,082 --> 00:48:44,748
What?

665
00:48:45,171 --> 00:48:49,192
The way you keep strangely changing...
I can't bear it anymore.

666
00:48:51,068 --> 00:48:55,194
I'm scared of what you'll turn into next.

667
00:48:56,155 --> 00:48:58,180
I'm worried that we'll get caught by 
other people.

668
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:01,908
<i>I should be busy working but...</i>

669
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,001
I have to be chained down by you.

670
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,144
It's frustrating and annoying.

671
00:49:08,224 --> 00:49:09,671
I won't be like that.

672
00:49:09,772 --> 00:49:10,889
I can stop being like that.

673
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,244
Go to Teacher Dong Ju.

674
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,189
What?

675
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:20,770
Right now, 
I'm taking you to Teacher Dong Ju.

676
00:49:20,802 --> 00:49:22,258
Dae Woong.

677
00:49:22,482 --> 00:49:24,760
You've had a hard time because of me,
huh?

678
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:25,976
I'm sorry.

679
00:49:26,077 --> 00:49:28,528
From now on, I won't make
you worried about me anymore.

680
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,759
I'm not going to Teacher Dong Ju.

681
00:49:31,236 --> 00:49:32,372
Let's go home.

682
00:49:47,816 --> 00:49:48,771
Get out.

683
00:50:00,253 --> 00:50:05,410
Because I was with you for so long,
I lost it for a little bit...

684
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:11,315
But watching you keep changing, 
I've suddenly woken up.

685
00:50:12,282 --> 00:50:14,698
- Dae Woong...
- If you really can become human,

686
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:17,151
I might be able to bear it.

687
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:21,260
But right now, you can't guarantee
that you'll become like that.

688
00:50:21,972 --> 00:50:25,830
I'm scared, uneasy, annoyed and frustrated so...

689
00:50:28,307 --> 00:50:30,868
I can't look at you anymore.

690
00:50:34,343 --> 00:50:36,697
So you leave.

691
00:50:37,156 --> 00:50:39,477
When I told you to leave before,

692
00:50:40,118 --> 00:50:42,471
you left quietly, right?

693
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,682
I'll ask you again,

694
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:48,428
Please leave.

695
00:50:49,512 --> 00:50:51,176
Dae Woong, don't be like this.

696
00:50:51,277 --> 00:50:53,577
I'm scared. Don't be like this.

697
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,166
Go to Teacher Dong Ju,

698
00:50:57,202 --> 00:51:00,567
and live with the identity of
Park Sun Ju that he made for you.

699
00:51:00,821 --> 00:51:06,060
That way, I won't feel bad about this either.

700
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:08,600
And don't you ever...

701
00:51:11,222 --> 00:51:13,533
appear in front of me again.

702
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:29,838
Dae Woong.

703
00:51:33,488 --> 00:51:40,481
<i>I love you
Words from the bottom of my heart</i>

704
00:51:44,474 --> 00:51:47,496
Dae Woong really left.

705
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,523
He threw me away and left.

706
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:25,374
Dae Woong's like that
'cause he's tired.

707
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,058
Dae Woong's like that
'cause he's tired.

708
00:52:28,923 --> 00:52:31,274
I just have to be good again.

709
00:52:50,588 --> 00:52:52,468
Dae Woong, what's wrong?

710
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:57,150
Stop drinking!
How many bottles has it been already?!

711
00:52:58,786 --> 00:53:02,579
Right now, I have to go completely crazy.

712
00:53:04,095 --> 00:53:06,623
She definitely won't leave at once.

713
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:08,848
She'll come back.

714
00:53:10,331 --> 00:53:14,186
Then I'll have to go completely crazy.

715
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:16,848
And act like an insane person.

716
00:53:29,469 --> 00:53:31,161
<i>One moment.</i>

717
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:34,714
<i>Hey!</i>

718
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,101
I was always curious what you were
trying to get from Dae Woong by enticing him.

719
00:53:43,523 --> 00:53:46,317
<i>I heard that you took
half of Dae Woong's life away.</i>

720
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,108
I knew I was right...

721
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:52,337
your existence will harm Dae Woong.

722
00:53:52,773 --> 00:53:55,944
You hate that I'm by Dae Woong's side
THAT much?

723
00:53:56,045 --> 00:53:57,410
Yeah!

724
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:02,360
I regret so much not being able
to capture Dae Woong's heart.

725
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:07,835
Because if only I accepted his heart, 
and the two us were dating...

726
00:54:08,347 --> 00:54:11,277
You wouldn't have been able
to get involved and harm him.

727
00:54:11,478 --> 00:54:16,090
You really believe that I'm only
harming Dae Woong when I'm by his side?

728
00:54:17,024 --> 00:54:18,785
Then you're not?

729
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:24,615
Ah, you said that you don't have
a conscience or pride, right?

730
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:28,263
<i>So that's why you can stick to him
without any shame.</i>

731
00:54:30,443 --> 00:54:33,565
When you said giving Dae Woong
the bead would be helpful to him,

732
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:36,045
I was able to bear with you.

733
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:40,684
But you weren't helping him...

734
00:54:40,897 --> 00:54:43,662
You used him because you needed him.

735
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:49,078
You're really a monster.

736
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,775
Dae Woong!

737
00:55:12,864 --> 00:55:17,251
Mi Ho, Dae Woong's really drunk.

738
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:19,168
<i>I tried to stop him,</i>

739
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:23,556
but he kept saying he has to go crazy
and wouldn't let me.

740
00:55:26,395 --> 00:55:29,624
He wasn't the type to drink alcohol
to clear his anger.

741
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:32,331
<i>But it seems like he's really having
a difficult time.</i>

742
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:34,412
You should comfort him well.

743
00:55:34,506 --> 00:55:35,972
I'm leaving.

744
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,968
Did I make it that difficult for you?

745
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,742
Woong, drink some water.

746
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:09,441
Why are you here?

747
00:56:09,461 --> 00:56:13,179
Just because you tell me to leave,
do you think I'll leave so obediently?

748
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,278
I'm super strength instant glue.

749
00:56:16,438 --> 00:56:19,135
If you're not leaving, then I'll leave.

750
00:56:23,038 --> 00:56:24,799
Dae Woong.

751
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:30,087
I'll go with you.

752
00:56:32,729 --> 00:56:37,070
Woong, if you're mad at me,
then you can get angry.

753
00:56:37,187 --> 00:56:39,690
Lose your temper and pull
a long face, it's all right.

754
00:56:39,859 --> 00:56:41,981
<i>You can do whatever you want.</i>

755
00:56:42,082 --> 00:56:44,018
I will take all of it.

756
00:56:44,145 --> 00:56:47,777
Until 100 days run out,
I can bear all of it.

757
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:49,542
You really…

758
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:53,073
You've already gave half of your life
to me, right?

759
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:55,898
Starting from now, you don't have
to do anything.

760
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:57,484
<i>Until all my tails have disappeared</i>

761
00:56:57,585 --> 00:57:00,099
<i>and I've become a human,
leave it all to me.</i>

762
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,628
You just have to stay by my side.

763
00:57:06,344 --> 00:57:07,997
I don't want to.

764
00:57:09,572 --> 00:57:11,412
I don't like having you by my side.

765
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:18,015
Even if you somehow become human,
your essence is still gumiho.

766
00:57:18,324 --> 00:57:21,103
Perhaps people who don't know
can see you as a human...

767
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:24,064
but in my eyes, it's not like that.

768
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:29,574
Then, what am I in your eyes?

769
00:57:30,578 --> 00:57:33,742
Recently my eyes keep seeing you...

770
00:57:36,794 --> 00:57:37,919
as a monster.

771
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,536
<i>I still don't understand love</i>

772
00:57:42,637 --> 00:57:47,226
<i>So I'm unable to get closer</i>

773
00:57:47,327 --> 00:57:58,035
<i>But why does my silly heart keep pounding?</i>

774
00:57:58,236 --> 00:58:03,107
<i>I come across you again and again</i>

775
00:58:03,308 --> 00:58:07,869
<i>I just can't escape</i>

776
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:17,767
<i>Towards this helpless love,
my heart hurts endlessly</i>

777
00:58:17,868 --> 00:58:28,822
<i>A day has passed, all I think about is you</i>

778
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:33,617
<i>The pitiful and foolish me</i>

779
00:58:33,618 --> 00:58:39,515
<i>What should I do?</i>

780
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:44,204
<i>The heart following love</i>

781
00:58:44,305 --> 00:58:49,172
<i>What am going to do?</i>

782
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:55,160
<i>My heart hurts so much
from this hopeless love</i>

783
00:59:38,168 --> 00:59:40,008
[One month later]

784
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:47,714
<i>Thank you everyone, for your hard work.</i>

785
00:59:47,815 --> 00:59:50,376
Starting from next week, we'll start filming
at the studio.

786
00:59:50,377 --> 00:59:52,451
Everyone go back and rest well.

787
00:59:52,486 --> 00:59:55,134
Okay, everybody worked hard.

788
00:59:59,535 --> 01:00:00,235
You've worked hard.

789
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,576
Miss Hae In, you've worked hard.

790
01:00:06,205 --> 01:00:07,514
Director.

791
01:00:07,952 --> 01:00:11,761
Yes, our Mr. Cha, you've worked hard too.

792
01:00:11,862 --> 01:00:13,981
Director, you too.

793
01:00:17,879 --> 01:00:19,301
Director!

794
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:22,948
Min Sook!

795
01:00:24,114 --> 01:00:25,859
Dad!

796
01:00:31,432 --> 01:00:33,127
Let go.

797
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:35,888
Oh, you're back.

798
01:00:35,989 --> 01:00:37,386
Grandpa.

799
01:00:39,451 --> 01:00:43,466
But, your face has gotten so thin in a month!

800
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:45,249
It probably 'cause I got so tanned.

801
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,350
I ate very well and lived very well too.

802
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:48,638
I didn't get injured either.

803
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:50,303
I've come back nice and healthy.

804
01:00:50,404 --> 01:00:53,014
Really? Let's eat first.

805
01:00:53,118 --> 01:00:56,882
Aunt made a lot of things that
you like.

806
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,782
I'm going to clean up and change first.

807
01:01:00,883 --> 01:01:01,491
Okay.

808
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:09,975
Mi Ho didn't go to meet Dae Woong?

809
01:01:11,445 --> 01:01:14,835
After Dae Woong went to China, she
moved out of the place they lived in,

810
01:01:14,936 --> 01:01:17,045
and never even went back once.

811
01:01:17,146 --> 01:01:20,130
It looks like they've completely broken up.

812
01:01:50,726 --> 01:01:55,090
Today is the 88th day.

813
01:01:58,977 --> 01:02:01,412
There aren't many days left.

814
01:02:03,922 --> 01:02:06,265
She should be ok... right?

815
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,647
If you do this survey, we'll give you
a complimentary gift.

816

Please fill one out.

817
01:02:42,248 --> 01:02:44,391
It closed down.

818
01:02:45,822 --> 01:02:50,696
Looks like they left together for
a faraway place.

819
01:02:50,797 --> 01:02:57,797
<i>Back then, I didn't know about love</i>

820
01:02:58,198 --> 01:03:01,698
<i>Staying by the side of someone,</i>

821
01:03:01,799 --> 01:03:04,899
<i>I feel unfamiliar and scared
with this kind of thing</i>

822
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,293
Thank you.

823
01:03:13,112 --> 01:03:14,816
Oh, excuse me, miss.

824
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,918
<i>You didn't fill out the name.</i>

825
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:23,000

834
01:03:54,802 --> 01:03:58,740
no one will be unprotected
by the Republic of Korea.

835
01:03:58,898 --> 01:04:02,359
That's my reason for becoming President.

<i>Game?</i>

01:04:04,563 --> 01:04:07,561
You thought it was because I have something
to gain that I intervened with this matter?

838
01:04:08,109 --> 01:04:12,633
<i>You didn't know that I became a prosecutor
to capture members of the legislature?</i>
