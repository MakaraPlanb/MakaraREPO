Episode 9

4
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:15,097
Even though I'm different from you,

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,867
can't you like me?

6
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,092
Grandfather.

7
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:43,894
You two can't be together anymore!

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,561
Break up!

9
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:48,541
Cha Dae Woong!

10
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:50,288
Pack your things!

11
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:55,113
Grandfather, Aunt.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,776
I said there's nothing wrong with me.

13
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:58,748
I heard the doctor said so!

14
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:00,852
I heard you were really hurt!

15
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,066
How could you lie about that, you punk!

16
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:05,813
I was hurt but I'm fine now.

17
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:06,763
What?

18
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:07,838
See!

19
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:09,790
He really was hurt!

20
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:12,131
It will be really bad if we just let him be!

21
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:13,853
End it all!

22
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:15,298
Come home now!

23
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:16,904
Pack your things now!

24
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,053
If I stay here with Mi Ho,
nothing will be wrong.

25
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:27,549
See, father!

26
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,179
That girl is pushing him!

27
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:33,350
I don't like that kind of girl either.

28
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,975
End it with that Mi Ho girl!

29
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,656
No, he can't!

30
00:01:43,963 --> 00:01:45,913
It's hurting again.

31
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:49,339
Grandfather.

32
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,646
You told me to start being responsible
and become a real human,

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,680
how can you tell me to end everything?

34
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:54,368
What?

35
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:55,748
Just like you wanted,

36
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:57,214
like a human I'm not going to quit,

37
00:01:57,293 --> 00:02:00,208
and I'm going to take full responsibility
so you give up and just go.

38
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:01,453
What?

39
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:04,732
That...

40
00:02:04,873 --> 00:02:06,715
That punk!

41
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:17,279
Grandfather and aunt don't even know.

42
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,548
What's wrong with you?

43
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:23,216
Woong...

44
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,718
I...

45
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,878
- Are you...
- Aigoo!

46
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,282
<i>Father! Dae Woong!</i>

47
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:31,018
<i>- Dae Woong!
- Hold on.</i>

48
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,565
<i>Father, are you okay?</i>

49
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:33,800
<i>Father!</i>

50
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:34,859
<i>Father!</i>

51
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:36,343
- Grandfather, what's wrong?
- Dae Woong!

52
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,603
Are you sick? Are you okay?

53
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:44,347
Get on my back!
- Wake up, father!

54
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,370
Father!
- Let's go.

55
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:51,402
Oh right. Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

56
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:55,373
I'm going to the hospital so just wait.

57
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:56,427
Yeah.

58
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:57,352
Grandfather, let's go.

59
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:58,549
<i>Okay.</i>

60
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:05,341
How could she not even
look outside to check?

61
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,973
It hurts so much.

62
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,572
It hurts so much this time.

63
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:55,501
Today should be her first death.

64
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,651
One of my tails disappeared.

65
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:26,594
I really am dying.

66
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:35,894
Grandfather, just hold on.

67
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:40,927
Aunt, if you take a right turn there,
it's the hospital.

68
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:42,946
Soon OK.

69
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:45,841
Grandfather, are you okay?

70
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:49,884
You're okay?

71
00:04:50,338 --> 00:04:51,959
<i>Cha Dae Woong.</i>

72
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:58,415
If you just go back now,
I'm not going to drink a drop of water.

73
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,677
If you don't want to see me faint,

74
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:03,817
come with us quietly.

75
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,430
Seriously!

76
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,468
Aunt, stop the car.

77
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:27,343
Just go.

78
00:05:27,448 --> 00:05:29,096
Aunt, stop! Stop for just a moment.

79
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,768
Cha Dae Woong!

80
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:33,125
Even if you don't stop, I'm getting out!

81
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:39,406
You!

82
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,941
I'll just go check if she's okay
and I'll come home.

83
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:43,222
<i>What?</i>

84
00:05:44,232 --> 00:05:46,046
- Don't get out!
- Cha Dae Woong!

85
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:49,427
<i>The person I'll love</i>

86
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:53,210
<i>I wish you'd look at me</i>

87
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:57,789
<i>Because although I may seem different</i>

88
00:05:57,897 --> 00:06:00,316
<i>I feel the same way</i>

89
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,832
<i>I'm staring into your eyes</i>

90
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:08,196
<i>So I don't have courage</i>

91
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:11,008
Mi Ho!

92
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,972
Are you okay?

93
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:16,985
Yeah.

94
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:18,376
You weren't sick?

95
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:19,823
No.

96
00:06:20,027 --> 00:06:21,291
I'm okay.

97
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,258
I thought you were sick.

98
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:25,647
I'm not sick.

99
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,247
I'm a gumiho who can even break walls.

100
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:32,728
I'm not a "weak woman", like this.

101
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,782
Why are you so cold?

102
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:40,532
Ah...

103
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,821
It must because I'm so tired.

104
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:47,118
From working too hard cleaning the grills.

105
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:50,450
Of course a girl who was locked up
for five hundred years,

106
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,338
and suddenly works so hard would get tired!

107
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:59,749
Don't clean grills anymore.

108
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,379
That place made a lot of money.

109
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:13,587
How many grills did they make you clean
for a gumiho to get tired?

110
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,339
I should have complained more.

111
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:20,769
Should I go again right now?

112
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:22,202
Dae Woong.

113
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,182
Don't do that.

114
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:27,350
That ahjusshi was really scared.

115
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:29,785
Don't be scary because of me.

116
00:07:29,913 --> 00:07:32,585
I'm only holding back because of you.

117
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:42,046
There's a lot of meat and soda at home.

118
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,717
Eat it and rest.

119
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,149
And take breaks while you take care
of the action school.

120
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:50,178
You have to go back?

121
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:52,530
Is your grandfather really sick?

122
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:57,302
If I don't go, he'll start being sick
so I need to go back now.

123
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:01,804
I saw that you're okay
so I won't be worried and go.

124
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:04,369
When are you coming back?

125
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:10,564
I need to stay with my grandfather
until I can set his mind at ease.

126
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:16,062
If I go now, it'll take a couple days.

127
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,445
You can be by yourself, right?

128
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,407
Yeah.

129
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:21,943
I even have money I made.

130
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:23,044
Don't worry.

131
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:27,262
When grandfather gets better,
come back to our home quickly.

132
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:28,534
Okay.

133
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:30,430
I'll be back.

134
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:46,632
Our home?

135
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:50,670
Why is this our home?

136
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:54,570
I got confused again.

137
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,742
Have I lost my mind?

138
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,046
<i>Woong!</i>

139
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,167
Dae Woong.

140
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:14,396
Can you come back before the flowers
you gave me wilt?

141
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:31,109
What's wrong with this?

142
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,769
It's indecisive too.

143
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:43,729
On and off.

144
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,477
I'm so confused.

145
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,859
My head hurts.

146
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:15,673
With my mind confused,
I think it's possible.

147
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:17,241
What?

148
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:27,630
It's a warning to come to my senses.

149
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:31,930
Yes.

150
00:10:32,374 --> 00:10:34,545
I need to come to my senses.

151
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,993
I'm going.

152
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,092
Woong!

153
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:43,839
I'll be waiting.

154
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:59,161
It's not coming on now.

155
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:03,162
It must have gone out completely.

156
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,889
Yes.

157
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:17,992
This is my home and I need to live
with the lights shining bright,

158
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,180
and with all my senses gathered.

159
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,292
It's better this way.

160
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:30,209
It'll be good for my mental health
to be away from her for a while.

161
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:37,437
One of my tails disappeared.

162
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:39,110
Now I'm a palmiho*!
[*gu=9; pal=8]

163
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:42,506
It must have hurt as much as losing a life.

164
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:44,282
You still like it?

165
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:47,592
It hurt a lot yesterday but now
I've forgotten all about it.

166
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:50,839
You have eight more times of that pain left.

167
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:53,601
And it will hurt more and more each time.

168
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:56,093
It'll hurt more?

169
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,103
I don't like it hurting more.

170
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:04,095
Then when it starts to hurt,
stay next to Cha Dae Woong.

171
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:07,417
If your bead is nearby, it will hurt less.

172
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,935
No.

173
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,617
I don't want to show Dae Woong
that sort of thing.

174
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,206
Figures.

175
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:18,330
You can't tell him that you're
becoming human, right?

176
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:21,021
If Cha Dae Woong knew,
he'd hate it and run away.

177
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,870
I think I'll be able to tell him soon!

178
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:25,097
Dae Woong said he doesn't hate me.

179
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:27,782
Just because he doesn't hate you,
doesn't mean he'll start liking you.

180
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:29,290
Dae Woong even gave me flowers.

181
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,944
You've never seen such
pretty flowers, right?

182
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:34,785
It's nice that you got a bouquet,

183
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,959
but it seems like you made a mistake
in begging him to like you.

184
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:39,577
Why?

185
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:40,589
He ran away.

186
00:12:40,714 --> 00:12:41,673
No!

187
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,476
He left because his grandfather was sick.

188
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:46,611
You said he's not sick.

189
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:52,542
He ran away in order to avoid
your uncomfortable gaze.

190
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:58,050
Don't look at me with such resentful eyes.

191
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,970
Acknowledge the truth.

192
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,444
And that grandfather took him away
because he didn't like you.

193
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:07,333
He might never send him back.

194
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,248
Teacher Dong Ju is bad!

195
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:12,340
Teacher Dong Ju is a dog* teacher!
[dog = mild curse word, eg crap]

196
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,609
Where did you learn that adding
the word dog makes it a curse?

197
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,203
I'm calling you a dog teacher because
you are a dog teacher!

198
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:26,399
Well you're a fox,
so I'll call you a foxy girl.

199
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,810
Good for you, dog teacher!

200
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,923
Give me that!

201
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:54,066
She left it behind.

202
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:06,319
He'll come back.

203
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:08,601
He won't come back.

204
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,402
He'll come back.

205
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:12,203
He won't come back.

206
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:13,744
He'll come back.

207
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,283
He won't come back!

208
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:22,841
Glaring Eyes.

209
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,366
Did something happen?

210
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:27,144
Ahjumma.

211
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:32,213
My boyfriend got taken away
by his grandfather.

212
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,055
You must have made a bad impression
on your grandfather-in-law.

213
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:38,844
Usually, when a man gets caught by
the in-laws, he doesn't come back.

214
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:39,784
In-laws?

215
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:43,822
The grandfather is your grandfather-in-law
and that family is your in-laws.

216
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:45,957
How's the mother-in-law?

217
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,015
Ah, the person who yells and glares?

218
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:50,565
Dae Woong's aunt is like that.

219
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:54,903
You made a bad impression
on the aunt-in-law too.

220
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:57,275
It's over.

221
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:08,603
<i>We don't even know where
you're from, you girl!</i>

222
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:11,144
You dare to go for my grandson?

223
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:14,654
<i>You're also much older than our Min Ho!</i>

224
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:19,285
I'm six hundred how many more years older?

225
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:23,060
And you have two burdens too?

226
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:25,607
I still have eight tails left!

227
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,385
Please accept.

228
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:30,129
<i>I love Min Ho.</i>

229
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:31,002
Accept her!

230
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:31,925
Accept her!

231
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,575
You shameless thing.

232
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:37,552
You're not even human!

233
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:41,986
Father, have some porridge.
- Okay.

234
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:53,648
Why is the porridge so plain?

235
00:15:53,838 --> 00:15:57,157
Why didn't you secretly add some meat?

236
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:58,414
Father.

237
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:02,177
There's no need for you to pretend
to be sick and only eat porridge.

238
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:03,888
<i>Dae Woong is quiet.</i>

239
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:06,243
Come outside and eat rice.

240
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:09,005
That's strange.

241
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:18,740
I was ready to fight with him for four days
and three nights if we brought him back.

242
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,347
Why is he so calm?

243
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:23,277
It's really strange.

244
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:28,664
Normally, he would have run away
at least 12 times,

245
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,691
and he would have flipped over
the dinner table at least 10 times.

246
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,608
He's really quiet now.

247
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:41,038
Has he finally matured?

248
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:46,041
Let's come to my senses
and look at it carefully.

249
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:48,089
Mi Ho is a fox.

250
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:55,248
Ddoong Ja you're a dog, Mi Ho is a fox.

251
00:16:58,187 --> 00:16:59,541
<i>It's scary, right?</i>

252
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,081
Ddoong Ja, do you like me?

253
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,539
But I can't accept your feelings.

254
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:12,302
Because I'm a human.

255
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:18,243
Yeah.

256
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:24,576
If I keep thinking of Mi Ho as a fox,
I won't be confused anymore.

257
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:28,570
Mi Ho is a fox.

258
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,586
A scary...

259
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,296
fox.

260
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:45,781
But looking carefully, the fox doesn't
look as scary as I thought.

261
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:50,996
It's eyes are round so it looks cute.

262
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,880
And it sort of looks like Mi Ho.

263
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:05,923
But she hasn't called once.

264
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:08,762
Ddoong Ja.

265
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:12,069
You're curious about Mi Ho, right?

266
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,766
Do you want to go see her?

267
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,944
Did grandfather eat?

268
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:23,890
Yes.

269
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,361
I'm going to take Ddoong Ja on a walk.

270
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:30,349
You're going out?

271
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,624
I'll come back before
grandfather eats dinner.

272
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:39,700
And tell him to eat rice
instead of porridge.

273
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:45,324
I said there's nothing to worry about.

274
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:46,951
I'll be back.

275
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:48,633
Ddoong Ja, let's go.

276
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:55,171
Ddoong Ja, make sure to bring
Dae Woong back home!

277
00:18:57,238 --> 00:19:00,047
Unni, your outfit is really pretty!

278
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,543
There should be several more
of Lady Seo Young's outfits.

279
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,211
Lucky!

280
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:05,618
<i>Black Rain</i>

281
00:19:05,718 --> 00:19:07,273
Is this Cha Dae Woong's outfit?
- Yeah.

282
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:11,436
Dae Woong said his grandfather
knows he was hurt.

283
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:13,913
All his costumes were fitted,
what do we do now?

284
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,659
Cha Dae Woong's screwed now.

285
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:21,202
How did his grandfather find out about that?

286
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:23,684
Then Dae Woong's home right now?

287
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:24,677
Yes.

288
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:27,736
Then what about that Mi Ho girl?

289
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:31,002
Dae Woong's not even there anymore,
is she still at the action school?

290
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:36,266
Dae Woong's not even there anymore,
she probably went back to her home.

291
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:54,872
It's really high up.

292
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,727
Yeah.

293
00:19:56,892 --> 00:20:01,108
It's nonsense to think that
she jumped off from here.

294
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:13,386
It's locked.

295
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:17,096
I guess they're not here.

296
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,757
Slowly, slowly.

297
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:25,581
Noona.

298
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:30,341
Ddoong Ja, drink water.

299
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:33,666
I heard you went back home.

300
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:34,866
Why did you come?

301
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,739
Did you come to get your things?

302
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:38,647
I came to see Mi Ho.

303
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:42,867
Really?

304
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:47,703
Your girlfriend must still be here.

305
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:49,498
Yeah.

306
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:53,436
I'm only temporarily at
my grandfather's place.

307
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:58,185
Why is she here while you're gone?

308
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,222
Where's her home?

309
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:02,273
She can't go home because it's far?

310
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:07,956
Seon Nyeo says Mi Ho used to live abroad,
Byung Soo said she's from the countryside.

311
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:10,198
<i>Which is true?</i>

312
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:13,850
What kind of girl is she?

313
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:18,297
She's in some tricky situations.

314
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:19,435
This is good.

315
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,952
I needed to see you anyways.

316
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:21,900
Wait.

317
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:28,671
Situations?

318
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,483
Seriously, what is she?

319
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:53,989
What's this?

320
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58,357
Where did I put it?

321
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:05,857
Is he counting up to the
100 days anniversary?

322
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,108
It's not the filming schedule...

323
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:26,514
I think I should return this.

324
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:32,257
I gave it to you in order to
help our acting together.

325
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:33,397
I didn't mean anything by it.

326
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:34,729
I have a camcorder too.

327
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:36,869
I can use that.

328
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:41,768
Okay.

329
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,341
She must have said to return it.

330
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,170
There was definitely something
in front of me.

331
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,676
Oh, it's the Hater.

332
00:23:24,092 --> 00:23:26,516
Hey, you scared me!

333
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:28,929
Hey, you scared me too.

334
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,761
My flowers fell because of you, too.

335
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:43,240
She definitely came from over there
and I almost hit her.

336
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:47,930
I'm right.

337
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,417
How did she avoid it?

338
00:23:55,294 --> 00:23:56,765
That's strange.

339
00:24:01,237 --> 00:24:02,520
Did it break?

340
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,369
There's something on here.

341
00:24:06,758 --> 00:24:08,821
Did she touch it?

342
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:10,602
What is it?

343
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:14,233
What's this?

344
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,525
What is this?

345
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:36,479
Look me straight in the eyes.

346
00:24:36,584 --> 00:24:40,547
Are you really saying that you saw
the girl that I'm looking for?

347
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:43,627
Yes, I think so.

348
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:45,776
<i>Please tell me carefully.</i>

349
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,924
I'm not positive based on
what I heard from Seon Nyeo.

350
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:55,305
Her hair is about this long,

351
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,179
<i>and she wears a white dress.</i>

352
00:24:58,284 --> 00:25:00,671
She jumps high and runs far.

353
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:02,220
It's that kind of girl.

354
00:25:02,345 --> 00:25:04,140
Dae Woong definitely said that.

355
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:09,534
He said he got better because of Mi Ho
and he said all he needs is Mi Ho.

356
00:25:10,037 --> 00:25:16,855
So after she came back, he became fine.

357
00:25:17,023 --> 00:25:19,431
The first day Dae Woong met Mi Ho,

358
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,090
he was scared about some strange girl
who was following him

359
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:23,438
<i>and threatening to kill him.</i>

360
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:27,084
But he was probably joking
about her name, right?

361
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:31,799
He said she was going to kill him?

362
00:25:31,885 --> 00:25:33,169
Byung Soo!

363
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:37,569
Which hospital did Dae Woong get
checked out at last time?

364
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:40,330
It was Gangnam Hospital.

365
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,747
Daddy.

366
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:46,388
My friend got an examination
at Gangnam hospital,

367
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:48,539
but I think there was a problem
with the results.

368
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:51,558
I was hoping you could talk to the Chairman

369
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:54,884
and take a look at the examination results.

370
00:26:03,024 --> 00:26:04,934
Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

371
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:12,142
If you know, you'll die.

372
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,042
Either I'm crazy or there's something
definitely strange about her.

373
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:31,557
She left her phone here,

374
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:33,727
no wonder she doesn't pick up
no matter how much I call.

375
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:39,784
<i>Missed call: Dae Woong
Outgoing call: Teacher Dong Ju</i>

376
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:40,983
What's this?

377
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,622
She called Teacher Dong Ju
twice already this morning.

378
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:53,777
So she called Teacher Dong Ju, tossed her
phone aside, and went out to play!

379
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,522
Forget it.

380
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,630
Lucky Charm Animal Hospital, right turn.

381
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:07,052
Lucky Charm?

382
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:10,187
What a really unique name.

383
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:11,878
Right, Ddoong Ja?

384
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:16,637
Ddoong Ja.

385
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:21,273
We're not going to look for Mi Ho, we're
going to get a diagnosis on your obesity.

386
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:24,736
You can't seem lame in front of
Teacher Dong Ju, okay?

387
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,658
My Ddoong Ja.

388
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:27,291
You have to seem expensive.

389
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,566
She's not here.

390
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:45,164
This hospital was really hard to find.

391
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:48,092
It must be difficult to get business.

392
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:51,359
It's not as bad as you're worried about.

393
00:27:52,074 --> 00:27:56,516
But you must have a lot of regulars
for it's a cute atmosphere.

394
00:27:56,664 --> 00:28:02,746
Regular customers are important
for dog hospitals, right?

395
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:06,142
This dog is not yet obese.

396
00:28:06,254 --> 00:28:10,390
If you watch her meals and give her
enough exercise, she'll be fine.

397
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:12,182
Ah yes.

398
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:13,952
That's a relief.

399
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:16,580
Would you like a more in-depth examination?

400
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,409
No, that's fine.

401
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:21,402
I'll just change my Ddoong Ja's* name.
[*Ddoong Ja = chubby]

402
00:28:21,981 --> 00:28:23,536
Heoljook*!
[*Heoljook = skinny]

403
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,229
Good job.

404
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:29,895
i>You look so great.

405
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,398
Mi Ho's not here!

406
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:40,593
I should have gone to
the chicken shop first!

407
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:41,498
Let's go!

408
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:52,540
If he came all the way here,
is he starting to care about Mi Ho?

409
00:28:56,265 --> 00:29:05,070
Will that human not betray her
in the end and die?

410
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:17,396
This is definitely Dae Woong's house
by what Byung Soo told me.

411
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:22,173
I can't tell whether Dae Woong
is home or not.

412
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:26,398
I wish I could just see his face once.

413
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:36,761
Ddoong Ja.

414
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:38,348
You're upset right?

415
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:43,199
I was going to show you her face once.

416
00:29:46,978 --> 00:29:51,144
My friend Mi Ho is...

417
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,297
a scary...

418
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:02,689
a cute gumiho.

419
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:22,240
If I stay here and grandfather
catches me, he'll hate me more.

420
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,972
Hoy hoy!

421
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:51,686
Aunt, it's me. Open up.

422
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,675
Ong?

423
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:09,648
Woong?

424
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:19,712
She glued it with crazy glue
and wrote "Woong?"

425
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:22,191
Woong, Woong.

426
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:24,329
Woong, I miss you.

427
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,124
Woong, Woong, Woong, Woong.

428
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:29,920
<i>Woong, Woong, Woong, Woong.</i>

429
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:33,806
Woong!

430
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:37,370
Didn't you come to stick to me
like crazy glue?

431
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:38,403
Why did you just leave?

432
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,633
Woong!

433
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,265
<i>The person I'll love...</i>

434
00:31:43,325 --> 00:31:47,633
You're really sticking to me
without a moment's hesitation.

435
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:49,693
Get off.

436
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:51,714
I don't want to!

437
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,282
Hey.

438
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:56,383
This is our neighborhood so
there are a lot of watching eyes.

439
00:31:56,412 --> 00:31:57,334
Okay!

440
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:04,911
Just because I can't see,
others can't either?

441
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:08,313
You're a chicken brain.

442
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:13,492
First you call me a dog, then a snake,
and now I'm a chicken?

443
00:32:17,422 --> 00:32:18,944
What's with your hair?

444
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,763
Did a fashionista friend do it for you?

445
00:32:20,854 --> 00:32:23,031
No, I did it.

446
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:25,428
I did it.

447
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:33,919
<i>Dad.</i>

448
00:32:34,231 --> 00:32:36,803
It's serious, right?

449
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,753
Yes.

450
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:40,034
He needs to be careful for
three to four months.

451
00:32:40,178 --> 00:32:42,931
Your friend was in a very bad accident.

452
00:32:43,196 --> 00:32:46,778
After something that bad, he can't just walk
around normally after a few days, right?

453
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:48,862
It's impossible without a miracle.

454
00:32:48,956 --> 00:32:54,947
So even now, he couldn't be fine
in a few days, right?

455
00:32:55,352 --> 00:32:57,493
Of course not.

456
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,533
If you're that worried, bring him to me.

457
00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:10,922
Something impossible happened to Dae Woong.

458
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:13,492
Because of that girl.

459
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:17,693
Is that why he needs to stay by her side?

460
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:21,265
What the heck is she?

461
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:30,469
This is Mi Ho the fox.

462
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,103
This is Ddoong Ja the dog.

463
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:33,600
Here.

464
00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:36,553
Shake hands with each other.

465
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:40,340
Must you really introduce me as a fox?

466
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,744
Then what should I say?

467
00:33:42,283 --> 00:33:43,497
Hello Ddoong Ja!

468
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,168
I'm Dae Woong's girlfriend.

469
00:33:45,301 --> 00:33:47,831
I even got this from Dae Woong!

470
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:48,686
Hey.

471
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:52,338
My Ddoong Ja even got this necklace from me.

472
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,304
That looks nice too.

473
00:33:54,522 --> 00:33:55,260
Ddoong Ja!

474
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:57,648
You're a fashionista too!

475
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,495
Way to use that anywhere.

476
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:01,979
Woong.

477
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:04,646
Is grandfather okay?

478
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:08,966
He's not exactly hurting anywhere
in particular,

479
00:34:09,054 --> 00:34:14,158
but he's only eating porridge for show
so the old man has no energy.

480
00:34:14,316 --> 00:34:16,546
You're okay because of the fox bead,

481
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:21,241
but your grandfather doesn't know that
so he must be really worried.

482
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:25,629
It's because my grandfather
has a lot of fear.

483
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:31,730
After my mom and dad died in the accident,
his guts shrank to nothing.

484
00:34:32,229 --> 00:34:38,809
If I had the fox bead then, my mom and dad
would have survived the accident.

485
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:42,914
Your mom and dad were hurt a lot?

486
00:34:43,773 --> 00:34:48,715
When I was young, they died in an
accident on a trip.

487
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:51,260
I was the only one who survived.

488
00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:01,821
Everyone said I would die too but
my grandfather saved me like a miracle.

489
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:09,458
He says that I lived because he held my hand
for 100 days and never once let go.

490
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:14,295
Your grandfather was your fox bead!

491
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:16,695
Yeah, he was.

492
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:21,672
Then my grandfather is as
awesome as a gumiho.

493
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:42,927
That punk needs to stop being stubborn.

494
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,507
What if he gets hurt?

495
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:51,593
That punk.

496
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:55,654
I need to succeed, at least
for my grandfather.

497
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:56,961
You need to succeed!

498
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,740
Ah, the weather's nice!

499
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:01,142
Ah, the weather's nice!

500
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:05,711
Ah, what's wrong with the weather?

501
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:08,316
Ah, what's wrong with the weather?

502
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:10,009
Is it going to snow?

503
00:36:10,488 --> 00:36:11,748
Is it going to snow?

504
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:14,950
Oh!

505
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:15,772
Woong!

506
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:17,131
What's that?

507
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:18,924
Ah, badminton?

508
00:36:19,032 --> 00:36:20,217
Badminton?

509
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:22,003
You want to try it?
- Yeah!

510
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:29,634
If I hit this with this,
you hit it the same way too.

511
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:30,198
Got it?

512
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:36,477
Here I go!

513
00:36:41,027 --> 00:36:41,885
Wow!

514
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:44,178
How far is it going?

515
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:46,420
Wow!

516
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:01,105
Mi Ho, Ddoong Ja, get up!

517
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:04,490
It's indecent to watch other people eat.

518
00:37:04,673 --> 00:37:05,874
Get up.

519
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:09,948
Is it good?

520
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:18,292
I'm full.

521
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:20,167
Do you want more?

522
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:28,743
Here, Ddoong Ja.

523
00:37:35,612 --> 00:37:39,214
This is man's great invention, the bicycle.

524
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:42,129
When you step on the pedal, it goes forward.

525
00:37:42,316 --> 00:37:43,130
Are you ready?

526
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:44,259
Yeah.

527
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:45,711
Here we go.

528
00:37:47,972 --> 00:37:49,370
Hey, hey!

529
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:54,816
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

530
00:37:55,077 --> 00:37:56,846
<i>I miss you.</i>

531
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,149
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

532
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:04,609
<i>I must have lost my mind.
I couldn't even say I love you</i>

533
00:38:04,873 --> 00:38:08,481
<i>Because I was sorry
I couldn't even say thank you</i>

534
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:10,430
<i>Because you might leave</i>

535
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:12,018
<i>Come back to me my girl</i>

536
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:13,082
<i>My girl</i>

537
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:16,853
<i>I won't be able to sleep tonight
because of you</i>

538
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,164
If you've seen enough of my face,
why don't you pedal a bit too?

539
00:38:21,662 --> 00:38:22,970
Okay.

540
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:27,371
Wow, it's fast.

541
00:38:29,751 --> 00:38:35,416
<i>I really must have lost my mind then.</i>

542
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:38,699
I should go in so grandfather can eat.

543
00:38:38,878 --> 00:38:40,502
Already?

544
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:43,479
Okay.

545
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:45,356
Then call me when you get home.

546
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:46,761
Call?

547
00:38:47,587 --> 00:38:48,331
Hey.

548
00:38:48,463 --> 00:38:51,810
If I bought you a phone,
take it around with you.

549
00:38:51,952 --> 00:38:53,312
My phone's at home.

550
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:56,915
It lost all its energy
so I stuck it in the string.

551
00:38:57,014 --> 00:38:57,663
Yeah.

552
00:38:57,772 --> 00:39:00,036
It was nice and stuck in the charger.

553
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,045
If you charged it,
you should take it with you.

554
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:03,210
Is that a landline?

555
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:04,092
It's a cell phone.

556
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:04,812
Woong!

557
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:06,866
You went home?

558
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:08,651
Why?

559
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:10,577
Why did you go?

560
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,526
I just dropped by while I was passing.

561
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:14,588
Why did you drop by?

562
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:15,357
Why?

563
00:39:15,444 --> 00:39:17,194
Why did you drop by?

564
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:19,726
Ddoong Ja!

565
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:21,156
Gross, spit it out.

566
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:22,106
You can't eat that.

567
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,014
Dae Woong, why did you go?

568
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:26,183
You went because you missed me, right?

569
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,411
Right?

570
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:31,454
Woong, you missed me!

571
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,735
I went to your house because I missed you,

572
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:36,094
and you went to our house
because you missed me too!

573
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:42,003
I was just on a walk with Ddoong Ja
and I dropped by for a second.

574
00:39:42,142 --> 00:39:45,419
Woong, tell me you went
because you missed me.

575
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:50,782
Then there's something I can tell you too.

576
00:39:51,215 --> 00:39:54,396
You went because you missed me, right?

577
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:58,036
No, I've never done that.

578
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:02,294
Grandfather will be looking for me.

579
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,526
I need to get going now.

580
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:06,363
You go too.

581
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:09,813
Ddoong Ja, let's go.

582
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,669
Woong!

583
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:13,116
You missed me, right?

584
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:15,916
Right?

585
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:21,808
Woong, I missed you so so so so much too!

586
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:24,257
What's wrong with her?

587
00:40:24,428 --> 00:40:29,045
Woong, I like you so so so so so so much!

588
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:34,553
I like you so so so so so much!

589
00:40:34,773 --> 00:40:36,627
Hurry up and go home!

590
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:42,027
It's good, right father? Hurry up and eat.

591
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,391
Father, father! Dae Woong, Dae Woong.

592
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,230
<I>Dae Woong, you.

593
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:56,271
Did you go there because
you missed that girl?

594
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,196
You were away for just a bit
and you missed her that much?

595
00:40:59,289 --> 00:40:59,891
No!

596
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,443
That's definitely not it!

597
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:04,130
I've never missed her!

598
00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:08,230
I said I didn't miss her,
why are you doing this to me?

599
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:30,333
So embarrassing.

600
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:35,778
Now it seems like I missed her more.

601
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:40,480
I should have denied it more.

602
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:52,132
Dae Woong said he missed me.

603
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:55,389
Because he likes me.

604
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:58,943
Then I will tell him too.

605
00:41:59,196 --> 00:42:03,410
That I'm going to be a human!

606
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:07,215
Oh, Teacher Dong Ju!

607
00:42:11,192 --> 00:42:14,580
I thought you would be bored
by yourself so I came to buy you meat.

608
00:42:14,654 --> 00:42:18,023
But you seem incredibly happy
even by yourself.

609
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:18,745
Teacher Dong Ju.

610
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:22,581
I'm going to tell Dae Woong that
I'm going to become human.

611
00:42:26,649 --> 00:42:31,238
I didn't know at all that
Mr. Cha was unwell.

612
00:42:31,377 --> 00:42:35,727
But where did such touching action
come from?

613
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:45,074
My father is worrying so much so
please convince him to quit the movie.

614
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,372
Yes.

615
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:47,866
It's very unfortunate.

616
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,271
I'll trust you.

617
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:53,017
Then let's go eat.

618
00:42:54,251 --> 00:43:00,263
Are you just going to eat and run away
because of your daughter this time, too?

619
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:05,484
I'm about to text her
that I may not come home.

620
00:43:05,594 --> 00:43:06,872
Oh my!

621
00:43:10,413 --> 00:43:15,032
My goodness, you have a lot of awards!

622
00:43:16,295 --> 00:43:19,961
I believe I may be receiving
another one soon.

623
00:43:20,742 --> 00:43:27,812
So at this awards ceremony,
I'm thinking of saying your name.

624
00:43:29,729 --> 00:43:34,750
It'll be embarrassing if you just
say my name so blatantly.

625
00:43:37,107 --> 00:43:44,395
Then what about if I make my acceptance
speech with a secret signal between us two?

626
00:43:47,774 --> 00:43:51,320
Like if I do this and say "thank you!"

627
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:55,410
Then you'll seem a bit strange!

628
00:43:55,532 --> 00:44:01,818
Then how about turning around
and saying "thank you!"

629
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:04,082
Oh my!

630
00:44:12,477 --> 00:44:14,096
<i>I'm okay.</i>

631
00:44:15,846 --> 00:44:16,862
Chow...

632
00:44:22,896 --> 00:44:24,353
Chow...

633
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:32,056
You should be careful!

634
00:44:32,526 --> 00:44:35,428
Why are you always such a clumsy woman!

635
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:39,213
How could you spill coffee of all things!

636
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,599
You spilled it on my one
and only Chow Yun Fat DVD!

637
00:44:43,271 --> 00:44:46,441
I can just buy you a new one.

638
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,017
Where will you buy this?

639
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:51,247
A signed special edition from Hong Kong!

640
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:53,477
Where will you buy one?!

641
00:44:55,189 --> 00:44:57,735
I'll just go to Hong Kong right now,

642
00:44:57,873 --> 00:45:04,878
and do whatever it takes to meet
Chow Yun Fat and get you a signed DVD!

643
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,705
Min Sook...

644
00:45:11,027 --> 00:45:15,750
Where are you going without eating dinner?

645
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:18,222
I'm going to Hong Kong!

646
00:45:18,325 --> 00:45:20,919
<i>I love you, you fool.</i>

647
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,705
<i>I want to be with you.</i>

648
00:45:27,085 --> 00:45:29,148
I lost to Chow Yun Fat and
I lost to his daughter.

649
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:30,866
What am I, a broken-down car?

650
00:45:30,953 --> 00:45:32,955
Why does he keep pushing me?

651
00:45:39,065 --> 00:45:40,351
Who is this?

652
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:43,574
I met you last time, I'm Eun Hae In.

653
00:45:43,936 --> 00:45:48,428
I have something I want to tell you
about Dae Woong.

654
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:58,804
Dae Woong missed me.

655
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:01,693
He won't run away even if I tell him
I'm going to become human.

656
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:04,324
I think he's going to let me
stay by his side.

657
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:09,055
You're slowing winning his heart
so at least he won't betray you.

658
00:46:09,962 --> 00:46:13,974
But you like that human,
Cha Dae Woong, that much?

659
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,365
Yeah. I like him so much.

660
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:17,548
I like him more and more.

661
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,338
What if after you became human,
Cha Dae Woong was no longer by your side?

662
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,628
How do you think you'll feel?

663
00:46:24,753 --> 00:46:27,409
You need Cha Dae Woong right now
to become human,

664
00:46:27,514 --> 00:46:30,994
but after you've become human,
it doesn't matter if he's not there.

665
00:46:31,573 --> 00:46:33,621
I can't be without Dae Woong.

666
00:46:33,756 --> 00:46:38,428
I'm by his side because I like him,
I'm not with him because I need him.

667
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:42,200
<i>The biggest reason I want to
become human is my Dae Woong.</i>

668
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:46,537
Oh, it looks delicious!

669
00:46:46,832 --> 00:46:48,453
Thanks, Teacher Dong Ju.

670
00:46:51,439 --> 00:46:55,254
It's better to not have people who know
your identity by your side.

671
00:46:55,350 --> 00:47:02,499
So after the hundred days,
leave Cha Dae Woong's side.

672
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:03,897
I don't want to.

673
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:07,579
Then I won't help you anymore.

674
00:47:07,686 --> 00:47:12,491
I definitely told you that
I didn't tell you everything.

675
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:19,653
In order for you to safely become human,
you absolutely need my help.

676
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:26,723
I want for you to not die and
safely achieve what you want.

677
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,641
So give up the greed of wanting to be
by Cha Dae Woong's side.

678
00:47:30,762 --> 00:47:32,456
What's wrong with you?

679
00:47:32,611 --> 00:47:35,130
Why can't I be by Dae Woong's side?

680
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:37,556
I can't tell you that reason yet either.

681
00:47:37,645 --> 00:47:40,006
Trust me and do as I say.

682
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:41,763
Just as you have until now.

683
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,852
No!

684
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:49,014
As long as Dae Woong says he doesn't object,
I'm going to stay by his side.

685
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:05,973
It's because I don't think
you could handle his death.

686
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:33,713
When all these days are through,
I'll become a human,

687
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:38,769
and afterwards, I'll continue
to stay by Dae Woong's side.

688
00:48:40,455 --> 00:48:48,408
Go to the hospital your aunt went to
and get a definite examination.

689
00:48:48,513 --> 00:48:50,405
Let's talk after we get the results.

690
00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:55,224
If you can't believe me even after
I said I'm fine, then let's do that.

691
00:48:58,997 --> 00:49:01,324
My goodness.

692
00:49:02,993 --> 00:49:04,053
Hey.

693
00:49:04,624 --> 00:49:14,157
If it's Dae Woong's sunbae's father's
hospital, couldn't they trick us?

694
00:49:14,497 --> 00:49:15,870
No way.

695
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:19,235
She's the one who told me he was hurt
in the first place.

696
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:22,656
She asked a favor from her dad
because she was worried,

697
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,132
that she interfered and messed up
Dae Woong's work.

698
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,675
Isn't she so nice?

699
00:49:28,414 --> 00:49:32,944
Eun Hae In is also working on the movie
with Dae Woong, right?

700
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:33,843
Yes.

701
00:49:34,332 --> 00:49:38,890
Her father is a doctor at a big hospital
and he's very smart.

702
00:49:39,803 --> 00:49:43,267
It seems like she has feelings
for Dae Woong too.

703
00:49:43,552 --> 00:49:46,531
She's much better than that Mi Ho girl.

704
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:53,144
That girl Mi Ho was quite nice
when I saw her.

705
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:59,028
When Dae Woong gets an examination at
my dad's hospital tomorrow, bring Mi Ho too.

706
00:49:59,131 --> 00:50:02,194
She needs to know exactly
how Dae Woong is doing too.

707
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:03,219
Figures.

708
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,874
Dae Woong will only tell us if
Mi Ho knows and persuades him.

709
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,915
Since when did Cha Dae Woong
only trust and follow a girl?

710
00:50:10,054 --> 00:50:11,554
He's a complete loser.

711
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:14,767
Don't tell Dae Woong
that you're bringing Mi Ho.

712
00:50:14,918 --> 00:50:18,553
He doesn't really want to tell her
how he is.

713
00:50:20,614 --> 00:50:21,584
Dad.

714
00:50:21,877 --> 00:50:26,720
When I come to the hospital tomorrow,
I'm going to bring another girl.

715
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:31,599
She's a bit strange,
take a look at her, too, please.

716
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:44,607
Dae Woong!

717
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,137
I wanted to hear your voice so much!

718
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:49,434
You called because you wanted
to hear my voice too, right?

719
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:50,473
No.

720
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:53,705
I called just to ask you a question.

721
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:55,247
What is it?

722
00:50:56,091 --> 00:51:00,380
It's been over ten days since
your bead has been in my belly.

723
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,497
Do you think my body is completely healed?

724
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,206
Yeah.

725
00:51:04,388 --> 00:51:09,177
Even when you were nearly dying,
you were okay in less than ten days.

726
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:12,954
You should be completely healed by now.

727
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,140
Why?

728
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,199
Are you going to tell me to take it back
because you're all better now?

729
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:20,691
I'm not.

730
00:51:20,904 --> 00:51:22,684
It's because if I'm going to put
grandfather's mind at ease,

731
00:51:22,797 --> 00:51:24,975
I need to show him that my body is okay.

732
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:30,100
I'm going to keep the bead for the full
100 days and suck out all its benefits.

733
00:51:30,393 --> 00:51:31,512
Woong.

734
00:51:32,419 --> 00:51:37,912
You missed me when you didn't
see me for a little bit, right?

735
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:40,923
No, I didn't!

736
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:45,100
I said I didn't miss you,
why do you keep insisting I did?

737
00:51:45,322 --> 00:51:52,291
Then after 100 days, how do you think
you'll feel if I'm not by your side?

738
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,305
<i>Don't you think you'll miss me?</i>

739
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,233
I don't know.

740
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,109
We'll have to see then.

741
00:52:02,775 --> 00:52:04,557
I'm done with my question.

742
00:52:04,651 --> 00:52:05,492
Bye.

743
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:15,365
You need to say you'll miss me

744
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:21,170
so that I can argue with Teacher Dong Ju
and insist on staying by your side.

745
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:26,284
This girl...

746
00:52:28,328 --> 00:52:31,139
asked me something like that...

747
00:52:33,808 --> 00:52:36,882
and is making me confused again.

748
00:52:37,707 --> 00:52:40,859
<i>The person I'll love</i>

749
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:44,545
<i>I wish you'd look at me</i>

750
00:52:44,774 --> 00:52:48,945
<i>Because although I may seem different</i>

751
00:52:49,158 --> 00:52:51,580
<i>I feel the same way</i>

752
00:52:51,873 --> 00:52:55,149
<i>I'm staring into your eyes</i>

753
00:52:55,398 --> 00:52:59,659
<i>So I don't have courage</i>

754
00:52:59,988 --> 00:53:03,276
<i>Please love me</i>

755
00:53:03,486 --> 00:53:09,658
<i>Please turn back to me.</i>

756
00:53:13,954 --> 00:53:14,807
Mi Ho.

757
00:53:14,908 --> 00:53:15,820
Let's go to the hospital together.

758
00:53:15,932 --> 00:53:17,647
Dae Woong didn't tell me to come.

759
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:19,538
If you go, you can meet Dae Woong.

760
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:23,481
He's getting checked out
so let's go together!

761
00:53:35,948 --> 00:53:44,905
Please check him from his head to his toes
to make sure nothing is wrong.

762
00:53:49,654 --> 00:53:51,572
Please change into this.

763
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:10,432
Hae In unni's dad is going to examine
Dae Woong at this hospital.

764
00:54:10,516 --> 00:54:11,558
Oh really?

765
00:54:12,464 --> 00:54:16,649
This hospital place smells really strange.

766
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:27,017
Dae Woong's not picking up.

767
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:28,580
He must be having his examination.

768
00:54:28,684 --> 00:54:30,220
Let's ask over there.

769
00:54:33,286 --> 00:54:34,366
Mi Ho!

770
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:39,510
It's Hater.

771
00:54:39,608 --> 00:54:41,246
You came to meet Dae Woong, right?

772
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:42,640
Follow me.

773
00:54:48,037 --> 00:54:50,216
They'll find their way.

774
00:54:51,616 --> 00:54:52,774
Let's go.

775
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,413
The results will be out immediately
so wait and see.

776
00:55:04,507 --> 00:55:09,525
If the results are bad,
you can't say anything anymore.

777
00:55:09,636 --> 00:55:14,245
If there's nothing wrong with me, you can't
interfere in my business anymore either.

778
00:55:17,441 --> 00:55:22,477
The hospital smell is so strong,
I can't tell where Dae Woong is.

779
00:55:24,257 --> 00:55:29,372
You're strangely able to find
Dae Woong all the time.

780
00:55:29,497 --> 00:55:33,759
I don't know how you do it,
it's quite odd.

781
00:55:34,802 --> 00:55:37,929
Are you sure we're going to Dae Woong?

782
00:55:38,032 --> 00:55:39,359
It's this way.

783
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:40,559
Let's go.

784
00:55:55,662 --> 00:55:57,115
Where is this?

785
00:55:57,568 --> 00:55:59,345
It's an examination room.

786
00:55:59,409 --> 00:56:01,551
Examination room?
- Yeah.

787
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:05,462
Let's get you checked out.

788
00:56:05,592 --> 00:56:08,929
I almost hit you with my car last time.

789
00:56:09,097 --> 00:56:12,154
I was worried you might have gotten hurt.

790
00:56:12,264 --> 00:56:12,811
It's fine.

791
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:14,142
I want to leave.

792
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,179
Hey, what are you doing?

793
00:56:26,164 --> 00:56:28,043
Just wait a little bit here.

794
00:56:28,598 --> 00:56:33,551
The doctor will come and
carefully examine you.

795
00:56:34,154 --> 00:56:38,924
You jumped off from the roof
last time, right?

796
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:48,509
You're also the girl Director Ban is looking
for who flies through the sky, right?

797
00:56:52,855 --> 00:56:58,021
You told me last time that
you're different, right?

798
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:00,362
How are you different?

799
00:57:01,468 --> 00:57:03,325
What are you?

800
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:09,269
Are you a monster?

801
00:57:11,232 --> 00:57:15,383
I'm so curious that I brought you
here to get you examined.

802
00:57:15,747 --> 00:57:17,661
Just wait a little bit.

803
00:57:25,996 --> 00:57:28,952
I can't get examined.

804
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:40,567
Cha Dae Woong!

805
00:57:40,647 --> 00:57:42,496
Let's go get your results.

806
00:57:43,466 --> 00:57:44,699
Hey, Cha Dae Woong.

807
00:57:44,842 --> 00:57:45,589
Yeah.

808
00:58:05,185 --> 00:58:06,872
She broke this?

809
00:58:09,506 --> 00:58:10,318
Hey!

810
00:58:10,422 --> 00:58:11,125
<i>Hey!</i>

811
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:15,898
Hey!

812
00:58:16,388 --> 00:58:17,568
You're here, right?

813
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,494
Come out!

814
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,251
You're not going to come out?

815
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:27,895
I knew you had a reason you
didn't want to get examined!

816
00:58:27,977 --> 00:58:28,909
Fine.

817
00:58:29,017 --> 00:58:30,770
I'm going to Dae Woong.

818
00:58:31,244 --> 00:58:37,797
I'm going to say you're strange in front of
his grandfather, aunt, and all his friends!

819
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:42,841
I'm going make Dae Woong tell me
himself what you are!

820
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:52,357
Why does it matter what I am?

821
00:58:52,754 --> 00:58:54,469
Why are you doing this to me?

822
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,706
Because I can't let something strange
like you stay by Dae Woong's side!

823
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,310
I didn't do anything wrong.

824
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:01,442
What did you do to Dae Woong's body?

825
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:04,906
Did you feed him some strange medicine
to make him seem better when he's not?

826
00:59:05,031 --> 00:59:06,115
No.

827
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:08,930
I made Dae Woong better.

828
00:59:09,665 --> 00:59:12,852
What the heck are you?

829
00:59:12,939 --> 00:59:16,112
I'm not bad.

830
00:59:16,233 --> 00:59:18,718
I said I'm just a bit different.

831
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:20,438
Can't you just leave me alone?

832
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:28,949
Then I won't ask you what you are
or tell anyone, so just disappear.

833
00:59:29,056 --> 00:59:33,658
If you disappear, then I'll leave you alone.

834
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,888
Disappear?

835
00:59:41,499 --> 00:59:42,786
There's nothing wrong with him.

836
00:59:42,864 --> 00:59:44,517
He's very healthy.

837
00:59:47,068 --> 00:59:48,659
Is he really?

838
00:59:48,765 --> 00:59:49,563
Yes.

839
00:59:50,824 --> 00:59:53,338
I told you I was okay.

840
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:55,840
Thank you, doctor.

841
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,210
Hey, Dae Woong.

842
01:00:00,032 --> 01:00:03,059
I can go now, right?

843
01:00:03,304 --> 01:00:04,945
You're just going to go?

844
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:06,940
Eat before you go.

845
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:08,726
You eat a lot.

846
01:00:09,155 --> 01:00:10,997
Don't eat porridge, have rice.

847
01:00:11,092 --> 01:00:12,124
Bye!

848
01:00:12,226 --> 01:00:13,600
Dae Woong...

849
01:00:18,892 --> 01:00:24,178
There must have been an error with
the result from Gangnam hospital.

850
01:00:24,504 --> 01:00:28,326
Anyways, it's good that he's okay.

851
01:00:29,316 --> 01:00:31,497
What about the other girl
you said was coming?

852
01:00:31,812 --> 01:00:33,390
She's fine.

853
01:00:33,728 --> 01:00:37,875
The problem was taken care of.

854
01:00:48,669 --> 01:00:50,640
I have to disappear.

855
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,773
I have no choice right now.

856
01:00:57,534 --> 01:00:58,778
Mi Ho!

857
01:00:59,028 --> 01:01:00,244
Mi Ho!

858
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:05,725
Mi Ho!

859
01:01:05,816 --> 01:01:07,100
Mi Ho!

860
01:01:16,129 --> 01:01:18,672
Where did she go?

861
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:24,129
I thought she'd be really happy to know
I'm back so I ran over without even eating.

862
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,930
They've hardly withered.

863
01:01:33,627 --> 01:01:39,494
I felt like I was gone for a long time
but it wasn't long at all.

864
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:49,421
Mi Ho?

865
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:50,496
Why did you call?

866
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,308
Where are you?

867
01:01:52,741 --> 01:01:54,429
When are you coming home?

868
01:01:55,384 --> 01:01:59,231
I miss you, can you come home early today?

869
01:01:59,968 --> 01:02:01,267
I'm not sure.

870
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:05,706
I don't miss you very much so I'm not
planning on coming home early.

871
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:10,431
You really don't miss me.

872
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,134
That's a relief.

873
01:02:12,304 --> 01:02:14,180
Mi Ho, honestly...

874
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:15,662
<i>Woong.</i>

875
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,252
I have something to say.

876
01:02:18,692 --> 01:02:19,577
What?

877
01:02:19,808 --> 01:02:25,236
You'll protect my bead even if
I don't scare you, right?

878
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:26,411
Yeah.

879
01:02:26,563 --> 01:02:29,808
You'll protect it even if
you don't need it, right?

880
01:02:30,105 --> 01:02:31,103
Yeah.

881
01:02:32,103 --> 01:02:33,866
You still don't trust me?

882
01:02:34,008 --> 01:02:35,158
<i>I do.</i>

883
01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:41,148
So protect the bead well
even if I'm not with you.

884
01:02:43,102 --> 01:02:43,886
What?

885
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:46,396
Dae Woong.

886
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:54,090
I think I'm going to have to
disappear from your side.
