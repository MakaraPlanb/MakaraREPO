<i>Look at this side,
look at that side</i>

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,772
<i>It can't be understood</i>

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:28,119
<i>Mi Ho, Mi Ho</i>

7
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:33,008
<i>My friend Mi Ho</i>

8
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,490
<i>is a cute Gumiho</i>

9
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:38,652
Hoy.

10
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:40,132
Hoy!

11
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:45,403
<i>My beautiful friend Mi Ho</i>

12
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:46,586
Hoy.

13
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:48,015
<i>Hoy!</i>

14
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:50,446
<i>Mi Ho is</i>

15
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:53,924
<i>the one I like!
The one I like</i>

16
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:59,784
<i>The Yuh-Chin* I like.
[*shortened word for girlfriend]</i>

17
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:02,557
Hoy! Hoy!

18
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:06,404
But, what's a "Yuh-Chin"?

19
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,805
<i>I love you</i>

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,106
<i>words from the bottom of my heart</i>

21
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:22,006
<i>I love you</i>

22
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,907
<i>Words which I would
say a thousand times</i>

23
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,707
<i>Until now I haven't given you anything</i>

24
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:33,708
<i>So I want to start telling you more now</i>

25
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:39,709
<i>Words that I would like to tell only you</i>

26
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,656
Oh! You found the ring!

27
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,913
This time, it's real.

28
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:50,024
Yeah, it's real.

29
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:55,225
<i>Both unfamiliar and scared</i>

30
00:01:55,326 --> 00:02:02,326
<i>Now I understand your love</i>

31
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:06,027
<i>Days where I'd push you away,
saying that it wasn't love between us</i>

32
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,428
<i>Woong!</i>

33
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:11,390
Woong! What's wrong?

34
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:14,267
I don't know. It hurts.

35
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:17,160
Why would it be like this?

36
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,961
The bead is angry!

37
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:20,769
What?

38
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,520
It probably hasn't recovered from
being hurt by another woman's chi.

39
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,330
<i>Dae Woong.</i>

40
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:30,656
Now that you're thinking about mating,

41
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:33,196
the bead is angry.

42
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:37,314
What? When did I?

43
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,071
I didn't think about that!

44
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:41,741
You don't have to lie.

45
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:43,738
The bead shows everything.

46
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,413
I didn't!

47
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,649
What a waste!

48
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,824
Until the bead is completely healed,

49
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:53,545
we can't mate.

50
00:02:56,764 --> 00:03:00,454
Seriously. Why is the bead being this way?

51
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:03,432
It's unhappy with the body that has
been tainted by another woman.

52
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:06,276
What? Tainted?

53
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:09,118
Who told you to do that with other women?

54
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,545
I was the victim!

55
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:13,952
If you still haven't recovered yet...

56
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:17,293
You! You really did it, didn't you?

57
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:18,978
Really did it?

58
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,554
I pulled back right away!

59
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,742
Woong, just put up with it.

60
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,935
No, this isn't working.
You go away. Go away!

61
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:49,481
No, just put up with it a little!

62
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:07,074
No, no, no.

63
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,555
What a waste!

64
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,225
Our bead must calm down soon.

65
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:21,059
Yeah.

66
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:13,579
So she won't be hurt by
Cha Dae Woong's death,

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,016
I have to send her to a place
where she cannot meet him.

68
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:22,575
I can't block her anymore.

69
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:30,696
What are you doing?

70
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:32,874
I heard the sounds of you showering,
and felt a bit fidgety.

71
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:35,570
I made a plan about our future life.

72
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:37,409
Life plan?

73
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,689
I wrote down all the things that
I want to do after becoming human.

74
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:44,917
<i>1. Mate with Dae Woong.</i>

75
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:47,714
<i>2. Have a wedding with Dae Woong.</i>

76
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,334
3. Have a baby with Dae Woong.

77
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:53,977
4. With Dae Woong...

78
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:56,990
You're not even human yet.

79
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,972
It's a bit early to be making plans.

80
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,925
<i>Wedding. Kids.</i>

81
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:04,776
I haven't even thought about those.

82
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:07,426
You just have to follow
what I tell you to do.

83
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:09,979
The first one will be accomplished
after the bead heals.

84
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,131
The second will be done
on the hundredth day.

85
00:06:12,232 --> 00:06:15,891
<i>The third will be done within one year
of the first one.</i>

86
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:18,985
Then, after hard work, if I give
birth once every year,

87
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:22,780
<i>4. I will live happily ever
after with Dae Woong!</i>

88
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,885
So good!

89
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:27,893
I haven't even thought about these.

90
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:30,152
You want them to be done all in one year?

91
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:31,411
Yes.

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,126
The bead is healed.

93
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,024
Life Plan Number One. Go!

94
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,390
Clear!

95
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:50,476
One hundred days, done!

96
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,357
Life Plan Number Two. Go!

97
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:55,685
<i>I now declare you husband and wife.</i>

98
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,454
Clear.

99
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:02,447
Mission: Baby.

100
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,463
Life Plan Number Three. Go!

101
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:12,681
<i>Continue with mission?</i>

102
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:14,480
Level up.

103
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:22,656
<i>Dad, buy us meat.</i>

104
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:25,757
<i>Dad, buy us meat.</i>

105
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,758
<i>Dad, buy us meat.</i>

106
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:31,859
Dad, buy us meat.

107
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,060
Dad, buy us meat.

108
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:38,161
Dad, buy us meat.

109
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:40,923
- Dad, buy us meat.
- No, no!

110
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:43,793
- Dad, buy us meat.
- No!

111
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,291
No, no, no. Stop, stop!

112
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:51,286
This won't do.

113
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:53,383
I'm only twenty-one!

114
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,505
If I marry in two or three months,

115
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,179
then I'll have to be a dad
at twenty-two years old?

116
00:07:58,242 --> 00:08:01,126
Woong, I'm already more than
five hundred years old.

117
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:05,092
Mi Ho, we just got together today.

118
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:08,088
If you make these scary
life plans right now,

119
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:12,040
I can't agree to them.

120
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,913
The bead has really done
something important,

121
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:27,698
giving me a brake for Mi Ho's
lightning-fast plan.

122
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:33,700
If I force him too much,

123
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,145
Dae Woong really won't agree to it.

124
00:08:37,414 --> 00:08:41,040
I'll take it step-by-step, and go slowly.

125
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:53,470
That's right. You have to
educate men slowly.

126
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:56,082
<i>If you press too hard, they'll run away.</i>

127
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,896
It's good that you still have
something to be excited over.

128
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,001
Ahjumma, is something wrong?

129
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:03,462
Did someone bully you?

130
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:06,505
The construction is starting
on that new building.

131
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:08,944
An even bigger meat
restaurant will be built.

132
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:11,661
What will happen to my
fried chicken restaurant?

133
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:14,514
Your chicken is delicious,
so your restaurant will be fine.

134
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:17,195
I heard that the construction
has expanded again,

135
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:19,354
and cut down all the trees in our area.

136
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:22,359
Should I submit a complaint and sue them?

137
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,771
They cut down the trees?

138
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:28,657
Yeah! They even cut down
the area's largest tree!

139
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:31,146
If they cut down that tree,

140
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:35,136
many things will have nowhere
to go, and will be angry.

141
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,339
It feels good.

142
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:49,755
What happened to the rice wine
and acorn jelly I put here?

143
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:57,336
Oh, it's a fox.

144
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:03,227
Does she have anything I can steal?

145
00:10:06,076 --> 00:10:08,906
<i>Dae Woong says that it's
okay that I am who I am.</i>

146
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,721
He says that he likes me.

147
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,478
Right now, nothing matters to me, either.

148
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,520
Looks like now you won't
listen to me anymore, right?

149
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:20,348
After you become human,
you have to handle what you do yourself.

150
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:23,398
Teacher Dong Ju, don't worry.

151
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:25,627
Dae Woong and I will be very happy together.

152
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:27,337
You just watch.

153
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,869
I'm afraid that's not possible.

154
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:34,093
I've decided to wrap up my life here.

155
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:38,643
I can't take care of you anymore after this.

156
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:41,632
Wrapping up? You're leaving?

157
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:44,703
I said that I can't stay in
one place for a long time.

158
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:47,307
I've already stayed long enough here.

159
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:50,133
I've never had a great connection to anyone,

160
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:54,055
but that habit has been broken
ever since I met you.

161
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:55,456
Because of me?

162
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:56,852
Yes.

163
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,017
Because of you,

164
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,375
I broke the rule that I have
been trying hard to stick to.

165
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,442
Sorry, Teacher Dong Ju.

166
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,165
I am sorry, too.

167
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:10,998
Teacher Dong Ju, what do you
have to be sorry about?

168
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:13,625
Not being able to care
for you until the end.

169
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:17,172
Where are you going?

170
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:18,941
I don't know.

171
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,304
I'm tired of city life.

172
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,097
Should I go to a small island?

173
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:29,399
Island? That's a place where
there is sea on all sides.

174
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:31,908
Then I can't go.

175
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,107
Why?

176
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,624
I'm very afraid of water.

177
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:38,430
Islands are surrounded by water.

178
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:40,321
It must be very scary.

179
00:11:40,422 --> 00:11:43,186
You said you were scared of water?

180
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:46,147
That's weird. Foxes are animals.

181
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:49,545
They're supposed to be
afraid of fire, not water.

182
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:53,835
That's probably because
I was made using fire.

183
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:54,889
You're made from fire?

184
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,635
Yes. Grandma Sam Shin first
made me out of fire.

185
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:03,034
That's why my tails are blue, like a flame.

186
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,152
Ah, Teacher Dong Ju.
You haven't seen my tails, have you?

187
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:11,066
Before you leave, let's meet
under the moonlight once.

188
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,533
I'll show you my tails.

189
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,452
Okay.

190
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:23,493
I'm leaving. Bye.

191
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,209
Tails that are blue like flames?

192
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,000
How could that be possible?

193
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,108
<i>Who was that?</i>

194
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,654
<i>- That scared me to death.
- What happened?</i>

195
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:48,341
<i>What was there?</i>

196
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:49,698
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

197
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:59,958
I have bad news for you, right
after you made up with Mi Ho.

198
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:00,774
What?

199
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,569
You're probably going to die in China.

200
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:05,622
What?

201
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:06,567
In the movie.

202
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:09,940
They're probably going to
China to film your part.

203
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:13,589
I thought the director cut that part out,
since the circumstances didn't allow it.

204
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:14,998
That's how it was,

205
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,539
but now it looks like it's
back to the original plan.

206
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,788
<i>Our director always does it his way.</i>

207
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:24,492
<i>If he really decides on this,
this is how it's going to be.</i>

208
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:28,231
But maybe we won't go.

209
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:33,371
Don't worry about separating
from your lover, Cha "Chun Hyang".

210
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,476
It won't happen, right.

211
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,169
I'm so frustrated.

212
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,358
<i>The Hater.</i>

213
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:50,434
Your face became uglier.

214
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:52,229
My skin became worse
with worrying,

215
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,372
because of the lies you spread.

216
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,673
Because you are ugly in your heart,

217
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:58,375
your face is also ugly.

218
00:13:58,433 --> 00:13:59,683
What about you?

219
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:00,924
Didn't you say that you'll
let go of Dae Woong?

220
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,085
Why are you suddenly back with him again?

221
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:04,292
<i>You say you'll disappear, but you don't.</i>

222
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,888
You say you'll leave, but you don't.

223
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:10,124
You really have no shame,
and no morals, right?

224
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,523
Yes. Because I stick to him like
I have no shame and no morals,

225
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:18,780
<i>I can one day marry Dae Woong, have
kids with him, and lead a happy life.</i>

226
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:20,203
So, Hater...

227
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:21,888
I won't let you get between us.

228
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:23,537
If you dare,

229
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,343
you really will turn out like my curse,

230
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:27,735
<i>and become uglier and uglier.</i>

231
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:31,208
Ommabarani.

232
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:34,485
That person really is...

233
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:41,050
This is really nice!

234
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:48,642
Did you go see Teacher Dong Ju?

235
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:52,192
Teacher Dong Ju is leaving now.

236
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:53,995
Really?

237
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,325
That's good for him, then.

238
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,004
He said that he was going to an island.

239
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,154
<i>Island?</i>

240
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:01,886
The location's pretty good.

241
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:05,785
You're afraid of water,
so you won't ever see him again, right?

242
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,020
I told him that, too.

243
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:10,056
Well done.

244
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:11,754
After today's work ends,

245
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:14,114
Grandpa says to meet him for dinner.

246
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:17,231
I should go and properly greet Grandpa.

247
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:18,751
But...

248
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:22,188
What if Grandpa hates me?

249
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,776
I'm sure that Grandpa will like you a lot.

250
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,510
Your life plan is similar to
the life plan he made for me.

251
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:28,433
Similar?

252
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:31,653
Ever since I was small,
my grandpa always nagged me...

253
00:15:31,754 --> 00:15:35,654
to get married quickly
and give him a grandson.

254
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,848
Oh, really?

255
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:44,656
Your life plan... you definitely cannot
tell my grandpa about that!

256
00:15:45,484 --> 00:15:48,096
What if he gets excited and
decides to plan it for us?

257
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:49,673
That'll be big trouble.

258
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:52,447
I will follow whatever
Grandpa tells me to do.

259
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:56,960
That fox hid the bead inside of that man?

260
00:15:57,714 --> 00:15:59,455
<i>You have to do it that way.</i>

261
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:03,229
Don't try using Grandpa as your ally!

262
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:05,463
<i>What does Grandpa like?</i>

263
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:08,330
I said, what does Grandpa like?

264
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:14,106
<i>My Grandpa likes antiques
and stuff like that.</i>

265
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,102
<i>He likes ancient stuff.</i>

266
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:19,986
Oh? That fox's bead has
a goblin-fire smell to it.

267
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:20,930
It must be delicious.

268
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:22,374
- I must get it and eat it.
- Mi Ho, fighting!

269
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:23,874
<i>Do well.</i>

270
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:25,031
Yes, do well.

271
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:26,211
- Mi Ho.
- Hello.

272
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:28,170
- I'll see you later.
- Let's go.

273
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:30,441
I need to go to the costume department
to get the props over here.

274
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:34,182
Props? I'll go get them.
You go and find out the progress.

275
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:43,666
Are you following that guy?

276
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:45,064
What are you going to do?

277
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:48,524
I say, Ahjussi. Let go of me!

278
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,932
It doesn't matter if you
changed your appearance.

279
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:54,440
<i>I know what you are.</i>

280
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:59,655
You already know? That I'm a goblin?

281
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:09,520
I was almost beaten to death by Mi Ho here.

282
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:12,054
But now I'm okay.

283
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:16,810
This bead sure is something.

284
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:20,190
<i>Let go of me!</i>

285
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,720
Forgive me!

286
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:30,089
The tree I lived in has been cut down.

287
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:32,378
I really had no choice but
to come to the human world.

288
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,233
What were you doing,
trying to follow the gumiho?

289
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:38,750
I wanted to be friends, since
we're in the same situation.

290
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:44,063
You seemed to be after the bead
inside of that guy just now.

291
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:48,659
I know that a goblin has a great appetite.

292
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:51,975
But if you want to steal
the bead from him,

293
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,309
I can't allow that.

294
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:57,208
I said I just wanted to be friends!

295
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,893
The bead that the fox gave to that guy,

296
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:03,034
it had a goblin-fire smell to it.

297
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,726
What?

298
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,678
A goblin-fire smell?

299
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:14,377
It's true. I can smell better than a ghost.

300
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:17,301
<i>It clearly was a bead from a gumiho,</i>

301
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,792
but it had a goblin-fire smell to it.

302
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:21,645
What? How could it be?

303
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:26,548
That fox was probably made from goblin-fire.

304
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:35,442
Goblin-fire?

305
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:40,106
Grandma Sam Shin said that I
was originally made from fire.

306
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:43,399
That's why my tails are blue, like a flame.

307
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:58,396
The same face...
it's not a coincidence, is it?

308
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:00,987
It can't be...

309
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:04,905
It can't be!

310
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:30,395
Mi Ho is quite impressive.

311
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:33,271
Of course.

312
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,299
Did you like it, Grandpa?

313
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,675
Yes, yes.

314
00:19:40,356 --> 00:19:42,830
I heard that you liked traditional things.

315
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,785
Oh, that's right.

316
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:48,569
Let me dance a traditional dance for you.

317
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:54,134
Traditional dance?

318
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:04,703
It's great!

319
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,204
It's great!

320
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:17,696
She's so cute and polite!

321
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:22,848
I can also prune orchids.
Let me show you.

322
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:26,636
You learned those things before?

323
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:29,193
I learned about them a long time ago.

324
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,084
The kids nowadays don't usually know
about stuff like that. When did you learn?

325
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,309
You're so pretty,

326
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,578
<i>and so talented!</i>

327
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:53,478
You eat it so deliciously.

328
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:59,282
Mi Ho, do you not like the food?

329
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:01,119
The meat is very good!

330
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:06,078
Just the meat? I prepared
the other dishes especially for you,

331
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,479
why are you only eating the meat?

332
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:14,739
She thinks the meat is more delicious,
that's why she's eating it.

333
00:21:16,553 --> 00:21:19,396
The bean sprout soup is also really good.

334
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:23,267
I made the cabbage and
the kimchi just recently.

335
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:26,413
Eat those too!

336
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:28,219
Are the dishes I made not delicious?

337
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,032
<i>Of course they're delicious!</i>

338
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:33,633
She was eating it just now, didn't you see?

339
00:21:33,662 --> 00:21:39,133
She must've eaten them, since
the eggplants are almost gone.

340
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:41,206
Eat more. Eat more.

341
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:42,493
Yes.

342
00:21:55,892 --> 00:21:59,732
Oh, is that fridge new?

343
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:03,914
<i>What?</i>

344
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:05,947
No.

345
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,462
Is it good?

346
00:22:11,516 --> 00:22:12,942
Yes.

347
00:22:13,678 --> 00:22:15,995
Eat it with rice.

348
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:17,642
Yes.

349
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,378
Oh, Ddoong Ja!

350
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:35,483
He's not here,

351
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:37,220
so why are you calling him?

352
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,080
I miss him.

353
00:22:54,236 --> 00:22:55,550
What's that?

354
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,761
<i>I ate two bowls of rice because of you.</i>

355
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:03,814
My stomach's so full it's going to explode.

356
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:07,000
I played the flute, danced, and
ate a lot of delicious food.

357
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,770
Grandpa must be very happy.

358
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,682
If he knew that you learned
those things five hundred years ago,

359
00:23:14,797 --> 00:23:16,096
he'd probably faint from shock.

360
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:18,645
I was bored waiting for my husband
five hundred years ago,

361
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:20,536
<i>so that's why I learned.</i>

362
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:24,665
Now they're useful to me at
my future husband's home!

363
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:29,998
Maybe it's because I haven't noticed before,

364
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,821
but you've really lived for a long time.

365
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:36,644
You were so little and adorable!

366
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:39,989
That was twenty years ago,
so of course I was.

367
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:43,271
It's only been twenty years? How come
there are so many changes since then?

368
00:23:43,372 --> 00:23:45,056
Only?

369
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:50,188
Ah, it's because you existed
since five hundred years ago.

370
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,591
No wonder twenty years
seem like nothing to you.

371
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:56,886
Five hundred years.
That's really hard to imagine.

372
00:23:56,987 --> 00:24:00,402
Actually, it's been more
than five hundred years.

373
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:03,713
Mi Ho, aren't you scared?

374
00:24:03,814 --> 00:24:05,573
Of what?

375
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:09,053
If you were to remain a gumiho,

376
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:13,542
you'd be like you are now forever.

377
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:15,405
But if you turn human,

378
00:24:15,513 --> 00:24:19,440
you'll become old. You'll even die.

379
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:24,699
I guess so. But I'm not feeling it.

380
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:26,617
<i>Are you sure that's all right?</i>

381
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:31,222
You've had that appearance
for five hundred years.

382
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,111
To humans, age and death are very scary.

383
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:41,870
Woong, I haven't been living.

384
00:24:44,153 --> 00:24:46,876
I've just been existing.

385
00:24:48,243 --> 00:24:50,653
You've only lived for twenty years,

386
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,006
<i>but you've looked like this, and this.</i>

387
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:56,551
But I haven't.

388
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:00,765
I want to be like this,

389
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:05,769
growing and changing in my life.

390
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:11,245
<i>I often heard people's
wishes at the temple.</i>

391
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:17,075
I was very envious. People can actually
hope for something and live wanting it.

392
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:20,511
My life plan might look
very childish to you.

393
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:24,415
It might seem like it was just
something I randomly wrote,

394
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:28,197
but at the temple, it was the wish...

395
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:31,855
that I heard humans make the most often.

396
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:45,296
<i>Give me a good partner, so
that we can live well together.</i>

397
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:50,161
<i>Let me be with my children
and my family happily, forever.</i>

398
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:03,816
I'm about to become human.
I want to make them all come true.

399
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:06,104
A plain, average life...

400
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:10,105
is what I want the most.

401
00:26:11,682 --> 00:26:13,341
Really?

402
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:19,405
Humans will always have precious
memories to recall.

403
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:21,985
Actually, I'm very jealous.

404
00:26:24,112 --> 00:26:26,983
It'll be okay if you start
making memories now.

405
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,814
Come here.

406
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:38,620
Here. One. Two. Three.

407
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:40,504
Okay.

408
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:46,462
This is the first precious
memory that you have.

409
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:49,832
At Dae Woong's house,
performing for Grandpa.

410
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:51,521
Yeah.

411
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:54,647
Let us be full of memories together later.

412
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:56,732
Yes. Together.

413
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:08,517
The thing that you made and took around,

414
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:12,408
was made out of goblin-fire.

415
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,622
Is this true?

416
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:19,575
That goblin-fire was left before...

417
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:23,376
by my Kil Dal.

418
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:28,471
Kil Dal's bead?

419
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,584
So that child is...

420
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:36,785
actually...

421
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:42,586
part of Kil Dal?

422
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:55,688
I've... made a mistake again,

423
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:58,589
haven't I?

424
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,857
If you don't go back, you could die.

425
00:28:26,936 --> 00:28:31,241
What is this?
We haven't had much improvement at all.

426
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:34,667
It's the bead that's keeping us apart.
What can I do about it?

427
00:28:34,768 --> 00:28:36,326
You're not really afraid
of the bead, are you?

428
00:28:36,727 --> 00:28:38,427
You just want to avoid it, right?

429
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:42,082
Okay.

430
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,631
Even if I'm scared, we should
still make some progress.

431
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:50,142
Give me your hand.

432
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:56,634
Oh, it can take this kind of progress!

433
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,255
Really?

434
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,139
Then, what about this?

435
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:03,680
Oh, it's okay!

436
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:05,291
Really?

437
00:29:05,363 --> 00:29:07,146
What about this?

438
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,562
This one?

439
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,479
This one...

440
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,980
Ah, this is too close.

441
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:16,800
Stop here.

442
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,032
Ahh, really.

443
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,492
Here.

444
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:26,770
Let's go.

445
00:29:26,871 --> 00:29:28,249
Let's go.

446
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,261
What's wrong?

447
00:29:55,695 --> 00:30:00,579
Mi Ho, I have to buy some stuff.
You go in first.

448
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:08,116
Teacher Dong Ju!

449
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,714
What's the matter?

450
00:30:11,886 --> 00:30:15,816
It's really been a long time.

451
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:20,275
Teacher Dong Ju, didn't we just meet?

452
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:38,426
Teacher Dong Ju, are you coming
to see me before you leave?

453
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:43,694
Yes, I came to see you.

454
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:45,728
<i>But I didn't come to bid you farewell.</i>

455
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:52,429
I came to say that I really miss you.

456
00:30:57,077 --> 00:31:01,292
I will not leave. Definitely not.

457
00:31:06,068 --> 00:31:08,643
I just came to say this.

458
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,230
Teacher Dong Ju,

459
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,871
you're not leaving now?

460
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:15,072
I will protect you.

461
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:18,451
I'm okay.

462
00:31:18,588 --> 00:31:20,463
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

463
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:22,745
Nothing will happen to me,

464
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:26,066
since I will be very happy
by Dae Woong's side.

465
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,527
Right. This time...

466
00:31:32,728 --> 00:31:34,428
I have to protect you.

467
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:43,910
<i>The photo came out.</i>

468
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:45,846
Thanks.

469
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,932
We'll have to fill this
one by one from now on.

470
00:31:56,017 --> 00:31:59,083
Fill all of this together.

471
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,646
I heard you were going far away.

472
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,949
Did you come to say goodbye to Mi Ho?

473
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:33,203
It looks like my departure will
occur a bit later than planned.

474
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:35,890
Looks like you're pushing it back.

475
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:38,360
Just make sure not to cancel it.

476
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:39,586
Well, then. Goodbye.

477
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:42,258
<i>Until that promise ends,</i>

478
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,356
you have to protect the bead.

479
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:52,071
The bead that is in your chest,

480
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:54,124
you have to take good care of it.

481
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:59,058
You absolutely cannot let it get hurt,

482
00:32:59,118 --> 00:33:01,594
or meet any kind of danger.

483
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:11,178
I don't need you to tell me to take
care of it, because I already know.

484
00:33:11,262 --> 00:33:13,345
Also...

485
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:16,631
when it's time for her to leave,

486
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:21,148
promise me that you will let her go.

487
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:28,317
She will only go if you let her go.

488
00:33:32,818 --> 00:33:35,559
That won't happen.

489
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:38,248
Even if it does, there's no way
I'm letting her go.

490
00:33:39,011 --> 00:33:40,448
In the future,

491
00:33:44,449 --> 00:33:46,549
Mi Ho and I will lead very
long and happy lives.

492
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:58,108
If the person who had the bead wasn't him,

493
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:04,345
they could've gone through
a rather painless death.

494
00:34:18,658 --> 00:34:21,894
The chi that the bead is taking from
Cha Dae Woong's body...

495
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,995
will be up to here.

496
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:28,074
Until the rest is gathered,

497
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:33,023
I must also protect him,
so he doesn't get hurt.

498
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:37,037
I have to catch that goblin first.

499
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:47,372
Mi Ho.

500
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:51,210
You have to watch what you eat from now on.

501
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,093
You have to be like a human,
and eat both vegetables and rice.

502
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:57,054
I'll worry about that after I become human.

503
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:01,450
I really don't like to
eat rice and vegetables.

504
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:05,349
From now on, learn to eat some.

505
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:06,982
Practice eating plants?

506
00:35:07,015 --> 00:35:09,060
I don't want it.

507
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:14,880
You can only maintain this meat-eating
habit because you're a gumiho.

508
00:35:14,984 --> 00:35:16,784
<i>Just watch how you react
to it after becoming human.</i>

509
00:35:16,885 --> 00:35:18,591
Health is one aspect.

510
00:35:18,692 --> 00:35:20,939
Right after you turn human,
you'll become a pig.

511
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,754
Pig?

512
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:22,807
Yeah!

513
00:35:22,908 --> 00:35:25,437
Even Ddoong Ja has been
controlling his diet.

514
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,381
You must get used to a
human's eating habits.

515
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:31,154
But I still hate that.

516
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:32,689
I want to wait until
I actually become human.

517
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:37,991
If you eat vegetables, they'll make your
skin really good and you'll become prettier.

518
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,134
How could I be prettier?

519
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,749
I'm satisfied the way I am.

520
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,562
It's like I'm lecturing a picky child.

521
00:35:50,726 --> 00:35:52,960
I'm really worried about
when you become human.

522
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:56,255
I really understand a father's
feelings now.

523
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,164
Oh, Byung Soo?

524
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:05,521
What? The China filming has been confirmed?

525
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:10,817
Director Doong Gook, who is in China,
is my long time friend.

526
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:15,201
He said that he'll give me
endless help for this movie.

527
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:22,809
If it's endless...
how long will he support us for?

528
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,309
Around ten days?

529
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:31,971
My friendship with Director
Doong Gook is not that fragile.

530
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:36,070
Two months.

531
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,450
We were promised two months.

532
00:36:38,543 --> 00:36:42,415
Two months? Such a long time?

533
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:45,067
Looks like your relationship
must be very good.

534
00:36:46,727 --> 00:36:48,569
I wasn't thinking about that,

535
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,543
since he offered me his help first.

536
00:36:57,306 --> 00:37:02,680
We must film a great action
film on the soil of China!

537
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:08,734
Two months.

538
00:37:09,423 --> 00:37:10,809
Two months.

539
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:16,335
It's not like you're always
there for those two months.

540
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:18,553
You can always come back when you have time.

541
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,707
What are you worried about?

542
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:23,661
Because I'm leaving Mi Ho
and going by myself.

543
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:25,651
Is Mi Ho a child?

544
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:30,603
She's no different from a child.

545
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:35,513
You want to miss filming because of your
girlfriend and drop out of the movie?

546
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:37,620
No, right?

547
00:37:55,514 --> 00:38:00,131
I heard that Dae Woong is hesitating to
go and film in China because of you.

548
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:02,329
That's what Seon Nyeo said.

549
00:38:03,474 --> 00:38:05,218
Because of me?

550
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,094
You said that you would disappear before,

551
00:38:09,132 --> 00:38:12,665
but you sure are holding
on to Dae Woong well.

552
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,932
Hater.

553
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,519
Why do you hate me so much?

554
00:38:19,571 --> 00:38:23,288
I'm useful towards you.

555
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:27,351
No matter what,
you shouldn't be so annoying.

556
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:33,026
You're pretending to be human.
Pretending to be so kind.

557
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:36,253
You hide knives in your smile.
It's really annoying.

558
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:41,355
<i>You definitely will become a burden.</i>

559
00:38:42,283 --> 00:38:44,706
You don't know this,

560
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:47,707
and bring Dae Woong with you everywhere.
You really can make a person angry.

561
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:53,158
Woong.

562
00:38:53,918 --> 00:38:57,258
Woong.

563
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:02,111
Woong.

564
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:03,912
Woong.

565
00:39:11,373 --> 00:39:12,643
Woong!

566
00:39:15,388 --> 00:39:18,643
Considering you're here saying
my name over and over,

567
00:39:18,744 --> 00:39:21,344
you must know that I'm going to China.

568
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:22,569
Yes.

569
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:27,856
Woong, don't say that you're
not going because of me.

570
00:39:27,997 --> 00:39:30,262
You don't have to worry about me. Just go.

571
00:39:30,363 --> 00:39:32,124
Are you sure that's okay?

572
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:33,525
Yes.

573
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:35,154
Dae Woong.

574
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:38,245
Since your girlfriend is a gumiho,

575
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:41,346
You have to worry about a lot of things
other people don't worry about.

576
00:39:41,457 --> 00:39:43,539
It must be tiring, right?

577
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:48,139
I'm sorry for not being a normal girlfriend.

578
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:52,975
You can't be so sad. It just won't do.

579
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,982
We have to be apart for a long time.

580
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:57,963
I think you need an energy boost.

581
00:39:58,304 --> 00:39:59,612
Okay.

582
00:39:59,895 --> 00:40:04,431
I'll tell you a story that will
get you excited in no time.

583
00:40:04,462 --> 00:40:08,362
Because my girlfriend is a gumiho,
there are nine good qualities about her.

584
00:40:08,463 --> 00:40:10,885
Wow, there are nine? That's so many!

585
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:11,705
One.

586
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:16,506
Her uniqueness, since she's the only
one in the world. Special.

587
00:40:17,344 --> 00:40:18,120
<i>Two.</i>

588
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:23,321
You don't have to worry about safety while
walking around at night. Strength.

589
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:24,924
<i>Three.</i>

590
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:31,825
She's direct and never coy.
Honesty.

591
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:33,489
<i>Four.</i>

592
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:41,090
You shout that you like me, no
matter where we are. Courage.

593
00:40:41,855 --> 00:40:42,644
Five.

594
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,820
Ah, it's a quality that I
feel insecure about.

595
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,320
Have you seen such a beautiful girlfriend?

596
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:55,021
Confidence.

597
00:40:57,134 --> 00:41:00,304
Woong, drink this water while you talk.

598
00:41:04,143 --> 00:41:04,884
Six.

599
00:41:05,385 --> 00:41:07,385
The way she takes care
of me all the time.

600
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:09,731
<i>Seven.</i>

601
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:13,932
Cheating is death. Nervousness.

602
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:15,392
Eight.

603
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:23,393
She will never leave my side. Belief.

604
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:27,241
What else? What's nine?

605
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:32,811
You have to be happy again,
once you hear this last one.

606
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:35,675
Look left and right and see
if there are any people.

607
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:39,256
Clasp your hands so you
don't get too excited.

608
00:41:43,172 --> 00:41:46,125
The last one. Nine.

609
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:53,134
Miho, I just...

610
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:58,149
really, really, really, really, really,
really, really, really, really...

611
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,150
really like you.

612
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,696
Recharge complete!

613
00:42:10,034 --> 00:42:11,897
Right now,

614
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:14,724
I feel really, really,
really, really...

615
00:42:14,744 --> 00:42:18,699
really, really, really, really, really good.

616
00:42:19,698 --> 00:42:21,698
Really good.

617
00:42:45,552 --> 00:42:50,853
You should already see that there's
no way for me to disrupt them.

618
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:52,212
Because my pride is really hurt,

619
00:42:52,313 --> 00:42:53,855
I no longer want to go and interfere.

620
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:57,841
Don't back out even if your pride is hurt.
Continue what you're doing.

621
00:42:58,104 --> 00:43:00,796
It's okay if it only becomes
a small obstacle.

622
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:05,003
If you really want to break them up,
why don't you do it yourself?

623
00:43:05,243 --> 00:43:09,334
You seem more powerful than her.

624
00:43:09,627 --> 00:43:12,908
That's right. I'm very powerful.

625
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:15,587
Then why don't you do it yourself?

626
00:43:15,664 --> 00:43:16,958
If you take her forcibly,

627
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:19,243
she can't do anything about it,
and will give herself up.

628
00:43:19,344 --> 00:43:24,046
If I take her forcibly,
I'm afraid that she will disappear.

629
00:43:24,787 --> 00:43:27,199
That's why I can't do that.

630
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:34,206
I can't go to China with Dae Woong?

631
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:37,773
Last time, Teacher Dong Ju, you
gave me that... passport, right?

632
00:43:37,874 --> 00:43:40,489
Didn't you say that I can
go anywhere with it?

633
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:44,866
Recently there's been a weird
guy following Cha Dae Woong.

634
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:46,366
Weird guy?

635
00:43:46,467 --> 00:43:50,665
He was originally a goblin from
the tree that was cut down.

636
00:43:50,827 --> 00:43:54,038
Looks like he's after your bead.

637
00:43:54,144 --> 00:43:55,587
Really?

638
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:57,249
But he can't take that!

639
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,313
It'll be very dangerous before he's caught.

640
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:05,020
If Cha Dae Woong goes somewhere far away,
he'll be okay.

641
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,610
Tell him to leave quickly,
and hide the bead.

642
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,459
This way, it'll be safe.

643
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:21,215
What is all this?

644
00:44:21,316 --> 00:44:23,753
Woong, look at this.

645
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:33,302
Woong, I'm okay.

646
00:44:33,457 --> 00:44:37,054
A gumiho is eating vegetables and rice.
What do you have to worry about?

647
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:41,145
So don't worry about me, and go to China.

648
00:44:41,317 --> 00:44:45,600
Do you want to go live in
my house for a while?

649
00:44:45,844 --> 00:44:50,108
My tails have been reappearing lately.
I can't.

650
00:44:50,407 --> 00:44:53,692
Are you sure you're okay by yourself?

651
00:44:53,772 --> 00:44:57,806
If I practice, I can eat all of this
within two months.

652
00:44:57,845 --> 00:45:00,833
At that time, you'll be shocked.

653
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:07,275
Remember to keep in contact
once you're in China.

654
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,534
Because we're going to
the desert area to film,

655
00:45:09,635 --> 00:45:11,735
I might not be able to keep
in constant contact with you.

656
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:13,568
But, if I can find a signal,

657
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,945
I will definitely call you.

658
00:45:17,129 --> 00:45:20,890
There are no signals in the desert?

659
00:45:21,354 --> 00:45:23,927
I don't know if my cell phone
will have signals or not.

660
00:45:24,028 --> 00:45:26,237
But thinking of how Min
Sook is worrying for me,

661
00:45:26,338 --> 00:45:28,907
I'm sure it'll have the best signal.

662
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,866
Me too.

663
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:47,102
What is this?

664
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,663
<i>Fill it slowly.</i>

665
00:45:49,728 --> 00:45:50,751
When I come back,

666
00:45:50,852 --> 00:45:54,859
you have to tell me what happy
moments you've had.

667
00:46:03,614 --> 00:46:05,118
Woong.

668
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:11,956
Come back quickly.

669
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:18,814
<i>I love you</i>

670
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:23,158
<i>words from the bottom of my heart</i>

671
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:27,136
When I come back, the bead
probably will be healed.

672
00:46:27,222 --> 00:46:29,659
I'll give it back to you then.

673
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,860
<i>Until now I haven't given you anything</i>

674
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:37,761
<i>So I want to start telling you more now</i>

675
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:41,862
<i>Words that I would like to only tell you</i>

676
00:46:41,994 --> 00:46:45,231
<i>I'll fill this with my pictures
before Dae Woong comes back.</i>

677
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:47,237
<i>I'm sure he'll like it after he comes back.</i>

678
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:51,687
After he comes back, life will
be completely different.

679
00:47:01,032 --> 00:47:03,660
The guy with the bead is gone.

680
00:47:03,784 --> 00:47:06,633
I'll only get strength after I eat the bead.

681
00:47:08,585 --> 00:47:12,165
Grandpa, Ddoong Ja and I are BFF.

682
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:14,608
What's BFF?

683
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:16,618
Grandpa, don't you know this?

684
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:19,458
Best friend.

685
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:23,634
Grandpa, do you also want
to be my best friend?

686
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:24,712
Okay.

687
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:32,213
<i>I think I lost my mind at that time</i>

688
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:36,314
<i>How could I have left you</i>

689
00:47:36,415 --> 00:47:40,515
<i>I only love you, I'm really sorry</i>

690
00:47:40,616 --> 00:47:44,016
<i>I can only cry</i>

691
00:47:44,117 --> 00:47:47,917
<i>I think I lost my mind at that time</i>

692
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:52,018
<i>How could I have left you</i>

693
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,219
<i>I really miss you, I miss you</i>

694
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,520
<i>Please forgive me</i>

695
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:05,221
<i>I think I lost my mind.
I know that it's too late now</i>

696
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:08,954
It really has no taste.

697
00:48:16,297 --> 00:48:19,093
Wow! Your bag is really pretty.

698
00:48:19,194 --> 00:48:21,222
You're a fashionista!

699
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:23,660
Then, you want to take turns wearing it?

700
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:29,452
One, two, three...

701
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:36,734
Good work!

702
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:56,280
Ah! That was delicious!

703
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:58,586
Not really.

704
00:49:07,287 --> 00:49:11,687
Aigoo, aigoo...

705
00:49:11,692 --> 00:49:14,938
A continuous twelve hours on a
bus and a plane.

706
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:17,777
I feel like my entire body is stiff.

707
00:49:17,808 --> 00:49:21,567
You should rest when we're not filming.
Why did you follow me back?

708
00:49:21,614 --> 00:49:24,674
<i>You were in such a hurry to come
back now that filming ended.</i>

709
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:29,415
Cha Chun Hyang, do you miss Mi Ho that much?

710
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:33,241
I'm only worried about her.

711
00:49:33,351 --> 00:49:37,122
I know. But did you really not tell
her that you were coming back today?

712
00:49:37,298 --> 00:49:38,290
Yeah.

713
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:43,291
I wanted to surprise her,
so it has a meaning.

714
00:49:44,136 --> 00:49:47,035
Dae Woong hasn't been picking
up his phone these two days.

715
00:49:47,038 --> 00:49:51,341
There might not be antennas
near the desert, right?

716
00:49:54,688 --> 00:49:59,604
This is the quiet place near a
suburban area in Japan.

717
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:02,580
<i>How is it?</i>

718
00:50:03,716 --> 00:50:05,136
Do you like it?

719
00:50:05,205 --> 00:50:07,766
Wow, it's so pretty!

720
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:11,915
Teacher Dong Ju, you're moving there?

721
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:14,871
I'll be going with you.

722
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:16,378
Teacher Dong Ju,

723
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:19,179
you're going to talk about how Dae
Woong and I should break up, right?

724
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:20,926
<i>I told you that I won't!</i>

725
00:50:20,955 --> 00:50:26,760
I already have a lot of plans for
our life after he comes back.

726
00:50:26,874 --> 00:50:29,108
The goblin is still nearby.

727
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:32,163
If Dae Woong comes back with the bead,
he'll definitely go after him.

728
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:34,083
If you're by Cha Dae Woong's side,

729
00:50:34,184 --> 00:50:37,444
the bead will be revealed,
and he might steal it.

730
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,652
That goblin.

731
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:44,052
If I had my bead, I could've
caught him with one step.

732
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:48,099
Right now, you just need to
think about becoming human.

733
00:50:48,169 --> 00:50:51,913
For these hundred days to
pass quickly and safely,

734
00:50:51,933 --> 00:50:54,183
you must separate from Cha Dae Woong.

735
00:50:54,256 --> 00:50:55,832
On the last day,

736
00:50:55,987 --> 00:50:58,990
I'll bring the bead to you.

737
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:05,566
Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

738
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:12,560
She really doesn't have good timing.

739
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:30,158
You've been well in the time I was gone.

740
00:51:32,772 --> 00:51:34,216
Did she go to the chicken
restaurant to play?

741
00:51:35,919 --> 00:51:38,579
Before Cha Dae Woong comes back from China,

742
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,254
you have to leave with me.

743
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,993
I've already prepared everything.

744
00:51:44,645 --> 00:51:47,976
How should I tell Dae Woong?

745
00:51:48,044 --> 00:51:50,774
Should I tell him about the goblin?

746
00:52:02,806 --> 00:52:04,918
It's that guy with the bead.

747
00:52:04,972 --> 00:52:06,941
I found him!

748
00:52:09,743 --> 00:52:12,219
Action School is pretty good.

749
00:52:12,248 --> 00:52:14,456
<i>Help me!</i>

750
00:52:16,808 --> 00:52:17,649
<i>What happened?</i>

751
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,999
Did you get hurt somewhere?

752
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:22,981
My body's paralyzed, so I can't move.

753
00:52:23,032 --> 00:52:25,746
Get on my back.
I'll bring you to the hospital.

754
00:52:49,636 --> 00:52:51,915
- It's that guy!
- Goblin?

755
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:53,474
Here?

756
00:53:00,713 --> 00:53:02,481
<i>Don't come near me.</i>

757
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:04,868
This knife is very dangerous to you.

758
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:08,025
I'll go. Do not follow me.

759
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:12,465
Teacher Dong Ju...

760
00:53:13,174 --> 00:53:16,608
He's the one that catches people like me.

761
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:30,043
It's obviously in his body.

762
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,460
<i>I have to get it out without hurting it.</i>

763
00:53:44,176 --> 00:53:45,237
Who are you?

764
00:53:45,338 --> 00:53:48,019
Don't move. I'm getting the bead.

765
00:53:48,995 --> 00:53:50,627
Bead?

766
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,094
No.

767
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:57,572
You have the bead because you've
been possessed by the fox, right?

768
00:53:57,958 --> 00:54:01,677
If you continue to hold on to that,
you'll die.

769
00:54:11,368 --> 00:54:15,035
Die? What do you mean?

770
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:17,179
So you don't know anything.

771
00:54:17,232 --> 00:54:20,814
If you give me the bead,
I'll tell you everything.

772
00:54:21,722 --> 00:54:23,033
I can't give it to you.

773
00:54:23,299 --> 00:54:24,612
Move away.

774
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:27,998
Give me the bead!

775
00:54:28,025 --> 00:54:29,693
<i>Hurry!</i>

776
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,677
He got away.

777
00:55:06,573 --> 00:55:07,444
It's you, isn't it?

778
00:55:07,645 --> 00:55:10,024
The one that wants to steal my bead!

779
00:55:21,347 --> 00:55:23,582
What was that just now?

780
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:27,602
A goblin that wants the fox's bead.

781
00:55:29,255 --> 00:55:31,884
There are really a lot of
strange things in the world.

782
00:55:33,422 --> 00:55:34,806
Did he run away?

783
00:55:34,816 --> 00:55:36,210
He was injured badly.

784
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:40,511
Even if he managed to get away,
he won't come back.

785
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:44,594
Just now that guy said some strange things.

786
00:55:44,997 --> 00:55:46,840
He said that I'll die.

787
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,369
He said that I'll die because of the bead.

788
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:52,200
What does that mean?

789
00:55:52,214 --> 00:55:54,507
You know, don't you?

790
00:55:55,196 --> 00:55:57,419
<i>Let go! Fox, let go of me!</i>

791
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,187
Why do you keep annoying me?

792
00:56:00,246 --> 00:56:02,414
Because of you, I can't
stay by Dae Woong's side!

793
00:56:02,515 --> 00:56:03,529
You little jerk!

794
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,796
You're the evil one.

795
00:56:04,897 --> 00:56:08,104
You want to suck out all of his chi
and let him die.

796
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:11,554
What? What did you say?

797
00:56:11,626 --> 00:56:13,172
Did you put the bead inside of a human body?

798
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:16,114
<i>You wanted to use the bead so you
can suck up the body's chi, right?</i>

799
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,243
I did it because I wanted to save him!

800
00:56:18,364 --> 00:56:21,668
Your bead already took away half of his chi.

801
00:56:21,773 --> 00:56:24,545
<i>It'll probably be all gone in a while.</i>

802
00:56:24,657 --> 00:56:27,128
<i>You'll get the bead back then,</i>

803
00:56:27,201 --> 00:56:29,290
<i>and the guy will die.</i>

804
00:56:29,312 --> 00:56:31,102
What did you say?

805
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:32,294
That's impossible.

806
00:56:32,395 --> 00:56:33,947
Stop acting.

807
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:37,568
The one who was with you also knows.

808
00:56:38,152 --> 00:56:40,900
Teacher Dong Ju knows about this?

809
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,599
Right.

810
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:47,632
I won't chase him around anymore.
Tell him not to look for me.

811
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:59,140
After taking back the bead,
I'll become human...

812
00:57:00,032 --> 00:57:02,578
but Dae Woong will die?

813
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,529
You said if I held onto the bead,

814
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,712
Mi Ho will die?

815
00:57:11,813 --> 00:57:13,085
That's right.

816
00:57:13,186 --> 00:57:14,739
The goblin said that...

817
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,140
if you betray Mi Ho and refused to give
the bead back to her, she will die.

818
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:21,987
Then there's nothing to worry about.

819
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,582
I will not betray Mi Ho.

820
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:30,830
Thank you for helping me keep this bead.

821
00:57:33,086 --> 00:57:34,976
Cha Dae Woong.

822
00:57:38,928 --> 00:57:40,985
Let me ask of you one more time.

823
00:57:41,019 --> 00:57:45,067
You must keep the bead safe.

824
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:50,167
After one hundred days pass,
you have to return it to her.

825
00:57:50,268 --> 00:57:53,032
I don't need you to ask me to do that.

826
00:57:53,198 --> 00:57:55,811
I already said that I would do that.

827
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:15,268
Also, at a time... when she is oblivious,

828
00:58:15,569 --> 00:58:16,969
die quietly.

829
00:58:24,132 --> 00:58:26,417
Something big almost happened.

830
00:58:27,406 --> 00:58:30,000
He said that if the bead were stolen,

831
00:58:30,121 --> 00:58:32,815
Mi Ho would die.

832
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:39,458
Oh, this was really fortunate.

833
00:58:41,606 --> 00:58:46,153
But why did Mi Ho keep this from me?

834
00:58:57,584 --> 00:59:02,235
If, after you become human,
you no longer have Cha Dae Woong,

835
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,052
what will you do?

836
00:59:10,814 --> 00:59:12,850
At that time,

837
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,409
the world will no longer have Cha Dae Woong.

838
00:59:30,562 --> 00:59:31,804
Dae Woong.

839
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:36,173
Dae Woong. What do I do?

840
00:59:43,424 --> 00:59:47,999
Dae Woong. Dae Woong.

841
00:59:50,196 --> 00:59:52,161
Dae Woong, what do I do?

842
00:59:52,162 --> 00:59:54,062
What do I do?

843
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,468
Our Mi Ho really started
eating these things.

844
01:00:02,883 --> 01:00:05,048
She really grew up.

845
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,611
Half of the time will be gone in a few days.

846
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,975
The beginning is half of a whole.
Now that the half is over,

847
01:00:23,429 --> 01:00:25,253
it's almost done.

848
01:00:38,754 --> 01:00:43,421
[Dae Woong and Mi Ho's Life Plan]

849
01:01:06,722 --> 01:01:10,670
I chased away the goblin.
You don't have to worry now.

850
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:13,065
Teacher Dong Ju.

851
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:17,854
What's wrong? Were you scared?

852
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:22,526
The Kil Dal you knew...

853
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:25,699
Why didn't she become a
human, but disappeared instead?

854
01:01:27,347 --> 01:01:32,599
Because she mistook betrayal for love.

855
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:37,392
Are you scared that I'll disappear,
just like Kil Dal?

856
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:41,737
I will never let that happen.

857
01:01:44,444 --> 01:01:45,815
What if...

858
01:01:47,734 --> 01:01:53,634
What if Dae Woong never
gives the bead back to me?

859
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:59,637
What will you do?

860
01:01:59,738 --> 01:02:02,488
Will you force Dae Woong to give it up?

861
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:08,310
Even if I have to use force,
I'll get the bead from Cha Dae Woong.

862
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:14,024
If not, you will die.

863
01:02:16,497 --> 01:02:19,148
So it's like this.

864
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:22,025
<i>But you don't have to worry about that.</i>

865
01:02:22,046 --> 01:02:24,394
Cha Dae Woong came back.

866
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:30,608
The goblin almost took the bead,
but fortunately he did not.

867
01:02:30,842 --> 01:02:32,838
At that time, I told him...

868
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:38,204
that if he doesn't return the bead to you,
you will die.

869
01:02:41,418 --> 01:02:44,008
You told Dae Woong that?

870
01:02:45,006 --> 01:02:48,310
He will definitely give
the bead back to you.

871
01:02:48,394 --> 01:02:52,447
He will not let you die.

872
01:02:56,525 --> 01:02:59,013
You were scared by the goblin, right?

873
01:03:00,212 --> 01:03:03,549
<i>You'll be fine after drinking some tea.</i>

874
01:03:04,608 --> 01:03:06,778
<i>The goblin was injured by my knife,</i>

875
01:03:06,879 --> 01:03:09,581
<i>and won't last long before disappearing.</i>

876
01:03:12,495 --> 01:03:14,459
Teacher Dong Ju.

877
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:19,107
You said that if I were
stabbed by this knife,

878
01:03:19,127 --> 01:03:22,557
I would also disappear, right?

879
01:03:30,821 --> 01:03:34,436
Yes. It is very dangerous to you.

880
01:03:34,572 --> 01:03:38,635
I'm going to put it somewhere far
from you. Hold on for a second.

881
01:03:52,768 --> 01:03:54,562
I...

882
01:03:56,045 --> 01:03:58,322
have to disappear.

883
01:04:09,934 --> 01:04:11,108
<i>Mi Ho!</i>

884
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:13,730
I came back!

885
01:04:14,106 --> 01:04:16,010
Dae Woong.

886
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:19,942
What's with your reaction?

887
01:04:20,326 --> 01:04:22,739
You weren't shocked?

888
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:27,372
I was shocked. I was so shocked.

889
01:04:27,777 --> 01:04:29,982
You didn't tell me that
you were coming back.

890
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:34,306
I came back on the Director's
orders to help Byung Soo.

891
01:04:34,513 --> 01:04:37,975
I didn't sleep for two days and
finished filming in the desert.

892
01:04:38,062 --> 01:04:43,138
<i>Then I got on a 16-hour bus straight away,
and a 4-hour flight to come back.</i>

893
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:46,389
I didn't do it because I missed you.

894
01:04:54,567 --> 01:04:56,358
Okay, okay.

895
01:04:56,571 --> 01:04:58,621
I came back because I missed you.

896
01:04:58,752 --> 01:05:02,955
It really, really was because I missed you.

897
01:05:04,287 --> 01:05:09,056
But today I met a strange guy.

898
01:05:09,184 --> 01:05:11,932
He almost took the bead away from me.

899
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,211
Teacher Dong Ju chased him away.

900
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:15,612
Yes.

901
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:18,135
Why didn't you tell me?

902
01:05:19,573 --> 01:05:21,536
About you dying...

903
01:05:21,628 --> 01:05:23,798
why didn't you tell me?

904
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:30,056
If I don't give the bead back to you
in a hundred days,

905
01:05:31,234 --> 01:05:33,607
you'll die.

906
01:05:35,154 --> 01:05:37,113
Right now, your abilities
are gradually fading away.

907
01:05:37,214 --> 01:05:42,650
Your tails are disappearing...
one by one.

908
01:05:43,903 --> 01:05:44,592
Dae Woong.

909
01:05:44,693 --> 01:05:48,023
Why didn't you tell me
such an important thing?

910
01:05:48,253 --> 01:05:51,591
Don't you trust me? That almost let me down.

911
01:05:51,692 --> 01:05:55,947
But I didn't think that.

912
01:05:57,639 --> 01:05:58,776
You must've kept it from me,

913
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:02,977
because you trusted me, right?

914
01:06:05,244 --> 01:06:07,062
I believe you.

915
01:06:08,742 --> 01:06:10,744
After taking care of it,

916
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:16,194
I'll return the bead to you
on the hundredth day.

917
01:06:18,427 --> 01:06:23,089
You... have to do that.

918
01:06:23,857 --> 01:06:26,559
What's wrong?

919
01:06:26,975 --> 01:06:29,355
I like you a lot.

920
01:06:29,607 --> 01:06:35,083
I like you so much that I'm crying.

921
01:06:42,327 --> 01:06:47,004
If I'm with you, you won't fall sick, right?

922
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:52,335
I will always stay by your side.

923
01:06:52,756 --> 01:06:54,800
<i>Let's stay together, always.</i>

924
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:58,316
Let's stay together!

925
01:07:04,263 --> 01:07:08,005
I will protect you.

926
01:07:08,106 --> 01:07:09,798
Me, too.

927
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,684
I will protect you.
