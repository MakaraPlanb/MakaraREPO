1
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,090
I thought for a long time

2
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,220
In my brain is only you

3
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,560
Today I want to ask you something

4
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,110
Will you accept my love?

5
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
You explained to me

6
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,020
What exactly happened

7
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,460
Let me go or I won't care about you anymore

8
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,570
Explain to me, what's happened

9
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,690
This

10
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:30,760
That's...

11
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,310
That's light...

12
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,600
What exactly happened

13
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,300
You don't say right?

14
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,540
I will go to the police now

15
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,190
I say

16
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,460
My body

17
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,390
Can conduct electricity

18
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,270
Conduct electricity

19
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,850
When the heart rate reaches 110

20
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
So just now that you hug me

21
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,060
I didn't want to hug you

22
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,540
If my body conducts electricity

23
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,160
When I touch you

24
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,550
Look in your eyes

25
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,170
You will have an illusion.

26
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,250
Until thinking that you like me

27
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,810
Like you?

28
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,570
Anyway, it's just an illusion

29
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,730
Only effective for 24 hours

30
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,830
Then this feeling ...

31
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,830
It's too real

32
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,180
Now I look in your eyes

33
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,230
My heart beats faster

34
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,690
Anyway

35
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,630
It's just an illusion

36
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,770
Sorry

37
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,460
Good job, Chong.

38
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,780
You have to celebrate this achievement

39
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,240
This probably isn't going to vent because of a broken heart

40
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,340
Don't be too much

41
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:06,950
Look at the time

42
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,860
50.35 seconds

43
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,210
That's good

44
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,610
Can make time more than from high school

45
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,680
just 0.4 seconds

46
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,310
Why don't you look happy?

47
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,330
What this means?

48
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,390
This means...

49
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,060
I'm angry up to the limit.

50
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,380
Continue practicing tomorrow

51
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,030
I am Mai Shichong, must be embarrassed

52
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,370
Sometimes I want to cut your brain out and see

53
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,390
Whether you're happy or not is always the driving force behind your practice.

54
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,010
I wonder if you

55
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,820
must be a swimming robot

56
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,130
Maybe right?

57
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
By the way, in this world

58
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,370
Nothing is impossible

59
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,400
What do you mean

60
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,480
If...

61
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,210
I say "if"

62
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,950
In fact, there is lightning

63
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,180
Would you believe it?

64
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,780
Each word that you speak I understand.

65
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,990
But what do you mean by putting them together?

66
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,250
Is that right?

67
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,390
No one believed

68
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,940
But this is true

69
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,730
What are you watching?

70
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,550
The light didn't turn on

71
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,220
Still inactive

72
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,580
What's wrong with him?

73
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,070
Don't care anymore

74
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,390
You have already put electric shock on me twice

75
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,990
I lost myself for 48 hours

76
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,790
So you have to compensate for me

77
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,650
As recently known, will reduce you in half

78
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,270
Compensate to me 24 hours is enough

79
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:53,870
No need to thank me

80
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,380
No way

81
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,390
Don't even think

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,050
Also, we are not very close

83
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,270
Teacher

84
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,340
10 buns

85
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,260
5 pieces of duck

86
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
3 sets of steamed shrimp

87
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,720
She pay

88
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
Why do I have to pay?

89
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,370
I'm hungry

90
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,650
Need to charge the energy

91
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,060
I pay

92
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,050
Quickly!

93
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,770
Please eat

94
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,070
Don't you think this breakfast is a bit lacking?

95
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,430
Lack of what?

96
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,490
Probably because the rays of the light have drained my mouth

97
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,780
Want to drink a glass of milk tea

98
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,710
I go buy for you

99
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,260
Dink it

100
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:54,740
Unwrap the shrimp

101
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,470
Mai Shichong, aren't you doing too much?

102
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,220
why? Are you angry?

103
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,480
Otherwise

104
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,840
Would you like me to sing a Pikachu theme?

105
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,870
Pi...

106
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,350
I do

107
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,480
I do

108
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,190
Quickly!

109
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,710
unwrap cleanly

110
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,690
Welcome to the university listening test

111
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,670
Please read the following sentences

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,410
Bro.

113
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,820
Can you come to record it by yourself?

114
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,120
It doesn't recognize my voice

115
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,180
It's not that not

116
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,390
But people

117
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,150
noon like this, it's sleepy.

118
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
When I'm sleepy

119
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,570
Will pronounce it incorrectly

120
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,020
Ok

121
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:00,820
I do

122
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,160
Shichong

123
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
What

124
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,340
Litaixi

125
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,200
Don't you look at the way?

126
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
I am Lidaixi

127
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,470
Stupid guy

128
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,470
Daixi, this name...

129
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,650
Sounds too clever

130
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,720
But "Tai Xi" suits you better

131
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,220
May I ask...

132
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,140
Mei Weiwei and Mai Shichong...

133
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,800
Forget it!

134
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,930
What is it related to me?

135
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,310
Yeah, what is it related to you?

136
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,520
You...

137
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,070
Eh, you want to have a problem with me, right?

138
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,850
You like me?

139
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,210
But your flirtation method is like this elementary school boy

140
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,190
I suggest that you do not seek to do better

141
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,190
You...

142
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,780
Too old

143
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Who likes you?

144
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,590
This narcissistic woman like you

145
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,620
I have met for the first time

146
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,710
Ok

147
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,570
That's enough for today

148
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,270
Just continue tomorrow

149
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Why still have tomorrow?

150
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,790
We have agreed 24 hours

151
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,890
Missing for a second

152
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,010
It's not 24 hours

153
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,790
Otherwise

154
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,470
You follow me back

155
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,380
I sleep and you do the laundry

156
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,000
So will have only 12 hours left

157
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,610
No way

158
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,690
Just a moment ago I sent the powerpoint to the group

159
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,150
It's a job that we have to present tomorrow

160
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,810
Tomorrow we are the first group

161
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,540
You guys...

162
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,600
Don't be late

163
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,850
You do it alone?

164
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
You guys are busy

165
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,650
I'm free

166
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,940
Do not long and it's done

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,050
Next time if there is another group event

168
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,110
Tell me in advance

169
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:49,810
Ok

170
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,730
Yuxin

171
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,970
Are you going to study tomorrow?

172
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,910
Has instance noodle on my table

173
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
If you want to eat, just eat.

174
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,730
Thanks Yuxin

175
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,430
All must be blamed on that guy, Mai Shichong

176
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,110
All day, I couldn't eat at all

177
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,090
Mai Shichong

178
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,780
Actually, you can speak

179
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,160
I...

180
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,200
Absolutely I can speak

181
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,470
Jinjin

182
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,810
You tend to say a little less

183
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,250
You should have spoken to us a lot more

184
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Your voice sounded good like that

185
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,310
Coke on table is mine

186
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
You can drink

187
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,260
Thank you JinJin

188
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,040
Yuxin

189
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,250
Today you came too?

190
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,250
Weiwei

191
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
Today, someone came to change shifts with me

192
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,800
I think it shouldn't have anything

193
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,800
Jinjin

194
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,080
Mai Shiching

195
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,020
That's guy

196
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,170
Is Weiwei's boyfriend?

197
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,220
You mean Mai Shichong?

198
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,890
It doesn't seem like that

199
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,550
Weiwei probably doesn't like him

200
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,150
But I think Mai Shichong is a good person

201
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,620
The last time also helped us do some research

202
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:17,730
First of all

203
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,310
Came out to present the work that was given the last time

204
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,130
Physiotherapy Branch, Mei Weiwei

205
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,950
What do you want?

206
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,910
What noisy noise?

207
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,830
You don't want to get a grade, right?

208
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,430
Sorry

209
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,410
Today, you must present your powerpoint in front of the class

210
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,550
Feedback from respondents

211
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,660
We found that educating before exercise

212
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,130
will give you know more protection

213
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,300
More important is...

214
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,600
All of this is research from our group

215
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,730
Thanks everyone

216
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Good job

217
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,420
I have question

218
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,770
May I ask?

219
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,310
Electricity

220
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,090
Can it be used for your major?

221
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,750
Hope everyone asks questions...

222
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,670
that related to the topic

223
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,590
Electricity

224
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,390
It is very related to human life, isn't it?

225
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,830
So why isn't it about your major?

226
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,050
Actually, physical therapy work Have electrotherapy

227
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,610
If able to control the voltage

228
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,780
Electricity is fine too

229
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,420
Mei Weiei

230
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,540
You can't answer me

231
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,220
Feel that you will resist the use of electricity

232
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,590
Even though you know best

233
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,660
Well, we have a limited time

234
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,190
This group is enough

235
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,820
Next group

236
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:11,960
Medical field

237
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,310
Wang Lee

238
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,390
You promised me 24 hours to make up for me

239
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,420
Until now still not come

240
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,600
So I had to come to you

241
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,230
I just want you to charge me

242
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,230
Is it too hard?

243
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,510
Can you stop talking about electricity?

244
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,140
Or otherwise

245
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:29,860
Should I give you a nickname?

246
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:30,990
Pikachu

247
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:31,930
Mai Shichong

248
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,930
Don't follow me again

249
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,950
Why should I be like this?

250
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,530
It was clear that she was at fault first

251
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,020
What

252
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,610
Still not giving up on Wei sis?

253
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,770
Keep eat your food

254
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,630
You want to call, just call now

255
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,030
You made me uncomfortable to die anyway

256
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,770
Shut up

257
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,430
Wei sis?

258
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
Call her in a good word!

259
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,480
Me and her are not related at all.

260
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,090
You distance her to make it clear, understand?

261
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,510
No problem!

262
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,390
We want you two

263
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
get to know our company

264
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,670
Ok

265
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,100
I am going now

266
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,760
You drive

267
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,880
Trouble you already

268
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,530
Come on, come in quickly

269
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,200
Would you like to drink something?

270
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,090
No, Thank you

271
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,710
Make yourself at home

272
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,870
Today I visited

273
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
Because I want you two

274
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,650
Understand the situation of Sichong

275
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Isn't this just starting to study?

276
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,910
Still a beginner

277
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,930
Play all day, everyday

278
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,710
1st year students

279
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
It is an age playing for fun

280
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,090
By the end of the 4th year, it was good

281
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,340
He...

282
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,740
is a student

283
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,800
You look

284
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,270
The internship is now started

285
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,260
Oh

286
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,490
You are also from Nan Thi?

287
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,510
What field?

288
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,050
I studied economics

289
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,550
I and Shichong have met many times

290
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,700
Know each other

291
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,310
That's good

292
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,560
Xiao Mai grew up in a swimming pool

293
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,740
Very naive

294
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,100
Please look after him

295
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,490
You're welcome Auntie

296
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,930
Sichong was very famous in the university

297
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,520
Really?

298
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,200
Yes

299
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,690
During the competition in high school

300
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,700
There are many fans

301
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,060
Compared to other athletes

302
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,550
has everything already

303
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,530
He can be a celebrity in sports

304
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,870
What are celebrities?

305
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,640
We just hope this son

306
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,220
Playing sports happily is enough

307
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,230
Isn't that perfect?

308
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,460
Si Chong's talent

309
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,860
Everyone has seen each other

310
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,520
Sooner or later it will be a success

311
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,130
Indeed, as we came this time

312
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,450
Just wanted to ...

313
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,780
Give him one more chance

314
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,890
He was reluctant to join the provincial team

315
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,140
Admission University already

316
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,070
So please consider this as well

317
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:01,800
Future events

318
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:02,990
Just is the future

319
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,090
Ok

320
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,020
Today I do not bother much anymore

321
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
We're leaving

322
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,970
You came because of this topic

323
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,560
Trouble you guys

324
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,470
Why you say that?

325
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,370
Like this

326
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,680
If you two and Mai Shichong

327
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,490
Want to know about our company

328
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,360
Can go find me

329
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:18,900
Ok

330
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,660
Anything can come to me as well too

331
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,770
Thank you

332
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,620
Then I go send you guys

333
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,460
Be careful

334
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,660
Be safe

335
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
That is

336
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,390
Bro

337
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,080
All done

338
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,770
Do you have anything to add?

339
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,710
Let the teacher sign the name

340
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,060
Seek approval from the President of the Student Council

341
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,710
Excuse me, who is the president?

342
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:44,780
President

343
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,260
That's you!

344
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,110
Hello bro.

345
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,590
Physical therapy club

346
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,240
Yeah, like a blind man massaging in front of that door?

347
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,750
I watched it, and you want to do business with someone at the university

348
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,700
Our field of physical therapy

349
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,550
Of course, it must be different from a blind person

350
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,310
How many clubs are still remaining this year?

351
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,760
Only one club left

352
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,450
This year, there are many people applying for the club

353
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,690
The composition of the university is limited

354
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,250
I'm not one to approve

355
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,140
Bro

356
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,650
Our club leader is professional

357
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,990
The home business also has a physical therapy facility

358
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,670
Otherwise, please help me

359
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,460
Approve

360
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,070
Lie

361
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,140
Still will come and lie

362
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,460
Any clubs say the same

363
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,880
Like this, she left the matter here first

364
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,070
I will review it again

365
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,020
Ok

366
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,280
Thank you Bro

367
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,650
Why are there so many work in the afternoon?

368
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,590
This time, we have to prepare several more activities

369
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,670
In the afternoon, you followed a few people to help

370
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,220
Ok

371
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,140
What's the matter?

372
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
I can help

373
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,460
Not a big deal

374
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,450
Also, it will not look suitable

375
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,750
It's okay

376
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,060
Last time about Pikachu head It's my fault

377
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,050
Bro, let me help

378
00:18:59,340 --> 00:18:59,670
Okay

379
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:00,770
So you take her go

380
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:01,890
Okay

381
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,590
Follow me

382
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,750
Thank you Bro

383
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,670
Bro

384
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,030
I finished

385
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,760
Will you check it out?

386
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,830
There are posters around, you take it to post

387
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,380
And follow the board around the university

388
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,220
You go alone is enough

389
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,270
Okay

390
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,820
What are you doing?

391
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,430
It's all wrong

392
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,750
Isn't this last year's poster?

393
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,980
Oh no!

394
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,170
Really misunderstood

395
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,790
Weiwei

396
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:46,780
Sorry

397
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:47,450
Er...

398
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,640
They gave the wrong poster

399
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,230
If so, you unwrap it and paste a new one

400
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,670
Sorry Bro

401
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
I just finished pasting

402
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,770
Please go look for someone else

403
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,390
Weiwei

404
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,110
You haven't submitted an application ...

405
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,990
Physical therapy club, right?

406
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,570
I said it was a service, right?

407
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,090
You have to serve everyone.

408
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,820
Mei Weiwei

409
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,090
Where are you going?

410
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,110
Just your attitude is not right

411
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,740
What other clubs are you thinking of going to open?

412
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,310
I suggest you don't mess with her it's best

413
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,020
Again?

414
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,690
Boyfriend is here

415
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,340
A hero comes to help a beautiful woman?

416
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,010
Weiwei

417
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,610
Shock him

418
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,260
What electric guitar?

419
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,590
Didn't I give it back to you?

420
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,560
I told you to shock him

421
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,060
Bad people like them have to be hit

422
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,620
Who are you talking about?

423
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,410
That is you

424
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,850
Bullied the weaker students

425
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,860
You guys were shocked to feel

426
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,320
Mei Weiwei

427
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,860
Finish this evening with a poster

428
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,060
Otherwise your application

429
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:48,840
Don't even think

430
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,670
Weiwei

431
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,270
I am leaving

432
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,070
Weiwei

433
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:06,950
Weiwei

434
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,090
Weiwei

435
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,240
I was wrong

436
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,370
Sorry

437
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,580
I promised

438
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,760
Next, I won't talk about electricity

439
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,100
Even if the phone is dead battery I won't charge

440
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,450
Otherwise

441
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,410
You can shock me to get rid of my anger

442
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,910
You will also say

443
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:26,910
Sorry

444
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,730
I'm really wrong

445
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,150
Forget it!

446
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,830
Anyway, you don't understand

447
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,020
I understand

448
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,030
I really understand

449
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,990
You look, the student council has done this to you

450
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,060
You are still alright

451
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,630
I'm just talking about your electricity

452
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,530
You are so sad

453
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,900
About this

454
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,350
It has a huge impact on you, right?

455
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,260
Before, I wasn't careful, so I shot someone else

456
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,120
So they feel good about me

457
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,620
Then there were various misunderstandings

458
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,630
This give you

459
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,460
Take it

460
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,670
What are you doing?

461
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:14,840
Mom

462
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,310
The homeroom teacher called me to meet

463
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,330
Probably because of this woman, right?

464
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,270
This is not about her

465
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
What? Not about her?

466
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,040
You look at her, where is there like a student?

467
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,590
Mom, this is not about her

468
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,180
This is not really about her

469
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,220
Why are you doing this?

470
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,430
Change a person a day

471
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,020
Even the closest classmates

472
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,380
Left me all

473
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,750
Then

474
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,700
So I change school

475
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,740
Until I came to know Li Daixi

476
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,470
So I never told anyone my secrets

477
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,220
You understand, right?

478
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,240
I understand you

479
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,570
So

480
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,850
That you are trying to transfer major

481
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,770
Actually because of this

482
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,110
Anyway, I have to transfer major

483
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,920
So this club is very important. That I have to do

484
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,720
Mai Shichong

485
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,310
Very good

486
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,190
This work is not bad at all

487
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,130
Coach

488
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,770
Recently, Shichong's form is very good

489
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,420
The last time, the time was 50.35 seconds

490
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,130
So so

491
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,850
just a Third in the world

492
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,450
What?

493
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,990
Compliment you with just a few words and get narcissism

494
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,420
50.35, this is your high school record

495
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,910
Want to be more advanced

496
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,130
The road is still a long way

497
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,790
It seems that love can be really inspiring

498
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,090
I think you can't really sis Wei

499
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,230
What did you have to do with her?

500
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,390
Just got into school and then was in love

501
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,170
No, Coach

502
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,830
Misunderstand each other

503
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,580
Misunderstand

504
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,900
Oh ... Every time sis Wei comes to see it while swimming

505
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Let's swim faster

506
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,950
Swims faster than a duck

507
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,070
I'll told you

508
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,560
There is love, I don't stop

509
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,840
But I want to say

510
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,640
You probably know very well

511
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,310
Coach

512
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,380
I am not really in love

513
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:28,960
Forgot it!

514
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:29,900
Personal matters

515
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,510
After a while, continue to practice

516
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,190
Dingyi

517
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,590
I really ask you something

518
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,200
Is there any way?

519
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,860
That will increase the efficiency immediately

520
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,220
stimulate

521
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,450
Take medicine

522
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,340
Steroid medication

523
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,990
Diuretic

524
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,610
God

525
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,700
You may not...

526
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,060
No

527
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,060
Besides using drugs

528
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,360
Stimulate the body?

529
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,850
For example

530
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,750
Bitten by a spider and turned into a spider-man

531
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,690
Struck by lightning and become the flash

532
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,930
Then you can swim faster than your sensitivity

533
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:16,810
Really good

534
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,100
I don't understand

535
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,110
If the voltage can be regulated

536
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,510
Electricity can also heal injuries from exercise

537
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,370
My body

538
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,840
Can be conduct electricity.

539
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,670
50.35 seconds

540
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,920
Good job

541
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,530
0.4 seconds slower than the statistic you were in high school

542
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,490
Maybe

543
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,620
I will try to find Weiwei

544
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:57,940
Shichong

545
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,270
Pengpai Bro

546
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,390
Why are you come here?

547
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,090
I haven't done a little paper yet

548
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,330
You are here...

549
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,420
I came to look for information as well

550
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,830
I still have another class. I'm leaving

551
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Sorry

552
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,360
Hello

553
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,200
Weiwei

554
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,240
Do you have an appointment today?

555
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,310
Why?

556
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,510
Meet you today at 8 pm at the pool

557
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,530
I have something to talk to you

558
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,340
About what?

559
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,790
Can't you talk on the phone?

560
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,490
Calling is not convenient

561
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,170
Bye bye

562
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,630
See you tonight

563
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,390
Mai Shichong

564
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,270
Call me what's the matter?

565
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,070
Help me record the time

566
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,030
Why do I have to do it?

567
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,800
Where's Dingyi?

568
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,990
Please help me  record the time

569
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,030
Ready

570
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:01,850
Go

571
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,490
How much time?

572
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,610
51.46 seconds

573
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,970
That's 51 seconds

574
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,940
Why do I need you to come and order?

575
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,870
Okay, so call me what's the matter?

576
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,630
Mei Weiwei

577
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,140
Please Shock electricity on me
