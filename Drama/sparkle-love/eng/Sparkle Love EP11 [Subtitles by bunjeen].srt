1
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,750
Tomorrow I have a competition

2
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,690
Will you come to see?

3
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,790
Tomorrow is my birthday

4
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,310
The appointment you have not forgotten, right?

5
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,730
Tomorrow?

6
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,660
Fight

7
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,920
That's Mai Sichong,right?

8
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,480
The person behind will overtake him

9
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,420
How does he swim?

10
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,360
Mai Sichong, fighting

11
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,820
Chong bro

12
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,720
You look, I'm sleepy but have to come and play with you

13
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,500
Just give up today, don't make yourself unhappy

14
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,300
What bullshit? keep playing

15
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,740
Front left, you look irritated

16
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,790
The right one is like a broken heart.

17
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,810
Because today, sis Wei didn't come, right?

18
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,740
No

19
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,250
What is it about her?

20
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,620
If I let you talk, don't argue

21
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,680
Because today Sis Wei didn't come

22
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,400
So you are not in the mood to compete

23
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,710
Otherwise, you wouldn't take this much time away from Brother Rui

24
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,810
Chong bro

25
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,990
Today you look in a bad mood

26
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,570
Otherwise ...

27
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,020
It's okay

28
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,350
Today

29
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,740
Haven't congratulated you yet

30
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,850
Lose once, it's okay

31
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,270
The future wins will be better

32
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,770
Forget it!

33
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,450
Tomorrow, just apologize by face to face

34
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,810
Don't come to watch me compete, not reply to my message

35
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,950
Going to Peng Pai's birthday party, it must have been very happy

36
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,950
Mai Sichong

37
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,390
This's...

38
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,030
It is sports equipment that I bought for you

39
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,490
Take it

40
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,480
No need

41
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,130
What's wrong with you?

42
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,090
Are you sick?

43
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,620
You don't have to care

44
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,280
I know that you lost it. Must be sad

45
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,510
But still have a chance to win, isn't it?

46
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,280
If nothing else, so excuse me

47
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,050
I intend to come to you

48
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,010
You act like this

49
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,350
Be careful, I won't help you next time

50
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,420
Then you don't have to help

51
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,420
Chong bro

52
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,600
Are you guys okay?

53
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,660
Sis Wei did not come to see Pee Chong compete

54
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,700
During these two days, Chong kept swimming and not going anywhere

55
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,920
The competition still lost

56
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,420
Shut up

57
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,670
Weiwei

58
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,130
I say the truth

59
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,960
See from the examination report here

60
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,000
The symptoms are not bad at all

61
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,990
But will return to normal as before the injury

62
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,130
Still difficult

63
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,700
Where's Weiwei?

64
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,710
She...

65
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,170
He had been out since morning

66
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,670
Should have gone to Peng Pai senior's birthday party

67
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,920
Senior Peng Pai is not a kid like you

68
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,760
Can you please be an adult?

69
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,380
Weiwei

70
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,450
Bought you milk tea

71
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:41,780
Thank you

72
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,180
You are Weiwei's Peng Pai senior

73
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:45,990
Thank you

74
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,340
Wait

75
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,870
What is Peng Pai about founding the club?

76
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,980
He helped expose Fan Zheng Xiang, so we successfully founding a club

77
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,150
Oh yeah

78
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,100
About founding of the club,I'm not say thank you yet

79
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,860
It's okay

80
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,110
It's what I should do

81
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,280
Journalist friend

82
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,630
Would you call Weiwei for me?

83
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,630
No need, she already has a senior Peng Pai

84
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,130
She and Peng Pai are in a relationship?

85
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,750
Now not yet

86
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,830
but in future it's not sure

87
00:08:59,460 --> 00:08:59,660
Tape

88
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,380
What are you doing?

89
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,200
Hello

90
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,430
Err...

91
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,650
We are now preparing a new event

92
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,350
Forget about recommending

93
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,700
This is our new student council president, sister Jia Yi

94
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:21,700

95
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,640

Mei Weiwei

99
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,570
Your boyfriend is not bad

100
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,050
Exposing the mistake of the previous president

101
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,840
He's not my boyfriend

102
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
I'm still amazed

103
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,230
Why is Mai Sichong so dedicated to you?

104
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,990
Mai Sichong

105
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,310
Err..., we still need to check that way a little more

106
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,090
Excuse me

107
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,820

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,400

112
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,540
Well, it was he who exposed Fan Zheng Xiang

113
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,110
It's clearly that...

114
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,980
You guys do it yourself

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,570
I've something to do

116
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,480
Yu Xin

117
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,750
This one that the teacher said in the class, do you understand?

118
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,270
What we discussed in class today

119
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:15,950
There is still here

120
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,840
I remember like having this picture too, right?

121
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,310
Err...

122
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,060
I suddenly realized that I had something  to do

123
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,410
SO excuse me

124
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,670
Okay, so you hurry

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:24,820
Bye bye

127
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,490
Bye bye

128
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,350
Yu Xin

129
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:26,810
Junjun, let's go

130
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,360
Still have this...

131
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,780
I remember

132
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,350
The person who plays as Kurosaki Ichigo today so handsome

133
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,490
Junjun

134
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,460
Did you not say that today you will invite him

135
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,130
I haven't told him yet

136
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,760
Junjun

137
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,160
Hello I'm Xia Rui

138
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,610
Jun Jun, is this person is Kurosaki-kun?

139
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,340
Last time we saw your picture too

140
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,640
Not very clear

141
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,360
I didn't think the real one would be very handsome

142
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,910
Uh ... do you guys want something to drink?

143
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,950
I will buy it

144
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,990
No need

145
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,590
You guys go, I go too

146
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,970
Then we...

147
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,090
Go to a convenience store to find something to eat?

148
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:17,950
Okay

149
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,520
Let's go

150
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,420
Thank you

151
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,450
Do you like the god of death?

152
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,320
That day ... sorry

153
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:48,920
I...

154
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:50,940
I like...

155
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,330
Not...

156
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,690
I know

157
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,600
That day...

158
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,250
Too many people

159
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,320
Everyone teases

160
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,050
You don't know what to do

161
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,480
So you pointed at me instead, right?

162
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,670
It's fine, there's nothing to apologize for

163
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,370
At least this story really made us known, right?

164
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,410
Actually I...

165
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,050
Before, I was like you

166
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,400
At that time I was more boring than you

167
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,750
I'm just ...

168
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,180
I don't know how to communicate with everyone

169
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,960
When I saw you and I felt

170
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,090
See myself earlier

171
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,460
So I want to be your friend

172
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,630
Friend

173
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,460
Just

174
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,750
Common friend

175
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,470
I heard that you are sick

176
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,460
This is a drug and a supplement, you take it

177
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,500
Medicines and supplements

178
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,430
Take it

179
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,750
I heard that you were sick

180
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,580

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,380
Here are drugs and supplements, so take it

182
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,920
Forget it!

183
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,170
Mai Sichong

184
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,520
Mai Sichong

185
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,430
Mai Sichong

186
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,270
Mai Sichong

187
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,880
Mai Sichong, wake up

188
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,730
Anyone here?

189
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,880
Is there Anyone?

190
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,300
You wake up quickly

191
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,820
Mai Sichong

192
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,160
Mai Sichong

193
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,290
Mai Sichong, wake up

194
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,260
You...

195
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
be patience

196
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,890
wake up

197
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,900
Actually it is you

198
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,830
I'm really sick

199
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,860
All of them are hallucinations

200
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,390
Hallucination ...

201
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,700
Mai Sichong

202
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,770
Wake up, don't frightened me

203
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,220
Anyone here?

204
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,040
You...

205
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,340
You

206
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,220
You finally get conscious

207
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,180
You shock me to death

208
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,770
Just wait

209
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,790
I'll call 120 for you

210
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,460
Hello

211
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,130
Please send someone here

212
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,360
Fever is gone

213
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,380
Waking up and pretending to sleep again

214
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,170
No, I'm not

215
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,340
Why are you so sick of being such a child?

216
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,350
No, you're always like a kid

217
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,190
Not me

218
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,010
Or are you not ...

219
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,010
You...

220
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,710
In high school at 12 grade, you saved someone, right?

221
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,690
How did you know that in Grade 12?

222
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,760
Because I ...

223
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,520
Sichong, You already wake up?

224
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,910
Brother Chong is awake

225
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,370
We brought some juice

226
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,100
Are you still feeling sting right now?

227
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,190
Much better

228
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,110
Hello senior

229
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,220
Wei Wei Are you at University?

230
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,150
In the afternoon, I'll return to the university to take my thesis papers

231
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,130
Otherwise go have a meal together?

232
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,080
Just talk together

233
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,190
Ok, then you wait for me for a while

234
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,210
I will go now

235
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,350
I'll go to meet Brother Peng Pai at canteen

236
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,610
So excuse me

237
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,020
I will order food back for you

238
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,860
Then I'll go now

239
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,180
Chong bro

240
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,910
Do you think Mei Wei and Peng Pai have some somthing?

241
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,140
What about you, shut up.

242
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,280
Err...Junjun

243
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,870
Otherwise you go to eat first

244
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,030
What is the matter with Chong, I will tell you

245
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,000
Do you eat bananas?

246
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,080
Is your thesis not finished yet?

247
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,480
Peng Pai

248
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,290
Your birthday plan I told her

249
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,710
Sorry, I just...

250
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm leaving

251
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,570
Bro

252
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,650
You last birthday party, I didn't go

253
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,020
Sorry

254
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,300
I sent a gift You've got it, right?

255
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:08,910
Got it

256
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,260
But...

257
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,520
Why send books to me?

258
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,790
I saw inside it about sports economics

259
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,810
I think it is very suitable for you

260
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,230
But what I want is not a book

261
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,950
Also, I...

262
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,220
Bro

263
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,980
Actually, having adjusted my understanding you and let's be friends again

264
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,840
I am very happy

265
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,200
That day was not going to my birthday

266
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,370
Is something happen with him?

267
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
That day...

268
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,960
Went to watch Mai Sichong compete?

269
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,100
Umm

270
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,130
You...

271
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,380
Like Mai Sichong?

272
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,680
We are...

273
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,080
Nothing

274
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,760
Err...

275
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,590
The food that I ordered is finished

276
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,990
I go get it

277
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,940
You guys are here

278
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,140
Rector

279
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:15,680
Pei Pei

280
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,290
You look

281
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,720
Mai Sichong's score when in high school, can be attached to the provincial team

282
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,430
But this time, why is it so bad?

283
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,500
Actually, it shouldn't be like this

284
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,510
You have to pay attention to him a little more

285
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,970
Coach Li of the provincial team has always been interested in him

286
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,200
Last year's selection, why he not join?

287
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,280
I still have another meeting

288
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,480
You guys, consider it again

289
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,590
You look

290
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,160
When examining the body, there was no abnormality in Mai Sichong

291
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,880
I can only check the original files

292
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,410
Where's Mai Sichong

293
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,550
Chong seems to hurry back to the dormitory, I don't know why

294
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,070
Is he ok?

295
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,650
He's...

296
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Still not recovered, right?

297
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,130
There may be serious matters in the dormitory

298
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,630
Otherwise

299
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,420
You go to look after him

300
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,670
But how can I enter the male dormitory?

301
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,920
We have a way

302
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,420
Rui, today...

303
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,720
Is it cold today?

304
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,260
Rui

305
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,490
What are you guys doing? This is ...

306
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,850
Nothing

307
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,390
Chong bro

308
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,440
Why are your clothes is on my bed?

309
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,360
Ding Yi

310
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,260
Coach Pei Pei called us

311
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:19,820
What?

312
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,850
About practicing

313
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,280
Buy it for you, eat it

314
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,550
You first

315
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,730
When I was in the hospital

316
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,720
You went to eat with Peng Pai

317
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,780
What are you talking about?

318
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,620
I didn't go to his birthday party

319
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,540
So I went to apologize to him

320
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,320
You didn't go to his birthday party

321
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,370
Isn't it that I have to go see you for a match?

322
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,400
In the end, I couldn't keep up

323
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,180
What are you smiling at?

324
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,580
Nothing

325
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,180
You lose swimming competition

326
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,500
So frustrated, right?

327
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,610
Also get sick

328
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:38,690
It doesn't matter

329
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,370
I don't shed tears because of all this

330
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,500
I think our electro therapy is useless

331
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,390
Otherwise, do we find another way?

332
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,830
It's okay

333
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,080
I thought for a long time

334
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,440
That I swim faster, not because you shock me

335
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,830
Next time, you just come and watch me compete

336
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,810
I must win

337
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,350
Why?

338
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:57,990
Because I like ...

339
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,010
I'm going to buy two bottles of mineral water

340
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,290
I will tell you a big secret

341
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:22,820
What?

342
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,590
Weiwei is taking care of Mai Si Chong at our dormitory

343
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,390
Weiwei takes care of Mai Si Chong in your dorm

344
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,210
Turn down the sound

345
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,870
No way

346
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,580
They are...

347
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,690
No way

348
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,570
Wahy?

349
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,600
I will tell you

350
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,880
When Chong bro at high school, he makes a very good time record

351
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,910
But when he entered the university he couldn't do it

352
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,530
But every time that he saw Weiwei

353
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,850
Immediately swam faster

354
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,720
This power of love

355
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,050
Mai Sichong

356
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,980
Probably didn't really like Weiwei, right?

357
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,700
Why?

358
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:53,900
Are you jealous?

359
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,730
That's you who jealous them

360
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,220
Dai Xi, then let's go for a walk

361
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,950
No

362
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,550
They are in the room I can't go back

363
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,000
Not go

364
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,450
That ... brought it back to me
