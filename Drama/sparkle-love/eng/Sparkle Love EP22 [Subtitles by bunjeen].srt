1
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,950
You are awake

2
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,090
How are you feel?

3
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,290
Is it uncomfortable?

4
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,990
You shocked me

5
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,080
If not, Li Dai Xi, tell me

6
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,460
I didn't even know you fainted

7
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,020
What happened?

8
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,870
It seems that my electricity is now gone

9
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:40,850
You look

10
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,780
My electricity, it's gone

11
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,490
Your electricity is gone

12
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,600
I went to see Dr. Jiang

13
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,200
Dr.Jiang had already taken the electric out from me

14
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,460
This child...

15
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,090
Dr. Jiang's equipment was not completely tested

16
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,310
What if it is harmful to the body?

17
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,070
Here is the complete test here

18
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,160
It really works

19
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,810
Electricity is gone

20
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:07,870
That's  great

21
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,140
You come with me

22
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,350
So I gonna go

23
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,580
I'm going to pour water to you

24
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,240
I'll go with you

25
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,120
Sit down

26
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,680
Your name

27
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,490
Uncle, did you know?

28
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,180
Don't argue

29
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,790
Name

30
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,630
Mai Si Chong

31
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,820
With our Weiwei

32
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,730
How are you guys related?

33
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,660
Huh...

34
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,620
He hesitated

35
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,550
A man who hesitates, is it reliable?

36
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,840
I didn't hesitate

37
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,530
I didn't hesitate

38
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,520
I like Weiwei

39
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,450
He said he like you

40
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,690
I think

41
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,280
By now you should be studying

42
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,280
Now is school age

43
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,550
Drink water

44
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,520
Why hurry?

45
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,720
Follow me to the kitchen

46
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,970
Not finished speaking yet

47
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,230
This is like you say

48
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,570
Age of learning, so go to learn cooking

49
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,190
Now you still have time to confess

50
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,280
I'll go see you

51
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,670
It's hard to back down

52
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,990
A man playing in the water

53
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,620
After a while, it sinks from the surface of the water

54
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,740
What's wrong with you guys?

55
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,190
Have something to say, just say it

56
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,040
It's like this every day

57
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,360
It makes us stressful when practicing

58
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,830
You don't understand

59
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,700
Breaking news

60
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,000
Weiwei solved that problem

61
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,240
Now, even if Xia Rui would release a video clip

62
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,730
Nobody believed him

63
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,760
This crisis has passed

64
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,500
Chong will go for a drug test soon

65
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,020
At that time

66
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,960
Let's wait and see

67
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,460
Really?

68
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,200
ตกลงมันเกิดอะไรขึ้น?

69
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,230
Yes, yes, tell us quickly

70
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:44,970
You don't have to ask

71
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,420
As long as you remember

72
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,610
Do your best to practice

73
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,740
Learn a lot from brother Chong

74
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,030
Dr.

75
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,980
Sorry, you guys are late. Tomorrow will come again

76
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,100
Doctor

77
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,230
He is a provincial team athlete

78
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,130
Have come to check for drugs

79
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,040
Can you give us certification today?

80
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,500
Mai Si Chong

81
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,630
In you case

82
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,690
Must have a examination request from the university

83
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Examination request

84
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,880
Tomorrow the university opens and will come again

85
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,340
What should we do now?

86
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,350
Forgot it

87
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,350
Let's talk again tomorrow

88
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,270
Let's go

89
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,170
Drug examination site, why is it so far?

90
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,430
Last time it was very difficult to come

91
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,530
At this time, I couldn't call for a car

92
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,200
No cars at all

93
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,920
Weiwei

94
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,420
Weiwei

95
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,330
Did the car come?

96
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,290
Haven't come yet

97
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,740
You sleep like this will catch a cold

98
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,060
Otherwise

99
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,840
Let's find a place to stay

100
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,170
Let's go

101
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,720
Took a small hotel room, isn't it better?

102
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,030
This one is too luxurious.

103
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,630
No

104
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,210
How can I put you in such a pitiful state?

105
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,220
Here is fine

106
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,990
Welcome, Can I help you?

107
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,890
Two rooms

108
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,450
Ok

109
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,790
Sorry, there is only one room left

110
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,660
Only one room left

111
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,480
Not a standard room?

112
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,750
I will go ask

113
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,850
Well, it's late now

114
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,480
Don't ask

115
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,610
Let's talk again tomorrow

116
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,780
I'll take a shower first

117
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,090
Can I help you blow?

118
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,980
Weiwei

119
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,840
I will ask if there is any additional room

120
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,790
Hello, please check again if the room is available or not

121
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,730
Guests just check out ,please wait a moment

122
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,120
What do you plan to tell Master Mei Ling?

123
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,850
Speak truthfully

124
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,890
Why do you look so happy?

125
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,230
Someone will be able to join the province team. Of course, I must be happy

126
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,690
So

127
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Waiting for me to join the provincial team

128
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,720
When children's day

129
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,890
So you can travel with me

130
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,660
You have grown up so much and will still go on a children's day trip?

131
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,250
Why I can't?

132
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,160
Are you going or not?

133
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,310
Look at my mood first

134
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,220
No

135
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,720
Must go

136
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:05,980
Professor Mei Ling

137
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,950
I would like to consider about drug testing with the provincial team

138
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,740
I am not cheating

139
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,490
So

140
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,690
No matter how rigorous the drug testing is

141
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,190
I am pleased to do

142
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,260
Mai Si Chong

143
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,340
Hasn't your coach told you yet?

144
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,350
What?

145
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,630
Overdue for drug testing

146
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,570
And

147
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,850
You have been eliminated from the province team

148
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,250
But your coach still believes in you

149
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,730
She believes you are not a cheating boy

150
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,940
Therefore, the university has been discussing for a long time

151
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,120
The decision is final

152
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,110
Let you be punished with criticism

153
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,530
Ok

154
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,930
I understand, Professor Mei Ling

155
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,110
So, excuse me

156
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,250
Let's go

157
00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,980
Why? Coach

158
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,680
This is...

159
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,550
I still can't figure out how to tell Mai Si Chong

160
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
But it cannot be delayed any more

161
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,310
This one be announced today?

162
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,780
Tomorrow

163
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,520
Announced with the list of provincial teams

164
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,370
You and Mai Si Chong are in the same dormitory

165
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,570
Please comfort him

166
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,930
Anyway, this year our team has you participating

167
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:33,980
This many days

168
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,770
You also have time to rest and practice

169
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,870
After you entered the province team

170
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,300
It doesn't get any easier than in the university team

171
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,240
Just fighting

172
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,140
Come on

173
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,030
You don't have to think about it

174
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,830
Just not joining the provincial team

175
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,510
Not a big deal

176
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,290
Next year will continue to break the record

177
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,110
Look if he will let me join the team

178
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,740
But because you wanted to protect me, so you didn't go for a drug test

179
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,840
Otherwise, you have joined the provincial team already

180
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,450
Weiwei

181
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,650
Didn't I tell you?

182
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,920
My past life

183
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,660
Swimming is the most important thing

184
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,900
But after I met you

185
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,490
I just discovered that

186
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,630
In life there are many possibilities

187
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,190
There are many beautiful things

188
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,320
That makes my heart beat

189
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,060
So

190
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,050
Whether you can conduct electricity or not

191
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,240
You are the cutest to me

192
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,930
It's the happiest Pikachu

193
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,400
Don't be sad

194
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,730
Smile please

195
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,180
Not enough

196
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:09,490
Quickly

197
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:11,890
Let's go

198
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:13,840
Go

199
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,290
Where's Weiwei?

200
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,040
She was called by Yu Xi Sin

201
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,700
Just can't enter the province team

202
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,610
You guys are like this

203
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,930
Do like going to my grave like that

204
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,830
Not an ideal grave?

205
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,320
Rui

206
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,610
Rui

207
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,660
In the afternoon, why don't you go to practice?

208
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,020
You're really stupid

209
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,070
Brother Rui has already gone to the provincial team

210
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,280
In the afternoon, he asked to leave to adjust his practice schedule

211
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,240
Rui

212
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,930
Sit sit sit

213
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,200
Chong

214
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,170
Rui

215
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,430
We are all brothers

216
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,170
What's going on, why can't we talk well?

217
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,620
Haven't you heard that saying

218
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,670
If someone suggests you to be generous

219
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,700
You'd better stay away from him

220
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,700
Otherwise, when the storm comes

221
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,490
He will also hurt you

222
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,600
Why are you talking to Brother Rui like this?

223
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,040
What are you shouting at her?

224
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,640
enough

225
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,270
Xia Rui

226
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,350
Don't you have anything to say to me?

227
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,060
All that should be said, I have already said it

228
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,430
Rui

229
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,460
Dad

230
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,600
Yu Xin

231
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,210
Come here

232
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,920
Uncle, Hello

233
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,000
You are Weiwei, right?

234
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:53,920
Hello

235
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,600
Why must you be so formal?

236
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,850
เวยเวยไม่ใช่คนอื่นซะหน่อยWeiwei is not someone else

237
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,150
Come on Weiwei

238
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,380
What do you want to eat? Just order

239
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,830
We can eat it all

240
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,600
Or should we talk about business first?

241
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,590
Weiwei, you want to know, right?

242
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,290
About Mai Si Chong

243
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,130
Yes

244
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,100
I called to ask

245
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,380
The provincial team leader

246
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
Nothing but worry about that

247
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,590
Mai Si Chong

248
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,350
is going the wrong way

249
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,440
But only need someone to prove

250
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,380
He is talented

251
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,360
Can do it for sure

252
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,700
So we came to you, dad

253
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,860
Do you know anyone over the years?

254
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,240
Who is a leader and speaks well

255
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,530
Stupid girl

256
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,170
Think about it

257
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,450
If I look for someone to defend him

258
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,330
Like that, others would think

259
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,610
Mai Si Chong

260
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,740
use connection

261
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,380
so

262
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,540
so, what should we do?

263
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,400
You have to find Lobbyist

264
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,590
And

265
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,010
This Lobbyist

266
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,150
It must be reliable

267
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,850
And

268
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,950
With Mai Si Chong famuly

269
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,250
There must be no personal relationship with each other

270
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,650
Sun Yang

271
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,770
Xia Rui

272
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,920
You admit to confess your mistakes

273
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,370
Everyone is ready to forgive

274
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,620
Xia Rui

275
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,510
Are you there?

276
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,110
This one be announced today?

277
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,380
Tomorrow

278
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,130
Announced with the list of provincial teams

279
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,290
Why is there no announcement?

280
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,670
Coach Pei Pei

281
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,350
Hello

282
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:12,860
Coach

283
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,140
Hello

284
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,310
Welcome

285
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,450
Here. this way

286
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,890
This time is the provincial team selection playoff round

287
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,780
How important is it? I won't have to say much

288
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,830
For equality

289
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,960
You have to pass a drug test before the competition

290
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,990
Hope that you guys

291
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,400
Will show your full potential

292
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,070
Got it?

293
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,190
Prepare well

294
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,500
Finished and go have a meal together

295
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,620
Ok

296
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,370
Thank you for the previous story

297
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,210
You're welcome

298
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,070
Let's go get ready

299
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,290
I bet Chong will win

300
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,710
What if Rui wins?

301
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,280
No way

302
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,510
If he win

303
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,740
I'll be drinking water in the pool for a month

304
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,350
Where's Xia Rui?

305
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,800
What time is it, and he hasn't come yet?

306
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,320
I'll go and see him

307
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,780
Mai Si Chong

308
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,310
I accept

309
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,860
You are an excellent swimmer

310
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,060
I'm jealous

311
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,060
So I did a lot of things that hurt you and Mei Weiwei

312
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,680
Game between us

313
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,380
I lost from the start

314
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,230
So this competition is meaningless

315
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,920
I owe you guys, sorry

316
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,490
Sorry

317
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,160
Why you don't take it and see?

318
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,070
Why me?

319
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,780
This might be good news for Xiao Chong

320
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,810
I am a generous person

321
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,610
Let you see first

322
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,390
Glad?

323
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,170
Lao Mai, why are you so serious?

324
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,320
Don't you shock me

325
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,030
Mai Si Chong in this playoff round

326
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,360
Hit a record at 50.35 seconds

327
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,810
Successfully entered the provincial team

328
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,780
Congratulations

329
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,890
This old man

330
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,910
Fool me?

331
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,410
Really unthinkable

332
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,130
Open the first week of semester, people will register so much

333
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,250
Finally, our physical therapy club can survive

334
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Who made our bosses become jokes?

335
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,340
Hello Everybody

336
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,400
Welcome everyone to my live

337
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,230
I didn't think the physical therapy club would be this hot

338
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,210
Right now, our President Lin Bai Hui is teaching everyone Tai Chi

339
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,880
You don't take me, I don't take

340
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,100
Ok

341
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,130
Let's see where our Weiwei is

342
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,410
Very similar

343
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,010
Similar what?

344
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,200
Just 199

345
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,980
Will get Mei Weiwei electric eel back home

346
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,840
This kind is too cheap

347
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,680
Steamed fish is more expensive than her

348
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,070
Our Weiwei

349
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,150
How will it be compared with the money?

350
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,800
How did you come?

351
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,410
Where's Ding Yi?

352
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,510
Don't know

353
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,820
After class, just ran away

354
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,390
Why are you so happy?

355
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,460
Of course

356
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,980
Well, your boyfriend is so handsome

357
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,510
Others must be very jealous

358
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,040
Right?

359
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:14,740
I gonna go

360
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,010
Why are you still wearing this?

361
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,960
You don't have to use it

362
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,570
Anyway, I'm used to

363
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,390
Wear it and I feel comfortable

364
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,320
Ok

365
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,330
Did you have anything you want to do, but did you dare to do it?

366
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,080
I haven't swam yet

367
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,110
Swim

368
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,320
Your boyfriend is a great swimmer. How did you...

369
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,160
Do you want this?

370
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:36,870
I teach you

371
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:37,640
Go

372
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,160
Otherwise

373
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,660
Forgot it

374
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,090
I...

375
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,510
It's ok

376
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,200
During practice

377
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,220
Not many people

378
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:52,730
Let's go

379
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,420
But...

380
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,740
I've never swam before

381
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,260
Weiwei

382
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,410
Got me what are you afraid of?

383
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,460
Trust me

384
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,050
Let's go

385
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,070
Come on

386
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,870
You have not yet entered the pool, so what are you afraid of?

387
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,410
Come on

388
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,780
But

389
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,790
Last time you said

390
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,880
Last time I was almost drowned because of you

391
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,660
Be careful

392
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,800
So you don't let me go

393
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,550
Yes, I don't let you go

394
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,500
I'll be by your side

395
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,590
Don't take advantage with me

396
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,910
Why is it me who takes advantage?

397
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,180
Obviously, you're the one who takes advantage

398
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,450
All right

399
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,340
Come on, hold this one and let's try

400
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,020
Trust me, I'm on your side

401
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:12,950
So you take me

402
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,640
Really unthinkable that I would have a day to swim in the pool

403
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,500
How is it?

404
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,440
The days when there is no electricity

405
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,390
So happy, right?

406
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,660
Before I

407
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,730
Tend to worry about my own conductivity

408
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,770
So these things are really hard to think about

409
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,710
And never thought of my own future

410
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,880
So now you can start

411
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,730
Plan your future

412
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,670
Also have

413
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,710
Our future too
