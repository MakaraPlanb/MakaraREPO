1
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,130
I am a former student council president. Fan Zheng Xiang

2
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,190
Misappropriated funding of the council

3
00:01:59,210 --> 00:01:59,950
Misconduct

4
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,660
Was removed from the position of student council president

5
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,310
Considered as a punishment

6
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:04,940
All right

7
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,270
About the student council president, I knew

8
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,270
You are doing very well

9
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,230
So fighting!

10
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,630
Thank you professor

11
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,980
All right, I have class

12
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,010
I'm going

13
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,850
Thank you bro

14
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,410
Why haven't you answered me yet?

15
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,110
See from the report of this examination

16
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,100
Symptoms are not bad at all

17
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,530
But will return to normal as before the injury

18
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,550
Still considered difficult

19
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,220
It's okay, Auntie

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,250
I have my way

21
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,420
Is this Jun Jun?

22
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,060
Right

23
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,330
Our little girl grows up very fast

24
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,560
I remember that Xiao Luo was still very small before

25
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,480
Yeah

26
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,950
You don't know

27
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,520
Mai Sichong and my Jun Jun

28
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,550
study at the same university

29
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,290
What field of study are you in?

30
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,550
I...

31
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,100
Physical Therapy

32
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,130
So...

33
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,070
You and Mei Weiwei are in the same dormitory

34
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,860
Um

35
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,690
When you were kids

36
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,140
Be together every day

37
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,270
When they moved home

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
our Junjun

39
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,700
Even playmates don't have

40
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,020
Why can't I remember?

41
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,050
When?

42
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,230
What do you remember?

43
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,530
Remember only the dog?

44
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,430
So...

45
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,880
Mom, auntie

46
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,910
I'll go back to the university

47
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,020
Xiao Chong, aren't you going to go back to the university as well?

48
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,710
Go together

49
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,850
Let's go

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,380
Be careful

51
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:46,730
Ok

52
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,780
Safe back

53
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,200
Byebye

54
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:02,860
Junjun

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,700
Your cell phone is upside down

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
oh

57
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,970
Junjun

58
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,820
Do you have any lessons this hour?

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,500
You...

60
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,770
Want to know the schedule of Mei Weiwei?

61
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,600
Are you guys really close?

62
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,710
I...

63
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,780
I am not close to her at all

64
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,630
I and her ... How could that be?

65
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,390
Close?

66
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,200
What is this?

67
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,220
This

68
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,010
Give you

69
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,560
give me?

70
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,230
Thank you

71
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,190
So cool!

72
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,200
It looks almost like me

73
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,550
right?

74
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,860
Passed

75
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,140
Why are you here?

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,790
Return your gloves

77
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:18,950
Thank you

78
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,060
Very good

79
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,990
Weiwei

80
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,220
I heard that the Student Council Chairman's embezzlement was exposed

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,080
Do you do it?

82
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,190
No not me

83
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,440
Long story

84
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
I'll tell you this time it's not me

85
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,470
Now tell him

86
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,100
OK, so who helped you with that four-eyed guy?

87
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,190
All right

88
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,630
Actually, it is Peng Pai senior

89
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,070
Open this club successfully. He has helped us a lot

90
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:38,860
really?

91
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:39,720
wait

92
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,230
Who do you say?

93
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,380
Peng Pai senior

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,540
Let's not say it again. Let's talk about club activities

95
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,860
I thought it all

96
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,700
Mei Weiwei

97
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,330
Why

98
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,360
Weiwei

99
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,510
What's happen?

100
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,230
Nervous

101
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,810
Come on

102
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,830
Look

103
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,380
I'll give you look

104
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,150
I typed 3,941 words

105
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,070
You look

106
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,690
First topic

107
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,740
All right

108
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,940
Today we have enough

109
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,830
Done

110
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,090
Don't just walk by

111
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,980
Friends, let's take a look

112
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,830
The first physical therapy club

113
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,600
Teaches all skills

114
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
This is the course package

115
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,450
Take a look

116
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,870
Friends, take a look

117
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,420
Weiwei

118
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,380
We almost gave away

119
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,170
Let's go out

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,660
Guys

121
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,300
The first physical club Let's take it and see

122
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,470
It's free

123
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,130
Student

124
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,010
Give me one

125
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,230
Come on

126
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:00,880
Bro

127
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,220
You guys give out here, it doesn't work

128
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,760
You guys should go to the gym

129
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,290
There are many people

130
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:06,870
Weiwei

131
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,220
Buy milk tea for you guys

132
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,050
Thank you

133
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,220
Senior

134
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,260
Drinking a lot of milk tea is not good for your body

135
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,960
Because it contains a lot of sugar

136
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,150
Peng Pai

137
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,360
Haven't thanked you for the last time helping us with the club

138
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,140
What club

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,750
Are you Weiwei's senior, Peng Pai?

140
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,840
Hello

141
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,190
So let's go give out leaflet at the gym

142
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,670
Thank you bro

143
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,390
Bro

144
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,450
Thank you

145
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:32,940
Good luck

146
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,700
Free, no need to pay

147
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,200
Friends, let's take a look

148
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,440
Take the details of the club to read first

149
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,380
Free

150
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,550
No need to pay

151
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,620
Not reply to my message

152
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,740
Actually, here comes for give out leaflet

153
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,990
You are very busy

154
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,540
The class was really busy

155
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,410
Thinking of replying

156
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,120
You're probably not angry because of such a small thing, right?

157
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,910
How can I be like that?

158
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,710
I didn't think you'd even come and give out leaflet

159
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,730
Why are you so stupid?

160
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,910
Say like you have a better way

161
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,610
Easy to say, hard to do

162
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,480
do not have to be distributed

163
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,690
Like this would have been waiting until graduate

164
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,390
Wait and see me

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,980
Quickly

166
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,330
246

167
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,600
247

168
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,090
248

169
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,320
249

170
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,260
250

171
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,570
Mai student

172
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,170
Thank so much

173
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,940
If I can do it like you say

174
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,340
Then physical therapy club

175
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,500
Was not too far away

176
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:56,990
Little thing

177
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,730
I just don't want to delay my training

178
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,240
Weiwei

179
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,280
Are you going to practice with my Mai?

180
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,620
Can you swim?

181
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,300
Isn't Ding Yi busy these days?

182
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,590
I just helped him record the time

183
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,520
All right

184
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,350
We don't talk about this again

185
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,630
Thinking of club activities first, it's better to think about it

186
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,950
Right

187
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,380
Club activities

188
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,740
What can your physical therapy club do?

189
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,980
About this

190
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,110
I already thought

191
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:35,950
Did you think it?

192
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,550
Yes, I did

193
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,670
Okay

194
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,940
Weiwei

195
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,580
Peng Pai senior helped us to successfully open the club.

196
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,220
Wait

197
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,330
What is Peng Pai about opening the club?

198
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,630
He helped expose Fan Zheng Xiang

199
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,470
Allowing us to successfully open this club

200
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,520
He exposes

201
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,600
Well, it was he who exposed Fan Zheng Xiang

202
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,110
Clearly that...

203
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,550
Yeah

204
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,100
Today, our Mai Shijong helped us a lot as well

205
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,090
It's the number 2 hero, so clap your hands

206
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,010
You guys can make your own club

207
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,090
I'm leaving

208
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,710
Mai Sichong

209
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,050
I'll give you a free massage coupon later

210
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,520
Don't want

211
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:12,980
Yu Xin

212
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,010
Is there still strawberry cake left?

213
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,120
Sorry

214
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,140
The last piece he bought

215
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,200
Why is it you again?

216
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,540
Stole my strawberry cake to eat

217
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,260
Your strawberry cake

218
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,310
You call it

219
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,140
Will it answer you?

220
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,700
You...

221
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,510
Why is the mood so bad again?

222
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,900
Are you still fighting with my sister-in-law?

223
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,510
You don't want to talk crazy here

224
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,590
She's not your sister-in-law

225
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,060
How about you?

226
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,360
I advise you to stop bothering Chong bro

227
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,520
You're so ugly

228
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,400
No chance

229
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,890
You are the ugly 

230
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,200
Shaped like a frog

231
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,230
In addition, your face was a squirrel.

232
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,610
You...

233
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,880
What

234
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,440
I'll tell you

235
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,470
Princess like me, had not been interested in Ma Sichong for a long time

236
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,040
It's just that Weiwei doesn't like being gossiped

237
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,560
So, you'd better not be talking here like this

238
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,570
She will not be satisfied

239
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,810
This fork ... You haven't used it, right?

240
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,670
You used it all

241
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,540
Why do I use it?

242
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,740
Consider giving you a reward

243
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,310
What time does your club break up?

244
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,650
I left work and I will go and see

245
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,410
Okay

246
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,530
What are you doing?

247
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,770
How can you get a shock?

248
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,190
Then what?

249
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,630
How do you want to hold hands again?

250
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,260
Thinking of taking advantage of me, right?

251
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,460
Who's going to take advantage of you?

252
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,650
Aren't you asking me to help?

253
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,590
Why?

254
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,810
People let you do what, you just do

255
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,690
Others let you form a club, so you form

256
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,250
Others let you drink milk tea, you drink

257
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:08,990
Can you be yourself?

258
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,630
You asked me to come and help you. You're still acting strange here

259
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,300
Never mind

260
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,710
Bored

261
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,100
What are you angry?

262
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,990
What else can I be angry with?

263
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,480
Mei Weiwei, I'll tell you

264
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,580
About club opening, actually the truth is ...

265
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:29,980
What's wrong with you?

266
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,270
Nothing

267
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,310
It's just that day for a girl

268
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,800
Come up

269
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Come up, quickly

270
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,430
Why?

271
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,230
Let me down quickly

272
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,210
I'm not feeling well

273
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,800
Watch out

274
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,090
It seems to me ...

275
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,330
Not so uncomfortable

276
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,330
Weiwei

277
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,950
Dai Xi

278
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,310
What are you doing?

279
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:47,680
She...

280
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,870
Not feeling well

281
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,630
So I brought her here

282
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,590
Thank you

283
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,250
Weiwei

284
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,320
You sit first

285
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,570
I'll help you brew brown sugar

286
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Dai Xi

287
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,790
You are back here

288
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,150
Why did you change the bedding pattern?

289
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,500
Look at this one and it's cute

290
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,460
So change

291
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,710
Come on

292
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,230
Bring boiled brown sugar to drink quickly

293
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,830
Thank you

294
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,710
It's hot

295
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,180
Actually the feeling of being shock is unreliable

296
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,770
Shock to love you

297
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,130
It's reaaly...

298
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,900
Jun Jun, you're back?

299
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,280
She...

300
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,960
Will hear what I say?

301
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,640
No, I shouldn't have heard

302
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,670
Are you sure?

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,700
Of course

304
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,150
Trust me

305
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,680
No way

306
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,350
I didn't get shocked by her

307
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,700
Stop thinking and sleep

308
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,370
Weiwei

309
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,370
You didn't tell me

310
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,140
What is the theme of today's work

311
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
You still can't see it?

312
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,600
Dance for health

313
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,230
Dance for health

314
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,270
But we can't drink alcohol

315
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,110
sparkling water

316
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,060
How did you come?

317
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,000
I came to see if I can help

318
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,420
Isn't this syrup?

319
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,790
I will tell you

320
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,230
This is not very good for the body

321
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,430
There are both sugar and food coloring in it

322
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,270
I'm going to hang the lantern first

323
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,170
Mai Sichong

324
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,830
You try it

325
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,400
Adding a little goji berry is fine

326
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,070
Goji Berry

327
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Why don't i think?

328
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,300
Send to me

329
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,260
Thank you

330
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,070
Short and do not show off

331
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,870
Who is short?

332
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,980
You're short

333
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,590
Li Dai Xi

334
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,470
Why do you have to let me carry this?

335
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,620
You're forcing me

336
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,100
You wrong

337
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,140
Help princess move things

338
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,900
It is an honor for you

339
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:48,860
You...

340
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,910
Now you can see clearly

341
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,500
How's mood of princess like me now?

342
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
So

343
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,190
You don't have to try to do anything for me to like you

344
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,650
What am I doing to you?

345
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,100
Do you know Zhang Ziyi's daughter? What's the name?

346
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,160
What's the name?

347
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,950
Xingxing (it's mean wake up)

348
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,330
Wake up, you

349
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,030
You...

350
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,770
Not bad

351
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,660
No more

352
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,160
All friends

353
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,910
Next is...

354
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,550
To welcome you to a healthy party tonight

355
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,380
Activity highlights are

356
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,270
Health lectures

357
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,340
I want volunteers to come forward

358
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,550
If any friend voluntarily

359
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
Please come to the front

360
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:54,980
Who will voluntarily

361
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:55,910
He...

362
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,290
Ding Yi, please come

363
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,300
Good

364
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,480
Come on

365
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,880
You lie down here

366
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,170
What I want to tell everyone today is

367
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,580
Xen Yu point massage

368
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,950
It lies between the ribs

369
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,450
Find the location of this point

370
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,900
And then look at how his kidneys are

371
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,980
Just look at this point

372
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,710
At this time, Master Lin was pressing this student's Xen Yu point

373
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,480
This student shouted loudly

374
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,130
Apparently Kidneys are not very good

375
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Who's the bad kidney?

376
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,040
Li Tai Xi, you mean, right?

377
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,630
Relax

378
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,250
Anyone interested in this technique

379
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,310
Very useful too

380
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:38,920
How did you come?

381
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,340
Let them share with you

382
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,710
After a while, I'll go back to doing OT at the company

383
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,860
Thank you

384
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,100
Actually, you don't have to come

385
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,300
You're so busy

386
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,850
Everything about you must be important

387
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,780
If not because I have to work

388
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,990
Will be with you all night

389
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,230
oh really

390
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,880

I ask you

401
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,070
What happened to you and Peng Pai?

402
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
What matters?

403
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,860
Look at my face and answer me

404
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,490
What answer?

405
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,470
What do you want?

406
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,200
Chong bro

407
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,770
We don't see anything

408
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,120
Please continue

409
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,820

410
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,240
Insane

411
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,990
It seem that...

412
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,380
She must like Peng Pai for sure

413
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,150
All right, Ding Yi

414
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,810
Thank you everyone for joining us today

415
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,730
To keep our activities going

416
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:01,930
Let's get started

417
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,490
Great

418
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,060
Master Lin's skill is fine

419
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,770
Really?

420
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,380
Okay

421
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,170
Then you can continue with me

422
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,190
Li Dai Xi

423
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,250
Can I press the point for you?

424
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,780
Press your big head

425
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:23,670
Err...

426
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,580
Let me help you

427
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,090
You're in the physical field, right?

428
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,040
Hello, my name is Xia Rui

429
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:36,490
Thank you

430
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,010
The physical department has a dance party for health

431
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,710
I'll go too

432
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,740
hurry up

433
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,290
come quick

434
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,290
Will you come too?

435
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,890
Okay

436
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,550
I look at you, it's not that busy

437
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,820
There is still time to come back and pick up things at home

438
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,460
Didn't your mom teach these things when she was still alive?

439
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,620
Wang Mei Yun

440
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Don't mess with my mom

441
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,250
I've come back and have something to eat?

442
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,430
How about a dining table?

443
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,750
Thief up the house?

444
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,950
Or not because your daughter?

445
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,110
The mahogari table was just bought

446
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,030
This money just let it go

447
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,300
You wanted to destroy this house

448
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,320
Zhang Yu Xin

449
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,970
What are you going to do?

450
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,600
You threw my mother's dining table first

451
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,640
You want to protect her

452
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,580
Okay

453
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,130
So just throw me away

454
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,070
Weiwei

455
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,950
Leave with you,ok?

456
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,550
Weiwei, we'll go now

457
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,400
Okay, bye bye

458
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,250
Safe back

459
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,000
Bye bye Wei sis

460
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:05,790
You're go back

461
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,400
Mai student

462
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,230
Weiwei

463
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,470
Not hurry to get up yet

464
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,530
There is still someone inside

465
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,500
What's wrong with your knees?

466
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,710
Door?

467
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,450
The door has been locked

468
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:14,740
So what should we do?

469
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,250
I'll call Dai Xi

470
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,780
My phone has left with Dai Xi

471
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,090
And you?

472
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,350
Mine...

473
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,340
Left with Ding Yi

474
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,290
So what should we do?

475
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Wait for a while

476
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,340
Maybe someone will come

477
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,130
All right

478
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,780
Oh

479
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Li Dai Xi

480
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,190
Aren't you hungry?

481
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,460
Why do you eat that much?

482
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,160
I did it to take care of you

483
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,180
You're an athlete should pay attention to food

484
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,940
Can you not quote me?

485
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,810
I brought a lot of food for Chong bro

486
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,430
They are okay, right?

487
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
Your knees

488
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,290
okay?

489
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,890
Almost healed

490
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,830
No problem

491
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,850
You had been injured before

492
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,000
at your knees, right?

493
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,240
No

494
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,530
Just a bump just now

495
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,380
Don't lie to me

496
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,140
That you want me to shock you

497
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,290
Just hoping that the knee injury will heal quickly, right?

498
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,610
How do you know?

499
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,710
Just...

500
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,830
Just know

501
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,290
You haven't told me, how does your knee hurt?

502
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,470
Then I will tell you

503
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,740
Don't tell anyone else

504
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,910
Umm..

505
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
In the past

506
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,300
To save the life of a child

507
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,510
So there was an accident

508
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,130
At that time I fainted

509
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,510
Later someone told me that...

510
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,470
has someone helped me

511
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,010
At that time my knees moved

512
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,930
I didn't think that you would be brave

513
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,180
Do you have any secret?

514
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,040
Actually, it's not a secret

515
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,290
You know that

516
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,700
My body has a very special electric power

517
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,900
But I can't tell others

518
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,930
I've always felt that

519
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,580
This body only creates problems

520
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,280
Because it never brings me any luck

521
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,190
But there was one time, did you know?

522
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,850
I use my electricity to save someone

523
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,500
Since then I thought having electricity is good too

524
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,460
Before, you ...

525
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,830
You keep following me

526
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,110
Talk about my electricity

527
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,720
I was a little embarrassed

528
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,720
So I shouted at you loudly

529
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,300
Sorry

530
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,670
Thank you
