1
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,010
Your knees?

2
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,670
Is it okay?

3
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,730
It's ok

4
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,500
Hello Ding yi

5
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,790
My cell phone is on me

6
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,910
Why didn't you tell me?

7
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:06,770
Hello

8
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,270
Hello

9
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,120
The signal is not good at all

10
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,100
Mai Sichong, Wait for me!

11
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,530
Zhang President

12
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,270
This is Sun Yang's schedule of activities

13
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,340
Finished, please confirm

14
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,040
Okay

15
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,810
These two days must have been difficult for you

16
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,940
When this event done

17
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,050
You can take a break for two days

18
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,160
Thank you

19
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,610
Take this opportunity

20
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,620
Try asking the Mai Si Chong. Does he has time?

21
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,990
Just come and look around

22
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,880
and visit the company

23
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,600
Okay

24
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,340
I'll go back to the university in a moment

25
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,730
Go

26
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Hey Chong bro

27
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,820
Where did you go last night?

28
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,220
Noting

29
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:52,990
Did nothing

30
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,780
I knew

31
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,310
Brother Chong, you're really shy

32
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,760
Jumping not enough last night?

33
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,140
Swim for the whole laps

34
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,940
Pei Pei coach is not here

35
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,690
I could swim less

36
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,420
Missing just one laps

37
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,580
Coach

38
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,230
Coach, I'll swim right now

39
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,730
Brother Chong, you lied to me

40
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,340
Ready?

41
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,210
The qualifying team at the provincial level is about to begin

42
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,890
To encourage everyone

43
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,280
The university

44
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,590
prepared to host

45
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,590
In the friendly competition of the university

46
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,510
Even if it's just a friendly match

47
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,200
But as long as it's a game

48
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,370
I hope that...

49
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,740
You will show your potential

50
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,050
Strive to be the first

51
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,980
Understand?

52
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,950
Understand

53
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,060
Coach

54
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,690
As it is a friendly match

55
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,730
So can I do it for friendship?

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,700
Withdrawing from competition

57
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,510
I think

58
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
for friendship

59
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,820
You still have to compete

60
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,480
This will give everyone an advantage

61
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,380
All contestants

62
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,370
Must be involved

63
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,410
Go to practice now

64
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,870
Tomorrow the hospital will have an expert from America meeting

65
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,250
You have to go

66
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,660
Brother Chong bet with me?

67
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,110
Last position

68
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,510
I must be the first

69
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,740
Will I get first place? I don't know.

70
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,160
But anyway, Ding Yi got the first place

71
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,070
Keep level

72
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Bro Chong, don't be humble

73
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,870
I bet with you

74
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,800
Brother Rui, did you take it with him too?

75
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
I bet, I and Brother Rui for sure

76
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,250
Brother Chong, are you still kidding?

77
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,210
How could number one have two?

78
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,170
You keep the first from the end for yourself

79
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:36,710
Sichong

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,910
Peng Pai

81
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:43,510
Sichong

82
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,030
If tomorrow can't come

83
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,870
Then it can be next time

84
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,730
Weiwei

85
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,150
Mei Weiwei

86
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:56,900
Bro

87
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,170
Bought it for me?

88
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,120
Just...

89
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,690
I am afraid that you will tease me

90
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,310
Am I that kind of person?

91
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,530
Or not

92
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,030
Err...

93
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,630
Tomorrow, at company have a Sun Yang meeting

94
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,950
But Si Chong couldn't go

95
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,040
Do you want to go?

96
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,870
Sun Yang

97
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,510
Yes

98
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,730
I can go?

99
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,420
Of course

100
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,010
Why are you going?

101
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,760
Are you a fan of Sun Yang?

102
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,260
You think

103
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,100
Before Sun Yang leave I have never watched every match

104
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,260
I will tell you

105
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,150
The meeting was a lot of people

106
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,300
You should be careful

107
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,370
Trust me

108
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,730
I will protect Weiwei well

109
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,080
Then see you tomorrow afternoon

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,090
When you come, call me

111
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:31,840
I will come down to pick you up

112
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:32,940
Okay

113
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,400
I still have to study, so excuse me

114
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,510
See you tomorrow afternoon

115
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:36,840
Okay

116
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,320
Bye bye

117
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,010
Bye bye

118
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,070
Weiwei

119
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:48,740
Junjun

120
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:49,590
No need to sleep

121
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,620
Next Wednesday, has a massage exam

122
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,960
We need to find a massage exam partner

123
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,060
Massage partner?

124
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,340
Lin Bai Hui

125
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,730
Can Tai Chi be used to protect yourself

126
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,870
Next Wednesday, come study with me

127
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,340
During this university there are psychopaths

128
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,370
Psychopath

129
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,430
You don't know yet?

130
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,730
Psychopaths stalking people at night

131
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,660
Secretly filming in the bathroom

132
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,150
They come in disguise

133
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,330
Put on a hat, put on a mask

134
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,550
CCTV cameras cannot see the face

135
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
This is too bad

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,480
Weiwei

137
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,020
Junjun

138
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,740
Recently, we have many activities.

139
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,180
You guys go back late

140
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,090
For safety

141
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,150
Otherwise

142
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
You guys bought a spray for protection

143
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,740
No

144
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,300
No

145
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:25,710
Like this

146
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,170
Sorry Weiwei

147
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,710
Wednesday I have a live broadcast

148
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,580
I have to go

149
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,980
Wing Chun is the original fierce martial arts of China

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,740
It is an attack block technique

151
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,420
Forget about it

152
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,560
Could you be a partner for a massage exam next Wednesday?

153
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,750
No problem

154
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,350
Welcome

155
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,130
Yu Xin

156
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,310
Are you busy?

157
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,700
Large cup 35, small cup 30, what kind do you want?

158
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,010
I don't drink coffee

159
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,950
In coffee there is a lot of caffeine

160
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,190
Drinking a lot is not good for the body

161
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,590
It also causes insomnia

162
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,380
What kind of coffee tastes good?

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,020
Yu Xin

164
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,410
I come today

165
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,570
Because I wanted to invite you

166
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,250
Join our physical therapy club

167
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,030
This is the first club in our field of physical therapy

168
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,980
Without you it's like a lack of spirit

169
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,440
And also, I really like you

170
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,990
You like me?

171
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,770
Cold outside but hot inside like you

172
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,130
If you were there

173
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,470
Everything must go well

174
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,940
Wait

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,610
If you want to use ...

176
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,780
a club

177
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,200
Come follow me, I will say

178
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,990
Not necessarily

179
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:53,970
No no no ,I'm not...

180
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,490
You're not, that's good

181
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,550
Today, in class...

182
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,330
You left this

183
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,270
this one

184
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,890
How much?

185
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,630
Do not pay

186
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,460
I buy you

187
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:36,890
Thank you

188
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,500
Err...

189
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,230
Our shop is closing. So you ...

190
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:41,950
You hurry back

191
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,740
So

192
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,580
About club activities

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,160
You can consider it again

194
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,650
Thank you

195
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,480
Weiwei

196
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,500
Sorry, I couldn't take the exam with you

197
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,550
You...

198
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,490
Can you find someone?

199
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,910
I've found

200
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,290
That's good

201
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,650
So...

202
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,730
You have to be very careful

203
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,770
Your power, don't let others know

204
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,520
To compensate you

205
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,100
Tomorrow I will take you to eat something delicious

206
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,720
Tomorrow I have an appointment

207
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,050
Have an appointment

208
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,020
What's the matter?

209
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,450
I will meet Sun Yang

210
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,660
Sun Yang

211
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,130
Where did you meet him?

212
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,640
FT Company

213
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,000
Is that a company that Senior Peng Pai trainees?

214
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,060
He brought you to meet?

215
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,700
The two of you are back together

216
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,630
No

217
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,630
Weiwei

218
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,910
When she was bullied

219
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,900
He walked away

220
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,840
This thing

221
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,370
Can you let it go?

222
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,610
I'm just going to meet Sun Yang

223
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,710
Not going to see Peng Pai

224
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,650
Mei Weiwei, Mei Weiwei

225
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,530
You're...

226
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,910
Why is your little brain so bad?

227
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,150
All right

228
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,790
I don't talk to you

229
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,110
Look

230
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,790
Sun Yang

231
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,650
Actually, my first gold medal was from Sun Yang

232
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,980
Even though he's leaving the industry now

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,050
But he is still my idol

234
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,470
So why don't you go with me today?

235
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,740
What are you going to do?

236
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
I...

237
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,710
Go...

238
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,950
I go to practice

239
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:06,520
Yeah

240
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,480
Go practice

241
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,550
Don't lie to me

242
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,910
Have you ever obeyed that?

243
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,270
Anyway, I have something to do

244
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:14,690
Don't ask me anymore

245
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,840
Okay, don't ask

246
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,400
Keep it well

247
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,830
May be in the future

248
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,260
You might only see me on the poster

249
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,010
You keep it well

250
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,200
So will you run?

251
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,340
run

252
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:05,920
Are you back?

253
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,990
Let's go eat.

254
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,670
Okay

255
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,410
Why are you and Li Dai Xi being together so often lately?

256
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,170
Just go to eat two times together

257
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,830
How about Wei ?

258
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,220
She's gone

259
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,840
So are you going?

260
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,070
Okay, let's go

261
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,430
Why hasn't Sun Yang come yet?

262
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,560
How do I look?

263
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,440
You're a lavender? (Fan's group name) , stand here

264
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,770
Sun Yang was close to come

265
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,380
This is not so bad

266
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,870
Sun Yang has arrived

267
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,810
Sun Yang

268
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
Who is she?

269
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,620
Why can she enter the FT company?

270
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,650
Go

271
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,770
This is our office space

272
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,200
Qiaoqiao sister

273
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,600
You come already

274
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,200
You...

275
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,600
At FT, do you have to dress formally every day?

276
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,450
Actually, it doesn't have to be

277
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,470
But every Friday is the company's Free Day

278
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,090
Today is free Day

279
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,950
Sports agent

280
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,310
It will be more informal compared to other artists

281
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,410
Oh

282
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,480
Let's go

283
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,190
Will take you to the meeting room

284
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:09,740
Okay

285
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,880
Then, we're going

286
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,540
Go

287
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,750
Why are the two of you so sad?

288
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,740
Weiwei has gone to meet Sun Yang

289
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,550
Why do you know And why I don't know

290
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,440
Mai Sichong

291
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,040
Why don't you take care of Weiwei?

292
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,790
Or will you really let she go with Peng Pai?

293
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,430
I...

294
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,410
Do you feel that She is like an old grandmother who is strict about the children's friendship

295
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:38,770
Keep eating

296
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,320
What reason do I have to stop she from going?

297
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,290
Sun Yang is her idol

298
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,020
Why does Weiwei want to meet other men?

299
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,050
You also like Sun Yang, isn't it? Why don't you go too?

300
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,910
Keep eating

301
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,380
You guys don't know

302
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,420
When Weiwei was in high school, gossiped until she had to quit

303
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,330
Moved to another school

304
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,110
At that time, the person she trusted most was her senior named Peng Yan

305
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,400
But when Weiwei was bullied

306
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
He just disappeared

307
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,200
Wait

308
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,540
Peng Yan

309
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
Now is Peng Pai

310
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,090
I think

311
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,140
He must be afraid of confronting the past, so he changed his name

312
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,340
Actually, using Sun Yang as an excuse

313
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,330
Brother Chong, where are you going?

314
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,110
You sit here

315
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,060
Peng Pai told me all

316
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,450
Thank you for supporting me

317
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,050
Before, I had been in Nanti

318
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,380
You can call me senior

319
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,190
Senior

320
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,530
Oh yes

321
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,940
Today I brought with you a present

322
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,490
Senior

323
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,860
I have been preparing for a very long time

324
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,480
Inside here I gather...

325
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
The achievements of you over the past 5 years

326
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
I also posted a photo

327
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Please be careful

328
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,110
Hope you like it

329
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
I left the industry

330
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,350
The competition has nothing to do with me

331
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,860
However, I have to thank you very much

332
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,490
Brother Yang

333
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,090
Weiwei has always admired you

334
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,050
Can you bother taking pictures with her?

335
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,120
Can I?

336
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:08,850
Sure

337
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,730
Come on

338
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,190
Why are you with Sun Yang?

339
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,710
Was that guy an FT employee?

340
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,350
This woman is so ugly

341
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,950
Secretly approached our man

342
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,510
Thank you

343
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,310
Err...

344
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:40,970
This one...

345
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,950
Can you sign for me?

346
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,700
Thank you

347
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:50,910
Err...

348
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,940
I will give this signature to my friend

349
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,190
He is also a swimmer

350
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,280
He admires you very much

351
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,130
Would you please write to encourage him?

352
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,310
What's his name?

353
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,130
Mai Sichong

354
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,030
Si from Si Yi

355
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,830
Chong from Ling Hu Chong

356
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,190
Mai Sichong

357
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,140
This name is familiar

358
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,270
What about your own signature?

359
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,870
I have enough photos. Thank you

360
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,030
All right

361
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,210
You can give it to me

362
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,590
Thank you brother Sun Yang

363
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,940
I have got something to do

364
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,170
So, excuse me

365
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,370
Good bye

366
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:25,760
Thank you

367
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,470
It's okay, you don't have to send me

368
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,920
Be careful when you go back

369
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,460
Thank you

370
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,870
I will go send him

371
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,570
Wait for me for a while

372
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,590
What is lavender?

373
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,900
Actually sneaked into the back door

374
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,890
Relying on a boyfriend who is an FT employee

375
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,270
In order to meet Sun Yang, right?

376
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,890
Who are you? Do this again, I will call the security guard

377
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,330
You are really shameless

378
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,700
Don't you know that Sun Yang is our person?

379
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,340
My hand

380
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,780
Why should you hurt people?

381
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,950
You have no reason

382
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,070
How do you hurt?

383
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,210
No, I'm not

384
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,420
It's all red, you still say no

385
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,200
Help me

386
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,800
Still will say you didn't do

387
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
You guys look

388
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,310
It's all red

389
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,540
Weiwei

390
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,890
Sister Qioaqioa

391
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,650
Who are you?

392
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm staff here

393
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,270
You guys, calm down first

394
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,560
Just an apprentice

395
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,750
Go get someone who can handle this

396
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,430
Should you guys calm down first?

397
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,700
Has anything? you can tell me

398
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,360
Sir, you can't go in

399
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,000
Sir

400
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,470
I think your employees are really unreliable

401
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,740
Not allowing fans to enter

402
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,990
Let only the girlfriend enter

403
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,180
Shameless

404
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,970
No, I'm not

405
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,290
This is misunderstood

406
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,070
I didn't hurt anyone

407
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,990
You take advantage of connection

408
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,570
And also pretending to be pitiful

409
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,300
I said I didn't hurt anyone

410
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,430
You didn't hurt anyone?

411
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,830
Then I will teach you

412
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,830
Don't you know what the consequences will be for the chaos in the company?

413
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,430
Don't want me to notify the police

414
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,300
Just calm down!

415
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,220
Who are you?

416
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:15,610
Let's go

417
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,730
She hurt us first

418
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,440
Right

419
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,680
You come back and explain this first

420
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:31,700
Weiwei

421
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,690
Are you ok?

422
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,790
I'm okay

423
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,610
Why didn't you answer my phone?

424
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,090
I might have turned off the sound at all

425
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
In the future, if there is something like this

426
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,550
Have to tell me

427
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,580
We have to rebuke

428
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,650
Damn not enough

429
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,050
Must defeat them

430
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,710
Never mind

431
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,470
Little one like you

432
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
I will protect you

433
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,300
All right

434
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,330
I'm really okay

435
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,520
Peng Pai

436
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,080
Weiwei Bag, why is it here with you?

437
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,650
Just a moment ago, two fans had invaded

438
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,380
Said that saw you take her to meet Sun Yang

439
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,870
That you came to create problems at the company

440
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,870
So where is she going now?

441
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
Went with that man already

442
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,880
You hurriedly followed her

443
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,280
Weiwei

444
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:21,930
Your bag

445
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,030
You still dare to come again

446
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,500
You take Weiwei came to the company

447
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,990
Why you leave her alone?

448
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,270
Weiwei

449
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,210
Sorry

450
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,890
I have something to talk with you

451
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,140
You dare to say it again?

452
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,830
Just now

453
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,380
When I send Sun Yang, meet Zhang President

454
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,980
I really don't know. That the company ...

455
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,550
Don't know?

456
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,170
Saying that you don't know is like warding off responsibility

457
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,300
Because of that, she had to transfer school. Do you know?

458
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,240
Peng Pai

459
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,950
You're just a two-faced person

460
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,450
Mei Weiwei was in a lot of pain because of you

461
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,040
I warn you

462
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,280
Stay away from her

463
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:19,730
Go

464
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,690
That day, my father had an accident

465
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
You can take it

466
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,040
What are you doing?

467
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,320
Mom

468
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,560
Your homeroom teacher called me to meet

469
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,050
Because of this girl, right?

470
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,810
This is not about her mother

471
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,860
You look

472
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,350
Where does she look like a student?

473
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,490
This is not really about her, mom

474
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,170
Go, back home

475
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:53,600
This is not about her

476
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,310
Mom

477
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,920
Why are you like this?

478
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,080
Peng Yan

479
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,270
Your father can't stand it. You quickly come back

480
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,580
When I arrived at the hospital

481
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,700
Doctor said...

482
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,430
My father couldn't handle the wounds

483
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Then my father passed away

484
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,310
My mother sold the house

485
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,420
She can't live alone

486
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,510
So I stopped going to study abroad

487
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
After I graduated

488
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,180
I didn't want to contact my relatives again

489
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,230
So, I change my name

490
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,700
Later...

491
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,380
When you change QQ

492
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,960
Phone is broken

493
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,830
I tried to contact you

494
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,140
I send messages to you every day

495
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:04,990
But you did not reply

496
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,290
Now

497
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,430
I want to find it, I can't find it

498
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,570
Today is the same

499
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,310
Not on the side to protect you

500
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:26,880
Sorry

501
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,190
Sichong

502
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,240
Thank you

503
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,480
Today if it's not you, come catch up

504
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,270
Nothing already

505
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,200
So, I'm leaving

506
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,420
Let's talk

507
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,410
He...

508
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,200
He's been looking for you for so long?

509
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,270
4 years have passed

510
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,090
He had always wanted to explain this to you

511
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,460
What this means?

512
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,060
That means I'm very stupid

513
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,910
I didn't know before so I deleted the QQ message

514
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,710
Meaning he still cares for a fool like you

515
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,220
How happy are you stupid?

516
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,520
I will sleep

517
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,180
Your little stupid brain

518
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,740
There is no way to deal with such a difficult problem

519
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,820
Good night

520
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,080
Good night

521
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,880
Even though you've waited for her many years

522
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,670
But people are not in the same place

523
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,720
I've been waiting for her for 4 years

524
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,910
You just know her, not too long

525
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,190
Are you close with her?

526
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,450
Do you know what kind of person she like?

527
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,540
What do you want to say?

528
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,550
At that time I knew

529
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:01,870
That she has feelings for me

530
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,160
She and Peng Pai were in a relationship?

531
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,130
Now still not

532
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,030
But in the future, it's unlikely

533
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,510
Tomorrow I will compete. Will you come to see?

534
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:11,870
Tomorrow is my birthday

535
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,670
You probably won't leave me alone

536
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,530
Wait until I won

537
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,990
You will be the first physical therapist of the Olympic champion

538
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,540
He left the track slowly, right?

539
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,880
So what will you do if you lose?

540
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
I'm not losing

541
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,060
I won't

542
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:26,710
Mai Sichong

543
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,740
Thank you so much

544
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,550
I will always be by your side

545
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,060
Weiwei

546
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,510
I like you
