1
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,730
Peng Pai senior

2
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,760
Weiwei

3
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,980
Why are you at the university today?

4
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm coming to the topic of thesis work

5
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,130
Afternoon back to the company

6
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,700
Err...

7
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,320
Bro...

8
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,550
I have something I want you to help me

9
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,400
Just say it

10
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,270
Is it possible? ...

11
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,490
That you will help manage Sun Yang and Mai Sichong meet together

12
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,970
I think...

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,630
If Sun Yang talk direct with him

14
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,130
He will definitely be able to help Mai Sichong

15
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,370
This's...

16
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,860
I'm afraid it will be difficult

17
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,510
Actually, I just tried asking. For good luck

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,290
You don't take it to pay attention

19
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,210
So, excuse mw. I've to go to study

20
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,030
Ding Yi

21
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:52,670
Sis Wei

22
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,760
Mai Shi Chong hasn't come to learn yet?

23
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,580
Chong asked to take a break from home

24
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,370
Been home several days ago

25
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,420
He said he did not dare to come to the university

26
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,920
The phone turned off

27
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,600
His knees

28
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,370
Still not getting better, right?

29
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,810
I think

30
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,320
If you want everything to be as it was before

31
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,350
It's no way

32
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,040
But if physical recovery goes well

33
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,460
I think

34
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,780
Should be able to join the provincial team, no problem for sure

35
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,440
Ding Yi

36
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,630
Do you want to help him?

37
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,240
Follow me

38
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,340
Why are you moving so fast?

39
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,510
Boss

40
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,740
Did you not say?

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,960
Just I join the relay race

42
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,170
You promised to help massage for Mai Si Chong

43
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,270
Yeah

44
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,110
But...

45
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,280
We moved suddenly like this. And did not tell the Professor

46
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,530
It's not good

47
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,350
What's not good?

48
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,370
Anyway, you don't like the seniors in the dorm

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,890
Now, you moved to the Mai Sichong's dormitory

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,210
There are more swimmers waiting for you to heal

51
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,780
It's so good

52
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,920
Made new friends

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,970
Show off one's skill

54
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,110
Shoot one hand with two birds, right?

55
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,750
And you, Ding Yi

56
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,700
Selection of the coming province You have to cooperate fully with Master Bai Hui

57
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,710
Care to impress

58
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,140
Roger that!

59
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Guaranteed work success

60
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,630
Hui

61
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,060
Then I will ...

62
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,720
Take good care of you

63
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,070
We can...

64
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
Name change

65
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,100
So what do I call you?

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,920
Bai Bai

67
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,610
Hui Hui

68
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,290
It's up to you

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
You just lift up quickly

70
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:27,910
I'm going to register

71
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,930
Then I called on my own

72
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,530
Up to you

73
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,380
All right

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,370
So, let's carry things up first

75
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,940
I'm leaving

76
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,940
You hurry back

77
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,000
Now your son keeps himself in the room

78
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,910
Who called it did not open

79
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,310
Darling, don't be impatient

80
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,760
This isn't your idea?

81
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,330
You know I will talk to him

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,350
You will also explain to me

83
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,230
It's all my fault

84
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,170
The child is already growing up

85
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,540
You just let him calm down a bit

86
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,300
Who's coming again?

87
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,370
I'll hang up

88
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,370
Auntie, hello

89
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:01,930
Weiwei

90
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,950
Come in

91
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,210
Do not call Auntie in the future

92
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,520
Call me Mai's mom

93
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,870
Is Mai Sichong at home?

94
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,040
You came just right time

95
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,150
This child kept himself in a room

96
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,090
What ever I call, he would not come out

97
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,660
Can you help me talk to him?

98
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,210
Quick

99
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,120
Auntie

100
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,590
I cam suddenly

101
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,330
Don't bother, right?

102
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,270
How can disturb this? I'm so glad you came

103
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,540
You hurry to help me talk to him

104
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,350
Locked himself in a room for two days and refused to come out

105
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,780
What I said, it did not work

106
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,950
Also let me go to the university, bring him something

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,450
Said to be at home for a while

108
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,140
I Anxious to die already

109
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,400
Go in quickly

110
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:40,930
Then I will try talking to him

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
Book "A Brief History of Humanity"

112
00:05:59,450 --> 00:05:59,860
Weiwei

113
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,950
You talk to him

114
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,180
I will go get some fruit for you

115
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:02,980
Okay

116
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,500
Thank you

117
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,730
You read understand?

118
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,620
It's not difficult

119
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,660
How can I not understand?

120
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,450
Why are you free to come?

121
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,400
I asked Lin Bai Hui to move to your dormitory

122
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,070
He is very good at rehabilitation

123
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,130
He will definitely help you

124
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,190
No, don't want

125
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,690
Why?

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,550
Block yourself?

127
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,490
What?

128
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,600
The one who is embarrassed is not you

129
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,360
What's embarrassing about this matter?

130
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,670
Anyway, this isn't the first time you've been embarrassed

131
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,480
Not everyone has any interest in you

132
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,450
Trust me

133
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,610
What kind of person are you? Saw people falling and stepping over again

134
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,930
I'm not go

135
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,650
Get up and go back to college with me

136
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,030
No

137
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,320
You will not get up?

138
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,290
Won't get up, I'm going to drag you

139
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,400
No, I'm not go

140
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,250
You get up,now!

141
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,890
I told you, not go

142
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,760
Mei Weiwei

143
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,040
Why you...

144
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,220
Still hugging me

145
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,400
You're not embarrassed?

146
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,820
You obviously pulled me down

147
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,220
What's the reason?

148
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,410
I...

149
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,020
Come on

150
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:24,870
F...F...Fruit

151
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,080
Sorry

152
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,730
You guys can continue

153
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,930
Xiao Mai

154
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,440
You go downstairs, help me throw away the trash

155
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,560
I can't lift

156
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,640
This child...

157
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,220
You're so fast that I can't keep up

158
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,350
Mom, don't think about it by yourself

159
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,490
What is it that I thought?

160
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,690
Why are you two playing sumo?

161
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,550
Auntie, I'am leaving

162
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,510
Weiwei

163
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,190
Please stay

164
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,690
I still have something fun for you to watch

165
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:10,970
Fun?

166
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,470
You look at him as a kid, was he fat?

167
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,960
Belly like a baby watermelon

168
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,540
You look, this is like a big head doll

169
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:19,860
This picture

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,540
I remember it was 5 years old. You look. he still eat his hand

171
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,920
Keep watching

172
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,830
I am most impressed with this picture

173
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,320
It was probably the first time he won a gold medal

174
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,790
He was red-eyed as well. You look

175
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,070
He had to put swimming goggles to cover his face

176
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,040
Mom

177
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,180
Mom, can you respect my privacy?

178
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,090
What? It's so cute

179
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,400
This picture is not shown to Weiwei, so anyone can see it?

180
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:46,820
Here is 3 of our family

181
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,710
All right

182
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,350
Isn't there a yoga class in the afternoon?

183
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,380
Hurry to go to class quickly

184
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,490
I'll talk

185
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,230
Okay

186
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,240
So you guys talked

187
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,350
What's so laughable?

188
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,270
Is this the medal you got when you were a kid?

189
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,520
Just a gold medal

190
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,460
Do you still have a silver medal?

191
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,950
Of course not

192
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,160
I remember not knowing who had it. When swimming competition at the university

193
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,820
Why do you like to swim?

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,150
It was a long time ago

195
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,040
The real reason

196
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,030
I couldn't imagine either

197
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,180
But as a kid I was on the swimming team

198
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,710
Yang Master caught the eye of me

199
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,150
Yang Master

200
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,610
At high school, Yang Master

201
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,180
is my coach

202
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,550
He is also a professional athlete

203
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,290
When he saw me swimming, he felt that...

204
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,060
In the future, I will definitely get a gold medal

205
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,260
So later he decided to pull me over

206
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,580
But...

207
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,030
My situation now...

208
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,350
Mai Sichong

209
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,830
Let's go find Yang Master

210
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,320
Yang Coach

211
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:21,710
Sichong

212
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,290
You...!

213
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
At last you appeared

214
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,980
Haven't seen each other for a long time and still do like this

215
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,090
You still know that called for a long time

216
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,450
I didn't see you coming to visit me

217
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,160
And this hasn't come yet?

218
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:33,830
This person is...

219
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,480
your girlfriend?

220
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:36,930
No

221
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,930
College friends

222
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,760
Do you want...

223
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,180
to go to see inside?

224
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,460
It has been for many years, so what's worth seeing?

225
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,550
Let's go eat

226
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:44,910
Go

227
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,110
Yang Coach

228
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,170
I haven't eaten with you for a long time

229
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,170
Oh yeah

230
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,940
On the way, you said that...

231
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,220
Didn't audition for the provincial team, because of the pain in the knee

232
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,540
How did this happen?

233
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,460
Before

234
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,810
There was a little accident

235
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,040
Knee meniscus injury

236
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,830
The doctor recommended that I have surgery

237
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,300
Therefore was unable to audition for the provincial team

238
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,180
You're...

239
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,190
As a swimmer

240
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,870
Why do you let your knees fall like this?

241
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,060
Coach

242
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,360
I know, I was wrong

243
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,640
In the future, I'll be careful more

244
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,460
You know well

245
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,350
And now

246
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,040
Can you still swim?

247
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,630
I can swim

248
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,050
But just...

249
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,440
Why?

250
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,440
You probably haven't thought of giving up, right?

251
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,520
Oh yeah

252
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,320
I have a gift for you

253
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,370
You look

254
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:47,870
gift?

255
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,120
You look

256
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,330
Yang coach

257
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,640
Why are you carrying this?

258
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,980
Why can't I carry?

259
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,520
What's not good?

260
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,750
I'll told you

261
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,870
I also liked your commitment as a kid

262
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,360
Determination that will not give up

263
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,330
Xiao Chong

264
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,080
You listen to me

265
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,860
You are a very talented person

266
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,930
Also trying hard

267
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,160
It's been 10 years now

268
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,370
I have found a good seedling like you

269
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,950
I believe that you will definitely be able to step on the podium

270
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,690
And

271
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,980
Not just in the country

272
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,670
But also abroad

273
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,440
You will definitely go a long way

274
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,640
Got it?

275
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,570
Got it

276
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,210
Thank you

277
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,930
Be careful

278
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,120
It's ok

279
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,410
I'm not drunk

280
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,170
watch out

281
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,150
All right

282
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:00,760
Xiao Chong

283
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,110
Remember

284
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,460
You must...

285
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,980
Take good care of your girlfriend

286
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,200
I...

287
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,770
Your thoughts

288
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,510
You can't lie to me

289
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,960
Be careful

290
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,680
Safe back

291
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,390
Bye bye

292
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,610
Just a moment ago you drank quite a bit

293
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,270
I'm going to buy you yogurt

294
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:27,990
Cure the hang

295
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,840
Today I lost to the fat boy in the team

296
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,000
And also frantic in the team as well

297
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,390
I know I was wrong

298
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,800
But this does not mean that I have given up

299
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,080
I, the Demon of the Pool, Mai Si Chong, swear by

300
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,290
I won't cry anyway

301
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,090
I don't care what rank I stand in

302
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,620
I won't say I give up again

303
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,850
If I say give up again, I'm a dog

304
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,160
Yang coach

305
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,980
Don't be angry me

306
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,370
I guarantee

307
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,500
That I have to do it for sure

308
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,340
Mai Sichong

309
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,600
Thank you

310
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,270
So...

311
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,460
I sent you back to the university first

312
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:28,980
Let's go

313
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,100
Yang Master looked at you really optimistic

314
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,090
Sure

315
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,600
Coach that I have ever met ,who doesn't see me as good?

316
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,280
And you?

317
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,770
Do you see me a good person?

318
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,950
I...

319
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,380
Is that difficult to answer?

320
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,450
At least

321
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,740
I'm probably the best swimmer you know, right?

322
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,020
Mai Sichong

323
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,670
That you are like this Isn't it because of confidence?

324
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,900
By the way, Mai Sichong that I know

325
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,580
When being with the swimming that he like

326
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,880
Will be enthusiastic and confident

327
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,890
If you give up now

328
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,660
So before, I had looked at you wrong

329
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,170
I sent you just like this

330
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,020
Go back on your own

331
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:08,950
Excuse me

332
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,540
Wait

333
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,580
You don't go to university with me

334
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,700
Probably not afraid or embarrassed by people

335
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,910
I...

336
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,910
What's I have to be afraid of?

337
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,550
Is it not because I am afraid of someone

338
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,790
to walk with me

339
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,680
will be gossiped by those around her

340
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,340
and male her unhappy?

341
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,200
Take it like this

342
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,050
I sent you back to the dormitory

343
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,760
But let me choose a path

344
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,970
Dare or not?

345
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,590
You choose, then choose

346
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,480
Who doesn't dare?

347
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,660
Why did you have to come on this secret route?

348
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,430
Close to your dorm

349
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,100
and

350
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,360
Weren't you in danger last time?

351
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,670
So I have to come and send you back

352
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,690
I think, you were just scared

353
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,500
to go to a crowded place, right?

354
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,120
How is that possible?

355
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,060
I am Mai Si Chong

356
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,750
What is there to fear?

357
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,330
Just kidding

358
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,670
Then you can take off your hood

359
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,200
No way

360
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,220
Like this, I feel cool

361
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,420
Ding Yi

362
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:06,490
We're here

363
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,060
Has he gone?

364
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Has he gone? Ding Yi.

365
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,500
You're afraid you'll meet Ding Yi

366
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,730
And also say that you are not afraid to be embarrassed

367
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,660
Who said I was afraid to meet people?

368
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,660
Is there anything I have to fear?

369
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,770
So why do you have to take a shortcut?

370
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,770
I...

371
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,330
Is it not because I can be with someone a little longer?

372
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
I am back

373
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,090
You back?

374
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,070
What is the matter to be so happy?

375
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,490
I successfully persuaded Mai Sichong to return to the university

376
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,630
What's so glad?

377
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,330
It's great

378
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,780
Oh yeah, Jun Jun

379
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,240
You and Madam Sichong were friends as a child, right?

380
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,850
He...

381
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,300
Was he like this in the past?

382
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,740
Everyone said a few words and just ran away

383
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,480
Actually it is because of him...

384
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,850
Too proud of hisself

385
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,620
The first time when he won a gold medal

386
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,260
He was red-eyed

387
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,770
So he refused to go up for photo group when receiving the award

388
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,530
I am most impressed with this picture

389
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,050
This was probably the first time he won a gold medal

390
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,010
He was red-eyed as well. You see

391
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,780
He had to cover his face with swimming goggles

392
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,300
Because the eyes are so red

393
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,370
Are you sure that...

394
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,920
that this is called self-esteem?

395
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,970
Not a narcissist

396
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,640
You guys...

397
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,810
Why do you have to pay attention to the Mai of Sichong?

398
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,290
Probably because he grew up handsome

399
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,680
But looks like our college boys when growing up is so handsome

400
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,750
Except Ding Yi

401
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,920
Also has

402
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,070
Your guys boss

403
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,770
Lin Bai Hui

404
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,030
Journalism student

405
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
You talk about Ding Yi, just say it. Why came about with our boss?

406
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,820
Yu Xin

407
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,750
You look strange

408
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,960
What is strange?

409
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,100
What strange will I have? There is nothing strange.

410
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,530
Tomorrow, class time is changed to 7:30 a.m.

411
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,260
We have already signed the 4x100 mixed relay

412
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,390
But still missing another woman, what should I do?

413
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,390
Yu Xin

414
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,870
There are still others missing

415
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,360
Please help

416
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,720
I...

417
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,050
Actually I...

418
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,660
Not signed

419
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,260
I can't really run

420
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,530
Yu Xin

421
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,200
Let's join the team together

422
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:44,930
Okay

423
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,880
What do I need to do?

424
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,840
I have to really want to try it

425
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,170
I will sleep

426
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:53,990
You guys sleep

427
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,040
I go take a shower first

428
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,490
You go

429
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,230
You keep staring at me for 20 minutes, what are you going to do?

430
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,140
You changed

431
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,350
I know

432
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,240
I become more handsome

433
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,620
You have changed

434
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,340
I am like the best sibling

435
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,190
But now what do you have, you only talk with Mei Wei?

436
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,640
Do you feel the conscience in your heart?

437
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,700
Is it painful?

438
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,210
You do it yourself

439
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,170
How are you and Wei Wei the same?

440
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,740
Shallow excuses

441
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,930
All right

442
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,690
Buy a game for you

443
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,670
Don't think you can take a game to destroy my soul

444
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,480
Next month, add allowances for another half month

445
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,740
Am I the type of person who bends to eat?

446
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,570
So...

447
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,570
The game and the allowances are no longer available

448
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,220
Okay

449
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,580
I forgive you, okay?

450
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,100
I can't remember 

451
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,000
Forgive you

452
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,560
Are you finished talking?

453
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,150
Weiwei let me do you rehab

454
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,190
So...

455
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,890
Let's start now

456
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:47,950
Fight

457
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,750
How is it?

458
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,380
Get better

459
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,140
That's good

460
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,910
Look at your heart rate

461
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
115

462
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,890
Take this to collect electricity

463
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,040
No problem

464
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,290
Take a break

465
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,390
Why haven't mom come yet?

466
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,780
Don't talk about her to me

467
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,170
You said the weather like this

468
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,370
So that she could save electricity

469
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,120
Won't let me use the electric mattress

470
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,540
Really angry

471
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,990
Every day she has to bring cold feet

472
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,570
Put on my belly

473
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,820
You think she's not annoyed?

474
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:18,770
Dad

475
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,280
Your stomach is not small

476
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
This is not because of you?

477
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,690
Came out early for a run with you

478
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,890
Will eat or sleep, they are all confused

479
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,100
Then can the belly be small?

480
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,640
Weiwei, you think...

481
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,810
In future

482
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,190
With a body like this, if you want to find a soulmate? What should you do?

483
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,420
Dad, I was just in Grade 10

484
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,920
Right, that's too fast

485
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,680
Besides studying

486
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,550
All day you just ran

487
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,300
Why do you like running?

488
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,300
I and your mom still think

489
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,890
We gave birth to a running machine or something

490
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,470
Running makes me comfortable

491
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,140
The Flash can still save the world

492
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,850
Pikachu can still help Xiao Zhi

493
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,280
As for me, running makes me happy

494
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,490
Make myself happy, it's wonderful

495
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,380
Wonderful

496
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,310
I wish only my daughter to be happy

497
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,290
Dad was happy

498
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:07,520
Go home

499
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,530
Let's go home

500
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,710
How did you come?

501
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,990
How long have you been running?

502
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:53,930
To get tired like this

503
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,630
What does it have to do with you?

504
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,440
I promise to practice with you, isn't it?

505
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,420
I said it and I have to do it

506
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,350
I finished practicing

507
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,030
And are you still practicing?

508
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,950
If you don't practice, just go

509
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,930
I don't practice anymore

510
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:08,980
Tired to die

511
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,200
come on

512
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,790
Be comfortable

513
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,030
I give a special price

514
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,530
80 each time

515
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:23,880
You...

516
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,030
Friends should be free

517
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,870
So add more 20

518
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,160
Hurts

519
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,370
You be careful

520
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,860
Good morning, Yu Xin

521
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,420
Good morning

522
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,320
Have you eaten yet?

523
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,730
Not yet

524
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,450
You look this

525
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,020
The chef at the cafeteria makes

526
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,350
I had him add 5 eggs for me

527
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,820
Help me open the lid

528
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,730
I'll find something

529
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,270
Lin Bai Hui

530
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,340
Your eggs smell

531
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,990
It's too strong

532
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,100
Please, please stay a distance from me

533
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,850
Yu Xin

534
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,060
Are you okay?

535
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,280
I'm okay

536
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,170
Then please call Weiwei

537
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,140
Why hasn't she come yet?

538
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,160
Why?

539
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,010
Go to the pool with me

540
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,790
There is a surprise for you

541
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,190
Mei Weiwei

542
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,350
Why did you bring me here?

543
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,900
Go and know by yourself. Hurry up

544
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,630
Today I am not in the mood to practice

545
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,150
Not going to practice

546
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,350
There is something to surprise you

547
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,250
Bro

548
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,170
Weiwei

549
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:57,830
We are here

550
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,280
Sichong

551
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,790
Where is he?

552
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,640
Mai Sichong
