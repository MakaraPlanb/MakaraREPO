1
00:02:11,488 --> 00:02:12,244
Good morning

2
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,520
Morning

3
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,440
Dingyi

4
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,400
Get up for your breakfast

5
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
Sichong, where did you go last night

6
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,280
Dressing like Pikachu

7
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,120
You really scared me last night

8
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,160
Do you know the girl

9
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,720
who came to the swimming pool yesterday?

10
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,640
Which one? That journalist?

11
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,600
No, the other one

12
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,240
Right, the one from rehabilitation class?

13
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,040
What's wrong with her?

14
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,480
Nothing

15
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,160
Is there something you're not telling me?

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
I think he is being weird, Xia Rui, do you agree?

17
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,640
I get something to do, excuse me

18
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,800
So weird, fine, let's go

19
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,800
Over 600 yuan?

20
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,560
That's unbelievably expensive

21
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Weiwei

22
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,520
I have been waiting for Sischong's message for the whole night

23
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,680
Why he didn't text me?

24
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,120
He must be sleeping

25
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,000
Calm down

26
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,960
When he gets up

27
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,120
your phone is going to be busy as hell

28
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,400
But it has been so long

29
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,000
Your super power

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,520
is going to be valid tonight

31
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,920
Sweet heart

32
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,680
Are you feeling alright?

33
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,711
Don't keep secrets from me

34
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,644
Relax, I am fine

35
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:55,600
Don't worry about me

36
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,960
Let's find the Pikachu's head

37
00:03:57,755 --> 00:03:58,511
Fine

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,000
Hello Weiwei, can I have my Pikachu back?

39
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,888
I will wait for you on the third floor of the teaching building

40
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,320
The student union needs it for an activity

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,320
Daixi, I don' have much time left

42
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,120
I gotta go

43
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,000
-What to do with the Pikachu? -Forget about it

44
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,399
Are my eyes deceiving meï¼Ÿ

45
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,360
Where is the head?

46
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,480
I can't find it

47
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,880
Are you kidding me?

48
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,960
I lent to you last night

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,200
because you look like an decent lady

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,120
Why do you act like a rude girl?

51
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,360
I need it now!

52
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,680
How about this

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
I would like to for the head

54
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,422
Fine

55
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:45,420
-How much is it? -6000 yuan

56
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,840
6000?

57
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,240
The Pikachu is a special edition

58
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,840
You won't get it

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
even if you fly to Japan right now

60
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
Fine

61
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,680
But could you please

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,200
give me a 50% off?

63
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,680
Is 3000 enough?

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,280
No way

65
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,360
Is this made of gold?

66
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,600
Can't you read a book before scamming people

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,520
Can you?

68
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,600
Who the hell are you?

69
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,280
Mai Sichong from the swimming team

70
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,800
Don't you know me?

71
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,680
She said she would pay for it

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
Here is your Pikachu

73
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,160
Don't you dare bully people again

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,520
Alright

75
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,520
Your Pikachu is safe and sound

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,080
My debt to you is over

77
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,560
Thank you

78
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,160
Let's go

79
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,000
Why are you stealing my Pikachu head

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,480
I find it for you

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
and now you blame me, how grateful

82
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,720
You want my attention on you?

83
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,240
What do you want?

84
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,600
I have no idea

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I just feel like to being around you

86
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,400
Are you falling love with...

87
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
with whom?

88
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,640
Nobody

89
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
I gotta go

90
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,880
How about dinner tonight?

91
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,720
I don't think it's a good idea

92
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,640
What can I do?

93
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,600
How can I face Daixi?

94
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,920
I used my super power on me!

95
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,920
I am sorry

96
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,040
I thought I am the one only one in the dorm

97
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
That's alright

98
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,000
I won't tell Daixi about this

99
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,760
I am going to grab my take out downstair now

100
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,280
Okay

101
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,280
There is a good news

102
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,360
and a bad news

103
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,480
I want the good now first

104
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,320
The good news is that I found the Pikachu head

105
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,680
The bad news is that

106
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,040
My super power on Sichong failed

107
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,040
The Pikachu head is so big

108
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,280
I can't figure out where he exactly was

109
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
I told you so

110
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,159
He should have dated me this morning if you succeed

111
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,199
Relax

112
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,911
I can charm him again

113
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,080
Are you sure?

114
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,480
Don't make yourself be pressured

115
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,440
I have promised you

116
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,240
and I have come up with a new plan

117
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,280
Alright

118
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,400
Let's talk about

119
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,760
something you may concern about

120
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,920
Roger Federer looks more handsome than in the pictures

121
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,240
He would take off his wedding ring

122
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,200
when he grabs his tennis racket

123
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,680
Which means, he is single

124
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,400
when he is playing games

125
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,240
I noticed that all the ladies are so excited

126
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,800
But the guy who

127
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,720
sitting in the middle of the third row

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What are you excited for

129
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560
Mr.Peng Pai

130
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,280
I like you a lot

131
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,720
I appreciate it

132
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,080
Mr.Peng

133
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,960
Is there much pressure during our daily work?

134
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,720
This tournament has its own systeem

135
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,800
every individual has their own work part

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,240
So we as the volunteers

137
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,320
also have own tasks and goals

138
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,160
In the meantime

139
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,040
We need each other to make a good team

140
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,266
Take me as an example

141
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,760
My job is to

142
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,800
assembling you guys and assign work

143
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,920
Thank you for answering

144
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,160
Mr.Peng

145
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,320
My name is Ai Ning [Love you]

146
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,320
Because I love you

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,480
Wow, thanks

148
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,920
But I think this could happen between you and me

149
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,640
I will be very pleased

150
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,720
to answer questions about volunteer work

151
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,880
Mr.Peng

152
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,800
Actually I want to know

153
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,440
In this tournament

154
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,360
Only you followed the whole process

155
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,800
Does this experience help you

156
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
get a job tin FT since it is the best sports management company

157
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,840
I am a lucky person

158
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,680
I was supposed to be responsible for the beginning

159
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
but they are suddenly short on staff

160
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,000
So I can follow the whole project

161
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,320
You are so busy

162
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,560
Do you need my help as a good wife?

163
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,560
I think this is my mom's business

164
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,280
I won't waste your time here

165
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,960
right?

166
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:41,800
Good

167
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,520
Let's go on

168
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,560
What else do you want to know about Federer

169
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,560
Okay

170
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:47,800
You

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,880
Excuse me

172
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,200
I am here to pick up

173
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,560
the psychological test

174
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
made by sports management class

175
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,800
Okay

176
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,160
I will bring to you from the data room

177
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,080
Thank you

178
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,800
Madam

179
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,160
there is something wrong with my body

180
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,640
Can I use the thermometer?

181
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,640
Hello

182
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,000
Excuse me

183
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,120
Which class are you in?

184
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,920
The Swimming class

185
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,760
My name is Mai Sichong

186
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,960
Mai Sichong?

187
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,120
the exceptional admission?

188
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,280
Sir

189
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,960
I think I am on the edge of madness

190
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,000
Since I met her

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,680
She has occupied my mind

192
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,960
I can'c control it

193
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,360
and I always think about

194
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,960
getting close to her

195
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,880
Are you feeling sick?

196
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,760
Find a doctor if you are feeling wrong

197
00:11:58,311 --> 00:12:00,280
Anyway, there must be something wrong with me

198
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,280
Based on what you have said

199
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,320
I assume you may have fall in love with her

200
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,040
My advice is to

201
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,880
ask your friends

202
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
and figure out what she wants

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,960
I may have scared her

204
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,680
Will she hate me?

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,840
Girls won't hate a guy like you

206
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,800
This makes sense

207
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,440
Thank you sir

208
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,360
Actually I am not a "Sir"

209
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,360
I am back

210
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,220
Here you are

211
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,111
You are also a student?

212
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:32,120
I am Peng Pai, a senior from Sports Management Class

213
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,720
Sorry

214
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,200
I can't find a proper time to tell you this

215
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,280
But don't worry

216
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,480
My month is zipped

217
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,880
Thanks a lot

218
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,840
I know what should I do next

219
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,160
You are early today

220
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,840
I will never be late

221
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,720
Alright

222
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,400
Guys

223
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,800
I will call a roll first

224
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,400
Mei Weiwei

225
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,040
Here

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,720
Mei Weiwei

227
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,560
I am here

228
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,320
What's your problem

229
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,440
Louder please, haven't you gotten anything to eat?

230
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,160
Madam

231
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,360
We all heard her

232
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,760
Pardon me?

233
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,000
He said he didn't hear me too

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,720
Sorry madam, I have a sour throat today

235
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,622
Fine, I will continue

236
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:23,620
-Peng Wanli -Here

237
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,620
Gao Dashan -Here

238
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,800
Stop talking to me

239
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,880
Find me

240
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,622
after class

241
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:29,488
Okay

242
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,720
Okay

243
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,880
This is all about today's class, dismissed

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,320
Finally

245
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,120
I almost can't breath

246
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,720
Can I talk to you now?

247
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,800
What do you want?

248
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
I think I have a crush on you

249
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,244
Can you be my girlfriend

250
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,240
I am a grown up

251
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,640
I don't have to deny anything

252
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,444
What's your answer?

253
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:25,177
Say yes

254
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:32,866
Weiwei

255
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,440
You said I can talk to you after class

256
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,440
Mai Sichong

257
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,920
I think you need to rest now

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,320
This is illusion

259
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,560
When you get up, you will forget me

260
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,160
This isn't illusion, I have thought for a long time

261
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
There has never been a problem

262
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,040
that can make me think for more than ten hours

263
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,977
I can't explain now

264
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,177
Just leave me alone

265
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,080
I am so sorry

266
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,600
Mom!? Didn't I tell you to wait me outside the school?

267
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,680
Who is this?

268
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,360
-Mei Weiwei, My future girlfriend -Really?

269
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,760
-I'm not... -"Future" girlfriend, I understand

270
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,680
You are so pretty

271
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,480
Are you available this afternoon?

272
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,520
Yes

273
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,688
That's great!

274
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:19,377
Would you mind having dinner with us?

275
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,111
Today is my birthday

276
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,360
Let's go

277
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,111
Let's go to my place

278
00:15:23,111 --> 00:15:25,110
Keep up!

279
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:36,640
Hello

280
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,955
Sichong is doing great

281
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,360
He is not only good at swimming

282
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,720
but also good at getting along with girls

283
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,520
Let me see it

284
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,560
That's Sichong, really

285
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,000
Is she meeting his parents?

286
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,866
That's a big step

287
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,560
Amazing

288
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,120
Yes, unbelievable

289
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,133
Indeed

290
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,040
We need to put some effort into girls

291
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,600
Learn from Sichong

292
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,560
Another crazy woman

293
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,520
Here is the roasted chicken

294
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,960
Do you like it?

295
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,240
This is Sichong's favorite

296
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,480
I like it, really

297
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,240
Right

298
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,720
Ms.Mai

299
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,880
Happy birthday!

300
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,600
Thank you!

301
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,560
You are so adorable

302
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,266
Is this the first time?

303
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:26,960
Weiwei, Sichong has never

304
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,800
brought a girlfriend home before

305
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,111
I am not...

306
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:31,080
What are you talking about?

307
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,960
Weiwei is a

308
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,520
very close friend of Sichong

309
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,720
Not his girlfriend

310
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,840
Watch your language

311
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,800
I am sorry

312
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,760
I hope you don't mind

313
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,240
But everyone in this family is very easy-going

314
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,080
Make yourself at home

315
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,880
-Have anything you want -Yes, don't feel uncomfortable

316
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,960
Come on

317
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,333
You are embarrassing her

318
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,520
No no no

319
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,160
What do you want to eat?

320
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,120
I can order take out for you

321
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,911
Thanks, but I am good

322
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:59,910
Order take out?

323
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,800
Every dish on this table is better than take out!

324
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,760
Absolutely!

325
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,480
Your dad is really good at cooking!

326
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,720
You are doing a great job

327
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,640
Thank you

328
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,719
I will get you some water

329
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,600
No need

330
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,440
What happened?

331
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,199
I am fine

332
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,560
Are you okay?

333
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,120
I am good, I will get you some water

334
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,439
Excuse us, come with me

335
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,920
Are you training too much

336
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,120
these days

337
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,280
No

338
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,440
I know you best

339
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,080
It's been several months

340
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,600
You still hurt so much

341
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,680
I have told you so many times

342
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,360
If you don't care your legs now

343
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
The damage will be permanent

344
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,240
You just wonâ€™t be able to look a cow in the eye for a while

345
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,200
Why did I sent you to the Sports University?

346
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,440
My attention is to give you a break

347
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,240
Yes, you are right

348
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,760
Bu it doesn't matter

349
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,960
As long as others won't notice I am injured

350
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,280
If our coach knows it

351
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,480
How can I be admitted to the Province team

352
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,320
Although I am in a university

353
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,360
I can't go easy on training

354
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,160
The competitions

355
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,520
in the second half of the year are very important to me

356
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,320
Alright, you are making sense

357
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,520
So listen to your doctor

358
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,360
Fine

359
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,480
I will be careful

360
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,120
Let's go eating

361
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,320
Go

362
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,600
You little bastard

363
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,200
Give it to them

364
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,040
We are leaving

365
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,440
The driver will drive you to school

366
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,640
Weiwei, come by next time, will you?

367
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,200
Sure

368
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,040
Thank you a lot

369
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,355
Good bye

370
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,520
Bye bye

371
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,160
Be careful on the road

372
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,080
It is not my attention to

373
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,200
invite you for dinner

374
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,280
It's my mom...

375
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,160
Mai Sichong

376
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,777
Send my greetings to your mom

377
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
and I can't accept these snacks

378
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,866
Take them back

379
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,000
Why

380
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,560
Am I rushing to fast?

381
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,120
It's not

382
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,640
Tomorrow is another day

383
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,760
I am leaving

384
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:39,200
Keep the snacks

385
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,640
I don't need...

386
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,160
Sichong

387
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,960
Peng Pai?

388
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,222
What a coincidence

389
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,080
Do you know each other?

390
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,200
I didn't expect to

391
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,960
meet you here

392
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,880
Long time no see

393
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,000
Peng Yan

394
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,680
Peng Yan?

395
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,080
His name is Peng Pai

396
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,680
I will leave you two alone

397
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:22,400
What about the snacks?

398
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,720
Pang Pai?

399
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,280
Excuse me?

400
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,360
She is angry with me again

401
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Girls are unpredictable

402
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,280
Sichong

403
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,955
Is she the one

404
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,920
You are talking about before?

405
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:43,960
Yes

406
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,400
I called you so many times

407
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,520
Why wouldn't you pick up?
I called you so many times

408
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,533
Why wouldn't you pick up?

409
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,360
and can you explain this?

410
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,400
What is going on between you and Mai Sichong

411
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,080
Daixi

412
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,680
I ran into Peng Yan just now

413
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,160
Did he go aboard?

414
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,520
He has changed his name

415
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,320
Now he is Peng Pai

416
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,120
The Peng Pai?

417
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,400
Did he say anything to you?

418
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,111
Nothing

419
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,560
Do not tell me you just left

420
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,600
I was so shocked that time

421
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,480
I didn't think much

422
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,280
and left unconsciously

423
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,240
You don't have to be afraid him

424
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,440
If he doesn't behave

425
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,400
You can shock him with your power

426
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
No no no

427
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,160
If he falls in love with you

428
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,560
Things will be more complicated

429
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,320
Explain this, now!

430
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,720
Are you two together now?

431
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,920
It's a long story

432
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,960
The story is that I used my super power on myself

433
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,680
So he falls in love with me

434
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,680
Why didn't you tell me the truth

435
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
when we were at the cafe?

436
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,880
Why did you lie to me?

437
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,840
I am afraid that you will be mad at me

438
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,320
Anyway

439
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,280
He will forget me

440
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,320
After couple hours

441
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,360
Then we start our plan B

442
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,880
And I am sure it will work

443
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,066
-Are you sure? -Of course

444
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,320
Fine

445
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,680
Peng Pai

446
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,240
You have knew about Mei Weiwei

447
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,520
since high school

448
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,400
right?

449
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,120
-Are you courting her right now? -Yes

450
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,800
But things don't go very well

451
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,080
She is hiding from me

452
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,000
She used to be a professional track athlete

453
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,240
She runs like a leopard

454
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,440
Really?

455
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,160
I need more

456
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,040
Share with me

457
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,600
I just have no idea how to please her now

458
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,920
How did you first meet Weiwei?

459
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,440
It's not so long after first day of school

460
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,560
Actually I don't have much impression on her

461
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,240
Then I met her in the school

462
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,640
She became clingy

463
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,440
Right

464
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,560
Why she turned me down

465
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,840
when she is the one who loves me first

466
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,920
I think you may have misunderstood her

467
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,280
You need to calm down

468
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,640
That's what she told me

469
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,280
I just think she is clumsy

470
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,920
But later in that night tour

471
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,680
She looked at me

472
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,000
and I felt something changed

473
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,360
What changed?

474
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,080
You mean fall in love at first sight?

475
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,480
Anyway you don't need to rush in

476
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:24,960
Take some rest

477
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,680
Cheers

478
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Pleas eat

479
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,080
Cheers

480
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,960
I believe you will love back

481
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,360
I won't give up

482
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,920
Stay calm!

483
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,280
Stay rational!

484
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:00,644
Come on

485
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:26,644
Ding Yi

486
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,800
Let me sleep

487
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,760
Good morning

488
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,960
Get up!

489
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,360
Don't bother me

490
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,720
I want to sleep

491
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,960
I believe you will love me back

492
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,120
I won't give up

493
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,080
Stay calm

494
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,600
Stay rational

495
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,920
Why you always turn me down

496
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,120
I won't stop loving you

497
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
no matter what you said to me

498
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,200
What's this

499
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,520
What did I do yesterday?

500
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,200
Weiwei. are you in bed?

501
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,040
I am thinking of you all the time

502
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,200
I want the whole world know

503
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,320
your cuteness

504
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,040
-Ding Yi -My sister in law!

505
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,022
Call me Mei Weiwei please

506
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,440
Can you do me a favor?

507
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,880
This is for you

508
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,160
Did you take training tonight?

509
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,400
The coach didn't ask us to 

510
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,200
But Sichong mush be there 

511
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,120
You want to surprise him?

512
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,120
Y...es

513
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,640
Forget me?

514
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,720
Peng Yan

515
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,240
We should have talked that night

516
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,960
And I want to apologize for

517
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,680
what I did before

518
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,822
-I was...-Peng Yan

519
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,200
Let bygones be bygones

520
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,160
I can hardly remember it

521
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,040
I need to leave for

522
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,200
my classes

523
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,960
Sichong

524
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,280
Why are you so happy today

525
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,880
-You and Mei weiwei -Shut up

526
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,480
What happened

527
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,400
Yesterday you were just fine

528
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,320
Why you behave like this

529
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
She is right

530
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,160
Falling in love at first sight is stupid

531
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,040
What would you react if she come to you

532
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,160
It depends on my mood

533
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,160
Let's go training

534
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Weirdo

535
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,640
Mai sichong

536
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,400
Somebody is drowning

537
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,680
-Help her please -Drowning?

538
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,400
Pleas help her

539
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,640
Can anybody drown 

540
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,360
in such a shallow swimming pool?

541
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,960
Come on

542
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,520
She is drowning, for sure!

543
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,280
She was seized with cramp

544
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,222
Go and help her

545
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:36,880
You are such a lousy actress

546
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,560
I am leaving

547
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
-Good evening coach! -Coach?

548
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120

550
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,720
You are safe now

551
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:40,666
It's you

552
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,480
Are you okay?

553
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
I am fine

554
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,933
What are you doing?

555
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:06,711
Mei Weiwei

556
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,022

557
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,600
What have you done to me!
