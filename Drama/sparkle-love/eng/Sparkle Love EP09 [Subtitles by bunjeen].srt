You don't look down on me

56
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,940
I just wear clothes and look skinny

57
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,970
But actually have muscles

58
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,380
Why are you carrying a lot of stuff?

59
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Move house?

60
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,510
Yes

61
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,130
Just move house

62
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,380
I moved out of the house

63
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:53,900
All right

64
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,920
But you moved houses like this, your parents agree?

65
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,390
I agree it is enough

66
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,630
That's true

67
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,300

68
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,580
So you don't have to work two ways

69
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,210
It doesn't have to be that difficult

70
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:10,860

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,690

73
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,670

74
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,240

109
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,300
It's okay

110
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,590
We can share it with everyone

111
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,350
I've something to do

112
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:20,910
Excuse me

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,880

So, excuse me

116
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,450
Unhappy?

117
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,260
Today your training results are very good, isn't it?

118
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,170
heartbroken

119
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,030
Just heartbroken

120
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,310
Who?

121
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,090
Now, in my heart, it's all about the group stage

122
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,260
Just heartbroken

123
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,450
You don't eat?

124
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:01,990
No

125
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,800
Another illusion?

126
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Hello, mom

127
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,100
What? I'm so busy now

128
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,760
you're busy?

129
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,530
What are you busy with?

130
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,510
Yesterday I made an appointment with Doctor Peter who will be coming to China

131
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,330
It's very important, but you don't come

132
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,160
So what do you do about your knees?

133
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,910
Dr. Peter has returned to America

134
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,580
Yesterday Weiwei had a few things, so I didn't go

135
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,570
What's more important than your knees?

136
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,720
And Wei Wei is fine, right?

137
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,550
Okay now

138
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,010
Bye bye

139
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,110
Hello Weiwei

140
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:57,970
What?

141
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,590
Shocks me right now?

142
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,300
Hello Weiwei

143
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,150
I'm hungry

144
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,720
You're not going to feed me, how bout right now?

145
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,350
What was there to talk about with Peng Pai?

146
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,520
Mei Ling Professor

147
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,040
This is our club plan

148
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,030
Please take a look

149
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,150
I don't do this alone

150
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,880
This is the result of everyone's work togetherness

151
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,820
Especially Weiwe

152
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,810
She helped a lot

153
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,610
Mei Weiwei

154
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,040
Umm

155
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,760
Isn't she going to transfer a major?

156
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,750
Why did she suddenly become interested in physical therapy?

157
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,430
Transfer a major?

158
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,760
Yes

159
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,260
Only one week to start studying and then come see me

160
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,460
She founded a club For the GPA, right?

161
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,410
I heard Master Mei Ling say

162
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,250
You gonna transfer a major

163
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Is it true?

164
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,080
Boss

165
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,790
I should have told you this

166
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,210
But I'm afraid that when I told you about transfer a major

167
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,810
You're not going to let me join the club

168
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,950
But you can trust me

169
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,290
I just transfer a major

170
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,230
But I'm not going to delay my club work

171
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,430
I don't care, Weiwei

172
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
I've always felt that...

173
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,240
You are very suitable for our professional field

174
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,310
We have been happy to work together so many times

175
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,790
I also think you like physical therapy

176
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,220
Just started a club with me

177
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:53,940
Weiwei

178
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,680
Whatever reason you have, just tell him

179
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,250
You should give him the opportunity to understand you too

180
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:01,540
I...

181
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,130
Weiwei

182
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,950
You have an inconvenient reason to say, right?

183
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,390
We all can help you

184
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
I really hope that...

185
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You'll stay

186
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:22,820
Boss

187
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,930
Let's talk about this again, okay?

188
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,220
I have an urgent matter, excuse me

189
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:26,690
Weiwei

190
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,100
Weiwei

191
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,960
Mai Sichong

192
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,910
Call me dozens

193
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,050
How are you a mobile robot?

194
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,000
I am willing

195
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,530
Why didn't you answer my phone?

196
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,020
Our boss knew about my transferring a major and was angry

197
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,990
How can I pick up your call?

198
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,880
Actually, are you with Bai Hui?

199
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,200
Why are you smiling?

200
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:48,650
Nothing

201
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,350
Come on

202
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,350
Hurry to shock, hurry to practice

203
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,490
You don't have to run today

204
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,340
Just finished the exam

205
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:03,910
Will take you on a trip

206
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,200
Go where?

207
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,330
You said to take me out on a trip. Is it brought to buy things?

208
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,610
I've never dated a girl

209
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,850
I don't know what to do

210
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,480
Hey friend

211
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,910
We can't date, don't you know?

212
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,150
Speak carefully

213
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,360
So what are we?

214
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,640
We are...

215
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,680
However, this is not a dating relationship

216
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,050
Weiwei

217
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,030
I think this dress doesn't suit you

218
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,650
You have to buy clothes that suit your personality

219
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,830
So which one do you think is right for me?

220
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:55,790
Small

221
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,420
What small?

222
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,910
your body so small

223
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,150
Otherwise, what will can be?

224
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,590
Where am I small?

225
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,720
Go

226
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,460
I know a shop that is very suitable for you

227
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,830
Let's go

228
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Not good?

229
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,990
When I look at you

230
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,070
It's like I can see myself

231
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,370
How good is this?

232
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,320
What do you know?

233
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
This is called BF brand

234
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,250
It means Boy ...

235
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,950
How do men wear?

236
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,860
You can wear it too.

237
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,040
I feel like you're talking in nonsense

238
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,880
Wait a minute

239
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,230
Wear this so it will look cool

240
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Why are you shocking me again?

241
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,970
No, I didn't

242
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,850
Want me to like you, just say it

243
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Why do you have to shock me?

244
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,690
No, I didn't

245
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,290
All day today, I haven't been shocked yet, okay?

246
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,610
It was just a electrostatic

247
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,390
electrostatic

248
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,860
So today during the exam

249
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,610
Didn't you shock me?

250
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,760
No

251
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,360
Don't you eat?

252
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,020
You look really strange today

253
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,490
Keep staring at me

254
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,690
Don't just stare at me

255
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
You have a fever, right?

256
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,500
Are you sure all day today didn't shock me?

257
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,020
Sure

258
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,030
Eat your food

259
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,150
Thank you

260
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,550
If you're tired, go to the meeting room for a while

261
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,340
No, I have to work

262
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,010
Today at noon when you go back to the university

263
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,320
Go see Weiwei, right?

264
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,650
It's no surprise that all the work has to be done in the evenings

265
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,060
You...

266
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,660
Just worried about the work you have to do with me, right?

267
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,270
Tomorrow I have to get off work soon

268
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,480
Therefore, President Zhang's work must be completed today

269
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,420
Have a girlfriend, this is really good

270
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,580
Not my girlfriend yet

271
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:32,970
Haven't you told he yet?

272
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,870
As a friend, let me remind you

273
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,950
The past is not equivalent to the present

274
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,830
Even though you've waited for her many years

275
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,760
But people are not together

276
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,870
All right, I knew

277
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,610
Let's work

278
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,360
In the morning I fell asleep, why didn't you call me?

279
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,810
You went back very late last night

280
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,990
I want you to sleep a lot

281
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:03,690
Weiwei

282
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,240
Peng Pai, let me bring you this breakfast

283
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,280
Thank you

284
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,460
Bye bye

285
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,990
The little girl is already has something to worried about

286
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,440
Hello

287
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,420
Weiwei

288
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,260
Are you free this weekend?

289
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,360
What's the matter?

290
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,690
I heard that there is a new restaurant near our high school

291
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,790
If this weekend is free

292
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,540
Let's go eat together

293
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,590
Okay

294
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,270
Bye bye

295
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:37,960
What is he talking to you?

296
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,440
You don't care, go to study now

297
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,510
He wants to meet you, right?

298
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,510
Not at all

299
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,220
Mai Sichong

300
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:48,940
Xie Rui

301
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,860
Not bad, time results are great

302
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,790
Ding Yi also has today

303
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,520
I still think you will have to practice until I retire

304
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,190
Okay

305
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,060
Let's go relax

306
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,090
Chong bro

307
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,750
You haven't trained hard recently

308
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,510
Every day you stay at the physical club

309
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Why are you developing so fast?

310
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,800
Before, I thought a lot of work had to be done

311
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,750
So that I can swim faster

312
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,790
But actually not

313
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
I'm just gifted

314
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,820
Do you believe him?

315
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,070
He just likes to stay asleep all night

316
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,530
Pretending to be a good boy, never working hard

317
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,220
Or is he actually lurking in training?

318
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,410
Do you believe his nonsense?

319
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,990
I saw everyday he was with Mei Weiwei

320
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,930
People in love

321
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,040
Every day, he was thrilled

322
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,750
Last night of singing love songs, Can't you hear?

323
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,250
I can hear it all

324
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,470
Weiwei

325
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,170
How did you come?

326
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,010
Senior Peng Pai had just brought you breakfast

327
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
You acted like nothing happen

328
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,440
It's clearly

329
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,990
He invites me to dinner

330
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,420
Really?

331
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,300
I think he must like you for sure

332
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,860
Nothing

333
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,920
You think too much

334
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,490
I really believe you

335
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,440
Honey

336
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,270
For 4 years, he's been texting you all the time

337
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,700
If he doesn't like you

338
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,280
Why send messages to you all day long?

339
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,470
Or does he want to be a writer?

340
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,470
Are you ok?

341
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,720
Do you know the daughter of a foreign movie star? What's her name?

342
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,410
What's her name?

343
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,150
Xingxing (means wake up)

344
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,150
If you miss the senior Peng Pai

345
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,470
You probably won't touch a love again

346
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,330
A good man like this

347
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,300
We didn't get anything from the beginning

348
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,740
I think you...

349
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,760
Just don't want yourself to regret later

350
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,080
It's a shame

351
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,420
Now that should be taken

352
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,810
Just try it

353
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,320
Journalist friend

354
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,910
You and Ding Yi, amnesia?

355
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,230
My name is Li Dai Xi

356
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
I didn't name a journalist friend

357
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,370
There is something to bother you

358
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,330
Please call Weiwei for me

359
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,410
She seems sick

360
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,400
Weiwei get sick?

361
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,540
She is...

362
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Must have been sick, so didn't answer my phone

363
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,810
Why are you coming to Weiwei again?

364
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,440
Send her warming heart?

365
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,630
No need, she already has a senior Peng Pai

366
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,650
She and Peng Pai are in a relationship?

367
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,190
Not yet

368
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,970
Maybe next

369
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:33,790
Bye

370
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:40,990
Weiwei

371
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,340
This is their special menu

372
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:42,760
You try it

373
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,260
Okay

374
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,990
Your university

375
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,220
Have anything recently?

376
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,140
There is nothing during this time

377
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
But there are rumors

378
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,370
During this time the university had female students being stalked

379
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:57,760
Do you want this?

380
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,510
Next, I'll go pick you up

381
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,330
Single woman is insecure

382
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,130
No need

383
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,500
You have work to do

384
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,480
So very busy

385
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,470
You don't have to pick me up

386
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,900
Hello, President Zhang

387
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,590
Weiwei, can you come pick me up at the university gate?

388
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,830
It seems that someone has followed me

389
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,510
Bro, I have an urgent matter. Excuse me

390
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,010
Weiwei

391
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:27,540
Hello

392
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,910
Weiwei, have you returned to university yet? I will pick you up

393
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,400
Not yet, I came out to find Junjun

394
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,620
There seemed to be someone following her

395
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,660
But I don't know where she is?

396
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,670
Junjun

397
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,150
It's me

398
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,150
I'm Xie Rui

399
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,100
A classmate of the Mai Sichong

400
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,600
How did you get here?

401
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,370
You follow me?

402
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:44,890
No

403
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,010
You don't just get it wrong

404
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,330
Err...

405
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,360
The university said that there are psychopaths?

406
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,760
I think you are the only woman

407
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,330
Returning to the dorm would be unsafe

408
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,010
So I want to drop you off

409
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,270
But

410
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,400
I don't know you

411
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,870
Before, didn't we meet at the physical club?

412
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,830
Also, I know you are Mei Weiwei's classmates

413
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,690
The two of you are friends

414
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,910
So

415
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,220
I just want to protect you

416
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,660
But who knows That you will think that I am a bad person

417
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,040
Weiwei

418
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,220
Where are you now?

419
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:18,950
Tell me quickly

420
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:19,990
And waiting for me there

421
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,610
Don't walk anywhere

422
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,830
Weiwei

423
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,650
Too bad

424
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,990
Weiwei

425
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,470
Weiwei, answer me!

426
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,170
Weiwei

427
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,550
Weiwei

428
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:37,590
You...

429
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,580
Are you ok?

430
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,220
Not safe here

431
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:46,940
Let's go hurry

432
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,270
Umm

433
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Let's go back

434
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,790
Go

435
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,180
The event

436
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
I fully understand

437
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,830
You see this psychopath

438
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,220
Was hit by a man and ran away

439
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,470
Little girl

440
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,850
Very amazing

441
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
How do you do?

442
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,800
Hit this psychopath

443
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,190
Until running away

444
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
I used an electric shock to chase that bastard
