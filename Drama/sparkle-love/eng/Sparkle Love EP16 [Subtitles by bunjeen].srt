1
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,620
You said yes to me

2
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,180
You won't regret it later?

3
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,580
My electric

4
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,800
It's ok

5
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,620
Whether you conduct electricity or not

6
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,310
I'm the same

7
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,710
Okay, isn't there a race tomorrow?

8
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,790
Let's go back quickly

9
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,220
I won't go

10
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,910
If you still don't return it will be late

11
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,630
Do you really want me to go?

12
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,450
I won't go

13
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,100
Hurry back

14
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,830
You can catch a cold

15
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,720
I returned to the dormitory

16
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,290
Are you awake?

17
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,300
Would you like to drink some water?

18
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,470
Thank you

19
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,780
Where's Weiwei?

20
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,350
Stayed out with Mai Shi Chong all day

21
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,760
But today they really are...

22
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,470
Using Nanti as a love scene

23
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,050
Jun Jun

24
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,010
Actually, I have always wanted to ask you

25
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,470
The one you like

26
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,550
Not Xia Rui

27
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,080
Right?

28
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,940
You guys are here

29
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:57,970
Jun Jun

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,900
Here for you

31
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,580
Today is difficult for you

32
00:03:59,600 --> 00:03:59,870
Thanks

33
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,280
Eat more

34
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,600
This is Yu Xin's

35
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,260
Thank you

36
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,550
What do you want to eat? Just take it

37
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,970
However

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
Mai Si Chong bought it

39
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,510
A while

40
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,880
Show your true potential

41
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,380
Make the best swimming record

42
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,210
understand?

43
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,040
understand

44
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,840
But this is a competition

45
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,860
How will it be like in normal practice?

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,900
Ding Yi

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,920
You did not participate in the competition

48
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,580
Why are you still here and telling me what to do?

49
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,670
Fighting

50
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,160
Get on the car

51
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Thesis Examination Results

52
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,480
You only do 1.2%

53
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,450
There should be no problems

54
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,600
Actually, professor wanted me to change the topic as well

55
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,030
This is just a university pre-examination. There is still a lot of time

56
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,680
Weiwei

57
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Sis

58
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,770
Where are you going to hurry?

59
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,200
I have something to do outside

60
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,930
Qiao Qiao

61
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,690
We have to see the professor to get the paper exam results

62
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,560
Let's go

63
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,010
Okay

64
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,220
So, we gonna go

65
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,190
Bye bye

66
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,150
You guys

67
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Not talking well

68
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,190
The matter has passed

69
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,660
Big brother, I've known you for 4 years

70
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,080
No need to tell how well I know you

71
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,770
Are you happy? I can see

72
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,850
I know the feelings you have for Mei Wei are not the same

73
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,330
But she must not know for sure

74
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,710
I think...

75
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,540
You have to tell her

76
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,540
FTI Company 
Sheng Yu: Did you hear the news yet? Zhang Wei Xin will resign

77
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,760
President Zhang will resign now

78
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,920
Fighting Fighting

79
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,470
Nanti will win

80
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,000
Fighting Fighting

81
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,280
Nanti will win

82
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,370
How did you guys come?

83
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,340
Why is this ...

84
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,390
Can't see?

85
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,400
Come and cheer you guys

86
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,530
Also here

87
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
With cheer flags

88
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,440
It's over

89
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,580
You guys do this If we lose, where will we put our face?

90
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,590
Bad mouth, how can you lose?

91
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,000
Just...

92
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,470
Why haven't you entered the field yet?

93
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,530
All right

94
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,720
Provincial teams allow friends and relatives to attend the races

95
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,480
But everyone still has to register

96
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,110
Okay?

97
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,930
Okay

98
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,300
Let's get into the field

99
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,790
Let's get into

100
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,830
So crazy

101
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,400
You don't have anything to tell me?

102
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:00,760
Fighting

103
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,480
That's it?

104
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,800
Wait and see

105
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,690
I will show you one place

106
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:10,520
Let's go

107
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,930
Brother Chong hurts again, right?

108
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,580
It's okay, he'll be able to do it

109
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,150
Are you ok?

110
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,940
I'm ok

111
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,770
I've been doing physical therapy for him all this time

112
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,280
He told me it was okay, then trust me

113
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,730
Weiwei

114
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,340
Uncle, auntie

115
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,890
Darling, hurry up

116
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,360
Trust me, Mai Si Chong will definitely win

117
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,570
There you are, must win

118
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,680
Where is he?

119
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,240

120
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,200

124
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,380
I'm not your boss any more

125
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,420
You don't have to be that cautious

126
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
About resignation

127
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,140
At first I planned to wait for you to work

128
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,390
At least

129
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,480
I can protect you

130
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,540
But now...

131
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,860
President Zhang, you're very good to me

132
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,910
Since I started working, I have always followed you

133
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,890
I am very grateful

134
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,940
About FT

135
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,280
There has never been a place for useless people

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,370
You are talented and ambitious

137
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,500
Just try one more time

138
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
President Zhang, don't you try one more time?

139
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,110
I want to take a temporary break

140
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,560
I would like to divide the time

141
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,820
to my daughter

142
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,490
At first I thought

143
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,270
This kid is tired

144
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,140
To take care of herself

145
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,460
But now looking back

146
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,080
Over the years my daughter needs me the most

147
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Instead, I threw away the opportunity

148
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:34,520
Come on

149
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,400
Bless you

150
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,360
Bright future

151
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:43,770
Eat it

152
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,330
Very good, right?

153
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,850
We win

154
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,670
I can brag fully

155
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,850
Today before my mother go back she said

156
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,390
Tonight, let me take everyone to rest a little

157
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,530
Everyone

158
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,890
Bro Chong would like us to spend the night too

159
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,040
Why are you excited?

160
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,360
Of course I must be excited

161
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,170
Chong and Rui grabbed the 1st and 2nd place for us

162
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,990
You have to be respectful, understand?

163
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,660
To celebrate Chong and Rui

164
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,230
Because of my intelligence, so we make the practice complete

165
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,370
I decided

166
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,950
Let Chong bro feast for dinner

167
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,990
How about this?

168
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,050
Tonight, I invite everyone to take a hot spring bath

169
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,930
Open a private room

170
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,070
VVIP, is it ok?

171
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,230
Great

172
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,980
Great

173
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,400
I haven't been in a hot spring yet

174
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,330
Really?

175
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,520
Chong bro

176
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,840
I really want to marry you

177
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Marry with your head

178
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,300
Li Dai Xi's head

179
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,130
Like a ball

180
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,520
You...

181
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,440
Say it again!

182
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,750
Look, what games are there?

183
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,320
King of Fighters, is it good?

184
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,940
Here I can choose what I want, right?

185
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,920
Professor Lin gave a very good description these days

186
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,010
You don't have to

187
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,810
Jun Jun, you choose

188
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,530
What do you want to watch

189
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,690
BLEACH

190
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,460
BLEACH?

191
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,290
Otherwise

192
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,590
I take you outside

193
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,880
Go

194
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,020
I'm a little excited

195
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,950
Sorry

196
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,100
It's ok

197
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,040
You will get used to

198
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,830
Next

199
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,870
I will do this to you often

200
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,140
First time just ever

201
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:01,990
The second time was used

202
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,220
And many times

203
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,830
Better then

204
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,280
Lots of mosquitoes

205
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,700
Lots of mosquitoes

206
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,400
I gonna go

207
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:55,920
mosquito?

208
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,720
Where are the mosquitoes?

209
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,130
Are you guys back?

210
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,570
Finally back

211
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,100
Oh year

212
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,150
What is this for?

213
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,330
Here, write the name

214
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,060
Write down the name of the person you like

215
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,850
Like that

216
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,530
Will be fulfilled smoothly

217
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,660
Really?

218
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:29,790
Fortune sticks

219
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,590
What is this?

220
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,270
Younger Sis, our fortune sticks are very accurate

221
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:33,630
really?

222
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,570
I will meet my soulmate

223
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,830
won't I?

224
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,110
Among the crowd

225
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,740
So flattering

226
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,250
What is it written about?

227
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,780
Like enemies

228
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,530
face to face

229
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,610
Nothing

230
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,490
Let's go, what else are you going to randomize with?

231
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,100
Go

232
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,260
Why are you randomly picked?

233
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,250
What wishes do you have? I can help you

234
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,860
I...

235
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,170
I'm still thinking about transfer my Major

236
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,430
I want to know what the future will be like

237
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:03,730
Why?

238
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,450
You don't want to transfer?

239
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,860
Still hesitating

240
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:07,850
It's ok

241
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:08,940
however

242
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:09,920
Where is the future going?

243
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,960
I will support you

244
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,560
Come on Weiwei

245
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:21,750
These give you

246
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,120
Why did you buy so many strange things?

247
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,820
You just eat, it's ok

248
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,250
This little raccoon. You have to put it on, too?

249
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,070
You eat

250
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,410
Wo ju (Lettuce)

251
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:34,980
Xi Gua (cucumber)

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,920
Hwan Xiang (Raccoon), Ni Chew (Carp)

253
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,280
Wo Xi Huan Ni (I like you)

254
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,730
You are outdated, Mai Si Chong

255
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,180
Chong bro

256
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,470
You are crazy too

257
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,940
too sweet

258
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,360
Where did you learn these from?

259
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,650
4 spades do make up

260
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,280
to 4 hearts

261
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,690
Kiss

262
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,780
All right

263
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,090
You guys turn your face away

264
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,080
Oh, it's so dark

265
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,710
Don't look back

266
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,820
Okay okay

267
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,210
We don't look

268
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:21,650
If I don't say

269
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,550
Don't turn back

270
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,630
I don't want to just be a game

271
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,010
Commonly done

272
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,190
Real kiss must be more serious

273
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,950
Chong bro

274
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,390
I'll say

275
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,360
Your kiss

276
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,790
I didn't say to kiss my lips

277
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,180
So, kiss one more time

278
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,230
You are...

279
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,170
Next turn

280
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,900
This turn, let me do

281
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,300
Ok, your turn

282
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,710
This turn

283
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,480
I'm a king

284
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,900
So

285
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,970
A hearts and A spades

286
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,260
Must hug 1 time

287
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,910
Jun Jun

288
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,370
So who is the other person?

289
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,380
Not me

290
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,660
Sis Wei

291
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,350
You're not angry, right?

292
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,160
Just hug, isn't it?

293
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,920
Go

294
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,560
Hugged

295
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,830
Childhood friend

296
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,110
What's going on next? Come to me and Xia Rui

297
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,030
We will protect you

298
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,170
Next turn

299
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,720
Come on, next turn I'll do

300
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,540
Ok, your turn

301
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,480
Next turn

302
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,180
I'll go to the bathroom

303
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,930
Err...

304
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,890
I picked up the phone for a while

305
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,060
Go

306
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,550
Come on

307
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,560
Wipe the table

308
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,000
Jun Jun

309
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,220
Are you ok?

310
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,880
I'm ok

311
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,550
You don't have to do this in the future

312
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
The person whom the Mai Si Chong likes is Weiwei

313
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,160
Weiwei also like him too

314
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,830
They are a good match

315
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,180
So what?

316
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,570
You have liked him for a long time

317
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,250
Why doesn't he care about you?

318
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,080
I...

319
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,300
Don't want him to know

320
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,600
It's not you don't want, you just dare not

321
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,790
You have been protecting him for a long time

322
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,370
But you're just going to back off

323
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,550
What would mean like this?

324
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,080
Like this, what is your advantage?

325
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:11,970
First

326
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,480
I don't like it at all

327
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,560
Finally accept the result

328
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,790
You're just too cowardly

329
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,210
I hope that in the future you will not do this again

330
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,610
I'll feel

331
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,370
Very uncomfortable

332
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,920
Ok, I got it

333
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,580
I won't do this again

334
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,720
I conduct electricity, can't go into the water

335
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,140
Weiwei

336
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,150
Feeling of the first kiss

337
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,570
How is it?

338
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,950
What's first kiss?

339
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,440
It's like a CPR

340
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,600
Have you had a CPR as well?

341
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,120
At that time, Mai Si Chong was sick

342
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,460
Fainted at the pool

343
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,540
I just...

344
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,370
Meaning that it was not your first kiss

345
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,120
Do you want to play together?

346
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,350
Forgot it

347
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:22,940
Weiwei

348
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,230
She wants to spend her life in this world with me

349
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,340
So you two are together in the world

350
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,760
I'll be with Jun Jun in the worlds too

351
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:32,800
Never thought that

352
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,310
In college, I will have good friends like you guys

353
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,690
Me too

354
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,100
This room...

355
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,230
The one is Jun Jun, and one is you

356
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,140
If not because I moved in

357
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,230
Probably no one talked together

358
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,110
actually

359
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,510
Actually, I like to talk a lot

360
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,810
You are Jun Jun?

361
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,810
Probably not wrong, right?

362
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,400
A while

363
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,980
See you in the garden

364
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,140
Okay

365
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,360
Just go

366
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:06,530
Fighting

367
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,240
How is it?

368
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,120
Is it fun to today?

369
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,090
The hot spring is very comfortable

370
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,340
Why call me out?

371
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
I have something want to give you

372
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:32,790
What?

373
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,680
Just this one?

374
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:44,630
I...

375
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,230
Actually, I want to buy big fireworks

376
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,240
But...

377
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,260
I can only buy nearby

378
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,490
But this one is very beautiful

379
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,460
Ding Yi told me that

380
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,020
Girls like you love things that

381
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,150
beautiful

382
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,380
Sparkling, isn't it?

383
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
I made you see

384
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,380
How is it?

385
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:10,660
It's beautiful, right?

386
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,770
You...

387
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,710
Really don't like it?

388
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,820
Weiwei

389
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,960
Actually

390
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,800
I just want to give you special memories

391
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
But actually I...

392
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,010
I don't know what to do to make you happy

393
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,220
Before I met you

394
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,870
Each day I spend my life with swimming

395
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,750
My world is a monotonous blue

396
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,130
But when I met you

397
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,590
My world has become colorful

398
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,920
You are like fireworks

399
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,900
Bright and dazzling

400
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,780
In the pool

401
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,940
Even if meeting a strong opponent

402
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,620
I was never afraid

403
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,330
But in front of you

404
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,720
I'm afraid that I'll do something bad

405
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,880
You know that

406
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,260
This is the first time I have been in love

407
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,720
Has many things

408
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,670
That I don't know what to do as well

409
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,980
Don't know that...

410
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,450
You'll...

411
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,850
Can you accept a boyfriend like me?

412
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,060
Mai Si Chong

413
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
I like you
