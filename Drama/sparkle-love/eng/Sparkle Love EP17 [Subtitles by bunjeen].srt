1
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,450
The spirit of a good man

2
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,280
Really comfortable

3
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,100
Should have a bath with more bubbles

4
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,670
This will help the blood circulation in the body

5
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,270
We haven't taken pictures yet

6
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,040
Let's take a photo

7
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,670
Exactly!

8
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,690
Let's take a photo

9
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,350
Okay

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,190
Come on

11
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,510
Rui

12
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,120
Stand on top

13
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,070
You stand in front

14
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,720
Your face is so small

15
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,890
I can't shoot

16
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,900
Come on

17
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,220
Is there me in the frame?

18
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,240
What did you take? Give me

19
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,740
Okay

20
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,100
1 2 3

21
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,140
eggplant

22
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,040
Okay

23
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,850
Like I'm closing my eyes

24
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,500
So

25
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,920
Where do we go next?

26
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,040
I'm not going

27
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,420
Err, I...

28
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,840
I will go home

29
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,310
Already bought a car ticket?

30
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,910
Yes

31
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,970
I gonna go

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,730
Okay Bye bye

33
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,070
Bye bye

34
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,070
I will be back too

35
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,830
I made an appointment with my friends

36
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,210
I am going too

37
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,230
At the coffee shop, I have something to do

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:53,720
Bye bye

39
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,740
Bye bye

40
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,140
So

41
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,940
I gonna go too

42
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,720
Tell us to go and just go

43
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,310
So?

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Why go all together?

45
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:02,860
So

46
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,430
Dai Xi

47
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,070
So let's go shopping

48
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,600
Go

49
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:44,800
Err...

50
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,580
Do you have any wishes?

51
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,780
I...

52
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,050
Previously had

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Now...

54
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:55,740
And you?

55
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,260
I...

56
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,580
At first there was no

57
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,580
Now there is...

58
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,400
Err...

59
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,890
This place seems far from the station

60
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,290
Otherwise let me request a car

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,430
Drop you off at the dormitory

62
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:24,460
No need

63
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,890
I can go by myself

64
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,820
And...

65
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,560
You trust me

66
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,570
Next I ...

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,570
Will not interfere with any more chaos

68
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,080
Story of you with Mai Si Chong

69
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780
You handle it yourself

70
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,550
I...

71
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,810
You buy shoes for training at a provincial club

72
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,620
one pair, is it good?

73
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,640
If I've gone

74
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,700
Don't you think?

75
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,890
I have to be alone

76
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,430
Now your thoughts are very dangerous

77
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,470
I can't always be with you alone

78
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,070
Otherwise you are thinking of ...

79
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,830
What does Chong bro want to do?

80
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,210
Have lunch

81
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,770
He want to have lunch

82
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,050
So hungry

83
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,190
Go find your Dai Xi

84
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:29,970
Go

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,680
How is it?

86
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,000
Weiwei

87
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,930
Last night, you and Mai Si Chong

88
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,580
Say it

89
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,470
What did you guys do?

90
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,520
Nothing

91
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,140
Nothing, why does your face turn red like this?

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
Student Mei Weiwei

93
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,720
You and Mai Sichong

94
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,880
Just recently dating

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,220
Why?

96
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,470
Or have to date each other for a long time

97
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,170
So can do such thing

98
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,060
Like that ...

99
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,220
You guys

100
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,240
Can you help me keep an eye out for Mai Si Chong

101
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,440
Is he doing anything too much?

102
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,440
This is Weiwei's first love

103
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,370
First love

104
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,930
Don't let I watch

105
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,480
People who are in love are not really the same

106
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,480
Get out

107
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,440
What do you think every day?

108
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,800
How far has you and Meiwei developed?

109
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,790
Dai Xi said that you have done too much

110
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,460
You guys have..... done, right?

111
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,230
What?

112
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,170
Student Mei Weiwei

113
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,460
Is the way of showing your love, it's too much?

114
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,190
Why did you let him lead like this?

115
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,450
You have to learn to control the game

116
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,820
So how do you control love? Master Li

117
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,370
The most important point is...

118
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,940
Women say that is not willing, is not willing

119
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,510
The man has no right to say anything

120
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,400
No matter what

121
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,940
But I'm willing

122
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,230
You're so obsessed with sex that you've been deceived by him

123
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,980
Our Weiwei

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,560
Yesterday was a clear girl. Who still don't wear a complete set of underwear

125
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,690
Today, you have been fooled by him

126
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,490
What?

127
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,080
Wait, like that as you say, we haven't done

128
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
What are you and Li Dai Xi thinking?

129
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,040
Come here

130
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,330
Come here

131
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,670
- I and Mau Si Chong
- I and Mei Weiwei

132
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,690
Just hold hands

133
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,480
Not too much

134
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,940
One kiss

135
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,080
Just this

136
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:47,850
So?

137
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,420
Just that makes you so happy

138
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
I think what are you all doing?

139
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,360
What can I do?

140
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,550
Then, Li Dai Xi, let me watch you all day

141
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,540
Then you guys are at the university. Do you only hold hands on days?

142
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,270
Too sweet

143
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,160
I already told you that I will go to see Mei Ling Professor

144
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,870
This winter holiday, you and Bro Xia going to keep practicing with the provincial team

145
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,600
Hui Hui has moved out

146
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,500
How to maintain a long distance relationship?

147
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,350
There are no pros to play online games

148
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,860
Left me alone

149
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Thanks

150
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,170
You...

151
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,430
Why come to my coffee shop again?

152
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,450
I just want to find a place

153
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,420
read a book

154
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,240
Yu Xin

155
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,670
Do you have time?

156
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,170
Uncle, hello

157
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,360
I am her college friend

158
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,390
And also the head of the room

159
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,780
Even though I don't know what you are thinking of doing here today

160
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,450
But...

161
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,040
This is a public place

162
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:20,920
You just please

163
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,240
Don't hurt other people

164
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,300
Or not able to curse

165
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,070
You trust me

166
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,650
She is my daughter

167
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,710
So I'll go wait in the shop

168
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,250
Why did you come?

169
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,820
During the winter holidays, you didn't come back home

170
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,920
I miss you

171
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,790
Therefore stopped by to visit you

172
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,750
Over the years I have been very busy

173
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,120
Not taking good care of you

174
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,960
But now it's okay.

175
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,370
I've resigned

176
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:03,890
resigned

177
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,170
I decided to leave FT

178
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,930
Open a coffee shop

179
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,540
So I can have time to take care of you

180
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,400
Yu Xin

181
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,530
That day, I was a little flustered

182
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,690
I'm very sad

183
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,700
I'm really sorry

184
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,940
Many days ago, I...

185
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,590
Been home and thinking for a long time

186
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,650
In the past, I spent too little time with you

187
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Even if you are free

188
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,760
Still have to pay attention

189
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,030
Need to take care

190
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,290
The past cannot be solved

191
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,680
But I swears

192
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
I will start from now on

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Do my best to be a good father

194
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,490
Dad welcomes you home anytime

195
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,190
I'll go back

196
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,220
I will visit you often

197
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,170
Are you ok?

198
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,050
Why did you go so long?

199
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,030
Manager, I'm sorry.

200
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,020
I haven't finished the conversation just now.

201
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,450
This is also a working place

202
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,190
You have to fight

203
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,810
This project must be negotiated by tonight

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,050
Manager, I vomited three times

205
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,610
I can't drink anymore

206
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,920
I really don't understand

207
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,290
You followed Chairman Zhang for many years

208
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,110
What did you learn?

209
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,670
I will recommend one more time

210
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,030
Don't try to act like him

211
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,330
Today it is out of date

212
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,710
This chance

213
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,830
Not that anyone has

214
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,500
Mr. Li's team looked at you very well

215
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,810
You drank a drink to make him happy

216
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,420
So it end in one meal of this meal

217
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,640
Otherwise

218
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,720
Definitely had a second meal

219
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,700
Come cheers

220
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,460
This kid is not bad at all

221
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,040
Not bad

222
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,920
This semester, you do not bad at all

223
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,380
I asked the secretary

224
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,120
Your GPA has reached the threshold for transfer Major

225
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,960
Go fill out the form and send it to me

226
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,790
Professor, what day must I return to you?

227
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,900
Must be as soon as possible

228
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,420
Weiwei

229
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,270
Do you think well, that you will transfer Major?

230
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,880
No

231
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,020
Why?

232
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,370
You don't want to transfer Major?

233
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,580
Mai Si Chong is a swimmer

234
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,130
You are his personal physical therapist

235
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,740
Like this, you can follow him everywhere.

236
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,850
So happy, right?

237
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,630
This is my personal physical therapist, Mei Weiwei

238
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,090
And become the best physical therapist in the world

239
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,160
Of course

240
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,290
She is also my most favorite person

241
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,970
Can you stop imagining?

242
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,090
You are not afraid of your electricity

243
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,750
Will someone know it?

244
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,040
Not like that

245
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,400
Are you back?

246
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,260
About transfer Major

247
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,110
Weiwei, actually, I didn't always understand

248
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,740
Now you can go to this major very well. 
Why do you still want to transfer Major?

249
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,120
Or think that our major

250
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,720
Is it too old?

251
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,390
No no no

252
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,020
I have another reason

253
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,940
Mei Wei is in this room right?

254
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Below, someone came to see you

255
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,010
I go see

256
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,370
Auntie, let me go to meet Weiwei

257
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,180
How old are you?

258
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,580
Why does the smell of the liquor are so buzzing?

259
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,000
Can't

260
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,400
It's very late today

261
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,730
Today I must meet Mei Weiwei

262
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,090
Go back and talk later

263
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,910
Go back and talk tomorrow

264
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,690
มีเรื่องอะไรกันคะ

265
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:30,770
Auntie

266
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,340
I'm sorry, he's my friend

267
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,450
So drunk

268
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,760
Now you are students

269
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,840
Can't drink alcohol too much

270
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,420
Sorry

271
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,690
Okay, send him back too

272
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:38,880
Ok

273
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,450
Why are you drinking so much?

274
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,740
Watch out

275
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,090
Are you going to find Sis Wei again?

276
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,700
You guys are too sweet.

277
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,300
In the evening, she doesn't eat enough, so she can get frustrated

278
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,190
Watch out

279
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,680
There are steps, be careful

280
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,410
Why are you drinking so much?

281
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,760
I'm ok

282
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,630
Are there any people in your room?

283
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,870
I will have him pick you up

284
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,650
Are you ok?

285
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,970
Hello, Weiwei

286
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:43,850
Hello

287
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,000
Mai Si Chong

288
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,300
Peng Pai , he's drunk, now I ...

289
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,690
I'll tell you

290
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,820
Weiwei is mine

291
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,430
She's nothing to you

292
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,370
Do you know?

293
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,720
What are you doing?

294
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,190
Take it

295
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,300
This is the key chain that you gave me

296
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:11,900
You keep it

297
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:12,850
Take it back

298
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,690
Ok

299
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,170
I'll take it back

300
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,110
I didn't want you to get it back

301
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,300
I just want you to be by my side

302
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,200
You are so drunk

303
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,300
I'm going to buy you a bottle of water

304
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,090
You obviously like me

305
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:30,880
Why has it changed now?

306
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Why can't we be together?

307
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,500
Weiwei

308
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,090
Only I am honest with you

309
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,040
In Mai Si Chong's heart, it was only a matter of swimming

310
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,520
Let me go

311
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:43,640
Forgot it

312
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,070
Mai Si Chong

313
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,950
Don't come let me see your face again

314
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,430
Just now

315
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,740
Does it hurt to get caught like that?

316
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,400
I'm ok

317
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,980
Mai Si Chong

318
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,740
Are you still angry?

319
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,100
Are you angry me?

320
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,690
I'm angry

321
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,120
but not you

322
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,270
I'm angry that...

323
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,360
Why can't I run faster?

324
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,850
I'm angry that...

325
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,450
Why can't I be by your side all the time?

326
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,250
I'm angry that I'm your boyfriend

327
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,990
But still makes you sad

328
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,550
Weiwei

329
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,840
I will have to go to training camp soon

330
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,480
I hope

331
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,250
You will tell me anything

332
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,760
I will support you fully

333
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,330
Why?

334
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,600
Intend to come to the company. will you come to punch me?

335
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,540
Do not find another reason to deal with Mei Weiwei

336
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,950
Otherwise, I cannot guarantee

337
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,620
For her, I can do anything

338
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,540
You know it

339
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,370
I have many memories with her that you don't know

340
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,900
I didn't come to listen to your nonsense

341
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,650
I just want to tell you that

342
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,810
From now on

343
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,940
Stay away from Mei Weiwei

344
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,280
Did you hear it?

345
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,260
Who determines that I can't like her?

346
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,530
Like?

347
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,450
What does your "like" mean?

348
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,650
You don't have to let juniors like me teach you

349
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,760
Xiao Mai

350
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,930
When you get to the provincial club

351
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,440
You have to be nice

352
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,150
Meeting for the first time, you have to be nice to match with other people

353
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,040
You know?

354
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,170
I know

355
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,100
Then at night

356
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,140
If turn off the light already

357
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,920
Just sleep, don't secretly play your phone

358
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,670
I know

359
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,440
Your mom is planning to let you carry it all over the house

360
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,320
Okay mom, that's enough

361
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,490
This one, I don't want

362
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,620
The college friends saw me all laughed at me

363
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,070
Laugh what?

364
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,890
All right

365
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,620
I gonna go

366
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,920
You don't like eating durian candy, right?

367
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,270
Actually, now I feel that...

368
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,060
It's pretty good

369
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,530
Enough

370
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,230
Go

371
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,630
Go

372
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,490
So, I'm leaving

373
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Safe trip

374
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:27,840
Bye bye

375
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,030
How do you know I'm here?

376
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,340
Innocent that I couldn't hear

377
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,110
Some people are old like this and still eat durian flavored candy

378
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Not too naive?

379
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,230
Just know that you like to eat

380
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,360
You don't like it?

381
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,710
Yeah

382
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,740
Durian candy is this delicious

383
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,140
Let you eat, it so waste things

384
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,210
I gonna eat it

385
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,460
You're so innocent, okay?

386
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,490
I gonna go

387
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,100
Go

388
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,410
Why?

389
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,630
Don't forget to make video calls with me every day

390
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,960
Must be reported every day

391
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:13,460
I know

392
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,130
Eat more

393
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,840
And sleep more

394
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,260
Intend to practice

395
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,970
But, are you going?

396
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,680
All right

397
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,130
Go

398
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,170
Bye bye

399
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,740
Don't worry

400
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,250
I will hurry to come back

401
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,160
So, I'll go

402
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,380

403
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,630
Bye bye

404
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,380
I represent the coach to inform everyone that

405
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
During training sessions

406
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,820
It is necessary to cut off all kinds of communications

407
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,330
Every day after training is finished

408
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,550
We will return the mobile phone

409
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,980
Give you an hour

410
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,230
Go contact

411
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,420
Relatives and girlfriend

412
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,490
The rest

413
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,550
Do not be distracted

414
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,930
Take out the mobile phone

415
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,010
Your cell phone?

416
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,620
I didn't bring a mobile phone here

417
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,460
Did not carry a mobile phone

418
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,980
Take out the mobile phone

419
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,340

00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,430

421
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,880
Everybody

422
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Go back to bed early

423
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,130
Quit line

424
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,650
Are you at the provincial club yet?

425
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,080
How are your teammates?

426
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,410
Is Xia Rui in the same dorm with you?
