2
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,490
Why are you wearing a raincoat?

3
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,260
The weather forecast says it will rain, right?

4
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,240
I just put on

5
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:46,850
So cute

6
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:47,660
Come on

7
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,290
I have something to show you

8
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:52,900
You look

9
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,780
Here I'm prepared

10
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
This one is food and drink

11
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,570
Inside there is a chair

12
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,730
If you're hungry, you can just sit and eat

13
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,610
If you are tired, you can sit

14
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,360
This fishing rod

15
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,780
Here binoculars

16
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
You want to fish, see the stars, all can be

17
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,170
You're scared of the cold, right?

18
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,320
I prepared a thick tent for you

19
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,070
Ok

20
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,400
Just having you is enough

21
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,050
Dad

22
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,530
Mom

23
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,360
Uncle, aunt, hello

24
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,270
You have to be careful about safety

25
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:21,870
Dad, mom, trust me

26
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,320
uncle, auntie, you can trust me

27
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,460
I will take good care of Weiwei

28
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,710
So, mom, dad, we gonna go

29
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:29,710
Go

30
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,340
Get on the car

31
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,280
So we've gone

32
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,540
Bye bye

33
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,260
- Have a safe trip
- ok

34
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,390
Hello, Coach

35
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,710
Si Chong

36
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,120
I called you to discuss future arrangements

37
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,640
Yes

38
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,690
Tomorrow you come back to the team. Have to start practicing immediately

39
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,730
I plan to have you participate in this year's competition

40
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,860
And also

41
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,220
I advise you guys to find a place

42
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,740
Where few people are not crowded

43
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,860
Stay half a year

44
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,370
Tomorrow

45
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,870
We will go to university

46
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,810
Make a break from studying for you

47
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,620
Have you thought how to tell him?

48
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,380
Why does your side have that fizzy noise?

49
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,710
Mai Si Chong, this is the last time I will meet you

50
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,980
Today I came to camp with my girlfriend by the lake

51
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,170
Fine, teenagers

52
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,210
Have a girlfriend

53
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,570
If not because your score is good

54
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,410
I definitely won't let you have a girlfriend

55
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,890
I know, coach

56
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,220
I promise you

57
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,710
It will not affect the practice

58
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,390
You have to work hard next time?

59
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,680
Also, after entering the provincial team

60
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,920
The training would be more rigorous than before

61
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,460
Don't think too much

62
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,360
Today we have a fun trip for a day

63
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,390
Let's go

64
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:17,720
Take a look around

65
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,490
Go

66
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,080
Here there is an alpaca

67
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,230
Can feed them too

68
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,790
Wait, it will spit on you

69
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,040
No, you look

70
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,170
You look

71
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,890
They are cute

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,160
Ok

73
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,330
You come and give them food

74
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,140
Come on

75
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,440
take it

76
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:44,820
Feed them

77
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,970
That's it, right?

78
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:52,770
You...

79
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,480
Electrostatic

80
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,350
I just caught my hair

81
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,760
Weiwei

82
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,960
Your Pikachu name is this not really set to play

83
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,420
Static electricity is stronger than anyone else

84
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,750
But this time you were not careful

85
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,170
Fortunately it is me

86
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,230
If it's someone else ...

87
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,960
I'll go

88
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,890
Look at the peacock

89
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:56,950
Why?

90
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,570
Nothing

91
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,000
Just now, my hand was touched a little dirty thing on the floor

92
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,170
Sit here

93
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,210
Actually

94
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,580
Sometimes I'm jealous of you

95
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,540
What are you jealous of?

96
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,840
When you were 19 years old

97
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,030
You met people like me

98
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,970
I'm too lazy to argue with you

99
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,180
So

100
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,170
If at that time I didn't shock you

101
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,610
Are you still going to like me?

102
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,560
I really thought that after you shock me

103
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,500
I was seduced by you

104
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,750
But...

105
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,400
If wanna say it ...

106
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,090
It's not

107
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,520
Do you remembers...

108
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,580
when we orientation before the school starts

109
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,280
the first time we meet?

110
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,280
Yes

111
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,550
At that time I thought

112
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,970
This girl

113
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,150
Why are there so many problems?

114
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,740
But still interesting

115
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,700
So that I could get close to you

116
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,220
So that's the reason for you to shock me

117
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,850
Who would have thought

118
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,290
A college star like me

119
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,460
Must

120
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,460
It will take a lot of effort to flirt with you

121
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,460
Are you sorry?

122
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,290
I, Mai Si Chong, what I've done, I never regret

123
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,850
I like you

124
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,680
I have never regretted it

125
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,060
Why don't you cover up with a cloth?

126
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,460
If you are still cold

127
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,560
There is a duvet on the car

128
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,370
I'll go and take it

129
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,990
Like this is better now

130
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,640
Why?

131
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:50,860
Can't sleep?

132
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,130
A little bit

133
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,170
Do you have something in your heart?

134
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,250
Mai Si Chong

135
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:04,890
Thank you

136
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,570
Thank you for what?

137
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,150
You will be a Pikachu that I will always protect

138
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,600
I like you

139
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,640
Let's sleep

140
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,340
So I'll go back

141
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,000
Otherwise, I can't catch the provincial team car in time

142
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:50,610
What's matter?

143
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,390
Do you start to miss me now?

144
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,760
Championship at the end of next month

145
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,780
If you...

146
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,060
Can't book tickets, you don't have to come

147
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,790
No

148
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,850
I'll go

149
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,190
That's great

150
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,320
Let's go

151
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,990
So, I'm leaving

152
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,350
Bye bye

153
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,610
Have a safe trip

154
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,570
Mai Si Chong

155
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:26,820
Bye bye

156
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:27,920
Bye bye

157
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,930
Most likely

158
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,840
We don't always want to say goodbye

159
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,750
Because I didn't know that leaving will meet again

160
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,990
Or never meet again

161
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,470
Almost starting to practice

162
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,480
Didn't see you

163
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,800
Can only look at things from you

164
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,420
My pikachu

165
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:33,860
It's time now

166
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,600
Give me mobile phone

167
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,730
Brother

168
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,920
Can I have another phone call?

169
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,660
No

170
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,040
This is the coach's rule

171
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,030
I don't know what to do either

172
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,620
Give me

173
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
One more minute

174
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,230
One minute

175
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,660
Still calling

176
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,910
Chong

177
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,340
Long time no see

178
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,130
Where's Weiwei?

179
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,090
There is a something at her home. So she can't come

180
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,900
But she left me to tell you that

181
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,500
Fighting

182
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,430
Don't let her down

183
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,710
Chong

184
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,160
The competition will start and let's go

185
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:32,780
Let's go

186
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,400
Go

187
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,660
Only contestants who score better and are excellent

188
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,730
On the seventh track, the contestants from Nanti, Mai Si Chong were leading

189
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,580
See, there is no concern with the results of this competition at all

190
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,760
Congratulations to the contestants from Nanti University

191
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,490
Mai Si Chong won the 1st place

192
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,960
This is the seventh time champion of his career

193
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,300
Bless him to keep his champion

194
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,740
Expected that the future he will become a young shark of our China

195
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,360
Mom

196
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,340
Until they closed the field for a long time

197
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,500
Just came out

198
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,570
Going back home or not?

199
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,480
Of course, I have to go home

200
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,100
But

201
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,510
Before going home, can you send me one place first?

202
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,760
Ok, I'll send you

203
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,870
What is the benefit of raising a son?

204
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,190
To keep practicing for a long time

205
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,520
For months not coming home

206
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,600
Just came out, just thought only your girlfriend first

207
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,720
Do like a married son

208
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,190
Mom

209
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,020
I haven't seen Weiwei in a long time

210
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,810
The provincial team is practicing very rigorously

211
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,820
Mobile cannot carry

212
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,880
Call her, not answer

213
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,810
So, can't I?

214
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,300
Okay, so let's hurry

215
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,050
Put things in the trunk of the car

216
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,300
Hurry up

217
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,490
Weiwei

218
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,820
Hello

219
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,230
The number you have called cannot be contacted ...

220
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,390
Mom

221
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,380
She turned off

222
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,170
Power off

223
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,150
Is it possible that

224
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,100
Do not want to make you uncomfortable

225
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,290
No

226
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,980
It's true

227
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,090
This has even closed the shop and moved out

228
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,930
Could it be that what will happen?

229
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,000
Mom, take it

230
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,630
You drive, I'm back by myself

231
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,350
Be careful

232
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,980
Chong, are you back?

233
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,860
What's happen with Mei Weiwei?

234
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,010
Say quickly

235
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,230
Sis Wei, she...

236
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,670
What's going on?

237
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,530
Where's she?

238
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,770
I don't know either

239
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,250
I really don't know

240
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,650
She moved with her parents, even me she didn't tell

241
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,750
I'm worried about her too

242
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,870
This's her message

243
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,430
The last WeChat sent to me before she leave

244
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,050
Let me pay attention to your mood

245
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,120
What did you tell him?

246
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,740
Nothing, I just...

247
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,790
Actually Weiwei

248
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,670
Before you go to the provincial team, she had a problem

249
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
She doesn't usually say anything

250
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,160
Always to keep it alone

251
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
Before departure

252
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,670
Send WeChat to say goodbye to me only

253
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,390
And also

254
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,060
tell Mai Si Chong

255
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,310
Don't find me

256
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Please tell me 

257
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,280
She's come here again, right?

258
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,100
Yes

259
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,060
But I don't know where they live

260
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,950
So

261
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,100
Doctor, can you contact her for me?

262
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,230
I had to find her

263
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,400
Two days ago they were

264
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,410
came here

265
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,170
You look

266
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,360
This is the flower that they brought

267
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,090
They will not have to come again during this period

268
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,810
So you come to me here

269
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,560
Just doesn't help

270
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,030
right?

271
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,770
Actually Weiwei

272
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,340
Before you go to the provincial team

273
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,530
She had a problem

274
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,310
Why are you wearing a raincoat today?

275
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,400
Electrostatic

276
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,550
I just touch my hair

277
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,120
Weiwei

278
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,230
Your Pikachu name is this, not really set to play

279
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,390
Static electricity is stronger than anyone else

280
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:29,890
Mai Si Chong

281
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:34,980
Bye bye

282
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,160
Today, I went to my aunt's house at Nanxiao Road

283
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,140
Aunt's flower shop will be closed soon

284
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:17,730
A bit sad

285
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,970
This is the flower that they sent

286
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,050
Weiwei

287
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,920
Look, these flowers are beginning to bloom

288
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:03,970
Yes

289
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,340
During this flowering period, there is a very good quality

290
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,670
Just a few orders left to be sent

291
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,640
Are you ok?

292
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,780
Dad, mom, trust me

293
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,010
Mei Weiwei, open the door

294
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,040
I don't want to meet you

295
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,810
You hurry back

296
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,370
Not open, right?

297
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,500
Don't open, so I'll break the door

298
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,040
You haven't gone yet I'm going to shock you

299
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,710
Ok

300
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,570
However, it wasn't the first time you shock me

301
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,420
I don't like you anymore

302
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,230
You know only the provincial swimming team

303
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,200
When I can't control electricity, where are you?

304
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,950
Sorry

305
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,480
There's no reason to apologize

306
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,530
Mai Si Chong, do you know that?

307
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,630
To make you feel good I could only walk from quietly

308
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,990
Even though I don't want to

309
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,030
I can never be with my boyfriend

310
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,120
Do you understand?

311
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,620
Mai Si Chong

312
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,620
Let's break up

313
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,870
Not in a hurry yet

314
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,630
Peipei Coach

315
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,810
Mai Si Chong

316
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,090
Where did you go? The provincial team is busy looking for each other

317
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,150
Now they call me to follow you

318
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,670
You guys still have to go back to training in advance, don't you?

319
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,040
Initially, you already have a history

320
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,850
Now you're still late. Who can Help You?

321
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,250
They were all set out

322
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,580
You hurry and come right now

323
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,880
Hurry and call the taxi back

324
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,040
I know, Coach Pei Pei

325
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,430
I was wrong

326
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,330
That makes the coach worry

327
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,030
You...

328
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,150
Weiwei

329
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,190
Do you remember that...

330
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,490
at the resort that night?

331
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,790
At that time you said to me

332
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,120
No matter how imperfect I am

333
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,880
You can accept

334
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,840
Endure

335
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,930
I know

336
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,780
Now, I...

337
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,560
There are still many drawbacks

338
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,220
But I want you to be sure

339
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,020
From now on, just ask if you want me

340
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,080
I will definitely be by your side

341
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,930
But my body

342
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,990
The doctor said that he didn't even know how to treat it

343
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,590
We could never be together

344
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,510
I'm like a time bomb

345
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,610
Just I was bad enough

346
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,320
I don't want you to be unlucky with me

347
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,860
You still have your life

348
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,160
If

349
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,830
My electricity can't control

350
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,970
If one day I shock you, what will you do?

351
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,130
And if...

352
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,780
My electricity will never go away, what to do?

353
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,000
No if

354
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,900
3 years later

355
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,980
Okay, all students

356
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,580
This is what we will be talking about in class today

357
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,070
Next, we open the textbook to page 82

358
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,750
Excuse me, is there Mr.Lin?

359
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,410
Your food

360
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
Everyone, look at an example first

361
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,170
Yes teacher

362
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,050
How did you come?

363
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,130
Bring you something

364
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,770
No sugar, adding a little milk

365
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:31,920
Thank you

366
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,500
Is this Mai Si Chong?

367
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,180
Mai Si Chong

368
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,580
I would like to ask you one question

369
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,730
After all, what's the thing that you want to do the most?

370
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,910
What I want to do the most?

371
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,950
Get married

372
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,980
I heard that you and your girlfriend have been in a very good relationship for many years

373
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,640
I wish you a smooth marriage

374
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,800
Of course

375
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,990
I have never failed anyway

376
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,730
Okay, thank you for letting us interview

377
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,550
This is our interview today

378
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,680
I'm, Li Dai Xi, report

379
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,470
You can take the equipment to collect first

380
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,060
What are you doing?

381
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,310
I gave you the first special interview

382
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,110
You do this to me?

383
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,560
You changed the interview for no reason

384
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,800
Weiwei doesn't want to be public

385
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,860
She doesn't want, but me want

386
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,320
Can't you see? How many women do in college like me?

387
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,680
Here I am protecting her. Did you know?

388
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,600
Ok

389
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,730
More tired than me

390
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,640
A good way, you should to prepare gifts for the bridesmaid

391
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,620

00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,620
Don't forget to give her

394
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,520
What's this?

395
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,740
This is not about you, just give her

396
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,930

399
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,740

401
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,380
Dai Xi

402
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,620
Err...

403
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,840
Today the parents of the children come to pick up late

404
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,100
Me as a coach, can't go first

405
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
Don't be angry

406
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,160

407
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,410

408
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,270

00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,480
Ok

417
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,080
Don't

418
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,800
Don't move

419
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,210
Chong

420
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,070

421
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,090
Bye bye

422

423
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,510
Hurry

424
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,410
Mai Si Chong

425
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,490
Long time no see

426
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,040
How are you doing?

427
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,990
Long time no see

428
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,600
First, today will come to see you compete

429
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,430
But at the university, there was no lecture class

430
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,210
How are you?

431
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,790
Same as before

432
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,650
Still No. 1

433
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,100
I forgot to tell you, now I ...

434
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,800
Study doctor already

435
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,260
So you have to be a student for a long time?

436
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,760
Err...

437
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,780
Jun Jun, she didn't come to watch you?

438
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,340
Why?

439
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,710
Didn't you contact her?

440
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,390
Jun Jun must inherit business at home

441
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,050
Busy work, no time to watch me compete

442
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,410
Mobile phone

443
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,390
Why?

444
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
I'll go to Weiwei, so excuse me

445
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,350
Hello

446
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,450
Hello

447
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,990
I'm Xia Rui

448
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,680
Treasure map

449
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,200
In front of Nan Thi University

450
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,200
Why did you invite me here?

451
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,410
You don't have to ask

452
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,810
I will guide you, you just follow me

453
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,120
Ok

454
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,270
This place is very beautiful

455
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,250
Don't change the subject

456
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,060
You don't even ask what is the result of my competition?

457
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,120
I have class to study

458
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,000
And also

459
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,330
Anyway, you can get No. 1 already, not in another rank

460
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,270
Because I'm too perfect, so you wasn't worried at all

461
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,250
How is the thesis repair exam?

462
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,540
Get 1st

463
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,810
So finally my physiotherapy specialist gonna graduate soon. I hung up

464
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,580
Please eat me

465
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,270
See you in Hai Yu

466
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,180
Real little boy

467
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,020
Mai Si Chong

468
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,920
You...

469
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,580
Is this that you prepared while in the water?

470
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,720
Open it

471
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,130
I know

472
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
You saw this one

473
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,810
May think it suddenly

474
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,280
But when I think about it

475
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,920
I have decided to do a lot of things

476
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:43,970
I think

477
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,880
The most correct

478
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,920
is that I chose you

479
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,420
I thought it countless times

480
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,500
Now it might be too soon

481
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,100
Or suddenly

482
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,740
But I think...

483
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,650
As long as I have you by my side

484
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,690
I always choose you

485
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,530
If you feel that too fast

486
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,020
It's okay

487
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,660
Whether 1 year

488
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,600
3 years

489
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,110
or 10 years

490
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,130
I will wait for you forever

491
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,700
Will I have to wait that long?

492
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,010
Mai Si Chong

493
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,650
I say "yes"

494
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,200
This life

495
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,170
Only yours

496
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,740
Pikachu

497
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,680
Happy Ending

498
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:35,540
