1
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,080
It's time to perform plan B

2
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,577
Help!

3
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,933
I don't believe anyone could drown in such a shallow pool

4
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:09,510
Mei Weiwei

5
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,920
What have you done to me!

6
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,480
I bought all the throat medicine in the market

7
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,600
You can have a try

8
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,840
I still sounds funny!

9
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,240
Are you done?

10
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,200
I can't breath!

11
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,800
What did you do last night?

12
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
What have you done to your throat?

13
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,840
I was kissed by Mei Weiwei last night

14
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:06,777
Mei Weiwei!

15
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,840
What have you done to my throat?

16
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
 
What have you done to my throat?

17
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:01,755
What have you done to my throat?

18
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:01,800
Just make me normal
What have you done to my throat?

19
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,680
Just make me normal

20
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,280
Are you stressed out recently?

21
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,400
Don't take it out on me

22
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,560
I am not...

23
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,000
I am not angry, I just want to be normal

24
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,560
Stop laughing

25
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,840
I am telling you

26
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,880
You are the one who get best of things

27
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,920
You have to be responsible...

28
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,200
Alright

29
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,480
I will be responsible to you

30
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,640
From now on, you follow me around

31
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,480
I will take care of everything

32
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
But, don't talk to me again

33
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,488
Maybe this is helpful

34
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:12,320
Why are you following me

35
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,320
I am here to buy groceries

36
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,560
Wow, you are so special

37
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:31,200
Shot! He must assume I am a lady 

38
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
who needs a razor!

39
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,240
So embarrassed

40
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,120
Okay

41
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,080
Let's move on to chapter 2

42
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,920
the sports industry structure

43
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,400
First of all, you need to know a concept

44
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,280
Interpreted literally

45
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,000
the industrial structure 

46
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,880
can be interpreted 

47
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,120
as the problem of corporate relationships within a certain industry

48
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,120
but also as the relationship structure 

49
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,680
between various industries

50
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,120
In the 1970s

51
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,400
I attended to sit in the first row

52
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,600
to give a good impression on Ms.Meiling

53
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,280
You want the first row? I can go...

54
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,800
Since you seem to be a little sleepy

55
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,311
Don't let anyone notice we are sitting together

56
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:11,800
-Or things will go wrong -I would like to call the roll

57
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,400
Stop talking to me

58
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Zhang Yuxin

59
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:18,244
Mei Weiwei

60
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:20,355
Mei Weiwei

61
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:22,555
Here

62
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,720
Since you are so curious

63
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
and this is a theory lesson

64
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,720
the homework would be a presentation

65
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,240
You rehabilitation class could do first

66
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,520
and you would be the team leader

67
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:38,266
Sit 

68
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,360
Are your brains clear now?

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,760
Let's continue

70
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,160
Some economists in Japan...

71
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,960
Why are you keeping your head low?

72
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,022
You said you wouldn't want people to see us together

73
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,600
You and me are not a couple!

74
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,200
Sooner or later

75
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:04,600
Anyway

76
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,840
Things are much more complicated than you think

77
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,000
I can never imagine taking class with you

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,720
Can we have lunch together?

79
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,160
Can I have your number?

80
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
Can I?

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
I want your number too

82
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,640
You can have my number first

83
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,280
Then I will form a group

84
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,400
You and him will all be in there

85
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Here is my number

86
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:25,844
Take me to lunch!

87
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,400
Ms.Meiling is calling us

88
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,840
We need to go now

89
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,022
-Let's go -Okay

90
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Sit there

91
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,800
You guys are here

92
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,840
Weiwei

93
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,760
When will Sichogn be normal again?

94
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,880
Maybe tomorrow

95
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,880
You..

96
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,466
Will you be uncomfortable of eating so much?

97
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
What do you want?

98
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,480
Weiwei's electricity shocked me so hard

99
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,760
-Daixi -I don't want to talk to you now

100
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,488
Daixi

101
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:47,444
What happened to them

102
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,520
No idea

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,240
Give me a chicken leg

104
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,160
I am starving

105
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,720
You sounds normal now!

106
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,711
How come?

107
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,440
Really

108
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
I need to tell Weiwei the good news

109
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,080
Wait a second

110
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,320
Weiwei is having a cold war with you

111
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,680
You tell her now

112
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,480
She won't speak to you any more

113
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,080
That makes sense

114
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,720
Daixi is really angry with me 

115
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,520
Peng Yan?

116
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,920
Are you available now?

117
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,533
We need to talk

118
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,800
Sorry but I am busy now

119
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,177
Maybe next time

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,600
Don't turn around

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,200
How is it going 

122
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
Do you like the life here?

123
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,680
You freshmen have so many classes

124
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,480
I have been here for two months

125
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,720
Oh! I forgot

126
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,320
I have been so busy in my internship

127
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,560
outside the campus

128
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
Actually in high school,  I was thinking if there is a possibility

129
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,160
that you will choose South China Sports University

130
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,760
and become a  track athlete

131
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,160
I don't do track any more

132
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,680
-Is it because of me? -Peng Yan

133
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,840
Can we stop mentioning the high school stuff?

134
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,240
Fine

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,640
Right

136
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,120
What are you majoring in now?

137
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,240
Rrehabilitation

138
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,200
My first thought is the sports economy but I am 1 point short

139
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,080
and I am considering switching majors

140
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,320
Switch to my major?

141
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,160
Why are you study here?

142
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,840
I heard you have gone aboard

143
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,480
and you changed your name

144
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,760
Remember the no high school stuff rule?

145
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,680
Let's not break it

146
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,680
Right

147
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,480
There is a meeting of seniors

148
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,520
I know a guy who had switched majors

149
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,240
You can talk to him

150
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,600
I don't think I can make it

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
I have other stuff 

152
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,480
You still don't want to get close to me

153
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,111
Can I at least have your number?

154
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,280
Text me anytime you are in trouble

155
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,200
Daixi

156
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,720
I will move

157
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,240
You don't treat me as your friend

158
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,760
I can explain

159
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,000
Explain?

160
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,800
Are we really friends?

161
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,720
First, you lied to me, that's fine

162
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,440
If I didn't see you guys together today

163
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
You are going to hide it from me forever?

164
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,360
Or, you also fall in love with Mai Sichong?

165
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,640
You can totally tell me 

166
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,400
if you like him

167
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,488
I would give in without another word

168
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:02,440
I wouldn't fall in love with Mai Sichong unless I am mad

169
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,560
Fine

170
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
You have your Peng Yan in your hands

171
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,440
Why not cast a spell on him?

172
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,760
Then you have two!

173
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,400
Am I being mean?

174
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,360
That must sound harsh

175
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I am leaving

176
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,760
Such an idiot

177
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
Weiwei, I know you are in the dormitory

178
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,960
I would shout out loud

179
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,680
if you don't come downstairs

180
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,520
Mai Sichong

181
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,280
Can't you leave me alone?

182
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,960
Why don't you go training?

183
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,200
You can't leave me alone

184
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,920
You said

185
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
You will take care of me today

186
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:21,888
Hello monitor

187
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,440
It's rare to see you in the library

188
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,880
About that presentation

189
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,240
I can help you

190
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,600
Are there ways to get extra points?

191
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,800
Extra points?

192
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,160
Give me a minute

193
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:47,950
Starting a club!

194
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,400
I am thinking of starting a massage club

195
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,733
But I need at least 10 members

196
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,240
If you join me

197
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,440
That would be wonderful

198
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,000
How many members do you have

199
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,880
including me

200
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,920
Two

201
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,280
Fine

202
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,680
I am in

203
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
We would be the founders

204
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,120
to gain the extra points

205
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,570
Let's go for some surveys

206
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,933
Now?

207
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,480
Slow down

208
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:52,266
What are you doing!

209
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:53,622
I can't stand you and him being together

210
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,600
Your voice!

211
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,000
You lied to me

212
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,520
Wow, I am normal!

213
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,600
Come on

214
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,400
You said you need to do survey

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's none of your business

216
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
You are my girl...

217
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
my...

218
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,680
girlfriend

219
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
I need to take care of you

220
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,800
Fine

221
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,280
Give me some minutes to go through everything

222
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,880
You don't need to! Just follow me

223
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,320
Let's go

224
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,520
Wait

225
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,844
Let's do this

226
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,960
Excuse me, if there is a massage club

227
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,400
Are you interested joining in?

228
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,720
You are? Good!

229
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,644
Excuse me?

230
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:27,555
Can I ask you some questions?

231
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,840
-Sure -Thank you

232
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,880
Excuse me

233
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,200
Would you mind doing me a favor?

234
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,520
Okay let's talk

235
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,640
You can tell me everything

236
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,800
Mai Sichong

237
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,480
I am thinking of

238
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,320
separating for couple days

239
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,560
You go back to your life

240
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,040
and then we could hang out again

241
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,880
Is it a no to me?

242
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,400
What do you mean?

243
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,440
Think twice

244
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,240
Your feeling about me is such a sudden

245
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,680
What do you like me about?

246
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,440
Maybe when you wake up tomorrow morning

247
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,640
You will regret liking me

248
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,680
and think you are crazy

249
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,360
Right?

250
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,879
No!

251
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,480
I really mean it

252
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,280
This is all my fault

253
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,160
What happened?

254
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,244
Is there anything borher you?

255
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,640
I told her how I feel but she blew me off

256
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,480
Who? Mei Weiwei?

257
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,440
You have told her?

258
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,680
And she turned you down?

259
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,822
Correct

260
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:59,266
That's not possible

261
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,200
Did she not understand what you mean?

262
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,422
Maybe

263
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:06,466
She turned you down because you have never been in a relationship before

264
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,840
Have you been in love before?

265
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Of course

266
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,600
I admit that you are genius in swimming

267
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,644
But when it comes to the love part
I admit that you are genius in swimming

268
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:16,066
But when it comes to the love part

269
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,280
I am the only genius

270
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,760
You are too staight

271
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,560
Girls wouldn't respond to you even in games

272
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,240
You are nothing but a pretty face

273
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,920
You gotta a lot to learn!

274
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,760
Girls need flowers, music and ceremony!

275
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,120
You have to create an atmosphere

276
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,760
Done!

277
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,360
Is she able to find Avatar Square

278
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,160
according to this picture?

279
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,280
You have found it 

280
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,360
The only reason 

281
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,288
that I can locate this place is because I am with you

282
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,000
What's the plan?

283
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,800
If she said yes

284
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,880
We need to go on a date 

285
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,880
and I will drive her

286
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,800
I am thinking of 

287
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,733
decorating the car with roses

288
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:09,133
You don't even have a complete plan

289
00:19:26,222 --> 00:19:27,555
Meet me here

290
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,720
I have something to tell you

291
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,960
What's this all about

292
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,440
What's this

293
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:53,511
Cheers

294
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:56,400
Cheers

295
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,240
Peng Pai

296
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,320
Are you not going to introduce that girl to me?

297
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,560
Which girl? Can I meet her?

298
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,880
She is very important to Peng Pai

299
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,120
You better be kidding

300
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,040
Is she your girlfriend?

301
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,000
Look at his face!

302
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:17,711
Cool

303
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,160
Peng Yan?

304
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,760
-Are you having dinner here? -Yes

305
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,533
Since you have been here, why not join us 

306
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,480
Thank you but I am good

307
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,533
I insist

308
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,200
I can introduce you to my classmate

309
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,266
who had switched majors
I can introduce you to my classmate

310
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:37,644
who had switched majors

311
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,440
Let's go 

312
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,280
Trust me

313
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,160
Excuse me

314
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,120
This is Mei Weiwei

315
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,000
Nice to meet you

316
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
This is the one I told you before

317
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,040
You can call her Qiaoqiao

318
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,440
-Nice to meet you -Hello

319
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,844
Sit here, please

320
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,640
Let's sit

321
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,680
Thank you

322
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,720
Let's drink

323
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,160
Peng Pai told me that

324
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,120
you want to switch majors?

325
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,040
Yes

326
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:14,822
My point is

327
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:17,222
Switching majors is to better achieve your life goals

328
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,600
not to hide from things

329
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,760
I know

330
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,960
Thanks for noticing

331
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,840
May I know the specific reason 

332
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,480
why you want to do this?

333
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,360
Is it because Peng Pai?

334
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,000
No no no

335
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,760
I am not in a relationship

336
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,920
with Peng Pai

337
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,160
Don't freak out, I am just kidding

338
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,200
But Peng Pai 

339
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,400
always mention you 

340
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,560
Sichong

341
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,880
There is a notice

342
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,160
saying that there will be a power failure

343
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,120
End of the plan

344
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Has Weiwei picked your phone yet?

345
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,600
Peng Pai's resume

346
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,960
is better than some experienced people

347
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Sichong!

348
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Mei Weiwei

349
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,880
Don't do stupid things!

350
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,440
Weiwei, listen to me

351
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,280
Peng Pai is my friend, he is perfect

352
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,200
These four years

353
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,680
I still can't figure out what he wants

354
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,688
He sometime is like a fake people

355
00:22:58,222 --> 00:22:59,933
He drank too much

356
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:01,930
I am sober!

357
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,080
I have a question for you Weiwei

358
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,400
-Enough -Mei Weiwei

359
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,920
Why you stood me up?

360
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,640
I didn't

361
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,840
Leave her alone!

362
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,440
It's none of your business

363
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,280
Let's go!

364
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,280
I am so sorry about this

365
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,280
Are you Okay?

366
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Mai Sichong

367
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,440
What are you doing?

368
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,240
This is for you

369
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,880
A shabby car?

370
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,360
What about now?

371
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,600
Am I clear enough?

372
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:24,311
Can you please listen to me?

373
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:25,111
I am enough with waiting

374
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,320
and doing nothing

375
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
I have been thinking this for a long time

376
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,680
For no reason

377
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:40,555
I just can't stop thinking about you

378
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,560
All I ask for is an answer

379
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,680
Can you accept me?
