And sleep more

7
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,100
Intend to practice

8
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,850
I know

9
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,630

11
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,390
Hello

12
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,210
What are you doing?

13
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,300
I'm reviewing the content, in a cafe.

14
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,690
Ok

15
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,870

16
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,440
I'm watching you

17
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,170
Don't be distracted

18
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,920
Read books

19
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,960

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Me and you, let's compete

21
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,220
Look, who can pack more?

22
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,850
Don't have to listen to dad ,you just eat

23
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,000
He has been wrapped for many years. Don't care about him

24
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,260
Hello

25
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:09,970
Express parcel

26
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,360
Let me do

27
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,520
Hello

28
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,250
Finally, you answer the call. I'm so worried

29
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,130
Just a moment ago, I was talking to Mai Si Chong

30
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,970
Are you ok?

31
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,640
Forgot it

32
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:40,610
Weiwei

33
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,010
I...

34
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Will confess my love to Ding Yi

35
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,570
I...

36
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,260
Mai Si Chong came to see, I hung up first

37
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,800
Hello

38
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:46,950
Hello

39
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
See a boyfriend better than a friend

40
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,950
The movie will begin soon. What are you doing?

41
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:05,770
Go

42
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,290

43
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,160

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,260
This give you

45
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,090
What do you mean?

46
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,590
It's mean...

47
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,630
What else can it mean?

48
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,240
It means that I like you

49
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,280
Dai Xi

50
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,230
You...

51
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,970
You like me?

52
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,220
Yes, so stupid

53
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,280
So...

54
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,000
Are you my girlfriend right now?

55
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,180
Foolish

56
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,240
Go

57
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,520
What the hell are you smiling at?

58
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,940
Today, I went to my aunt's house at Nanxiao Road

59
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,870
Aunt's flower shop will be closed for business

60
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,710
A little sad

61
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,100
If you like flower shops, wait for me to retire

62
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,220
Let's open a shop together

63
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,740
Hello Dai Xi

64
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,020
Weiwei, please come out

65
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,270
Ok

66
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Where are you? I'll come to you

67
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,850
University Coffee Shop

68
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:50,650
Don't be late

69
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,510
Well, you wait for me awhile

70
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,450
Well done

71
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,700
For virtue

72
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,230
Let's go

73
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,710
But I really don't know

74
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,340
Are you falling in love with me or Mai Si Chong?

75
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,680
About him, why do you have to be so dedicated?

76
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,230
Besides you

77
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,630
Who will be in my eyes?

78
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,450
You know that well

79
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,190
But

80
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,400
When will you tell everyone?

81
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,890
That we are dating

82
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,130
I think...

83
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,370
Wait for Chong bro to come back first

84
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,050
You look right now, Sis Wei alone

85
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:25,740
Like that

86
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,640
You make her endure

87
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,090
look at us, we are so sweet

88
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,080
right?

89
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,190
ok

90
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,890
Then you told Mai Si Chong that we had done it

91
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,120
Ok

92
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:42,810
Let's go

93
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,420
Surprise

94
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,950
You shocked me to death

95
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,780
How is it?

96
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,430
Bro Chong called us several lines

97
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,530
Let me prepare to surprise you

98
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,490
Are you happy?

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,050
When did you guys prepare? I don't know

100
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,810
Brother Chong is very busy so he can't come back

101
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,560
The two of you are really a fateful couple

102
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,250
What are you talking about?

103
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,870
Thank you

104
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,010
What are you doing?

105
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,230
All right, sis Wei

106
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,900
Brother Chong left me to tell you that

107
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,030
Next time

108
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,770
It is a tricycle that carries flowers

109
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,550
There is nothing more romantic than this

110
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,140
I hope you like this time

111
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,030
Like it

112
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,820
Like it very much

113
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,020
Sis Wei

114
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,030
This is the last surprise that Chong prepared for her

115
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,430
He say...

116
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,290
You like these things

117
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,260
Let's light up the fireworks

118
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,660
Thank you

119
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,440
This one I prepared for you

120
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:43,970
Imitate someone else

121
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,680
Don't you keep saying the idioms?

122
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,530
At first, this was my idea

123
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,610
In the end, Chong just stole my idea

124
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,520
Hope that the Mai Si Chong

125
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,360
Will be able to join the province team smoothly

126
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,280
Hope you all are smooth

127
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
May everyone be healthy and happy

128
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,950
healthy and happy

129
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:03,420
Oh yeah

130
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,230
I can take a picture of painting for you guys

131
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,050
Light draw

132
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,630
Come on, the two of you are standing together

133
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,410
Ready

134
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,060
Go

135
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,360
Let's do together

136
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:13,870
Come on

137
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,940
The practice is almost over

138
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,570
Are you ready to compete with me again?

139
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,270
No need

140
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,140
However, you win

141
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,610
You can't think that way

142
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,550
Mai Si Chong

143
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,700
Coach lets you go to his office

144
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,150
Coach

145
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,640
Okay, so I'll go first

146
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,050
Finally I finished the English exam

147
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,870
But there are still several days left until the exam week

148
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,300
Let's going to travel together

149
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,290
You guys go

150
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,850
I'm not feeling well

151
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,120
I go back to the dormitory to sleep

152
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,890
Weiwei, you can tell us what you have

153
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,970
Take care of yourself

154
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,690
Sis Wei

155
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,850
Finally you came

156
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,000
Li Tai Xi, she hurt me

157
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,190
Ding Yi, why are you here?

158
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,770
Her journal, finish exam already

159
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,120
Let me help you move

160
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,350
Are you ok?

161
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,530
I'm ok

162
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,230
Why?

163
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,540
Nothing

164
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,690
Not careful, electrostatic shock

165
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,370
Ding yi

166
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,480
Can you help me...

167
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,070
Finished packing, wait for me outside

168
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,220
Your electricity when you have a cold, fever

169
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,630
Began to be unstable

170
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,040
Are you really okay?

171
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,690
Otherwise let me take care of you?

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,670
I'm ok

173
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,640
Just rest a little bit, it's gonna better

174
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,600
You can go back first

175
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:07,510
Ok

176
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,160
So

177
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,290
If anything, call me

178
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,860
Ok

179
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,470
Just go

180
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:10,850
Bye bye

181
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,690
บ้ายบาย

182
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,840
Hello Ding Yi

183
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,480
Chong

184
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,250
What do you think, call me?

185
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
You don't have to say anymore

186
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,480
Mei Weiwei, what's going on?

187
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,480
Why isn't she answering my phone?

188
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,090
You see your girlfriend better than friend

189
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,510
All right

190
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,010
I'll help you ask Dai Xi for you

191
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,300
Ok

192
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,210
So you ask and tell me hurry

Give phone back

195
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,880
Why did the lights suddenly go out?

196
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,100
That' is, why the lights go out?

197
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
Weiwei, are you ok?

198
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,390
Your hand, what happen?

199
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,480
Lift me up

200
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,690
Do you want to go to the hospital?

201
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,620
It's ok

202
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
A little hurt

203
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
ทำแผลหน่อยก็ดีขึ้น

204
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:29,850
Thank you, Yu Xin

205
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,970
I broke up with my girlfriend last night again. Really frustrating

206
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,090
Many days, I can't contact Weiwei

207
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,890
What will happen?

208
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,850
You want to contact Weiwei?

209
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,470
Auntie

210
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,910
Can I borrow a mobile phone?

211
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,010
Thank you

212
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Sis Wei, she's sick

213
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,400
Hello Jun Jun

214
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,490
How is Weiwei?

215
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,880
She seems to have a fever

216
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,440
Now resting

217
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,730
I will go back now

218
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,220
But today it's much better

219
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,690
You trust me

220
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,660
We will take good care of her

221
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,440
So, Jun Jun

222
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,080
Bother you, buy her the medicine

223
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
I'll go right now

224
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,230
Thank you

225
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,030
JunJun

226
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,160
Sorry

227
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,150
Wake you up

228
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,860
I bought you some porridge with eggs and lean meat

229
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,030
Do you want to eat?

230
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,480
Thank you JunJun

231
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,120
Actually

232
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,930
This is...

233
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,980
And this medicine

234
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,100
All of these

235
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,910
Mai Si Chong called and told me to buy it

236
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,800
Thank you JunJun

237
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,860
Actually

238
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,990
We have known each other for a long time

239
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,220
This is the first time we are apart

240
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,490
He said

241
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,110
He's always calling you

242
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,450
But like your mobile phone will be suppressed

243
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,010
So he can't contact you

244
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,110
I forgot it

245
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,080
He should be practicing

246
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,950
Wait until finished, probably call you back

247
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,480
Hurry and eat

248
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,490
กินเสร็จแล้ว

249
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,950
Let's open a random box

250
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,160
Ok

251
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,390
Thank you JunJun

252
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,330
Director

253
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,780
Xiao Mai, sit down

254
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:02,680
Xiao Mai

255
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,870
Now, some people report that you use stimulants

256
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,410
To quell the injury

257
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,980
So you got 1

258
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,650
Until you can get into practice

259
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,270
I want to hear from you first

260
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,860
Director

261
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,660
What didn't do is not doing

262
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,550
The training results, you can see

263
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,930
I swim and set my own records

264
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,590
But according to the report

265
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,640
Before, you actually had an injury

266
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,960
My injuries before, does not effect to now

267
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,770
All rehabilitation doctors can testify for me

268
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,990
I continued treatment throughout the year

269
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,340
Because before this I had an injury

270
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,410
Therefore need to be more dedicated to get into the province team

271
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,720
But because I can't hide my physical condition

272
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,440
So others took it as an excuse to accuse me?

273
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,190
You trust me

274
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,340
Staff coach team will not be quick to judge you

275
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,230
But...

276
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,090
This month you have to go to the hospital for stimulants

277
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,660
No problem

278
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,790
I am ready to check whenever

279
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,430
Good, go practice

280
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,480
So, excuse me

281
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,160
I...

282
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,690
As a child, I didn't like seeing friends

283
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,020
Alone, he felt lonely and depressed

284
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,340
Therefore like to open a random box

285
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,940
When I've open it, mood will be better

286
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
You try

287
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,040
ok

288
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,560
Look

289
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,590
So cute

290
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,910
So cute. As a kid, I really liked Hello Kitty

291
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
So...

292
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,230
You guessed this box

293
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,280
What's inside?

294
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,530
Want to meet someone

295
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,120
Just have to go to him

296
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,050
He must be very happy

297
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,920
But remember to come back

298
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,560
Thank you JunJun

299
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,140
Hi

300
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,750
My boyfriend are practicing in here

301
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,700
Can you let me in?

302
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,640
Have to let him come out to pick you up

303
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,840
I can't let you in

304
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,570
But he should be practicing

305
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,710
Then please tell him, please

306
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,090
Little girl, don't bother the athletes, he practices

307
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,750
Today Chong got 1st again

308
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,380
Before, Xia Rui was in the same team as you, right?

309
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,530
Is he always like this?

310
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,260
Before, he tried very hard

311
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,160
There are girl...

312
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,040
So cute...

313
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,260
She came to me

314
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,590
This's kid...

315
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,020
Yeah

316
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,620
Miss me that much?

317
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,290
How are you?

318
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,290
Get well?

319
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,250
What about the wound?

320
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,210
Much better

321
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:13,760
Let me look

322
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,920
During the 2 days I am free

323
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,680
Otherwise

324
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,680
I wound you up

325
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
This will get better faster

326
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,730
Sorry

327
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,160
Many days that I'm away

328
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,330
Make you sad

329
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,290
Are you tired traveling?

330
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,040
Let's go and stay at the pool

331
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,120
Ok

332
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:44,920
Let's go

333
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,380
I thought that were a coach

334
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,260
Chong

335
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,430
Your girlfriend is visiting you here

336
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,830
Look very excitedly

337
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,990
Everyone practiced with difficulty

338
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
I also brought souvenirs for everyone

339
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,270
How about me?

340
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,720
Mai Si Chong

341
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,610
You have a girlfriend visit you here, you still want a souvenir?

342
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,840
Yeah

343
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:12,810
Take it

344
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,260
Here

345
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,080
I'll tell you

346
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,940
The girls in the female team come to confess their love to Chong every day

347
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,090
You have to keep an eye on him

348
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,210
Wait, there are still more Xia Rui stuff

349
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,600
Is it true or fake?

350
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,010
Is it necessary?

351
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,670
Oh yeah

352
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,480
You came out like this. It's okay, right?

353
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,410
It's ok

354
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,300
At most, was punished for swimming twice

355
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,050
Don't  worry

356
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,230
Even if I get caught

357
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,610
As long as the rules are not broken

358
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,600
The coach will pretend not to be seen

359
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,420
That's good

360
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:49,950
Oh yeah

361
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,280
I have something to give you

362
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,530
Why can you have this?

363
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,220
Someone likes this, isn't it?

364
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:58,880
Weiwei

365
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,690
You took the hi speed train

366
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
I don't have a mobile phone

367
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,810
Can't contact

368
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
What if we don't meet?

369
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,570
Of course, I have to wait

370
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,970
Even if I have to wait all day, I will wait

371
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,650
Foolish

372
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,330
You...

373
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,060
Aren't you hating the durian flavor?

374
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,030
This one ate one or two times

375
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,050
It's addicting as well

376
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,540
Oh yeah

377
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,180
I'll tell that

378
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,970
Got there, don't forget to call me

379
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:15,970
Ok

380
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,650
When I get there, I'll tell you

381
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Don't worry

382
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,320
So...

383
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,130
I gonna go

384
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,730
You have nothing to tell me?

385
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,850
Do your best to practice

386
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,570
Just this?

387
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,050
I wish you success soon

388
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,520
Not so fast, but I am definitely successful, okay?

389
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,180
The point is that  "fast and soon"

390
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,190
All right, let's go back quickly

391
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,610
Otherwise, I must swim 20 times

392
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,620
So. I gonna go

393
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,700
Wait

394
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,440
What are you doing?

395
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,610
Write what?

396
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:53,940
Don't move

397
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,170
Ok

398
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,180
If someone comes to confess to you again Then show her this

399
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,470
I got it

400
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,960
So, I'm leaving

401
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,300
Now it is reported that you used a stimulant to suppress the injury

402
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,690
So you got 1st

403
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,580
Until you get into practice

404
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,210
Because before this I had an injury

405
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,940
Therefore need to be more dedicated to get into the province team

406
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,220
But because I can't hide my physical condition

407
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,900
So others took it as an excuse to accuse me?

408
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,120
So, I'm leaving

409
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,610
Bye bye

410
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,240
During this, your speed

411
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:10,990
Drop to very slow

412
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,920
What's happen?

413
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,260
It was you who developed

414
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,100
As for me, it is stationary

415
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Why are you so depressed?

416
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,030
Are you going to give up?

417
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,240
By the way

418
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,580
Sooner or later, I had to leave the team

419
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,310
Leave early

420
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,320
It's not a bad thing

421
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,510
Please

422
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,630
Few people have overcome me

423
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,420
You are one of them

424
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,010
Just this, you'll give up?

425
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,640
Last time

426
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,690
Because you're leaving track late, isn't it?

427
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,700
ok

428
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,230
I give up

429
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,260
Compete with me again

430
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,550
OK, so just compete again

431
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,190
I'll go to take a bath

432
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,300
I'll run 2 more laps

433
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,230
You are Mai Si Chong, right?

434
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,340
I like you

435
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,410
Let's be friends

436
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,270
Err

437
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,650
Do I know you?

438
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,700
Don't know, it's fine

439
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
People who fell in love just got to know each other

440
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,340
I am...

441
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:03,730
No need

442
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,830
I don't want to know

443
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,900
The dog has an owner

444
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:12,710
Good bye

445
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,420
Exam finished

446
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,400
Holiday, will go home happily

447
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,170
I buy you drinks

448
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,320
Finished exam should not be bad. Thank you for your support

449
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,230
Where did you go on holiday?

450
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,590
Stay home

451
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,130
I guess that already

452
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,580
I will go home to go fishing

453
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,550
Fishing

454
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,910
That's so good

455
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,300
Weiwei

456
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,150
11 p.m., just go to sleep

457
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:56,870
Umm ok

458
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,980
Pikachu

459
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,550
Are you ready for a video call?

460
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,040
Wait, I changed the room first

461
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,650
My parents are asleep

462
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,970
I will speak softly

463
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,730
I understand

464
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,520
Recently I keep asking

465
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,090
This practice

466
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,250
When will it be over?

467
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
I never thought that training would be this torture

468
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,390
This is the first time I've felt this way

469
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,630
Then you have a little patience

470
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,950
Each day, practice carefully

471
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,910
And also

472
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,880
Don't just flirt with the female team

473
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,420
You said this, so I can remember

474
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,490
A few days ago, a female athlete came to confess to me

475
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:45,730
What's name?

476
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,420
What's name?

477
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,600
How do I know?

478
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,460
You look...

479
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,630
I wear the shirt that you write every day

480
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,350
Who will have the opportunity?

481
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,020
Don't move

482
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,400
I'm so shocked

483
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,210
We thought the thief had robbed the house

484
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
You...

485
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,200
It's so late, still haven't slept. What are you doing?

486
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,030
I'm learning English

487
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,800
Learn english

488
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,570
I went back to my room to sleep

489
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,800
Learn english

490
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,280
Learning English is good

491
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,370
Go

492
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,420
Go to sleep

493
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,090
Go!

494
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,720
Learning English is really good

495
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,670
I have one good news for you guys

496
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,740
During this long weekend, everyone can use a mobile phone

497
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,270
Coach approved

498
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,140
In my eyes, I only have you

499
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,330
Xia Rui

500
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
You came back from training?

501
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:15,980
Where's Mai Si Chong?

502
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,390
He seems to have something

503
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,760
Being detained at a training club

504
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,900
But what's the reason?

505
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,500
I don't know too

506
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,920
So, excuse me

507
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,770
Provincial team

508
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,620
What's going on?

509
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,050
I feel that you have something to hide from me

510
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,460
Someone reported that the Mai Si Chong

511
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,960
Cheat the competition by using stimulants

512
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,640
You don't know?

513
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,520
How would you explain?

514
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,320
Do you know what your current situation is?

515
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,450
Is this a small thing?

516
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,750
Why don't you go for a stimulant test?

517
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,340
Do you know if you miss this opportunity

518
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,000
Your dreams will always fade away

519
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,270
I have my reasons

520
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,700
You guys don't have to ask

521
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,230
I suggest you stop

522
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,890
Even if I can't enter the province team

523
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,300
I won't let her go

524
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,860
I don't know what you're talking about

525
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:04,930
Weiwei

526
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,030
Sorry

527
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:06,900
You trust me

528
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,280
If not the last minute yet

529
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,540
I will not give up for sure

530
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:30,310
