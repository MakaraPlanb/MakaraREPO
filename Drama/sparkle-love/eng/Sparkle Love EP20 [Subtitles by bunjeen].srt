1
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,240
Peng Pai

2
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,770
Someone comes to you

3
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,980
Weiwei

4
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,880
You rake around like this

5
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,930
Will you eat it?

6
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Don't want to eat

7
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,820
Not in the mood

8
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,730
Mai Si Chong

9
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,910
I feel like he's weird 

10
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,470
You say, two people from friends become lovers

11
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,610
It will become like this, right?

12
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,530
Not at all

13
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,620
Anyway, I am not

14
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,420
Yeah

15
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,080
I know that you guys are the sweetest

16
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,610
Have been together for a long time, still will hide each other

17
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,720
I would like to tell the public so much

18
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,860
I must blame Ding Yi

19
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,820
But

20
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,720
It looks like he hasn't sent WeChat to me in an hour

21
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,760
You come?

22
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,920
Do you think that Chong take girlfriend is more important than friends?

23
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,210
Since returning from the provincial team I haven't met him yet

24
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,260
Brother Rui

25
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,560
When you guys go to the province team, leave me alone

26
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,930
I must be very lonely

27
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,570
How do you know that in the future I will be able to join the provincial team?

28
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,880
It's sure

29
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,220
Went to practice Is like entering the province team already

30
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,610
Chong will definitely get 1st place

31
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,530
You were only a few seconds away from him

32
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,160
50-50 elimination opportunities

33
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
You guys can definitely

34
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,170
It's just the subject of Chong's drug testing

35
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,190
Nonsense

36
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Mai Si Chong

37
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,090
What exactly happened?

38
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,090
Why not go for drug testing?

39
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,380
Coach

40
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,720
No need to stress

41
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,800
I'll definitely explain to you

42
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,570
Now I...

43
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,850
On the way back to the university

44
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,570
It's best that you explain to me to clear it

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,930
When you arrive

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,450
Come straight to Professor Mei Ling's office

47
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,030
I know

48
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,290
Who are you texting with?

49
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,150
Why don't you answer me?

50
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,250
The message was not answered

51
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:34,800
Why?

52
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,690
Now starting to check the post?

53
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,420
Why?

54
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,030
I can't?

55
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,230
You can

56
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,230
Here, drink this

57
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,840
About yesterday

58
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,860
Already edited?

59
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,910
Still have many days

60
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,920
Check again later

61
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,320
Sure?

62
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,380
I feel you have something to hide from me

63
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,570
Stupid girl

64
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,010
Can you think about something important?

65
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,780
So what's more important than this?

66
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,500
Okay, don't think

67
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,980
Hurry to pack things to study

68
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,930
Hello, auntie

69
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,100
Ok

70
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,390
So I'll go to see you right now

71
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,310
Weiwei

72
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,720
Why are you eating alone?

73
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,450
Boss, Yuxin, you guys have just come

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,810
Help me tell Chen Professor

75
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,690
I will be late

76
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,800
I have something to do outside

77
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,790
So excuse me

78
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,810
Weiwei probably doesn't have anything, right?

79
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,530
Not at all

80
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,210
If there is something happened

81
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,280
She should have told us

82
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,040
Special herbal tea for Yuxin

83
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,590
Be careful, it's hot

84
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,010
Thank you

85
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,090
Very bitter

86
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,300
I'll go back and brew for you

87
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,340
No need

88
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,700
Actually

89
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,910
Just tasting

90
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,910
Has a little sweet taste

91
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,210
That's good

92
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:27,930
Auntie

93
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,590
Weiwei, sit down

94
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,260
Suddenly the call follows you, bothering you

95
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,260
It's okay

96
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:34,760
Thank you

97
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,630
Xiao Mai listens to you the most

98
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
So, today, I want you to help me

99
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,890
Ok

100
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,890
Help me find a way for him to get a stimulant test

101
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,410
Stimulant

102
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,660
The last time he checked I went with him

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,010
He told me that he had to change the hospital

104
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,340
This son...

105
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,270
Even you, he won't tell

106
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,260
Yesterday, Coach Pei Pei called

107
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Said they did not change the hospital

108
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,270
He intended not to go to the drug test 

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,230
Now I don't know what to do

110
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,290
Asked him, he would not speak

111
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,480
You look

112
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,090
And still came to tell me that he can fix

113
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,280
What can he go to fix?

114
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,710
The provincial team's drug testing deadline is almost here

115
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,670
Now I can't find him

116
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,300
Called, did not answer, did not call back

117
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,500
Weiwei

118
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,460
What are you thinking?

119
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,840
Nothing

120
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,220
Auntie, don't be frustrated

121
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,150
I'll go see him again

122
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,640
Then please convince him

123
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:38,710
Ok

124
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,500
Today, I still have something to do

125
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,480
So excuse me

126
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,020
Ok

127
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,790
Thank you

128
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,980
Hello

129
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,170
The number you have called cannot be contacted ...

130
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,430
Hello

131
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,450
The number you have called cannot be contacted ...

132
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,970
Ding Yi

133
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,050
Is Mai Si Chong with you now?

134
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,820
No

135
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,920
He took a ride, like he was going to see Peng Pai

136
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,020
There may be something wrong with it

137
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,290
What is she saying?

138
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,740
What did I say wrong?

139
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,760
I should say that Chong is with us, right?

140
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,550
Why?

141
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,400
You and Mai Si Chong

142
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,980
Did you do something embarrassing?

143
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,270
Of course not

144
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,320
But sisi Wei, just hearing it, then was completely silent

145
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,960
Seem to be in a bad mood

146
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,540
I probably didn't sell Chong, right?

147
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,540
Weiwei

148
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,170
Weiwei

149
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,870
Long time no see

150
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,660
I would like to ask you about the Mai Si Chong

151
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,410
He didn't tell you?

152
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,330
First

153
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,230
This matter, I should not comment

154
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,480
What

155
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,580
The person who sent me the video clip

156
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,150
Is you right?

157
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,050
What video clip?

158
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,630
I advise you to stop

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,380
Even if unable to join the province team

160
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,080
I wouldn't give up on her

161
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,590
Mai Si Chong

162
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,520
I don't know what you're talking about

163
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,950
Because of this, you didn't go to check the stimulant?

164
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,180
I've known Weiwei since high school

165
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,360
If I were to reveal her electricity

166
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,600
I don't even need to use this clip

167
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,300
No matter how much I hate you

168
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,490
I would never hurt Weiwei

169
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,380
Dose Weiwei know yet?

170
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,520
No

171
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,480
When is the deadline drug test?

172
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,340
There are 3 more days

173
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,960
Apparently

174
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,680
This person aims to destroy you

175
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,480
Even if you can catch

176
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
He would never give up

177
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,270
If this clip is revealed

178
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,920
I don't dare to think what Wei Wei will be like

179
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,370
I know

180
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:37,840
What are you going to do?

181
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,780
I will stop swimming

182
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,880
I still have other options in life

183
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,330
But if Mei Weiwei is revealed

184
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,610
There will be no other choice in her life

185
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:53,880
Yes

186
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,580
Swimming is 

187
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,200
my dream

188
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,400
But Mei Weiwei life

189
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,260
It's me and her

190
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:03,900
So

191
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,850
No matter what the situation is

192
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
I choose her

193
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
Have you checked your phone number yet?

194
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,160
I tried calling back

195
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,480
Power off

196
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,260
I'll help you check

197
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,530
Thank you

198
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,840
Just

199
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:34,870
Sorry

200
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,770
No need

201
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,210
Because what you did

202
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,050
I can't do

203
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,450
He does not go to check for stimulants, it's very serious

204
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,280
The university will have to deal seriously

205
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,970
I think he might be called to the university about discipline

206
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,790
Weiwei

207
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,660
Sorry

208
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,530
It's ok

209
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,370
Mei Ling Professor

210
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,030
Mai Si Chong

211
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,480
How would you explain?

212
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,090
I am not cheating

213
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,480
As for other matters

214
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,850
I have nothing to say

215
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,250
You have nothing to say?

216
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,270
Do you know what your situation is now?

217
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,340
Mei Ling Professor

218
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,950
My team members will never do anything that is unethical to athletes

219
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,860
The provincial team leader must be mistaken

220
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,640
My people

221
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,840
I believe without conditions

222
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,390
You trust him

223
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,670
Universities trust you

224
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,910
But the belief for this

225
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,930
How do you want me to speak to the provincial team?

226
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,040
In addition, the facts are now seen

227
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,340
The provincial team arranged for him to check the stimulant

228
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,230
He

229
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,760
Do not go on an appointment

230
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,620
Now the internal documents are out

231
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,340
Within 3 days must be announced at the university

232
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,450
And if it's not what they say?

233
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,360
In addition to the drug test results

234
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,870
There is still more evidence

235
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,620
Can you prove that a member of my team is cheating?

236
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,450
What evidence is there yet?

237
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,480
Is drug testing not the best evidence?

238
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,810
What evidence is there yet?

239
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,850
Mai Si Chong, I don't understand

240
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,770
Why didn't you go for a stimulant test?

241
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,110
Professor Mei Ling

242
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,940
I didn't do it

243
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,630
It's mean I did not

244
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,320
You don't do it, so just go for a drug test

245
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,020
Don't make everyone think you can make a mistake, can you?

246
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,390
Now just the words of you alone

247
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,340
Could it make the world believe you?

248
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,330
Professor Mei Ling

249
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,520
I believe that Mai Si Chong did not cheat

250
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:45,740
Mei Weiwei

251
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,080
Where did you come from?

252
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,830
Professor Mei Ling

253
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,560
I was able to prove the innocence of Mai Si Chong

254
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,810
This is not a joke

255
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,050
You have to bring evidence to prove it to me, right?

256
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,510
I know

257
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,490
Professor Mei Ling, please give us some time

258
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,270
I will bring the evidence as soon as possible

259
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,040
Please believe us

260
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,270
Weiwei

261
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,970
Weiwei

262
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,100
Weiwei, don't be angry

263
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,820
I'm not angry

264
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,290
What are you, think I don't know?

265
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,110
Mai Si Chong

266
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
Why are you fooling me?

267
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,140
Why don't you go for drug testing?

268
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,400
Do you know you made a mistake this time?

269
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
Your dreams will always fade away

270
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,570
Sorry

271
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
That I make you worry

272
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm afraid it's because of me

273
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,070
Make you lose your ambition

274
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,160
But you are very important to me

275
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,520
I didn't tell you before

276
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,110
Because I'm afraid to burden you

277
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,690
But I didn't think it would make you nervous

278
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,990
You trust me

279
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,280
I do not go to check for drugs

280
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,510
It doesn't mean that I will stay idle

281
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,620
However, there must be a clue

282
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,810
We must definitely catch the villain

283
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,800
But do you know the time is almost over?

284
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,250
Still have 3 more days, isn't it?

285
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,470
All right

286
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,710
Trust me

287
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
If not the last minute yet

288
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,690
I won't give up

289
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,940
But now go to study first

290
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,490
Ok?

291
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,890
So you promise me

292
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,540
Next, matters like this, don't hide me again

293
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,600
No matter what

294
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,570
Must share, okay?

295
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,880
Ok

296
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,550
Have you ever noticed that here

297
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,670
Is there someone secretly taking pictures of you?

298
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,790
No

299
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,640
Is it possible?

300
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,750
That it was that security guard

301
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,650
How could it be?

302
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,150
Last time that officer

303
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,020
More than half a year in prison

304
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
It has not been released yet

305
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,390
So

306
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,770
Is there anyone else that comes to watch the CCTV?

307
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,700
There was once a man asked to see

308
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,350
It's the person with you guys

309
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,390
with us?

310
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,940
Please come support me

311
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,730
Will all be dead, how can I support you?

312
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,500
Are you back?

313
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,290
Meet Mai Si Chong yet?

314
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Dai Xi

315
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,280
I have something to ask you

316
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,740
Come here please

317
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,010
You said you quit, then quit.

318
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,820
I'll send report

319
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,400
Why?

320
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,400
Dai Xi

321
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,470
Have you ever accidentally told someone about my electricity?

322
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,050
Never

323
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,140
Why do you ask this?

324
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,460
Because of this,so Mai Si Chong

325
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,360
did not go for drugs testing

326
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,730
Chong did not go for drugs testing

327
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,910
Why?

328
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,670
Is it time to ask the reason?

329
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,490
Ding Yi

330
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,240
You can think carefully

331
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,240
The person who reported about Mai Si Chong

332
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,490
Will it be your swimming team members?

333
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,250
No way

334
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,680
Everyone is like brothers and sisters

335
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,500
I'll go ask Chong

336
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,930
Come on

337
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,390
We go back to figure out a way again

338
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,870
Jun Jun

339
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,690
Jun Jun

340
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,980
I asked you one thing

341
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,160
What?

342
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,710
Do you still remember?

343
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,020
That day when the villain met

344
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,680
Who is next to you?

345
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,570
Why?

346
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,290
That security guard

347
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,190
Was released already?

348
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,540
No

349
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,180
I was just asking

350
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,900
Otherwise, you can try to ask Xia Rui

351
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,180
That day when I heard your voice

352
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,670
Xia Rui ran up first

353
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,650
He is more likely to remember

354
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,570
Xia Rui

355
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,180
My friend said

356
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,000
That sim card

357
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,800
It is a SIM that is purchased from a small shop near Nanti

358
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,320
Without registration

359
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,530
A friend in the province team told me that

360
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,490
It is very possible

361
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,900
The person reporting is most likely in your team

362
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,000
The person who is reporting is in the team

363
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,030
His purpose is very clear

364
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,340
Is to make people think you're cheating on the race

365
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,390
It also threatened to keep quiet

366
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,070
Then about this

367
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,580
Who has the most benefit?

368
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,750
In that day

369
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,990
Xia Rui are there too?

370
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,570
No way

371
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,520
Provincial teams have limited quota

372
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,610
If not you, it is Xia Rui

373
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,960
I think people who do, are the most likely to be him

374
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,100
But this is just a logical guess

375
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,550
Brother

376
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,460
If talking about Xia Rui without feeling

377
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,370
He is really self-disciplined

378
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,730
Every day to reach the pool first

379
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
Tried so hard

380
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,680
How could he do such a thing?

381
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,610
Do it or not, you are not in control

382
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,970
If you want to confirm like that, I won't be disappointed

383
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,890
But I just hope you don't drag Weiwei into it

384
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,260
What's the situation?

385
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,790
Brother Rui, did you see Chong today?

386
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,730
Today he returned to the dormitory

387
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,800
And still not coming back

388
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,580
Why don't he answer me?

389
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,800
Do you know that Chong doesn't go for drugs testing?

390
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,430
I know

391
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,860
Why do you all know each other? Then I don't know

392
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,390
Pour a little

393
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,390
Ok

394
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,490
Thank you Team Leader Li for helping

395
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,260
Really admire you

396
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,590
We have to arrange good drinks for you

397
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,160
Come on

398
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,260
Come on, Team Leader Li

399
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:05,710
Cheers

400
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:07,770
Thank you

401
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,900
Too considerate

402
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,960
Why are there any remaining?

403
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,750
Come on

404
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,080
You must run out of glasses

405
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,940
I can't drink anymore

406
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,400
Okay, a little bit

407
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,530
Actually

408
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,760
During this time, about my son

409
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,090
I'm really worried

410
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,230
You look

411
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,360
Can we figure out a way?

412
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,520
Just

413
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,990
Those above

414
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,800
Try calling him

415
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,360
Please speak for us

416
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,910
Lao Mai

417
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,180
What are we?

418
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,320
Our Xiao Mai

419
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,670
Since middle school

420
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,530
I see

421
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,680
this child

422
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,020
is really a swimming robot

423
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,930
It's just the situation right now

424
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,600
If he insists, refuses to test for drugs

425
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,190
Like that, anyone can't help it

426
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,290
He come already

427
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,540
This child

428
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,580
Come here, sit down

429
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,410
This child, what happened to just arrived?

430
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,440
I made many calls and didn't answer

431
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,950
An important meal like this. Why are you late?

432
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,360
Listen to Mr.Li

433
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,270
Si Chong

434
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,940
Why are you ...

435
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,970
Refusing to go for drug testing

436
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,330
Team Leader Li

437
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,150
That he gave me two more days

438
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,000
Is it your helping?

439
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,300
Thanks so much

440
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,130
At that time

441
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,080
I will have to prove it for sure

442
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,190
About this

443
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,290
I still believe you

444
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,420
Actually

445
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,570
Your statistics have been good since childhood

446
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,580
During these two days, you ...

447
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,400
just hurry

448
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,370
Go for drug testing

449
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,930
You can just fix it now, right?

450
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,370
You two

451
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,660
Don't worry

452
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,150
Team Leader Li

453
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,380
Actually, we believe in our son so much

454
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,940
He would never do such a thing

455
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,650
But I'm just wondering

456
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,500
Who do you say is shameless? Slander Xiao Chong

457
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,580
The person who reported it

458
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,010
Anonymous

459
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,890
I guess

460
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,280
this...

461
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,940
This is just my personal opinion

462
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,440
You say ...

463
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,780
Let me guess

464
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
80-90% chance

465
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,400
is people in the team

466
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,180
Team members who train together

467
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,410
Who want to...

468
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,780
to defeat the opponent

469
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,240
In the fastest way

470
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,500
just

471
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,800
Eliminate opponents

472
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,320
Thank you

473
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,220
That can speak for us to think

474
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,150
Xiao Mai

475
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,370
Child who go to practice at the provincial team with you, his name is Xia Rui, right?

476
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,010
Mom

477
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,960
What do you want to say?

478
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,490
We just felt...

479
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,930
That Mr.Li said today

480
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,090
It's not that

481
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,310
It would be impossible

482
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,860
Right

483
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,480
Yes

484
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,590
We are not going to doubt your classmates

485
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,270
But...

486
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:38,640
Mom

487
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,610
He's my roommate

488
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,450
His personality, I know best

489
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,180
I trust him

490
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,820
You don't have to guess

491
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,680
Dad

492
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,220
Mom

493
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,550
Many days ago

494
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,560
Make you worry

495
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,760
But you can trust me

496
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,710
No matter how bad the results are

497
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,570
I will fix it

498
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,070
All right

499
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,610
You have grown up

500
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,570
No matter what you decide to do

501
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,820
All probably have your own reasons

502
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,690
We trust you

503
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,680
How is that possible?

504
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,490
Chong brother

505
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,750
What's wrong with you?

506
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,350
You know right now outside, how bad are they talking about you?

507
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,140
Which ghost would believe that you used drugs?

508
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,520
Why don't you go for drug testing?

509
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,140
Where's Xia Rui?

510
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,540
Rui?

511
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,280
In the locker room

512
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,150
Guard outside, don't let anyone come in
