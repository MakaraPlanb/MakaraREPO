1
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,640
Dad, let's eat

2
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,420
Weiwei

3
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,050
I have looked at the wristwatch for you. No problem

4
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,990
I told, it's time to eat

5
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,400
Pikachu

6
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,350
Have you shut down?

7
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,300
Weiwei

8
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,360
Do you really want to enter the race?

9
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,510
Your body is like this

10
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,870
What if you get hurt?

11
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,770
Mom

12
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,410
Trust me

13
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,970
I definitely need to take good care of myself

14
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,120
Do you know?

15
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,710
University Swimming Team, there is a man

16
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,270
Broken knees but still swimming

17
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,370
What are the men's swimming teams?

18
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,180
Mom

19
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,480
I'm going to sort the books ahead

20
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,190
How did you come?

21
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,110
I will come to invite you to eat

22
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,850
Therefore asked for your home address from Li Dai Xi

23
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,870
Why did Li Dai Xi have to say all of that?

24
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,080
Dad

25
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
What books will this student buy?

26
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,110
Let me help you find

27
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,090
Dad

28
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,970
This is my college friend

29
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,010
Come to me because he has something to talk

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,530
Uncle, hello

31
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,200
Can you swim?

32
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,020
You didn't come and buy the book?

33
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,880
I came to buy a book

34
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,450
Quickly

35
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,970
How about onions?

36
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,190
I have set the oil for a long time

37
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,120
Hurry up, it's not in time

38
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,530
Actually, are you reading books like this?

39
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,510
Do I still have to read books like this?

40
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,100
Are you free?

41
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,010
Let's go eat

42
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,800
Ding Yi recommended a very delicious restaurant for me

43
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,650
Okay

44
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,110
So I go and tell my parents first

45
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,710
You wait for me awhile

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,060
It was you who told Mai Si Chong where Weiwei House is

47
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,330
Do you know what they have?

48
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,020
Weiwei had no news at all

49
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,480
Just two people love each other, what news are you going to want?

50
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
But...

51
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,410
Do you really think Mai Si Chong really likes Weiwei?

52
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,960
The two of them like each other

53
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,160
Today you have to tell me

54
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,450
Do you still like Mai Si Chong?

55
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,330
Otherwise I will say

56
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:27,920
You're going to get this, right?

57
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,560
I'll tell you

58
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,370
I haven't been interested in him for a long time

59
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,950
Not right

60
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,480
I never care about him

61
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,020
So who do you like right now?

62
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:44,990
I...

63
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,050
come on

64
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:55,940
Eat this one

65
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,930
eat

66
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:00,700
here

67
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,060
Eat a lot

68
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,520
enough

69
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,540
Will you fatten me to be a pig?

70
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,610
You are too thin, you should eat a lot

71
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,530
Are you mistaken about being skinny?

72
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,060
You don't eat onions and garlic, are you?

73
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,760
Wait a minute

74
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,980
Mai Si Chong

75
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,230
I haven't accidentally shot you again, right?

76
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,650
No

77
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,930
Just feel like

78
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,870
You are by my side

79
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,590
I will try hard

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,270
I don't know the reason why

81
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,590
Just want to do good to you

82
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,370
In the past, didn't I swim faster?

83
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,270
Actually

84
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,910
Not because of your electricity

85
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,320
But because of you

86
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,250
Let's eat

87
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,920
eat

88
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,440
Eat a lot of meat

89
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,580
Hello Dai Xi

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,480
Weiwei

91
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,360
Today, Mai Si Chong really went to see you?

92
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,890
I think he must have been affected by my electric effects

93
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,680
So have you ever thought that...

94
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,630
He really likes you

95
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,370
I'm a little sleepy, so I hang up

96
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,790
Weiwei

97
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,800
Mom

98
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,990
I brought milk to you

99
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,410
Thank you mom

100
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,610
Slowly

101
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,900
Tomorrow you will have to go back to university

102
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,970
I have something to ask you

103
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:29,940
Okay

104
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,680
You have a boyfriend, right?

105
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,490
No

106
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,710
Look at you

107
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,610
Mom, I squeezed your shoulder

108
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,200
Yes, you squeeze my shoulder

109
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,630
Weiwei

110
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,260
In fact, at this age, you will have someone to like you, that's normal

111
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,150
But mom and dad, just hope you will find someone who ...

112
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,470
Really like you and can make you happy

113
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,410
Now you have grown up

114
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,570
There are a lot of things that we cannot take care of you, right?

115
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,290
Mom

116
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,580
What is 'like'?

117
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,680
Which type is called 'like' very much?

118
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,680
What is 'like'? Which type is called 'like' very much?

119
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,130
Weiwei, this is...

120
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,360
Because your body is very special

121
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,800
What if the other party knew this?

122
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,150
If he is still willing to date with you

123
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:31,890
This man...

124
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,500
he really like you

125
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,920
You understand?

126
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:38,680
Thank you mom

127
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,870
My daughter is grown up

128
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,580
Weiwei

129
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,900
I'm with Mei Ling Professor right now

130
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,490
She said that if not all four people, unable to run a race

131
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,910
So you try to talk to her that one person can't run 2 turns?

132
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,890
Can't

133
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,890
You try inviting JunJun

134
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,330
Let's talk later

135
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,790
How did you come?

136
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,810
Don't practice?

137
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,060
Didn't you tell me that you would come home from 9 o'clock?

138
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,030
I am here

139
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,790
I've been waiting for an hour and a half

140
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,870
Why wait for me?

141
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,420
Because...

142
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,570
I want to have lunch with you

143
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,190
Auntie

144
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,670
Auntie

145
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,250
I helped her carry things. I will go now

146
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:45,970
Okay

147
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,310
Little girl

148
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,280
Your boyfriend is really nice to you

149
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,710
Let's go

150
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,660
Jun Jun

151
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,230
You see, I'm reluctant to take part in the relay race

152
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,750
Otherwise you can come and compete with us

153
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,440
Including you, our team is ready to race

154
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,560
No way, I can't do it

155
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,640
Definitely not

156
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,800
Yu Xin, please help me

157
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,160
Thank you

158
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,660
You help me convince her

159
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,560
Lin Bai Hui had already called me ten lines

160
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,520
But she insisted she didn't participate in the competition

161
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,770
It's not that I'm not willing to help everyone

162
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,020
Just...

163
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,930
There are too many people in the field

164
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,710
I'm nervous

165
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,040
I must transfer to be rock solid

166
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,890
I'll be your guys impediment

167
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,680
Thank you

168
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,820
Why would you be participating in a college sport?

169
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,710
The first thing is to make ...

170
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,250
I want to run by myself

171
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,720
Really?

172
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,990
I never told you?

173
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
In fact, in high school, I liked running a lot

174
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,520
Even though my body is special

175
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,340
But when I have run, I have fun

176
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,120
So I want to run one more time

177
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,340
But now our team is not yet complete

178
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,160
It's ok

179
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,340
In a moment, the situation will resolve itself

180
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,340
Don't worry

181
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,160
Let's eat

182
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,450
Jun Jun : Mai Si Chong

183
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,300
Are you free?

184
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:37,730
Jun Jun

185
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
Come to me, what's the matter?

186
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,010
Thank you

187
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,270
I want to ask you

188
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,690
Our class has a 4x100 meter relay race

189
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,560
I want to help everyone

190
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,370
But...

191
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,950
I have never attended an event like this before

192
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,840
I think...

193
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,150
This is up to you guys

194
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,530
Do what you believe and don't regret it later

195
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,730
But...

196
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,980
I'm afraid to impediment everyone

197
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,570
What's so scary?

198
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,450
How about this?

199
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,910
Whether the results are good or bad

200
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,840
I will support you

201
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,940
For next year, I will treat you all year round

202
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,500
How is it?

203
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,940
So

204
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,370
I will think again

205
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,910
Today

206
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,090
Enough

207
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:19,880
Quit class

208
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,810
Thank you Professor

209
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,660
Everyone

210
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,700
I have good news to tell

211
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,770
Let us clap our hands warmly

212
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Welcome Jun Jun

213
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,230
Join a competitive team

214
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,390
Our class 4x100 meter relay

215
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,570
Is the most important team member

216
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,120
Great

217
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,640
Next

218
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,390
We just

219
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,490
Get ready

220
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,730
Jun Jun

221
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,880
Thank you for your willingness to participate

222
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,140
Otherwise

223
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,230
For next year, I will treat you all year round

224
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,910
Do it for everyone

225
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,290
Thank you Weiwei

226
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,090
But...

227
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,260
You...

228
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,960
Why do you say same with Mai Si Chong?

229
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,020
Dai Xi

230
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,750
I think...

231
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,580
That Jun Jun is willing to join the running team

232
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,500
It seemed to be because the Mai Si Chong helped us

233
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,440
You think...

234
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,680
What does it mean?

235
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,800
What do you mean?

236
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,630
It's very clearly

237
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,630
Before, I helped you to shock a lot of people

238
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,580
Why not success?

239
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,370
Because

240
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,330
The feeling of the shock is unreliable

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,610
You look

242
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,900
Senior at grade 11

243
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,050
Juniors at grade 12

244
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,980
There is still another classroom next door

245
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,400
Once again is...

246
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,010
Senior who started military training

247
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,790
All like me for one day

248
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,410
Then, you still let me help you to shock people

249
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,700
'Like' just one day

250
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,500
It is considered 'like'

251
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,190
You look

252
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,060
Your electricity only works for 24 hours

253
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,670
If a long time has passed

254
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,040
He still likes you

255
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,120
It's mean

256
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,740
Mai Si Chong really like you

257
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,630
What?

258
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,940
You like the Mai  Si Chong, why wouldn't I know

259
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,010
If...

260
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,030
He dares to make you sad

261
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,060
I'll tell Ding Yi

262
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,920
Give him a laxative

263
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,750
Talk about Ding Yi

264
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,520
Did you notice that...

265
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,110
Since you know Ding Yi

266
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,680
Did not ask me to help you shock people again

267
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,010
So?

268
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,210
So?

269
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,640
Keep it on top for me

270
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,760
Chong bro

271
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,740
What are you doing here?

272
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,490
I just passed by

273
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:45,820
I can't?

274
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,090
Here for you

275
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,980
It is thanks to you always helping me

276
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,170
So good to me

277
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,830
You don't get it wrong

278
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,480
This is just a thank you

279
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,780
This is...

280
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,520
So ugly, what else must I be mistaken?

281
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,030
Then return to me

282
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:14,460
Not return

283
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,480
give me

284
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,530
No

285
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,300
I'll go back to the dormitory

286
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,090
Let's warm up

287
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,270
Don't give up

288
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,200
Okay

289
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,690
Let's warm up first

290
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,260
Jun Jun this way

291
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,810
Jun Jun, good morning

292
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,750
Jun Jun

293
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,290
I usually see you wearing a dress

294
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,510
This is the first time I saw you in sportswear

295
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,370
This looks good

296
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,690
So

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,860
Since Jun Jun has arrived

298
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,980
Our team has finished 4 people

299
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,420
Officially established

300
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:13,870
Great

301
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,700
Err...

302
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,850
First of all, the four of us, shall we determine the order?

303
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,750
Boss

304
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,850
I never run

305
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,120
I will try

306
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,630
It's okay

307
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,840
Otherwise, let's run together first

308
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,880
Will I be able to warm my body as well?

309
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:32,710
Good

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,310
So

311
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,500
Follow me

312
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,680
Come on...go...

313
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,210
Lin Bai Hui

314
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,690
Are you carrying 10 kilos of rice? 
(1 Jin is half a kilo)

315
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Please take a break

316
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,460
It's okay

317
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,860
I can still run

318
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,790
You haven't even started the real race yet

319
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,090
I will tell you

320
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,520
I, Lin Bai Hui

321
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Don't accept defeat

322
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,390
Hey, we are back

323
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,310
Are you back?

324
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:35,970
Run for a long time

325
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,260
One and half hour

326
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,580
I'm so hungry, I'm going to eat

327
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,680
Dai Xi, Yu Xin, are you going?

328
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,260
I'm not going, I'm going to add makeup

329
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,860
Oh yeah

330
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,780
You bought it for Jun Jun

331
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,440
Okay

332
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,320
So, I'm leaving

333
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,970
I want to go with you too

334
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,330
But there are a lot of people in the cafeteria

335
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,680
Are you ok?

336
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,080
It's ok

337
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,460
However, at the race

338
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,370
A lot of people

339
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,210
I would like to try

340
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,590
Okay

341
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,750
Well, you don't have to be afraid

342
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Just think that everyone is white cabbage

343
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:07,800
Let's go

344
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,800
White cabbage

345
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,470
White cabbage

346
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,050
Everyone is white cabbage

347
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,540
White cabbage

348
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,410
It's ok

349
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,000
However, we just finished exercising

350
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,360
Considered to strengthen vitamins

351
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,370
Thank you Weiwei

352
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,130
But...

353
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,710
"White cabbage"

354
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,440
It seems to really work

355
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,420
It seems to me

356
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
I'm not nervous anymore

357
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,160
That's good

358
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,050
Hurry eat

359
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,630
Eat more

360
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,650
You don't like it

361
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Why do you have to force yourself?

362
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,460
I will go and speak to them

363
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,150
I don't want to disappoint everyone

364
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,060
You don't want everyone to be disappointed

365
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,220
Or

366
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,180
You do not want to make Mai Si Chong disappointed

367
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,020
Also has our boss

368
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,700
Yu Xin and Weiwei

369
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,930
I've promised

370
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,570
Must do my best

371
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,560
Also, I found

372
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,880
Running

373
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,100
It's not that difficult

374
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,100
Okay

375
00:19:59,500 --> 00:19:59,970
You run

376
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,300
I'll run with you

377
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
I'm Xia Rui

378
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,550
I...I know

379
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,560
The competition will begin soon

380
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,590
Let's go eat together

381
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,910
Give you energy

382
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,170
I'm waiting under your dorm

383
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,380
I...

384
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,170
Too much

385
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,740
I can't eat all

386
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,550
It's ok

387
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,090
You just choose what you like to eat

388
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,410
Isn't the race starting?

389
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,670
You just have to eat a lot

390
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,850
Add protein and sugar

391
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:06,880

392
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,970

Fight

401
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,420
Why are they running so fast?

402
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,220
Maybe they will run and get 3rd place

403
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,100
Are you nervous?

404
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,730
This can help reduce your nervousness

405
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,490
You used to tell me

406
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,140
Thank you

407
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,210
You are the best classmate

408
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,060
Why are you two coming together?

409
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,650
Your swimming team, don't have to join, isn't it?

410
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,830
Well ... I came to cheer you guys up

411
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,010
Where's Weiwei?

412
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,630
Don't know

413
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,650
Why she hasn't come yet?

414
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,860
Thank you

415
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,380

417
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,810

419
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,190
But if it rains, what should I do?

420
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,810
No, I have to check the weather

421
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,710
Didn't I send you a weather forecast last night?

422
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,880
So what if the weather changes?

423
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,160
How could it be?

424
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,000
Not allowed to take Peng Pai

425
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,250
Come into the restricted area

426
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,950

427
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,680

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,170
You should bring an umbrella with you

432
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,520
Weather forecast just updated

433
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,780
It should rain again

434
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,210

435
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,240
