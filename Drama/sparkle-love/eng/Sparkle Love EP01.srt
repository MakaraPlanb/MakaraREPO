1
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,040
It is raining outside

2
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,400
How can I get to the classroom on time?

3
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
I can't pick you up now

4
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,760
Find a way here by yourself

5
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,955
Why are you so late?

6
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:18,400
I was playing video games when you called me

7
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,511
There are many memorable moments in our life

8
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,560
It can be a warm hug

9
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,760
a romantic eye contact

10
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,840
a tempted heartbeat

11
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,600
or

12
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,480
a sudden touch

13
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,280
a kiss that you will never forget

14
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,080
These precious memories 

15
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
that hide deep down in our mind

16
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,760
are sparkle love

17
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,400
Are you alright?

18
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,320
I will leave you here if you are fine

19
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,600
My name is Mei Weiwei

20
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,080
Since I was born

21
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,440
The static electricity in my body 

22
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,920
is  extremely active

23
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
If my heart rate runs over 110

24
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
I will turn into a living Pikachu

25
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,480
and release electricity to all the people near me

26
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The faster my heart rate, the stronger the voltage

27
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
However, my super power 

28
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,800
haven't really hurt anyone yet

29
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,680
If you accept my electricity by accident

30
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,280
you will fall in love with the one you first see

31
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,800
but the fake love like this 

32
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,320
it won't last too long 

33
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,320
After 24 hours 

34
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,880
the fragile bond will break up

35
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,480
Except this

36
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,480
If you ask me 

37
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,120
what else 

38
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
my lousy super power can bring to me

39
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,040
There is only one thing

40
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
which are endless troubles

41
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,320
Our experimental class is...

42
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,644
Mei Weiwei

43
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,640
Our group meeting will be over soon

44
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,120
and here you are?

45
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,400
I am so sorry

46
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,960
I had an accident on my way to the classroom

47
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,480
Just sit

48
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
We have taken classes for 3 weeks 

49
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,320
since the military training ends

50
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,280
and I haven't met Zhang Yuxin yet

51
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,560
She is living in your dormitory, tight?

52
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,920
Go and ask her why

53
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,840
Okay

54
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
Alright, let't move on

55
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,080
In our rehabilitation class 

56
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,840
There are only 4 students

57
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,066
But we are still a group

58
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,711
-Lin Baihui -Here

59
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:24,920
You are the monitor

60
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,280
so it's your job to organize some activities 

61
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,360
so that everyone here can get along well

62
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,840
Okay class dismissed

63
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Ms.Meiling excuse me

64
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,280
Can I have a word with you please?

65
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,040
I am in a hurry to a meeting

66
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,680
Find me in the lecture hall this afternoon

67
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,480
A cup of Americano please

68
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,360
Thank you

69
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,200
A cup of matcha latte please

70
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,040
Thanks

71
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:55,422
Hello Yuxin

72
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,920
Ms.Meiling asked me about you in the group meeting

73
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,000
she wonderer why you didn't attend classes

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,760
She had already called me 

75
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,360
and I've told you that

76
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,280
I need to do the part time job in this cafe

77
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,480
which occupied most of my time

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,560
Enjoy your coffee

79
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,320
Alright

80
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Why don't you pick me up today

81
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,680
Where did you go

82
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,360
Weiwei

83
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,880
I think I have a crush on a guy

84
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,040
Another!?

85
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,840
He got the first prize of the swimming competition

86
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,120
I met him when I am doing a interview

87
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,000
-Are you in the swimming team? -Yes, I am

88
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,520
Can I ask you a question? 

89
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,040
What do you expect from the swimming team

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,960
Nothing special

91
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,800
I can be satisfied 

92
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,120
if I can make some progress every single day

93
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,520
What are you dong here?

94
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:39,577
Are you doing interviews?

95
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,560
I can be your guest

96
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,400
What do you 

97
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,080
expect from the swimming team

98
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,320
I am here to be the bottom of the team

99
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,000
so that my teammates can be more confident

100
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
I am sorry

101
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,080
I am here to interview the champion

102
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,040
not you

103
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,040
Fine, your champion is here

104
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,360
His name is Mai Sichong

105
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,360
His highest grade 

106
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,120
on 100 meter freestyle is 5 minutes 35 seconds

107
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,440
He have been so popular since his high school

108
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,520
Nice to meet you

109
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
I am a journalist from school TV station

110
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,760
My name is Li Daixi

111
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,280
My major is sports journalism

112
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,240
Your job is to interview our champion

113
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,560
Why are you introducing yourself

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,200
Sorry

115
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
Mai Sichong, I have a question for you

116
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,920
What do you expect from the swimming team?

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,600
Winning the golden medal

118
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,400
But you are already got one 

119
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,320
That's history, it means nothing to me

120
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,320
I am talking about my next competition

121
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
Cool!

122
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,200
Are you in a relationship with someone now?

123
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,480
I mean

124
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,760
Being in a relationship may affect your training

125
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,920
How do you get balance?

126
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,720
There is no such a thing like romance in sports

127
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,520
I am supposed to compete for my nation

128
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,800
My girlfriend's name is competition

129
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,640
Cool!

130
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,120
I have a feeling that Mai Sichong

131
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,880
will be my one and only

132
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,840
-Can you help me to get him? -No way

133
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,880
I have promised to my mother that

134
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,199
I won't use my super power again

135
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
How about this

136
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,440
I will replace you to take the massage class

137
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,720
The professor don't know you

138
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,360
You said you are busy 

139
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,080
If you go to the massage class yourself

140
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,760
Your super power

141
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,400
will hurt people

142
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,480
No one can survive from your hands

143
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,977
Ms.Meiling I am assigned to this school

144
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:03,970
My attention is to go to the economy school

145
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,120
and I am not physically suitable 

146
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,520
to give people massage

147
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,355
Could you pleas...

148
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:08,200
I am sorry?

149
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,080
Physically disabled?

150
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,320
What a lousy excuse

151
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,960
You think you can do whatever you want?

152
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,480
We have rules

153
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,640
You can go to the economy school

154
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,400
when your average grade is above 90

155
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,000
-Final offer. -90?

156
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,200
Stop

157
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,280
There is no negotiation 

158
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,920
Your final grade will speak for you

159
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,200
Ms.Meiling!

160
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,800
Jesus

161
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
Is it so hard to open a door?!

162
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,800
So, you are the one who knocked me down in front of the library

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,200
Are you the one who block my way?

164
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,155
Your apology is accepted

165
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:17,840
Hey!

166
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,400
 Kiss! Kiss!

167
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,120
Sichong

168
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,200
Girls are so open nowadays

169
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,880
Hello

170
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,480
everyone

171
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,200
I am Li Daixi from the TV station

172
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,160
If you want to know about the information of the freshmen

173
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Feel free to ask me

174
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,920
Is Mai Sichong single?

175
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,720
I am sure about this

176
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,440
He is now but he will not very soon

177
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
Alright

178
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,960
It is so late

179
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,800
Although we are young

180
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,040
we need to get enough rest

181
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,920
Good night everyone

182
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,360
How is it going?

183
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,040
Did Ms.Meiling promise you?

184
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,040
She said that my final grade must be 

185
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,200
90 or above

186
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,400
and she will approve my request

187
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,840
I don't think this is possible

188
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,520
Don't you give up!

189
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,880
You can help me this time

190
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,400
and in exchange

191
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,560
I will take your massage classes

192
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,240
I promise it is the last time

193
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,840
and I promise your massage grade

194
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,120
is above 90

195
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
Okay fine

196
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,400
You promise?

197
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
You can't change your mind

198
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,288
I promise

199
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,880
Thank you

200
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,480
Are you sure she is not a mute?

201
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,560
Is she angry about me because 

202
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,577
I moved to your dormitory without her permission?
Is she angry about me because 

203
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:04,360
I moved to your dormitory without her permission?

204
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,360
Don't over think

205
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,640
The only word I hear her saying 

206
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,160
is "here"

207
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:19,555
On my marks, get set

208
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,200
You are 0.4 second faster than  last week

209
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,440
Mai Sichong

210
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,680
Come on!

211
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,080
Coach 

212
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,920
You don't have to worry about him

213
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,960
He won't give up until he is able to 

214
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,080
get the same grades when he was in high school

215
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,800
Just wait and see

216
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Look at him

217
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,640
and look at yourself

218
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
So you are planning to time Mai Sichong 

219
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,000
forever?

220
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,160
Can I?

221
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,240
How dare you

222
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,400
There are only two months left

223
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,480
We don't have enough spots for everyone

224
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,520
But it doesn't mean that the rest of you

225
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,800
don't have to take trainings

226
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,640
You need to be aware of your ultimate goal

227
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,800
I don't care about your future plan

228
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,760
But as long as you are here

229
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,360
You can't stop training

230
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:14,933
Which one is Mai Sichong?

231
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,488
The one on the seventh track

232
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:18,920
You can tell?

233
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,000
Of course!

234
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,560
Let's go

235
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,320
Alright

236
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,480
Rest for a second

237
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,640
Excuse me 

238
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,120
what's your emergency?

239
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,320
Hello

240
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,920
We are from the rehabilitation class

241
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,160
Sometimes we take the same class with the swimming team

242
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
I am not so clever

243
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,080
and I need practice

244
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,200
Can I practice on one of the team members?

245
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,720
This is my student card

246
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,400
Right

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,360
I will find you someone

248
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Mai Sichong, come here

249
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,560
and the rest of you, dismiss

250
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,360
This is one of your classmate, she will practice on you

251
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,240
So yesterday, you are in purpose

252
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,720
Coach

253
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,800
You are training right now

254
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,240
It's so rude to interrupt

255
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,480
I can come next time

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
Our training is over

257
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,000
But we are practicing massage

258
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
Is it a good time to practice here?

259
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,880
I don't see any trouble here

260
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,360
Sit

261
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,130
What are you waiting for? 

262
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,222
You need help?

263
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,160
Swimmers are most likely

264
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,960
to hurt the joints

265
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,400
on their shoulders

266
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,000
and secondly

267
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,160
the knee joints

268
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,400
I'm a swimmer

269
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,600
how could I hurt my knee?

270
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,880
Stay away from me

271
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:56,844
Don't!

272
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,800
Watch out!

273
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,000
You are so weird

274
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,800
like a ghost around me 

275
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,000
I am telling you

276
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,240
You are not my type

277
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,320
Please leave me alone

278
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,120
What?!

279
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,320
So what's your type actually?

280
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,400
Don't even try

281
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,720
His only lover 

282
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,200
is his swimming glasses

283
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,720
Ding Yi and Xia Rui, Let's go

284
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,160
Wait! In our last interview

285
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,320
I am not done yet

286
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
I want to know

287
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,560
Since when ddi you start learning swimming?

288
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,280
Why are you so passionate about it?

289
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,133
and, is it real that you haven't fall in love with a girl?

290
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,160
Hello

291
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,960
Let's go back to the dormitory

292
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:14,044
Why did you stop just now 

293
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,720
Daixi

294
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,279
I think I have seen a old friend

295
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,080
Maybe not

296
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,240
But anyway

297
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,200
The one you fall in love with is 

298
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,320
that rude guy who knocked my down before

299
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,280
Your taste is terrible

300
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,480
yeah, horses for courses

301
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,720
But how could you stop your magic

302
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,688
for a random guy

303
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,760
Give me Mai Sichong's Wechat account

304
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,280
I can handle this

305
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,480
I bought some new lipsticks

306
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,160
-Wanna try? -Sure

307
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,240
I am Mei Weiwei

308
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
I am so sorry about today

309
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:54,880
Can I meet you some time

310
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
No need

311
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,977
and I don't think everyone can talk to me in Wechat

312
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,800
Son!

313
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:31,711
Yes

314
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,360
I have told you that don't come here with your fancy car

315
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,000
It embarrasses me

316
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,920
come on

317
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
I was going to drive that nanny car 

318
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
But I have it washed

319
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,160
Fine

320
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,120
Are you thirsty?

321
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,800
Drinking beverage is not good for your health

322
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,160
remember?

323
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,840
But you just ignore me

324
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,840
You are messing with me?

325
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,360
aren't you?

326
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,040
When I was little, you held me in arms

327
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,920
played with me and gave me back to dad

328
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,960
when I cried

329
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,280
How dare you judge me like that

330
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,600
I suffered so hard 

331
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,720
to give birth to you

332
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,720
Fine your ingrate son is leaving

333
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,480
Wait

334
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,960
Are you moving a supermarket here?

335
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,920
Share with your roommates

336
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,840
I am leaving

337
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,480
Why are you in such a hurry

338
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
I am not finished yet

339
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,000
What do you want 

340
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,720
speak now

341
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,120
I met your Professor Liu the other day

342
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,040
She said all the files are well packed

343
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,120
which means your report is still in the school

344
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,600
-What? -Don't worry

345
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,622
She said it is only privacy

346
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,200
-No one can see that. -No 

347
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,680
I need to get it my own

348
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,400
Don't over think 

349
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,520
I promise your dad not to tell you this 

350
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
But I think 

351
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,160
it is your own business

352
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,960
You have the right to know

353
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,520
Right?

354
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,000
So here I am

355
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
-Keep it as a secret -Okay

356
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,560
I got it

357
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,533
You can go now

358
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,120
Tomorrow is my birthday

359
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,911
-I will pick you up -Okay

360
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,177
Focus on your training

361
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,960
Who is this girl, is she so fond of me?

362
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,440
I am going to lose the game

363
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,200
Did any of you sell my number?

364
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:22,960
I didn't

365
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,377
I am going to take a jog

366
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,880
I gave your number to Li Daixi

367
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,155
Who is that?

368
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:32,440
The girl who interviewed you before

369
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,200
looks pretty

370
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,560
Sichong, focus!

371
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,360
I met your Professor Liu the other day

372
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,480
She said all the files are well packed

373
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,520
which means your report is still in the school

374
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:04,911
Sichong

375
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,040
Sichong

376
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,360
Why do you want the key of data room

377
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,000
It's my own business

378
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,560
It's also my business

379
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,640
I am responsible for this 

380
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,760
it's my job to keep them

381
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,160
-Calm down -Give me back please

382
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
Just one hour

383
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,800
