2
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,640
When Chong was in high school, he made a very good time record

3
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,830
But in university he couldn't do it

4
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,690
How much?

5
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,650
Faster than last week .4 seconds

6
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,730
You don't obey, train hard again, right?

7
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,540
If your leg isn't healed

8
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,940
May be permanently injured

9
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,650
If the team leader knows that I have been injured

10
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,070
How can I join the provincial team next year?

11
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,350
Mei Weiwei

12
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,940
Shock me

13
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,170
At first, didn't I swim faster?

14
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,380
Actually

15
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,550
Not because of your electricity

16
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,250
But because of you

17
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,760
You are by my side

18
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,360
I will try hard

19
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,130
Now it is reported that you used a stimulant to suppress the injury

20
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,330
I am ready to check whenever

21
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:41,980
Mom

22
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,210
Why are you so slow?

23
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm very anxious

24
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,720
Lao Mai

25
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,200
Quickly

26
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,460
What did the boss say?

27
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,830
Nothing, Just ask a common question

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,020
Didn't you talk about your knee?

29
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,410
Will my knees be healed?

30
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,330
Will he not allow the best athletes to get injured?

31
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,730
And the leader of the team plans what to do next

32
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,110
What?

33
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,340
What to do?

34
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,800
My son has no problem

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,900
The big deal isn't the stimulant test?

36
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,320
What am I not saying clearly?

37
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,910
Mom, your idea is like the boss of everything

38
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,410
Unfortunately you are not the team leader

39
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,730
You, please glib a little less

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,770
I'm just a good leader with you and your father

41
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:20,910
Go

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Drive the car, take son to eat something delicious

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,510
I ... wouldn't eat

44
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,730
I must hurry back to the university

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,770
Weiwei is waiting for me

46
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,490
Bye bye

47
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
His heart is no longer here

48
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,490
Do you miss me?

49
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,360
I don't miss you at all

50
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,340
Come on

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,410
Sorry

52
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,520
That I didn't reply to your message

53
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,150
Because I went to arrange matters at the provincial club

54
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,440
Don't be angry, okay?

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,040
At the provincial club, what's going on?

56
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,560
Nothing

57
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,280
Just a little

58
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,440
Small matter, why don't you reply to the message?

59
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,320
You have something to hide from me, right?

60
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,480
How could it be?

61
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,550
Don't be angry, have a good mood

62
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,430
I promise you

63
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,890
Next time, I will immediately reply to you message

64
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,950
Even if I'm following my dream, I'll reply you immediately

65
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,410
Eloquence

66
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:49,770
come on

67
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,080
Take you to eat something delicious

68
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,690
Buy the milk tea that you like to drink

69
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:55,610
Go

70
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,570
Ding Yi

71
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,110
When will you tell everyone about us?

72
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,590
Err...

73
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,080
What?

74
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,160
Eat it, why are you talking about this?

75
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,460
Doing like the opening statement of the star couple

76
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,940
Sorry

77
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,050
I've heard that...

78
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,590
Sorry for what?

79
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,760
Just saying no, it is enough

80
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,980
Or will say

81
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,270
You date me, it's embarrassing

82
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,270
No

83
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,050
What's so embarrassing?

84
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,530
Brother Chong, are you back?

85
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,390
I heard a friend in the province team talking about you ...

86
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,050
You guys eat

87
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,740
I'm full

88
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,210
What are you guys?

89
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,940
It's been a while I'm not sure either

90
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,460
You can follow first. We can talk later

91
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,080
What's the matter?

92
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,200
Nothing

93
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,960
Previously, someone wrote a report

94
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,460
That I use stimulants

95
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Report

96
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,480
It's so important, why did you just tell me now?

97
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,380
Didn't want to say it while Ding Yi was there

98
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,790
Trust me

99
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,110
Just go for a stimulant test to prove, it's okay

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,090
Is it really that easy?

101
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,740
"If you don't want it to be revealed Do not go to check for stimulants. "\
Who?

102
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,330
Spam

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,530
Come on

104
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,130
Don't bump your eyebrows, just eat

105
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Then I'll go check the dope with you

106
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,050
Weiwei

107
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,450
After finished testing stimulants

108
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,230
Let's go skate

109
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,020
Ok

110
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,240
Then finished skating

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,700
We go to eat seafood

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
You want to eat shrimp or crab

113
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,830
Anything

114
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,520
So in the evening, let's go to the movies

115
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,380
Watching movies is not better

116
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,860
I'm afraid I'll sleep again

117
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,720
Oh

118
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,820
What are you smiling?

119
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,460
I remember the last time we went to the cinema with Peng Pai

120
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,270
And then you fall asleep

121
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,500
You said this so I can remember

122
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,390
I haven't asked you yet

123
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,240
Last time, you were meant to harass, right?

124
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
Of course

125
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,210
Or will I see my girlfriend's future go to the movies with other men?

126
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,150
Right?

127
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,330
All right

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,150
Someone else's here

129
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,310
It's okay

130
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,330
Well, I'll go to the bathroom

131
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,330
Your queue yet?

132
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,080
Weiwei

133
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,850
No need to check today

134
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,400
Why?

135
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,860
Err..., the provincial team just called and told me that

136
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,400
Changed to another hospital 

137
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,010
Why so sudden?

138
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
They will inform again. Come on

139
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,060
So where are we going now?

140
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,650
Let's go out first

141
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,840
Weiwei

142
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,040
Why did you suddenly bring me home?

143
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,640
Your parents are not at home?

144
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,770
Just now, I asked you where you want to go, but you didn't say anything

145
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,940
I saw what you were thinking

146
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,110
Therefore not wanting to interrupt

147
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,330
My parents are not at home

148
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,360
Therefore brought you here

149
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,890
You mean...

150
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,530
Are we progressing too quickly?

151
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,010
What are you thinking?

152
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,790
I just thought that when you entered the province team

153
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,910
Not eating good food

154
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,990
Just want to cook for you

155
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,190
Book that way, you can read comfortably

156
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,890
You sit for a while. I'll go and cook

157
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,020
Ok

158
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,110
Don't want to be exposed, don't go to check for stimulants

159
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,590
Ready

160
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,310
I never know, Mei Weiwei

161
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,700
That you are skilled in cooking as well

162
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,800
The skill I got from my dad

163
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,710
Taste it

164
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,440
Is it delicious?

165
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,840
Very delicious

166
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,820
Really? so you eat more

167
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,790
I will eat all of them

168
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,430
Really?

169
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,000
So you wait a moment

170
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,000
This is all of your

171
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,580
Why is there so much food?

172
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,120
I think athletes like you should eat more than others

173
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
So I've done a lot

174
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,600
Thanks to you

175
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,440
Taste it

176
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,410
Ok

177
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,350
This is more delicious

178
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,850
Compared to this one, this one is tastier

179
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,130
Really?

180
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,450
So you wait, I still have another surprise for you

181
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,810
Weiwei

182
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,810
Can I take this food back?

183
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,960
Take back?

184
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,350
So delicious, I have to take it slowly

185
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,280
If you like it, next time I do it again

186
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,650
Now it's all yours

187
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,720
Eat it when hot, it will taste better

188
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,510
Quickly

189
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,630
I will watch you eat

190
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,590
Ok

191
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,340
Really delicious

192
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,400
So you can eat them all

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,250
That's all of you

194
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,710
Ok

195
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,970
My mom said that women are the water element

196
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,840
It was clearly salt water

197
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,110
Never mind!

198
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,300
I must practice cooking more

199
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,440
Otherwise, we will surely die first

200
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,020
Before that I wasn't careful, so I shock other people

201
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,300
So they have a good feeling for me

202
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,870
Later there were various misunderstandings

203
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,810
But everyone thought I was deliberately seducing my male friends

204
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,770
So all branded me

205
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,240
Later I moved to another school

206
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,170
Got to know Li Dai Xi

207
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,200
So I never let anyone know my secret

208
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,550
You understand?

209
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:53,720
Give me back

210
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,130
Give me back

211
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,020
Let me see where are you?

212
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,210
Why is it so strange?

213
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,770
Are you okay?

214
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,030
Your own graduation photo...

215
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,290
After I moved to another school

216
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,470
I did not dare to associate with anyone again

217
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,800
So I took my own graduation photo

218
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,950
Because of the electricity, you have to suffer a lot

219
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,380
I used to feel very overwhelmed

220
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,160
But now I think it's good

221
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,200
If not my electricity Will I meet you?

222
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,660
I know

223
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,880
Know what?

224
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,340
I know I have to take care of you in the future

225
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,200
Oh yeah

226
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,890
Why did they suddenly change the hospital for stimulant testing?

227
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,570
And did they not inform yet, where to go to check instead?

228
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,460
Not yet

229
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,800
But...

230
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,820
They just wanted to find a place where he could check up more

231
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,000
So don't worry

232
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,210
Want to eat cake? There is in the refrigerator 

233
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,180
I brought it to you to eat

234
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,880
Coach Pei Pei

235
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:51,910
Dai Xi

236
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:53,990
Crab

237
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,900
I don't eat

238
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,450
You go back

239
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,060
Dai Xi

240
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,270
Let's talk again

241
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,690
Ding Yi

242
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,240
What are we?

243
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,340
Why should we talk nicely?

244
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,000
You're my girlfriend

245
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,630
Between us there is nothing to talk nicely, right?

246
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,520
So good

247
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,800
I ask you

248
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,440
Why don't you let people know what we are?

249
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,860
I, Li Dai Xi, is not beautiful enough that it makes you embarrassed?

250
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,230
No no no

251
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,100
So you have someone else, right?

252
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,660
How can I get someone else?

253
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,950
I have the ability

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,290
I just

255
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,200
You give me a reason

256
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,710
I have only you

257
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:28,700
Okay

258
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,010
You gave me a reason why you did not disclose to the public

259
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,080
We can continue dating

260
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,910
I just felt that ...

261
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,620
I just feel that I am not worthy of you

262
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,390
You look at Si Chong

263
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,420
The pride of the swimming team

264
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,980
Hui Hui was a professor of health

265
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,400
Xia Rui, a good person who is unmatched

266
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Only I, Ding Yi

267
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,300
I can't do anything

268
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
Only eat the 1st

269
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,710
Swimming is the last

270
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,870
Not good at games

271
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,020
How will you be interested in me?

272
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,770
You...

273
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,140
Just this...

274
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,540
Isn't this enough?

275
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,770
But why do I think like to eat is good

276
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,010
I like to eat too

277
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,360
Swimming, It's not just practice one day then I can swim

278
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,440
I don't care

279
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,290
Slow swimming is not injured

280
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,450
Not good at games

281
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,010
You really are

282
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,420
But you're willing to play with me

283
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,440
I think you are a very good person

284
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,090
Dai Xi

285
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,490
You are...

286
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,930
The eyesight is really bad, right?

287
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:28,930
Hey!

288
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,000
I admire you

289
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,020
How can you say this to me?

290
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:32,980
Wan to eat crab?

291
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:33,870
You peel

292
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,980
You have a taste

293
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,150
Is it delicious?

294
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,560
Delicious

295
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,480
Later, I went to peek at her at the playground

296
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,740
Suddenly an electric current came out

297
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:03,980
Electric current

298
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,260
What happened to you?

299
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,540
Come back, but don't tell me

300
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,730
How's it going, have you done a stimulant test?

301
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,020
When will the results come out?

302
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,190
Take a while

303
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,350
Not that fast

304
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,200
That is

305
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,070
How about Weiwei?

306
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,560
Where did you guys go?

307
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,550
You don't bring her to eat at all

308
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,220
Haven't seen her in over two months

309
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,440
Don't tell her that I really misses her

310
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:32,690
Mom

311
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,440
I'm tired ,you go back first

312
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,370
I gonna sleep

313
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,800
So you finished eating, just sleep

314
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,660
The person who reports me anonymously, is it you?

315
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,650
Your purpose is to frame me

316
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,200
Please, don't do anything Weiwei

317
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,440
It's so late, who's calling again?

318
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,670
Pei Pei Professor

319
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,260
Pei Pei Professor

320
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,910
It's very late, What's the matter?

321
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,140
Mai's mom Hello

322
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,730
May I ask? Mai Si Chong at home?

323
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,100
Yeah

324
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,360
I called him a lot, but he didn't answer

325
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,870
Mai Si Chong didn't go to check the stimulant

326
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
May be

327
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,310
May be expelled from the university

328
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,510
What?

329
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,590
What did you say?

330
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,160
Did you get news yet?

331
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,230
Brother Chong, what's going on?

332
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,950
A friend at the provincial team told me that

333
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,760
Chong really wants to join the province team

334
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,540
It was reported that he cheated on qualifying matches

335
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,780
And the ranking as well

336
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,650
What!

337
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,670
Do you believe these gossip?

338
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,700
What is the rank of Chong in the training team?

339
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,770
You don't know?

340
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,310
Does he need to use stimulants?

341
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,060
Say so, yes

342
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,400
But that guy said, the day that Chong had to go to check for drugs

343
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,480
Did not go to check

344
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,800
Now people in the provincial team have decided that Chong is guilty

345
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,310
What's nonsense?

346
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,410
Really

347
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,410
People in the province team said that Chong was being eliminated

348
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,730
No way

349
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,400
Chong was framed

350
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,030
Brother Rui, you heard it, right?

351
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,980
You tell them that Chong was framed, right?

352
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,600
I think this news

353
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,010
It's unbelievable You guys, don't say anything

354
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,690
Right, don't say anything

355
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,570
Mai Si Chong still didn't reply your Wechat ?

356
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,100
I feel like he's weird these days

357
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,730
Chong didn't come to practice today

358
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,350
Everyone said he was cheating

359
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,210
Some said he did not go for a drug test

360
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,980
I called him and didn't answer

361
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,690
Guess that has something happened

362
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
But about this, you don't tell Mei Weiwei

363
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,980
I think Chong is in trouble right now

364
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,920
Why?

365
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,550
Nothing

366
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,580
Just now, at the university, news about the Mai Si Chong was spreading

367
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,950
You don't think too much

368
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,280
The university has announced him

369
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,370
Weiwei

370
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,030
When you and the Mai Si Chong went for drug testing

371
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,750
He said he had to change the hospital suddenly

372
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,770
Why?

373
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,630
Nothing

374
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,220
I guess there must be someone who is jealous or hate on the Mai Si Chong

375
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,760
But Ding Yi said, Mai Si Chong, there is absolutely no way to get something happen

376
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,970
You don't need to worry

377
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,830
Eat bun me here

378
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,460
Very good

379
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,650
Pei Pei Professor called here last night

380
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,490
Did you go to the hospital?

381
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,640
Done

382
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,180
About drug testing?

383
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:22,770
Not yet

384
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,840
Mai Si Chong

385
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Do you know what your situation is now?

386
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,440
Provincial team suspects you cheated

387
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,680
Is this a small thing?

388
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,420
Mom

389
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,270
I have my reasons

390
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,470
You don't have to ask again, can you?

391
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,990
You watched this child

392
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,010
You...

393
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,370
Before, because we trusted you

394
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,390
Therefore did not interfere with drug testing

395
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,920
But today the coach said you did not go for a stimulant test

396
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,260
We just don't understand

397
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,280
You, today I ask you very seriously

398
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,150
Are you using drugs?

399
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,390
How could it be?

400
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,180
So why don't you go for drug testing?

401
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
If you actually use drugs

402
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,970
You do not hide us. Don't lie to others

403
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,670
What did you do wrong?

404
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,680
Just turn to repent, revise

405
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,090
Swimming has always been my ambition

406
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,220
How can I make fun of something like this?

407
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,010
But the reason for not taking drug testing is because ...

408
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,440
Now I don't know how to explain

409
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,840
Let's say, I have a consciousness

410
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,450
Nothing else to say well?

411
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,180
Si Chong

412
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,470
Just a moment ago, Mom was a little flustered

413
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,720
So she spoke without thinking about it first

414
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,040
You don't mind

415
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,500
Oh Yeah

416
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,630
We trust you a lot

417
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,530
But even if we believe, it is useless

418
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,530
Province team must believe, so it to be ok

419
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,710
Coach said, it was very serious now

420
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,230
If you really made this big mistake

421
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,100
Probably even got fired. Do you know?

422
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,370
However

423
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,280
Just my parents believed that I did not cheat

424
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,860
I ate full and I'm leaving

425
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,330
Si Chong

426
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,290
Brother Yang, your coffee

427
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,740
Oh yeah, Peng Pai

428
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,890
About Mai Si Chong, is it cleared yet?

429
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,650
Mai Si Chong

430
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
What does he have?

431
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,880
The other day I met the club boss at the event

432
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,810
He told me that someone reported that Mai Si Chong

433
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,880
Cheat selection by using stimulants

434
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,140
You don't know?

435
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,100
Mai Si Chong pledged to the team that he would go for a substance testing Wednesday

436
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,900
But they don't go for no reason

437
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,290
This is not possible

438
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,760
I do not believe that Mai Si Chong would dare to do such a thing

439
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,420
This kid should be just angry

440
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,730
You are his senior. Try to ask him

441
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,190
Yes, I'll try to go back and ask him

442
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,470
Okay, let's go to work

443
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,760
Peng Pai, there is someone came to see you

444
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:43,080
