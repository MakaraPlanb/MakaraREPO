1
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,070
During this university A dangerous person appears

2
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,300
Please all students to be careful

3
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,740
If you suspect being stalked

4
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,890
Immediately notify the police

5
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,340
I'll take care of you

6
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,940
Why do you seem so worried about Weiwei?

7
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,130
Are you jealous?

8
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,540
If you want someone to protect you, come see me

9
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
I give you 20% off

10
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,290
You can do it?

11
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,070
If you don't keep following me I will be very grateful

12
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,530
I followed you?

13
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,950
There are many beautiful college students

14
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,130
I have good things, why am I interested in people like you?

15
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,490
You remember what you said and what you did to me

16
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:24,980
Why?

17
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,180
I'll say. Why?

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,030
You...

19
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,740
Weiwei

20
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,690
You think...

21
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,870
Do you think other people will see my strength last night?

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,880
Trust me

23
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,900
Even if others see

24
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,150
He might have dreamed of it

25
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,400
Don't worry

26
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,400
So I go to study first

27
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,810
So

28
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,540
After finish class, I'll come to you

29
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,140
Why you have to come to me?

30
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,930
There are a lot of things in the university lately

31
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,310
So I can protect you

32
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,960
Physical condition like me

33
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,040
You don't need to protect me

34
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,410
That's right

35
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,870
Can't you just want to protect?

36
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,170
Give  you

37
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,580
Ding Yi told me that...

38
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,310
Every time after he was scolded by Coach Pei Pei

39
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,220
Will eat this candy

40
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,220
You eat

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Maybe it will make it better

42
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,230
Okay

43
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:32,890
So I'm going

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,710
Finished class, will come to you

45
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:46,830
Junjun

46
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,650
Let's go out on Saturday. There is an exhibition

47
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,910
Invite him to come out as well

48
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,340
We all at the same university

49
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,190
It's a destiny

50
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,220
You don't have to invite

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,470
About the letter

52
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,490
If you don't have time, it's ok

53
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,270
Next Saturday I would like to invite you to have afternoon tea together

54
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,310
Are you free?

55
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,050
Junjun

56
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,060
Junjun

57
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,340
Why are you still at the dorm?

58
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,580
Where are you going?

59
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,030
I'll go and see if there is a CCTV in that area

60
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,570
Not sure that the villain might be captured

61
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,190
I'm going with you

62
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:42,890
Let's go

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,510
Weiwei

64
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,100
There are CCTV

65
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,390
Yes

66
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,630
Not sure that all images may be saved

67
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,600
So let's hurry and go look at the CCTV in the control room

68
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,020
Hurry up

69
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,530
Not in time to attend class

70
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:07,850
Go

71
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,770
Come in

72
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,800
What's the matter?

73
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,030
Hello

74
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,140
We are...

75
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,430
Something happened last night, so we wanted to see it

76
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,540
CCTV on Zhi Xing Road

77
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,110
So let me see it for you guys

78
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:29,960
Thank you

79
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,780
Zhi Xing Road

80
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,710
CCTV cameras on Zhi Xing Road last night a bit problem

81
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,390
Repairing

82
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,260
May not have been recorded

83
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,380
So...

84
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,010
When will the repair be completed?

85
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,790
I'm not sure

86
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,090
I still have to submit my application for study

87
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,070
This is late

88
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,020
Otherwise you will go back first

89
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,090
I'll check it again

90
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,950
Err...

91
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,260
But it is really important

92
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,070
Go

93
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,920
We just want to see...

94
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,500
I'm really busy

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,360
เราไปกันเถอะ

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,140
Let's go

97
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,250
Go

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,350
Weiwei

99
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,870
You just...

100
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,170
Found something?

101
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,300
Junjun

102
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,250
Why are you coming quietly?

103
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,210
I just...

104
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,830
Like I met a guy last night

105
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,290
So...

106
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,910
Or that the security guard is ...

107
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,440
I was just wondering

108
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,060
Because of his figure and also his legs

109
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,200
Very similar to the villain I met last night

110
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,920
Mei Weiwei

111
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,520
What are you thinking?

112
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,260
Two women investigate

113
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,150
Think heaven will protect you?

114
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,520
I know you don't have to say it

115
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,900
What do you know?

116
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Be careful about safety

117
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,990
I told you if there was something, you have to call me

118
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,170
I don't want to bother you every time

119
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,280
Give me a mobile phone

120
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,610
Don't forget next time

121
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,810
Have to call me

122
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,150
Weiwei

123
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,280
I suddenly realized that...

124
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,340
I made an appointment with a friend to see a cartoon exhibition

125
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,120
I will be back too

126
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,840
You can message me with anything

127
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,630
That you bought, don't you eat?

128
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,220
I am full

129
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,590
This evening, don't forget to come to the swimming pool

130
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,100
Weiwei

131
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,730
Can you pay attention?

132
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,960
That we tried many today, will affect the competition on the day after tomorrow

133
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,450
Again

134
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,700
Mai Sichong

135
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,780
How are you?

136
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,770
The neck is not okay?

137
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,510
Was the shock too much?

138
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,770
It seems...

139
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,320
Nothing

140
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,390
I was wrong

141
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Just kidding

142
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,640
Now, you were electric shocked, is it useful? I don't know

143
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,150
Why do you have to do this?

144
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,000
What if I can't control electricity?

145
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,350
In the past, it was not well controlled

146
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,130
It's still alright

147
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,070
All right

148
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,290
Time

149
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:19,920
Ready

150
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:20,820
Go

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,430
Fight

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,550
Quick

153
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:56,640
How much?

154
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,970
51.09 second

155
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,170
Faster again

156
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,140
My statistics have always been international level, right?

157
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,310
In the future

158
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,280
Wait for me a little more

159
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,460
when I win

160
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
You will be the first physical therapist of the Olympic champion

161
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,430
So what will you do if you lose?

162
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,890
I'm not losing

163
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,590
I won't

164
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,180
Weiwei

165
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,190
With that security guard, how are you going to deal with?

166
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,250
Otherwise, should we notify the police?

167
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,940
But what if we find the wrong person?

168
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,820
Investigate a little more, we will know

169
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,070
Now

170
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,000
Just luring a tiger out of the cave

171
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:41,820
Chong bro

172
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,980
Can you say something that is the language of the athletes?

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,630
But he is a security guard

174
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,790
He won't know how to deceive people?

175
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,050
Why are you saying another idiom?

176
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,350
You really are a creature that talks a lot

177
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,030
Can you talk about your family later?

178
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,750
Who is the same house?

179
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,370
Junjun

180
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,370
There is something I want to disturb you

181
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:58,500
What?

182
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,540
We can use beauty

183
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:00,930
Lure him

184
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Not like this

185
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,090
I didn't tell that Jun Jun to be the lure

186
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,540
So what you mean is ...

187
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,410
What do you guys think?

188
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,440
This woman is not bad at all

189
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,990
Stop tease now

190
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,760
Smile

191
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,750
Don't take it

192
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,740
I think

193
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,010
Still missing something

194
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,790
Missing what?

195
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,510
Which one do you want?

196
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,930
Ok stop

197
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:38,580
Come on

198
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,690
All right, stop

199
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,190
We have to keep thinking that

200
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,570
Where to catch this psychopath?

201
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,750
Of course, it must be the place where you meet him most often

202
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,610
Brother Chong, don't pretend to be playing

203
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,430
Stop

204
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,120
Go in

205
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,070
Sichong

206
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,910
Xie Rui

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Li Dai Xi

208
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,610
Let me out

209
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,270
Din Yi

210
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,610
Can you be a man?

211
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:14,990
Go, hurry up

212
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,100
Hello, Chong bro

213
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,910
We have grown to this size already. There is no other way?

214
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,220
Ting Yi started speaking with an idiom

215
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,340
Sister

216
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,300
Now you are facing humiliation

217
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,260
Wait to catch that psychopath. Will definitely make a name for the family

218
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Wait, Li Dai Xi

219
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,020
Wait for me to catch that psychopath first. I'll teach you how to say the right way

220
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,180
Where will you go?

221
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,570
Stop

222
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,410
You go away

223
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,430
He is a security guard

224
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:00,360
Student

225
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,190
Let me go

226
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,180
I just made a mistake for the first time

227
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,750
Next time I don't dare to do it

228
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,020
It doesn't matter if you do it the first time

229
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,580
We called police, take him

230
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,510
Please don't

231
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,500
Let me go

232
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,110
Very dedicated

233
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,210
But even if you are a man, you shouldn't catch the culprit yourself

234
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,390
Now men are insecure

235
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,610
Everyone

236
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,600
Being brave is good

237
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,250
But when in danger

238
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,440
The first thing to do is notify the police immediately

239
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,690
Understand?

240
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,300
Okay, so we're going

241
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,930
So that CCTV

242
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,820
Should be able to capture the villain, right?

243
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,690
I've watched that CCTV already

244
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,040
No scene can be used at all

245
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,220
Don't think

246
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,620
We...

247
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,470
Shall we celebrate?

248
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,500
Of course, let's celebrate

249
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,470
I put so much effort

250
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,390
It's everyone's work, isn't it?

251
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
What

252
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:00,840
I didn't help?

253
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,340
Let's go

254
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,470
Trust me

255
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,010
CCTV has a limited time

256
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,790
When the time is over, it will automatically delete

257
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,020
Cheers

258
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,810
Today we do a big thing

259
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,850
Should universities give us a banner of praise?

260
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,590
Yes

261
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,830
Should give us

262
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,680
Actually

263
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,860
I prepared

264
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,330
To everyone already

265
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,290
Really?

266
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,090
Not joking

267
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,190
Put it in our dormitory

268
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,150
Why put it in your dorm?

269
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,890
Building B Room 517

270
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,700
Our room

271
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,360
Yes

272
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,670
Is it a love letter?

273
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,550
The two of you couldn't have ...

274
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,200
Junjun

275
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,790
You don't like me, right?

276
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,300
Insane

277
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,340
Like you?

278
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,150
She must have taken the wrong drug

279
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,260
Then someone likes you? Li Dai Xi?

280
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,170
Junjun

281
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,980
You look at these 3 people who do you like?

282
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,770
No

283
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,280
Just say it

284
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,830
I will recommend

285
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,180
You like Mai Sichong

286
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,770
I drink for you both

287
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,230
Why drink for us?

288
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,300
Everyone let's celebrate

289
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,610
Come on, everyone cheers

290
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,010
Cheers

291
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,910
Li Dai Xi

292
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,680
You are so heavy, who is going to support?

293
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:47,990
You like me

294
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,240
So you won't let me lose weight, right?

295
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,980
What practice should you go to?

296
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,780
Build muscle

297
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,330
What

298
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,470
Continue?

299
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,800
Muscle

300
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,110
That means your waist is not good

301
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,580
You are!

302
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,200
Sis Wei

303
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,200
Why does she like to say I like her?

304
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,740
Li Dai Xi

305
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,910
I see you like me

306
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,130
Obviously, I'm the one you like

307
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,990
All right, Junjun, help me

308
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,510
Junjun

309
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:14,680
Come on

310
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,560
We're going back

311
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,170
Be careful

312
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:22,680
Xie Rui

313
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,100
Jun Jun is my childhood friend

314
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:24,630
Do not bully her

315
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,610
Have you ever seen me bully anyone?

316
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,960
No

317
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,430
Here

318
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,390
There is another crazy person

319
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,160
Let's go

320
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,080
What are you watching?

321
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,330
This time is a warm-up match

322
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,860
To see the work of everyone

323
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,260
You guys can relax

324
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,250
Except Ding Yi

325
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,120
You guys don't need

326
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,930
to be pressured

327
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:55,870
Coach

328
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,500
Go practice

329
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,060
Don't linger

330
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,130
Tomorrow I have a competition

331
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,230
Will you come to see?

332
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,020
Senior, do you wait a long time?

333
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,430
Not at all

334
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,950
You have no something to do, right?

335
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,180
No, I don't

336
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,710
All cleared

337
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,140
Even if the psychopath has been caught

338
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,290
But walking at night have to be careful, you know

339
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,530
I knew

340
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,550
Thank you

341
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,290
Why are you free today?

342
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,530
Before, I was very busy

343
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,840
So these two days were stopped

344
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,780
Have a little time to rest

345
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,350
Tomorrow is my birthday

346
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,030
Our appointment, you have not forgotten, right?

347
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,010
Tomorrow?

348
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,320
Not the day after tomorrow?

349
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,430
You remembered my birthday wrongly

350
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,390
You've something to do tomorrow?

351
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,510
Tomorrow I have a competition. Will you come to see?

352
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,230
That we tried many today, will affect the competition on the day after tomorrow

353
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,800
I reserved a delicious restaurant

354
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,500
You probably won't leave me alone

355
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:04,790
Okay

356
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,960
On the way, haven't eaten anything yet?

357
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,150
When you haven't come yet, I ordered a strawberry cake that you liked

358
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,300
Thank you

359
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,890
The competition is about to begin.

360
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,750
Invite the contestants to the track

361
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,190
The staff will test each person's body

362
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,460
To keep the competition going smoothly

363
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,440
You intend this

364
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,470
Wei Wei saw, that she must be happy

365
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
If finished, we will go out first

366
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,030
I wish you success

367
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:01,930
Thank you

368
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,710
I go out to help

369
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
How are the windows and doors?

370
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,570
Junjun

371
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,500
How did you get here?

372
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,400
Come see you guys

373
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,740
Why are you in such a hurry?

374
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,460
Anyway, you can't get 1st place

375
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,830
Don't run to me

376
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,480
This time I got another last place

377
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,820
Coach Pei Pei will definitely take me to death

378
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:28,700
Fight

379
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,390
Where's Weiwei?

380
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,660
Has been out since morning

381
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,150
Should have gone to Peng Pai senior's birthday party

382
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,520
But she left me telling you that

383
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,190
Fight this time

384
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,220
Start the competition

385
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,070
Everyone

386
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,520
Ready

387
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,220
- Is that he ... 
- Is it late?

388
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,200

00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,260
This's Mai Sichong, right?

00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:21,530
Yes

391
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,630
The person behind will overtake him

392
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,670
How does he swim?

393
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,990

394
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,010

397
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,900

399
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,890
What's going on?

400
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,340
God, why is it like this?

401
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,300
What's going on?

402
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,690
Before this was not like this

403
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,230
Will lose

404
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,290

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,070
Weiwei

406
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:13,870
Sister Qiao qiao

407
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,230
Didn't you go to Peng Pai's birthday party?

408
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,000
My friend on the swim team had a little accident

409
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,850
I'm going to see him

410
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,960

413
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,770

414
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,670

415
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,540

Today I have a really important thing to do

431
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,100
Probably can't go

432
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,740
Don't wait for me

433
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,730

434
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,730

436
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:19,700
You...

437
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,190
You didn't go to the birthday party?

438
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,080
Is Mai Sichong win?

439
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,270

440
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,080
Lost

441
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,580
Not just losing

442
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,670
It's also the worst result since joining the team

443
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,680
54.57 second

444
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,070

446
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,820

448
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,900
Sis Wei did not go to watch Bro Chong compete

449
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,070
Two days Chong Bor kept swimming and not going anywhere

450
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,250
On the results of your health examination

451
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,860
You don't want to tell me?

452
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,000
I heard he had an injury. But did not let the Professor know

453
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,320
He's a college representative, isn't he?

454
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,000
He must have really finished

455
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,250
Will his sports career end?

456
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,070
Mai Sichong

457
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,880
Mai Sicong wake up
