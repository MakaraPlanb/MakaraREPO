1
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,010
If able to control the voltage

2
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,650
Electricity can also help heal exercise injuries

3
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,750
50.30 seconds

4
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,060
Good job

5
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,640
0.4 seconds slower than the statistic you were in high school

6
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,940
Mai Sichong

7
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,550
Why you call me out?

8
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,770
Help me record the time

9
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,720
Ready

10
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:12,870
Go

11
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,690
How much time?

12
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,870
54.46 seconds

13
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,260
That's 54 seconds

14
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,100
Why do I need you to come and order?

15
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,090
Okay, so call me what's the matter?

16
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,900
Mewi Weiwei

17
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,340
Please Shock electricity on me

18
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,010
I say

19
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,570
Please Shock electricity on me

20
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Are you crazy?

21
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,690
Stop

22
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,330
Are you crazy?

23
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,540
I am not crazy

24
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm seriously

25
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,830
No, I'm not okay

26
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,190
Why?

27
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
What?

28
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,190
If I make you...

29
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
So, what should to do?

30
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,550
You make me what?

31
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,580
Make me fall in love with you?

32
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,750
Mei Weiwei

33
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,520
Never known before

34
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,000
That your brain has such a problem

35
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,140
Okay

36
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,080
I'm wrong, are you satisfied yet?

37
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,210
So, how about...

38
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,730
When you shock electricity on me

39
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,300
I'll close my eyes

40
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,210
I promise

41
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,760
I won't make the same mistake twice

42
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,580
That still not okay

43
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,090
I do not guarantee my electric

44
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,320
I can't be responsible for you

45
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,560
Trust me

46
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,340
You don't have to take responsibility

47
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,530
He is Mai Sichong,right?

48
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,200
Go go go

49
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,830
That's enough, you don't have to say

50
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,880
Hurry back to practice

51
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,260
Go

52
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,460
Do it by yourself

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:40,740
Forgot it!

54
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,500
There is not much time

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,060
Anyway, you have to shock me

56
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,580
For what?

57
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,780
Why is it so important?

58
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,090
You don't say?

59
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,230
You don't say, so I go

60
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,610
Okay

61
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,150
I'm wrong.

62
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,260
I will tell you all

63
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,610
That is...

64
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Please shock on me

65
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,330
Maybe I might swim faster

66
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,230
I'm not sick

67
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,530
You will also say that you are not sick

68
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,510
Hello Bunchang

69
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,490
Hello Weiwei

70
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,870
Where are you?

71
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,540
Everyone has arrived, only you are left

72
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,060
Okay, I'll go now.

73
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,190
So, I'm leaving

74
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,520
Don't talk about this anymore

75
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,190
Just find someone else

76
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,760
Mei Weiwei

77
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,620
Besides you, who else can I go to?

78
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,400
Sorry I'm late

79
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,670
Weiwei

80
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,540
You told us to come here

81
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,610
For...

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,390
To announce a particular issue

83
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,810
I and Bunchang are preparing

84
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,880
A big plan that will help everyone graduate quickly

85
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,310
This plan is...

86
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,770
Established a physical therapy club

87
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,410
Clap your hands

88
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,410
Conclude that all

89
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,750
It is a club that is suitable for our profession

90
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,840
Not only makes this knowledge popular

91
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,100
It can also help students recover from physical exercise

92
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,990
And then?

93
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,190
So

94
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,870
Everyone

95
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,660
Would you like to join the club together?

96
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,610
Cooperate together

97
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:16,830
Weiwei

98
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,010
Even though last time you helped me present my work

99
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,680
I have to thank you very much

100
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,280
But what kind of physical club is this?

101
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,540
I'm not free

102
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,610
And also not interested

103
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,730
Yuxin

104
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,040
Actually we care about you

105
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,110
Will get retired for missing school often

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
That's not good

107
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,170
So I can find a matter of handing over the letter

108
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,210
Has anything else?

109
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,510
If you don't have, I'll go back and sleep

110
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,920
Yuxin

111
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,090
Weiwei

112
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,940
Club

113
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,360
I don't join too

114
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,620
The owner of the bar is still waiting for me

115
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,550
I'll go now

116
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,320
Jinjin

117
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:56,900
Weiwei

118
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,140
Don't give up

119
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,980
This is the way of the revolution

120
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,170
A hundred times a thousand times The road is still a long way

121
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,710
You say is right

122
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,340
I won't give up

123
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,350
Bunchang

124
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,580
I have some question want to ask you

125
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,020
The last time you spoke in class

126
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,730
Electricity can help restore the body

127
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,110
Then is it possible that...

128
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,700
That electricity stimulates the body's potential

129
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,880
For example

130
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,420
Makes it run faster, something like that

131
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,260
Electrotherapy is the most basic type of therapy.

132
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,130
That I have learned is...

133
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,600
It helps the muscles to relax and control the nerves

134
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,400
But as you say

135
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,770
Stimulate potential

136
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,920
I've never heard of it before

137
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,050
Electrotherapy

138
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,850
Who said that only Mei Weiwei would have to help?

139
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I can do it by myself

140
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,320
Mei Weiei

141
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,330
You come to study by yourself today?

142
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,840
Yeah

143
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,010
Don't unfold me

144
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,670
This student...

145
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,370
Who

146
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:05,710
Hello Professor

147
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm Meiweiwei

148
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,740
Mei Weiwei

149
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,060
Why don't you look like the last time?

150
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,670
May be because...

151
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,190
I just cut my hair

152
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,810
So you...

153
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
can't remember me

154
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,950
Stand up

155
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,870
I teach physical therapy

156
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,420
You probably think I'm old now

157
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,330
Your appearance, I would never remember

158
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,630
The height is this different

159
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,180
Still say that you two are the same person

160
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,180
This kid is so stubborn

161
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:39,850
Tell me

162
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,030
What field do you study?

163
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,780
What's your name?

164
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,130
Professor

165
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,380
I'm Mei Weiwei

166
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,890
If you really are Mei Weiwei

167
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,740
So last week it was a fake

168
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,240
There is no reason to come to class

169
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:50,870
This moment

170
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,110
Let's start

171
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,410
Weiwei

172
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,380
Weiwei

173
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,710
you...

174
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,290
Are you ok?

175
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,740
I'm fine

176
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,620
Very fine

177
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,380
Just didn't check the name of the class

178
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,100
Next time, we can dress up for class again

179
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,980
It's good that you can think like this

180
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,720
About that content

181
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,510
you don't worry

182
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,410
I will help you

183
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,810
Thank you Bunchang

184
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,100
Then I'll go to work 

185
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:25,740
Weiwei

186
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,730
Bro

187
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,420
Thank you

188
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:38,460
Thank you

189
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,910
Bro

190
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,390
I'm really sorry for that day.

191
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,940
Which makes you guys must not be okay

192
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,030
Never mind

193
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,470
You and Mai Schichong

194
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,420
What's wrong with that?

195
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,710
No

196
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,600
I and he just

197
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,230
Don't mention it

198
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,120
In fact, a good person like him

199
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,420
Did not join the provincial team

200
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,720
It's really a pity

201
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,670
Our company has always wanted to sign a contract with him

202
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,150
sign a contract

203
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,390
It's like Sun Yang?

204
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,030
Yes

205
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,670
Weiwei

206
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,850
Did Sichong ever tell you?

207
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,150
Why he didn't join the provincial team

208
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,850
Never

209
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,940
What reason could he have?

210
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,610
My seniors said

211
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,350
It could be due to a serious injury

212
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,140
And it might be because

213
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,290
Want to go to a club abroad

214
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,390
But they just guessed

215
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,500
I am a swimmer How can I hurt my knee?

216
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,010
Please shock on me

217
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,250
Maybe I might swim faster

218
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,570
I'm not sure either

219
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,850
Don't reply to my message anymore

220
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,630
No answer

221
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,640
Hey you...

222
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,430
I can remember

223
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,580
Are you Weiwei's classmates?

224
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,790
You are Mai Sichong?

225
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,080
Yes

226
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,900
I'm Linbaihui

227
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,060
I'm her classmate

228
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,620
Hui student

229
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,740
Ask you something

230
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,660
Where is Weiwei?

231
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,360
Weiwei went to the coffee shop of the university

232
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,760
Ok thank you Hui student

233
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,190
Hui student?

234
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:15,900
Weiwei

235
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
Are you free tomorrow?

236
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,240
Why?

237
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,270
Let's go see a movie together

238
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,390
Compensate that day, did not say goodbye

239
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,070
okay?

240
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,430
okay

241
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,320
so,I'll buy ticket

242
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:25,660
Okay

243
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,490
Mei Weiwei

244
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,450
Why don't you reply to me?

245
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:29,550
I...

246
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,430
Bro

247
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,410
Sichong

248
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,510
I'm thinking of going to the pool for you.

249
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,140
I'm currently an intern at FT Sports

250
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,060
It's a company specializing in sports brokers

251
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,310
Are you interested in participating?

252
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,090
In addition to training There are still other contests

253
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,110
What do you mean?

254
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,390
You take advantage of your appearance and height

255
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,060
Can be a super star

256
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,430
Besides being a professional athlete, this is probably the best choice.

257
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,250
You know

258
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,590
Athlete's career is at high risk.

259
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,740
I understand

260
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,020
Thank you

261
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,190
But in my heart I have only one goal

262
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,900
Be the first of the provincial team

263
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,060
Compared to being a super star

264
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,380
I think

265
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,830
The pool seemed to suit me better

266
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,880
Becoming a professional player

267
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,760
Would be much better

268
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,370
But this walk is like a gamble

269
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,460
But if injury occurs during games or practice

270
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,810
There is still another option

271
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,830
Is it really considered to have a break, right?

272
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,770
It's not necessary, senior

273
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,220
Still have breath, Life has to be at risk

274
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,810
A blessing is not a curse. Bad luck is inevitable

275
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,060
No matter what happens

276
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,620
Why bother

277
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,150
I still have another practice. I go first

278
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,490
Mei Weiwei

279
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,040
Bro, then I will go first.

280
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,370
Will you stop calling my full name next?

281
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,840
Do like me as your servant

282
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,380
I haven't said anything yet

283
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,740
It's only you who follow me

284
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,380
I'm lazy to talk to you already

285
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,430
Senior Pengpai made an offer to you

286
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,990
You haven't thought so well, why hurry to refuse?

287
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,460
Let me stop swimming

288
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,450
No way

289
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,820
Who made you stop swimming?

290
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:22,820
Stupid

291
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,090
What did you say?

292
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,940
You say I'm stupid?

293
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,360
What right do you have that I am stupid?

294
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,910
I just said so

295
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,680
You...

296
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,450
Do you have anything to hide?

297
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,650
How can I have something to hide?

298
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,130
Overthinking

299
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:40,810
Go

300
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,950
Let me go

301
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,310
Why are you taking me here?

302
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,270
I've researched many times

303
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,460
So brought her to shock me

304
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,540
Yeah

305
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,480
I begged Dr. Wu Tang several times to use this electrotherapy room

306
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,840
Give it to me

307
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,060
You don't think that you...

308
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,060
Actually, you are suitable to be a physical therapist

309
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,580
No, I'm not

310
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,990
I just want to change a major

311
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,120
You...

312
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:36,970
Look

313
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,540
Shock with a little electric

314
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,740
My knees move more smoothly

315
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,110
If next, you give me an electric shock every day

316
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,910
My fitness

317
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,280
Will definitely recover quickly

318
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,730
Mai Sichong

319
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,420
Why don't you join the province team?

320
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,710
That's...

321
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,770
Just don't want to enter

322
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,710
Don't ask anymore

323
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,940
What are you doing?

324
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,570
Based on your appearance

325
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,070
When you lie your heart will beat faster

326
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,460
So now

327
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,930
You look in my eyes and tell me

328
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,820
That your body is not a problem

329
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,170
My heart rate is normal

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,490
I told you to say

331
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,130
That your body is not a problem

332
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,670
My body is not a problem

333
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,630
You can't look

334
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,210
Can't look

335
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,630
Deceit

336
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,770
I didn't mean

337
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,260
Weiwei

338
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,710
Weiwei

339
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,470
I'm wrong

340
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,070
I'm really wrong

341
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,410
Seriously, you shock me

342
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,090
No way

343
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,500
Err...

344
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,490
I will give you everything

345
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,010
I didn't want you to take responsibility

346
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,210
If you talk about it again

347
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:34,860
I'm going to shock you

348
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,180
Okay

349
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:36,960
Let's shock me

350
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,690
Shock me

351
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:42,810
Give it to me

352
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:44,860
Unless you shock me

353
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,270
Shock me

354
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,090
Give it to me

355
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,460
No

356
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,300
Give it to me

357
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,570
No

358
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,050
You've stepped on my shoes

359
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,600
Can you...

360
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,220
Can you forgive me?

361
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,390
Give it to me

362
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,190
Mai Sichong

363
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,910
You can borrow the keys to the electric treatment room, right?

364
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,830
You can also shock yourself

365
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,970
Why you have to come and ask me to help?

366
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,320
But only you that can shock me

367
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,600
And my training statistics have improved

368
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,330
Who knows why it must be you?

369
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,480
But...

370
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,710
The problem is not that it cannot be helped

371
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,690
From time to time I have never been shock continuously

372
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,730
Last time I shock you 2 times

373
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,290
Your voice is still like that

374
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,150
I don't dare to imagine

375
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:49,780
Weiwei

376
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:50,970
I won't let you take the responsibility

377
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,630
I will take responsibility for myself

378
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,320
Only the heavens know this story

379
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,120
You know, I know

380
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,480
Even if...

381
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,150
Even if there is a problem

382
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,360
I promise you no one will cause you trouble

383
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,090
But what if the problem happened?

384
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,510
No

385
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,730
I am going to have a problem

386
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,420
I don't agree

387
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,030
Weiwei

388
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,170
When I was in high school

389
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,470
I used to hit a record at 50.35 seconds

390
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,050
With this statistic

391
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,530
I can stick to the Olympics

392
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,480
Seriously

393
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,170
I, Mai Sichong, this life...

394
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,530
The most important thing is swimming

395
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,820
So...

396
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,750
No matter what happens

397
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,980
No matter what the consequences will be

398
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
I will bear it

399
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:34,760
Trust me

400
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,640
Okay?

401
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,910
oKay

402
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,030
All right

403
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,270
Let's go

404
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,070
Okay

405
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,120
Now no one here

406
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,150
Let's start

407
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,810
Come on

408
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,000
Start

409
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,690
Okay start

410
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,750
Do you feel it?

411
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:38,680
No

412
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,290
How about this?

413
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,100
Mei Weiwei, are you done?

414
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,390
I feel it

415
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,040
I feel it

416
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,540
I feel it

417
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,170
Hurry up

418
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,270
Hurry to practice quickly

419
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,990
My bag

420
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,750
Hurry up

421
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,460
What do you mean?

422
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,610
Isn't it because I'm trying to recharge you?

423
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,420
I'm afraid that you'll turn out of energy

424
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,450
Next, there is no power to shock, what do I do?

425
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,660
You can doubt me

426
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,060
But you can't doubt my electric power.

427
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,230
So why don't you eat?

428
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,930
I'm just afraid that you have something to ask for me again

429
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
So don't dare to eat

430
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,490
How can I do that

431
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,640
Then I feed you

432
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,820
I have hands, I can do it myself

433
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,540
What do you do again?

434
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,210
Can you eat by yourself?

435
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Stupid

436
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,860
I just really wanted to thank you, so fed you

437
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,640
Hurry and eat

438
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,050
Really delicious

439
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,890
Try this

440
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Who believes

441
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,060
Sichong

442
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,920
Recently, new movies are just getting popular

443
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,720
We go to see together, okay?

444
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,820
What movie?

445
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,350
What's the title?

446
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,000
You check it out

447
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,260
Electric shock

448
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,170
That's the name of the flash

449
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,010
Also, that's not Marvel's either

450
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,750
That's an American movie

451
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,330
Chong bro

452
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,310
You're not going to book tickets, right?

453
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Xiao Chong student

454
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,780
You're not going to pay movie for me, right?

455
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,780
Like that, I'm shy

456
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,090
Don't be shy

457
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,770
Didn't invite you

458
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,370
And watch you look at me

459
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,630
Is it too cruel?

460
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,270
I...

461
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,740
I just look at what it is

462
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,000
Weiwei

463
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,070
Why are you here?

464
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,290
Do you not practice today?

465
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,050
No, I don't

466
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,700
To thank you, I want to pay a movie for you.

467
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,500
Weiwei

468
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,540
Bro

469
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,270
How long have you been waiting?

470
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:08,990
Not long

471
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:11,990
Sichong

472
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
So let's go see a movie

473
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:14,630
Go

474
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,670
Wait

475
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,050
Which movie?

476
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,240
Incidentally, I want to watch movies too

477
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,120
Let's watch together

478
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,060
However, I haven't bought a ticket yet

479
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,530
Let's go

480
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,670
Let go with us

481
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,130
Thanks

482
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:13,980
What are you doing?

483
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,160
Aren't you hungry?

484
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,400
If you are hungry then you can eat a lot

485
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,190
So irrational

486
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,060
Weiwei

487
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
I go to the bathroom 

488
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,300
Weiwei

489
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,340
You look at this villain

490
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,920
So stupid

491
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:01,960
Weiwei

492
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,110
Weiwei

493
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,820
Is it over?

494
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,460
Not yet

495
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,370
Are you sleepy?

496
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,850
No

497
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,850
Keep watching

498
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,500
Err...

499
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,810
I'm sorry

500
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,150
Just half movie, I fell asleep

501
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,350
Half

502
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,820
In just the first 10 minutes, aren't you sleeping?

503
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,710
No, I'm not

504
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,640
So you tell

505
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,530
In which scene did the villain appear?

506
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,770
Enough, Mei Weiwei

507
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,860
You don't seem to understand

508
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,590
You understand?

509
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,220
Only look at the climax scene

510
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,650
Do you know a lot?

511
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,740
You're asleep, aren't you?

512
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,420
Come on, Sichong

513
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,300
Usually Weiwei doesn't like to watch movies like this anyway

514
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,390
She just likes the environment

515
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,590
It makes her relax

516
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,550
So

517
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,910
Would be inevitable if going to sleep

518
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,670
You don't take too much thought

519
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,740
All right

520
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,060
Tomorrow morning at 6:30 a.m.

521
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,070
Don't forget

522
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,350
Is there a queue tomorrow?

523
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,390
Recently we have studied

524
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,630
Bro

525
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,850
I'm leaving

526
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,830
Then I go to send you

527
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,730
No need
