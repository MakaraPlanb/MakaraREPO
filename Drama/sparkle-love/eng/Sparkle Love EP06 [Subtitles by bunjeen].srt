1
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,300
Wei Wei usually don't like this kind of movies anyway

2
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,750
Would be inevitable if going to sleep

3
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,860
Tomorrow morning at 6:30 a.m.

4
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,450
Don't forget it!

5
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,980
Recently we have studied

6
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,000
Then I go send you

7
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:03,670
No need

8
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,460
Mai Sichong

9
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,590
Pikachu

10
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,010
You're late

11
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,370
I'm just too late

12
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,810
Who gave you an appointment this morning?

13
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,520
You look, my eyes are completely dark

14
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,030
Are you sleepy?

15
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Throwing a ball and open eyes wide

16
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,050
Who wants to play football with you

17
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,250
Hurry up

18
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,730
The shock is done so I can go

19
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,960
Pikachu, you're not going to run out of power, right?

20
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,800
Who runs out of power?

21
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,630
Take it for another day

22
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,410
I'm really sleepy

23
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,300
Wait

24
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,990
What else?

25
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,930
You have to take the ball from me

26
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,950
And today I will let you go

27
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,700
Who wants to compete with you

28
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,340
Bro

29
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,310
Mei Weiwei

30
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,770
The electricity in your body

31
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,380
Too strong

32
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:12,910
I'll go

33
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,620
Why are you calling me now?

34
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,080
Sichong

35
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,410
Brother Fan, who is the student council president. Will join our team

36
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,520
I made an appointment this afternoon

37
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,700
Stay at the room

38
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,180
Get it

39
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,200
You come?

40
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,650
I think

41
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,180
This teammate

42
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,450
Not too many problems?

43
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,150
Did you have a problem today so that you brought me to you?

44
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,900
Xiang bro

45
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,540
Isn't this your duty?

46
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,080
My friend would like to established a club

47
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,110
You just need to sign your name

48
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,910
Sign my name?

49
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,430
Okay

50
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,540
But you had to apologize before

51
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,430
His neck is not good

52
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,820
Otherwise, let me apologize instead?

53
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,130
What does it have to do with you?

54
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,350
Request one get another one

55
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,230
I am the person...

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,080
that's totally straightforward

57
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,420
Say apologize, will I be signed?

58
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,130
I am the person...

59
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,980
Mood is not stable

60
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,520
If I make it, then in the end it is not signed

61
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Otherwise ...

62
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,220
Xiang bro

63
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,900
sit sit sit

64
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,490
Chong want to say...

65
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,610
he hope you can be honest what you want me to do

66
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,250
Everyone is a friend

67
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,380
Are you really friends?

68
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:28,870
All right

69
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,210
During this time the student council

70
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,630
There is not much support

71
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,820
Still lacking 20,000 yuan

72
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,840
I heard that his house is on the mountain

73
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,540
This must be bothering you

74
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,220
Did you do this right?

75
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,320
Okay

76
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,350
Okay

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,370
I'll help you with this

78
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,440
The story of the two of us

79
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,360
Considered to stop

80
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:47,690
Are you satisfied?

81
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,640
So bro...

82
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,720
He knew from the beginning

83
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,700
Since high school

84
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,390
There was once when they passed the classroom

85
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,650
Saw you secretly charging the game console

86
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,280
Mai Sichong knew already?

87
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,970
Yes

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,060
But he won't tell anyone else

89
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,790
Because he likes you

90
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,990
Is it worth she trust him?

91
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,790
It was me who was not careful to shock him

92
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,890
My electric

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,520
Making people see illusions misunderstand it is love at first sight

94
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,200
So he....

95
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,530
However, when he regained consciousness

96
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Will understand all by hisself

97
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,800
So at high school

98
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,820
They misunderstand you because of this?

99
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,940
But it's okay

100
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,890
Everything has passed

101
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,750
Bro

102
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,750
I also have another assignment

103
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,440
Very busy

104
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,770
I have other business

105
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,300
So excuse me

106
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,560
Bye bye

107
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,230
You just confessed to your senior

108
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,870
But he knew so long

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,100
Why do you look so worried?

110
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,460
I and him studied at junior high school together before

111
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,300
He is my senior

112
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,650
But...

113
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,260
Later, we never met him again

114
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,170
You think...

115
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,830
Only you think you hide from the world

116
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,020
Really good?

117
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,320
They all know you are Pikachu

118
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,760
Got it

119
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,950
You think everyone is like you?

120
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,900
Cringe to hope for electricity from me

121
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,310
Trust me

122
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,540
I won't tell anyone else

123
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,660
If more people knew I will protect you

124
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,870
If someone bullies you

125
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,010
I'll help you get revenge

126
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Who do you think you are?

127
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,520
Why?

128
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,860
You have to take care of yourself about electricity, don't let others know again

129
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,420
Are you sleeping yet?

130
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,570
No

131
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,340
Not yet

132
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,590
I have something to ask you about...

133
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,490
Many years ago

134
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,480
I used to misunderstand one senior

135
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,430
Not long ago, we met again

136
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,020
I don't know what I should do in front of him

137
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,420
Weiwei

138
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,490
I am not very good at this matter

139
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,070
Do you like him?

140
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,090
No

141
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,320
If you don't like it then tell him clearly

142
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,030
The longer this matter, the more difficult it is

143
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,850
Until then, you didn't know what to say

144
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:00,880
Come on

145
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,610
Hurry to drink

146
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,790
Mom

147
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,270
Come into the room, why don't you knock on the door?

148
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,540
You came back, did not tell me too

149
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,890
Can I ask you?

150
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,090
Do knees hurt?

151
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,930
It's okay

152
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,530
Never mind

153
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,570
So hurry and drink

154
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,470
Mom

155
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,480
Otherwise

156
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,400
You taught me to look at the ledger

157
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
The past

158
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,150
We suspect that the student president will make false accounts

159
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,470
Therefore gave a friend at the council's ledger copy room

160
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,110
I don't understand, mom please help me.

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,900
When did my son care about other people?

162
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,270
About Weiwei, right?

163
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,220
No

164
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,860
Just because...

165
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
For justice

166
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,410
For justice

167
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,200
So you can read by yourself

168
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,060
Mom

169
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,520
Yes

170
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,750
I said that

171
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,590
Will still lie to my mother again

172
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,950
Mai Sichong

173
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,190
What's happen?

174
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,470
What is your goal?

175
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,550
Look at your dark eyes

176
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,450
What did you do last night?

177
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,970
I let you practice and rest

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,320
You think I can't look?

179
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,500
Coach, I will sue

180
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,570
Brother Chong did not return to the dorm last night

181
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:16,740
Make trouble

182
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,930
Will still cause me more problems

183
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
It doesn't make it any better

184
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,390
You two

185
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,430
Today

186
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:21,960
20 laps

187
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,110
If not complete

188
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,330
Can't eat

189
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,470
Coach

190
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
What did I do?

191
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,630
I do...

192
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,820
I didn't swim enough?

193
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,570
Brother Rui

194
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,220
The coach punished us to swim 20 laps

195
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,890
If I don't have Chong, will definitely do better work

196
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,500
Chong bro

197
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,030
Why are you asking me to copy the Student Council account?

198
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,660
Brother Fan, is there a problem?

199
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,420
Last night, my mother and I sat all night reading

200
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,110
That Fan Zheng Xiang

201
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,460
Will definitely use the student council's money

202
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,900
Didn't you sleep all night last night because you checked this one?

203
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,030
But actually

204
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,860
It's not really about Fan

205
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,220
Fan has a problem so he has to get some money from you?

206
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,500
He wasted the public. Then I caught

207
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
Considered fair

208
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,510
That's not true

209
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,680
Chong bro

210
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,490
Made for women

211
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Mei Lin professor

212
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,140
Disturb the teacher

213
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,540
Can you seal it for us?

214
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,410
Can't

215
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,350
You have to get the student council president to sign first.

216
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,950
He signed his name so I could pump it up

217
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,950
Professor

218
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,010
Please help us

219
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,170
Student Council

220
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,390
We've gone already

221
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,690
Then go again

222
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,270
Talk to them clearly

223
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,320
I have already authorized the student council

224
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,750
But we've contacted them already

225
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,500
All right

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,900
If you guys don't have any problems

227
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,860
I still have class

228
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,710
What should to do?

229
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,700
Never mind

230
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,740
I...

231
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,180
Will try to go to the student council again

232
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,390
Let me do it

233
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,830
Tilted a little more to the right

234
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,530
Hello bro

235
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,360
Let me help you

236
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,950
What are the two of you guys?

237
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,010
Even small things can not do this

238
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,970
About that day, I was wrong

239
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:15,680
Otherwise ...

240
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,710
Wait, where are the maggots?

241
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,900
Whistling around here, a little faster

242
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,260
If you don't approve the club application, give it to me

243
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,700
I don't want to ...

244
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,630
After attaching, you can go

245
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,670
Wait

246
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,630
What are you doing?

247
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,080
I'm sorry, Brother Fan

248
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,790
You're okay, right?

249
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:45,830
Xixi

250
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,130
I'm okay

251
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,350
Did you get scalded?

252
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,540
No

253
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,450
Are you really okay?

254
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,570
Really okay

255
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,630
You don't get scalded,it's good.

256
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,350
I'm leaving

257
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,370
Bye bye

258
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,450
Who allowed to bully Weiwei?

259
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,210
Idiot, Wei Wei

260
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,540
Let's shock him to die

261
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,140
Really

262
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,410
Li Dai Xi

263
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,620
Do you intend?

264
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,430
Must be scared

265
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,670
It's not surprise at all

266
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,230
Look at his four eyes

267
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,460
I want to kill him

268
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,350
But why do you have to tease him?

269
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,340
Or same Sichong?

270
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,350
do it for sis Wei

271
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
Mai Sichong, why?

272
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,910
That's four-eyed elder bullying sis Wei about opening a club.

273
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,640
But Chong bro managed it already

274
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,030
Man in love

275
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,000
Wait

276
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,580
Mei Weiwei will open a club

277
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,810
She lives in the same dormitory with you, don't you know?

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,110
Interesting

279
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,670
Li Dai Xi

280
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,330
You haven't eaten yet, right?

281
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:42,950
Go

282
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,570
I will take you to eat

283
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,740
Don't eat

284
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,240
Losing weight

285
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,310
sis Wei

286
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,800
How are you and Li Dai Xi?

287
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,510
Today she help you

288
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,350
Acting like that four-eyes is the wrong person

289
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,830
Just spilled a little water on him

290
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,860
You guys, let's get good

291
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,360
I looked at her so sad

292
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,510
Weiwei

293
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,240
Yu Xni, are you here?

294
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,350
I would like to order a strawberry cake for someone

295
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,060
Okay

296
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,720
Then write the receiver's name and phone number

297
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,260
Okay

298
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,220
Li Dai Xi

299
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,930
Mai Sichong

300
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,820
What's the matter?

301
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,070
You come to Avatar Plaza

302
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,460
Mom

303
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,050
Mom, look at the wall paintings

304
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,720
This is what the student council president does

305
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,950
The cost should not be high

306
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,590
My son saw me as Baidu, right?

307
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,310
Looks and it's very cheap

308
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,870
Acrylic paint like this is not expensive

309
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,170
Mai Sichong

310
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,950
Why do you stealthy?

311
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,910
Anyway, this is a big deal for you

312
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,080
But...

313
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,610
You don't have to thank me

314
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,440
Why did you call me out?

315
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,070
Yes

316
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,280
Give you

317
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,960
where did you go buy this?

318
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,600
There aren't any around the university

319
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,310
Don't care how I got it

320
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,860
Try it

321
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:31,990
Thanks

322
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,740
Why are you looking at me?

323
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:44,930
Nothing

324
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,150
You want to drink milk tea?

325
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,410
Who wants to drink milk tea?

326
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,340
This glass of milk tea

327
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,400
Very fragrant and sweet and delicious

328
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,660
But there are some people

329
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:02,920
He is an athlete

330
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,130
Can't drink

331
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,030
He drank and had to hurry to practice. What should I do?

332
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,420
What should I do when drinking and studying?

333
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,510
I just drink

334
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,880
I am Mai Sichong, today I will let you see

335
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,240
Drinking milk tea and breaking the record

336
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,600
Why don't you close the lid?

337
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,830
So how do you want me to drink?

338
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,630
Weiwei

339
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,550
Next time you want to drink milk tea, 
can you go buy it yourself?

340
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,460
Don't drink mine

341
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,380
Why are you eating this strange taste like durian?

342
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Why are you interested in me?

343
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,590
I'm so wrong, are you satisfied yet?

344
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,570
I'm afraid you so much

345
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,880
You know it's wrong. 
So next time has any problem, don't disturb me again

346
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,490
I'm so busy

347
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,940
Why can't I come to you?

348
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,830
Or are we not counted as friends?

349
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:08,890
Friend?

350
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,030
But what to eat

351
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:11,770
What to play

352
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,860
We all different

353
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,170
How can we count as friends?

354
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,260
Now is friend already

355
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,580
Like you say

356
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,030
Okay

357
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,240
So next time, let's have a drink together

358
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:35,890
I'm leaving

359
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,820
Hello

360
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,910
I came to get the cake

361
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,030
Yes, wait for a moment

362
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,070
You cake

363
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,710
Thank you

364
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,630
Excuse me

365
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,440
Who gave me the cake?

366
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,220
Sorry

367
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,570
She didn't leave a message

368
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,680
This cake is really delicious

369
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,110
Ding yi

370
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,890
Give cake to girl

371
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,500
Very old-fashioned

372
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,660
But you tried to buy my favorite flavor

373
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,470
The princess will take it

374
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,150
Wait

375
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,810
Wait

376
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,860
What am I doing for you?

377
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,290
This cake

378
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,410
Or is it not you who bought it for me?

379
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,910
I...?

380
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,730
Ding yi?

381
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,940
Buy cake for you?

382
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,600
For what?

383
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,000
If the cake doesn't taste good, I'll give it to you

384
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,190
You don't have to be kidding me

385
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,550
I know

386
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,540
Now that I'm in your eyes

387
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,660
Both beautiful and like girl in your dream

388
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,790
I suggest that you be restrained

389
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,090
Wait, I think Li Dai Xi

390
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,350
Why is her mouth so furious?

391
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,390
Still more delusional

392
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,670
I think you sleep too much or not

393
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,310
You...

394
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,130
In my opinion

395
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
This cake you bought yourself

396
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,140
Thinking of taking a chance with me?

397
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,690
I'm not fooled

398
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,600
Dai Xi

399
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
Did you bring the cake?

400
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:01,750
Yu Xin

401
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,080
This cake I don't take You take it away

402
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,160
You and Weiwei are still annoyed

403
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,390
Not even the cake she bought you didn't want?

404
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,620
You look, at night she keeps sighing

405
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,070
The two of you are not in a hurry to reconcile

406
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,300
This cake

407
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,870
Weiwei buy for me?

408
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,760
Yes

409
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:19,820
Are you thrown away?

410
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,020
Thrown away?

411
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,030
Very embarrassed

412
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,770
About cake?

413
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,310
Bro

414
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:45,980
All done

415
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,380
Sorry

416
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,110
Did not notice

417
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,220
The floor is messed up

418
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,350
So

419
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,240
You rub it again

420
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,710
Bro

421
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,490
The university let you be the student council president. To serve all students

422
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,300
Didn't let you use your power for personal gain here

423
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,580
Have you got to teach me?

424
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,580
What do you mean?

425
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,670
And you? What do you mean?

426
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,000
Bro

427
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,430
Mei Weiwei

428
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,250
You're just like everyone else

429
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,430
There are many men helping you

430
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,020
The former student council president also came

431
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,360
You're Fan Zheng Xianf, right?

432
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,070
How long do you think you can stay in this student council?

433
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,740
You are just a former chairman of the council

434
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,360
Why do you mess with our council?

435
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,070
It's about you, I don't care

436
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,050
But about her

437
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,080
I care

438
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,080
Okay

439
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,630
You guys wait and see

440
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:51,920
Weiwei

441
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,110
What are you and him angry about?

442
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:56,770
Probably not?

443
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,110
Nothing

444
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,190
He is such a person

445
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,890
I'm used to

446
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,070
Pineapple flavor that you like

447
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,060
Thank you Bro

448
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
After a while, are you free?

449
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,240
I mean that

450
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,520
If there is no business in the moment

451
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,610
Let's go to the library together

452
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,140
Okay

453
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,090
Let's go

454
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,190
Mei Lin Professor

455
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,680
Please look at this

456
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,020
What's this?

457
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,000
This is a separate account for the Student Council that I have gathered

458
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,900
Why is there a rotten account like this?

459
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,710
The university is where students come to study

460
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,680
Why are they making me so angry?

461
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,770
I didn't think that this student council president

462
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,770
will be able to do things like this

463
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,250
Mai Sichong

464
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,070
Thank you for telling me this

465
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
I'll do it myself

466
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,760
Hello Weiwei

467
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:19,800
I have good news to tell you

468
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,340
Sichong

469
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,090
I am Peng Pai

470
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,280
Weiwei is asleep

471
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,300
Just wait for her

472
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,030
Bro

473
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,750
Thank you for today

474
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,430
So, I'm leaving

475
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,220
Wait

476
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,480
Give you

477
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,550
Bro, that you helped me ...

478
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,570
Open

479
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,170
I intend to buy it

480
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,430
I don't know if you like it or not

481
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,820
Actually, at high school, I bought a pair

482
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,380
I lost it so I couldn't give it to you

483
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,320
Finally find the same color

484
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,850
Really hard to find

485
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,360
Mei Weiwei

486
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,330
How you come here?

487
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,910
Waiting you

488
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,340
Wait till I fall asleep

489
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,530
Pikachu

490
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,570
Meet you and then you ...

491
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,250
When you see me

492
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,100
Meet you

493
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:29,750
Yeah

494
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,540
It's time now

495
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,820
Bro, we still have business, so I'm leaving

496
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,710
Where did you and Peng Pai go today?

497
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Why does he say that you are asleep?

498
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,110
We're in the library

499
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,880
I was not careful, I fell asleep

500
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,890
Library

501
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,110
You didn't tell him about us, right?

502
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,910
Your secret, how can I tell someone else?

503
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:05,700
All right

504
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,950
I have something to tell you

505
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,680
Those four eyes

506
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:10,860
Waht

507
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,900
Give it to me

508
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,750
Don't be a kid

509
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:21,520
Give it to me

510
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,270
No

511
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,370
Peng Pai bro is not a little kid like you

512
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,020
Could you please become more mature?

513
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,210
Is it raining outside?

514
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,670
Peng Pai bro is not a little kid like you

515
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,320
Could you please become more mature?

516
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,150
What are you doing?

517
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,740
You had been injured before

518
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,850
On the knees, right?

519
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,110
How did you know?

520
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,860
To save a child

521
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,900
So there was an accident

522
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,550
And you? Is there any secret?

523
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,040
Actually, it's not a secret.

524
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,000
I use electricity to save one person

525
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,110
Since then I think having electricity is good too
