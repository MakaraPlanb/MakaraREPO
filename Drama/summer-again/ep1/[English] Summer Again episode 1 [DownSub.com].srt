185
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,190
Dad!

186
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,190
Long time no see!

187
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,300
You gained weight.

188
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,550
You're lying.

189
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,630
You grew taller as well.

190
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,110
Is that so?

191
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,150
I'm taller than you.

192
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,470
Why didn't you guys tell me

193
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,710
that you two were moving back to Xi Hai?

194
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,190
We just arrived here.

195
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,430
I planned to let Tong Tong visit you

196
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,630
once we settle down.

197
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,550
Tong Tong, you can chat with your father.

198
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,390
I'll go upstairs first.

199
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,150
Xiao Hui,

200
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,590
I just picked this flower for you.

201
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,150
Tong Tong, you can bring it to me later.

202
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,110
Dad, how did you know
we were moving back to Xi Hai?

203
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,470
Mum wanted me to keep it from you.

204
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,789
I heard it from my friends at the theatre.

205
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,470
Tong Tong,

206
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,630
I'm really happy

207
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,870
that you two have returned to Xi Hai.

208
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,870
I think Xi Hai didn't change at all,
even after so many years.

209
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,790
Dad, how about you?
How are you doing lately?

210
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,670
Me? I'm still the same.

211
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,070
I'm trying my best to write.

212
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,470
You're still writing?

213
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,790
Dad, I have a huge plan for tomorrow.

214
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,590
What plan?

215
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,860
[7.20 a.m.]

216
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:43,990
[Today's plan, goal: ask Senior Wei Ze
to attend Guru Qing He's signing event.]

217
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,540
[Time to return to Da Cheng]

218
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,190
[and attend Guru Qing He's signing event
with Senior Wei Ze.]

219
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,750
[My plan starts now.]

220
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,470
[7.20 a.m., brush my teeth.]

221
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,350
[7.40 a.m., depart from my house.]

222
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,830
[7.50 a.m., call a cab to
Xi Hai Bus Station.]

223
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,750
[8 a.m., reach Xi Hai Bus Station]

224
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,990
[so that I can take the bus
to the airport.]

225
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,950
[9 a.m., reach the airport and
go for the security clearance.]

226
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,910
[Afternoon, reach Da Cheng successfully.]

227
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,630
[Everything is perfect.]

228
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,430
Hello, Yan Hua?

229
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,830
Send me Da Cheng's corporation regulation

230
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,790
immediately.

231
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,590
[My goodness!]

232
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,910
[Who would expect my mother]

233
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,230
[to go to Xi Hai Theatre this late]

234
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,790
[on her first day of work?]

235
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,630
Manager Wang?

236
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,350
Nice to meet you.

237
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,590
It's like this.

238
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,390
The concepts and habits of
the audience in Xi Hai

239
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,710
are different from
the audience in Da Cheng.

240
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,150
I think I'll invite our troupe here

241
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,070
for a performance once we settle down.

242
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:09,950
What do you think?

243
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,590
You're welcome.

244
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,350
This is my job.

245
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:15,670
Okay.

246
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,270
[To, Mum.]

247
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,430
[I'm returning to Da Cheng.]

248
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,380
[I'll be back soon.]

249
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,350
[Please don't miss me.]

250
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,070
[Although I could only afford
the Economy Class flight ticket,]

251
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,390
[my sisters,]

252
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,510
[Guru Qing He,]

253
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,510
[and Senior Wei Ze, please wait for me!]

254
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,870
Mister!

255
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,350
Where are you going?

256
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,510
Mister, to the bus station.

257
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm really sorry.

258
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,750
I'm in a rush.

259
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,590
What are you trying to do?

260
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,710
Why are you stealing my cab?

261
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,150
Wait, this is my cab!

262
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,460
You're a cab thief!

263
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,910
[I'm really unlucky today!
Why do I have to meet a thug like him?]

264
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,390
[No, he's worse than a thug.]

265
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,500
Excuse me!

266
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,070
Please show me your ticket.

267
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,190
Over here.

268
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,230
Unlucky.

269
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,310
I'm so unlucky.

270
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,510
If I see him again,

271
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,830
I'll surely puncture his tires.

272
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,350
And that cab thief, don't let me...

273
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:42,830
I...

274
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,310
Hold it right there!

275
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,550
[I hope I won't be so unlucky]

276
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,470
[as to]

277
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,910
[see this brat again when I return there.]

278
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,700
[Lin Nan Yi.]

279
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,470
I'm bleeding because of Tong Xi!

280
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,260
You guys can't even defeat me?

281
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,270
Are you guys even men?

282
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,070
Listen up.

283
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,540
Lin Nan Yi is under my protection.

284
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,620
In the future, no one can bully him.

285
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,230
[Even if we bully him,]

286
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,550
it's none of your business.

287
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,630
Of course it's my business.

288
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,710
Everyone in this alley knows

289
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,630
that he's my fiance.

290
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,670
I'm going to marry him in the future.

291
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,470
Why are you running?

292
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,110
You like Qing He as well?

293
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,390
What?

294
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,790
Did you forget about

295
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,310
your fiance after you went to Da Cheng?

296
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,030
No one wants you to be my fiance.

297
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,790
What did you say?

298
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,270
Please ready your tickets for inspection.

299
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,190
You're going to the airport as well?

300
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,110
You too?

301
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,870
Yeah.

302
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,910
Be careful!

303
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,760
[Shocked!]

304
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,750
So,

305
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,270
how long have you been back?

306
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:54,780
I just came back.

307
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,110
You're leaving when you're just back?

308
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,070
Yes, I was heading to Da Cheng initially.

309
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,550
What a coincidence.
I'm heading to Da Cheng as well.

310
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,150
Yeah, what a coincidence.

311
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,430
None of us can head to Da Cheng

312
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,470
after our encounter.

313
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,150
Hello, Senior?

314
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,190
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,750
Something happened on my way there.

316
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,990
I might not be able to make it.

317
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,430
This is such a pity.

318
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,670
It's a rare chance, you know?

319
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,750
I really feel sorry for you.

320
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,860
Senior, I'm fine.

321
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,310
I'm just worried

322
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,670
that I might not be able to see you

323
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,630
and the new students of the art troupe
once school reopens.

324
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,030
I feel pretty sad.

325
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,350
I guess you have no choice.

326
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,270
If you really can't make it,

327
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,630
let's meet up some other time.

328
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,390
So Senior,

329
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,230
can I ask you out again?

330
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,300
No.

331
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,510
I'm afraid not.

332
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,510
Judging by my leg's condition,

333
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,630
I think I need to rest for two days.

334
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,750
I'll contact you once I feel better.

335
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,350
See you then, Senior.

336
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,390
Goodbye.

337
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,390
Did you do that on purpose?

338
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,400
[Call from Stupid Wang Yi Ming]

339
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,150
[Lin, my brother. Where are you?]

340
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,150
At the orthopaedics department.

341
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,550
Since your friend is here,

342
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,270
I'll leave now.

343
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,270
Wait.

344
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,350
We're considered as old friends, right?

345
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,910
Why do you look so upset when you see me?

346
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,670
Let me ask you this.

347
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,950
Don't you feel awkward when you see me?

348
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:40,980
Awkward?

349
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,300
Awkward about what?

350
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,590
You can hold them yourself.

351
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,580
Tong Xi.

352
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,870
Why did I bring it with me?

353
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:14,670
I'm done for.

354
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,790
Don't tell me I was cursed by someone?

355
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,150
[Let me ask you this.]

356
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,510
[Don't you feel awkward when you see me?]

357
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,510
[Awkward about what?]

358
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,150
How could he not feel awkward about it?

359
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,870
Great.

360
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,110
I couldn't return to Da Cheng.

361
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,430
I stood Senior Wei Ze up.

362
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,780
I can't even

363
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,310
meet Guru Qing He.

364
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,710
Lin Nan Yi, it's all because of you.

365
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,030
I don't ever want to see you again.

366
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,890
[Early Summer]

367
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,230
Are you trying to starve me?

368
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,829
What's with the vegetable buns?

369
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,109
I want some meat.

370
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,910
You're a dancer, you know?
You want meat? In your dreams.

371
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,869
You will take your
first ballet lesson today.

372
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,150
You'd better attend
the lesson after school.

373
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,390
Let me repeat this.

374
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,869
When you're back here, you'd better

375
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,630
study hard and train hard.

376
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,030
How dare you try to leave the house?

377
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,380
You even wanted to return to Da Cheng?

378
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,310
You want to leave even though
you just came back.

379
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,230
Did your father influence you to do so?

380
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,100
Dad just sponsored me out of kindness.

381
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,950
It's none of his business.

382
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,350
Sponsored you out of kindness?

383
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,550
He's influencing you to commit crimes.

384
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,830
By the way, Mum,

385
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,670
how many high schools are there in Xi Hai?

386
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,950
Two or three, I think.

387
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,830
That's great to hear.

388
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,230
I guess I won't see him again.

389
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,710
What are you mumbling about?

390
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,190
Put down your foot.

391
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,870
You don't sit or eat like a girl at all.

392
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,630
Can't you behave like a girl for once?

393
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,870
Don't tell me you're going to school
with your jeans?

394
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,790
I haven't received my uniform yet.

395
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,710
I guess wearing anything is fine.

396
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,030
Wear the uniform you got from Da Cheng.

397
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,750
Mum!

398
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,940
Pull me up.

399
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,070
Do you have a band-aid?

400
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,310
No.

401
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,030
Buy some for me then.

402
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:33,950
No.

403
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,180
Do we know each other that well?

404
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,190
Lin Nan Yi, you're something.

405
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,390
You were a good boy when you were young.

406
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,110
But now, you're a hooligan.

407
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,660
How dare you get yourself into a fight?

408
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,670
It's fine that you were involved,

409
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,030
but how dare you lose to them?

410
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,060
It wasn't me.

411
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,270
It was her.

412
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,470
A kitten?

413
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,990
What happened?

414
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,390
It was entangled by the vines of the tree.

415
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,830
I tried to save her.

416
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,630
But she scratched my face instead.

417
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,950
Let's bring it to the vet,

418
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,950
if there's any vet in our town.

419
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,670
Sure.

420
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,390
No need to thank me.
I have an extra band-aid.

421
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,030
I'll go to school now.

422
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,150
She's such a heavy hitter.

423
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,950
My grandfather
left this mint garden for us.

424
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,110
It's beautiful.

425
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,870
Let's play over here in the future.
