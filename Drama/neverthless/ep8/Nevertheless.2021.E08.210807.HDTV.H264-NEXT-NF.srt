1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:08,067
NEVERTHELESS,

2
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:11,087
NEVERTHELESS,

3
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:17,004
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,795
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:28,650
Na-bi would love this.

6
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,235
Yang Do-hyeok!

7
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:32,529
You're here.

8
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:36,116
What happened?

9
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:37,993
I just got hurt a little.

10
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:40,370
How? Is it bad?

11
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:43,206
It's fine. Na-bi took good care of it.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,958
Gosh, it must hurt.

13
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,751
You should have been careful.

14
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:49,504
Where's Na-bi?

15
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:52,424
She said she's too tired to come.

16
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:54,092
She's not coming?

17
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:55,093
Are you that upset?

18
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,264
She went to her aunt's?

19
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:01,474
Probably. Why?

20
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:04,352
It's nothing.

21
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:07,939
But where is Jae-eon?

22
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:15,155
Do-yeon, take care of the guests.

23
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:17,490
What? Where are you going?

24
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:27,417
EPISODE 8: I KNOW IT'S A LIE.
NEVERTHELESS,

25
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:53,151
YANG DO-HYEOK

26
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:04,913
Is this really okay?

27
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,626
If we continue,

28
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:13,880
I don't think I can stop.

29
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:49,207
Oh, there you are.

30
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,751
Do-yeon told me you went home.

31
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:54,504
Right. I was about to leave.

32
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,590
-I'll take you home.
-No, it's fine. I can go by myself.

33
00:02:58,174 --> 00:03:00,010
It's late. I'll take you.

34
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:03,555
All right, then.

35
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:24,117
Well…

36
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:26,036
What?

37
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:29,497
It feels like the timing is wrong.

38
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:31,958
What do you mean?

39
00:03:58,485 --> 00:03:59,944
What is all this?

40
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:19,964
It's a flower called lisianthus.

41
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:21,633
It means…

42
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:27,847
Will you accept this?

43
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:34,229
Do-hyeok.

44
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:38,942
You're a really good person.

45
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:46,699
-Then--
-But I don't think this is good timing.

46
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,371
I don't think
I can have a good relationship right now.

47
00:04:57,544 --> 00:04:59,295
Is it because of Park Jae-eon?

48
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:05,176
Honestly, I can't say it isn't.

49
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:08,930
I ran away and came here
because of him too.

50
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:11,266
Then do you want to see him again?

51
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:17,564
It's not like that.

52
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,694
Are you disappointed in me?

53
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:24,571
Yes.

54
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,410
I already knew I'd get disappointed,

55
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,203
so a little thing like this

56
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:36,541
won't make me get disappointed in you.

57
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:40,211
You're just
romanticizing me right now. I--

58
00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:42,130
Then just…

59
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:44,799
disappoint me even more.

60
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:49,554
Right now, I like you so much

61
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,473
that I don't know what to do.

62
00:05:57,854 --> 00:06:00,231
I like you. Sincerely.

63
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:10,491
I understand how you feel.

64
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:14,829
So don't be too hard on yourself.

65
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:23,296
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:26,925
I don't even know why I'm crying.

67
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:34,724
Can I give you a hug?

68
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,476
No.

69
00:06:37,352 --> 00:06:40,480
You'll feel better
after you cry all you want.

70
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:43,191
No. I'd feel even more sorry.

71
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:17,809
<i>I know…</i>

72
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:21,771
<i>exactly what my tears mean.</i>

73
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,117
<i>I cried because I felt so pathetic.</i>

74
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:49,549
Did you take her home safely?

75
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:03,021
You must like her a lot.

76
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:06,149
Yes. Unlike someone.

77
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:09,694
So stop confusing her.

78
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:17,785
It's none of your business, you know.

79
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,459
Is Na-bi easily swayed by me?

80
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:33,301
No. Not at all.

81
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,722
She says she regrets
the time she spent with you.

82
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:40,224
She says she wants to forget it all.

83
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,354
Auntie.

84
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:18,948
What?

85
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,963
It'll take some time,
so let's wait outside.

86
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:35,089
Okay.

87
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,973
I'll finish up the rest,
so wash your hands over there.

88
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:44,974
All right.

89
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:13,127
You're the one who made
Na-bi come here, aren't you?

90
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:22,178
-Auntie.
-You're up.

91
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:24,847
Did you sleep well?

92
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,307
What are you doing here?

93
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,602
I was learning pottery from your aunt.

94
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:34,649
He came this morning,
saying he was a close friend of yours.

95
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,901
He wanted to learn pottery,

96
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:39,779
so I was teaching him
a few of my special know-hows.

97
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,198
You don't even know him.
You should've been careful.

98
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:43,908
You should've confirmed it with me.

99
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,078
Isn't he your friend?

100
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:52,291
-He is, but--
-Then it's fine.

101
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,627
Let's eat. Do you want to join us?

102
00:11:58,422 --> 00:11:59,465
Sure.

103
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:01,133
What are you doing?

104
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:02,635
You two can catch up.

105
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:04,428
Where are you going?

106
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:26,284
What are you doing here?

107
00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:29,745
I wanted to see your aunt.

108
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:31,872
Stop joking around.

109
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,584
We didn't get to finish.

110
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:36,794
What do you mean?

111
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:42,925
Just forget about yesterday.

112
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:46,846
By that,

113
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,767
are you saying it didn't mean anything?

114
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:55,563
It was a mistake.

115
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,692
We were both drunk.

116
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:05,781
Well, if that's how you feel.

117
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:08,200
<i>He's such a coward.</i>

118
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:13,122
Are you and Do-hyeok dating?

119
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:14,624
You don't have to know.

120
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:16,751
It's none of your business.

121
00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:23,841
Hey, you're so cold.

122
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:26,886
You really hurt me just now.

123
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:31,349
Na-bi.

124
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:32,892
Sorry.

125
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,979
-Is there anything you like?
-I'm sorry, but I should get going.

126
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:39,023
You're not going to eat?

127
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:41,108
Why? It won't take long.

128
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:42,652
I have other plans.

129
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:46,113
I loved your <i>jangjorim</i>. It's too bad.

130
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:49,617
You tried my <i>jangjorim</i>? How?

131
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,577
I sent them only to Na-bi.

132
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:58,000
Can I come and learn pottery
during vacations?

133
00:13:58,501 --> 00:13:59,502
Of course.

134
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:04,882
He's pretty talented.

135
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:07,927
If I teach him well,
he might be a better assistant than you.

136
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,178
Don't be ridiculous.

137
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:11,681
I'll be off, then.

138
00:14:12,264 --> 00:14:13,432
All right.

139
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:17,645
See you in Seoul.

140
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:19,563
Take care.

141
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:29,907
Let's go eat.

142
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,676
<i>Surprisingly, my regretful past
still hasn't ended yet.</i>

143
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:51,887
Here you go. Enjoy your food.

144
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,306
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

145
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,392
Isn't Jae-eon eating?

146
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,519
I guess he's still sleeping.

147
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:00,146
He left saying he had plans.

148
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:02,231
-He left?
-What plans?

149
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,778
I'm not sure what plans he had.

150
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:11,032
-What about Na-bi?
-She went to her aunt's.

151
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:12,700
I see.

152
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:19,665
Hey. What about Gyu-hyun? He's not eating?

153
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,545
I don't know.
I guess he's not feeling well.

154
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:28,466
Gosh. I feel awful.

155
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:31,844
Do you even remember last night, Ji-wan?

156
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:35,806
I remember doing the drinking games,

157
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,892
but I don't remember anything after that.

158
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:41,437
Why did you drink so much by yourself?

159
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,939
Sol took you to your room last night

160
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,858
and washed your face and everything.

161
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:49,570
How will you live without Sol?

162
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:52,323
You should
get a grip on yourself. All right?

163
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:55,326
Hey, look who's talking.

164
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,036
-Without Gyu-hyun--
-Shut up.

165
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,204
Okay.

166
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:08,130
Darn it.

167
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:37,451
CENTRAL BUS TERMINAL

168
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,509
Na-bi.

169
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:55,511
Do-hyeok.

170
00:16:57,805 --> 00:16:59,473
I'm glad you didn't leave yet.

171
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:02,351
I didn't know you were coming.
When did you get here?

172
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:04,228
I wanted to see you off this time.

173
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,897
Oh.

174
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,611
Get home safe.

175
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:16,240
I will. Good luck with the restaurant.

176
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:20,703
I'm going to try uploading
various contents like you suggested.

177
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:22,580
And try changing my video styles.

178
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:23,747
Good thinking.

179
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,002
Can you watch them after I edit them?

180
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:31,046
Of course.
I'll watch them and give you feedback.

181
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,554
It's nothing special,
but have this on the way.

182
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,226
Thanks.

183
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:48,480
I only receive things from you.

184
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:49,648
It's fine.

185
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:54,820
I'll get going now. Take care.

186
00:17:54,904 --> 00:17:57,531
-Sure, you too.
-Okay.

187
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,544
They look good.

188
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:29,980
Na-bi. I thought about it…

189
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:34,902
and I don't think I can give up
on you that easily.

190
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:38,322
Not until you see someone else

191
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:41,367
or tell me you'd never like me.

192
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:46,789
I'll call you later.

193
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:48,916
See you next time.

194
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:07,578
It's so pretty.

195
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:38,230
Go. I'll return the car.

196
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:41,400
-Thanks. Get back safe.
-Bye.

197
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:42,484
-Take care.
-Where are you going?

198
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:43,402
We're going home.

199
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:45,112
-Home?
-Bye!

200
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:46,738
-I'm heading to the studio.
-Bye.

201
00:20:53,454 --> 00:20:54,621
Aren't you getting off?

202
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:02,921
The weather
seems to have gotten hotter, right?

203
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,590
Should we get some shaved ice?

204
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,092
I'm just going to head home.

205
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:09,553
I can't just eat it by myself.

206
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:15,976
Do you still not remember
anything from yesterday?

207
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:18,437
What? Yesterday?

208
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,690
Yes. I brought you
inside the room last night.

209
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,067
And after that…

210
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:26,904
Gosh. I can't remember anything.

211
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:29,990
I should really quit drinking.

212
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:33,118
Did I do something bad to you yesterday?

213
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:34,286
Yes.

214
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:36,788
Oh, really?

215
00:21:38,415 --> 00:21:39,750
I'm really sorry.

216
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,045
Sol, if I ever try to drink again,

217
00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:46,590
just beat me up so I'll get a grip.

218
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,678
I was just kidding. Nothing happened.

219
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:55,307
Hey! You startled me.

220
00:21:58,393 --> 00:22:01,230
I'm tired. I'm going home now.

221
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:03,607
Okay. Get home safe.

222
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:12,366
Get off.

223
00:22:13,158 --> 00:22:14,159
Hey.

224
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:18,247
Did we break up?

225
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,498
If you agree.

226
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,085
You agree, right?

227
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:29,549
I mean…

228
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:33,971
To be honest, we both knew
what each other was like--

229
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:35,514
I know.

230
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:39,518
But I think we were
on better terms as friends.

231
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,939
You said it was tough
dating a guy like me, remember?

232
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:46,650
Gosh.

233
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:51,196
Are you still bothered by what I said?

234
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,615
-You--
-Honestly, it's tough for me too.

235
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:57,911
And we've been fighting
ever since we started dating.

236
00:22:59,162 --> 00:23:00,789
Were you even happy dating me?

237
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:04,543
We haven't even been dating that long.
That's a bit too deep.

238
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:09,339
And it seems like we both don't want
to change for each other's sake.

239
00:23:10,716 --> 00:23:12,676
It's best to end things here.

240
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,554
All right.

241
00:23:17,222 --> 00:23:18,640
Then let's be friends again.

242
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:19,599
What?

243
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:21,643
You said we were better as friends.

244
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:25,188
We were friends
for much longer than we dated.

245
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:26,773
Why wouldn't we be friends again?

246
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:30,110
Right. We could be friends again,

247
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:33,113
but it feels like

248
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:36,867
you might ask
to become friends with benefits later.

249
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:41,663
I won't, so let's just be friends again.

250
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:46,960
Nobody knows about us,
so I'll do my best not to show it.

251
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:49,546
I won't cause you trouble.

252
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:38,136
<i>I ended up…</i>

253
00:24:39,388 --> 00:24:40,847
<i>coming back.</i>

254
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:01,243
Are you here to work on your assignments?

255
00:25:02,828 --> 00:25:05,580
I'm just going to have a smoke and leave.

256
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:07,332
I have to return the car.

257
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,085
That's tiresome.

258
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:11,878
It must've been tiring for you too.

259
00:25:12,796 --> 00:25:15,340
-What do you mean?
-I shouldn't have told you

260
00:25:15,424 --> 00:25:16,800
that Na-bi was coming.

261
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:22,013
Well, something good came from that.

262
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:23,390
What?

263
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:26,393
I can focus on my work better.

264
00:25:29,312 --> 00:25:30,564
I'm ending things with her.

265
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,482
Why?

266
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,317
I'm exhausted.

267
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:36,945
It's the same for her too.

268
00:25:37,654 --> 00:25:39,573
I guess people never change.

269
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:42,284
Right.

270
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:51,668
It's been a while.

271
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:56,006
Oh, Dimples.

272
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,799
Hello.

273
00:25:57,883 --> 00:25:59,968
Hey, why were you ignoring me?

274
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:03,054
When? Oh, right.

275
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:05,474
I was with my boyfriend.

276
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:07,476
Boyfriend? You have a boyfriend?

277
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:11,396
I did, but not anymore. I got dumped.

278
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,274
You? Why? Why did you get dumped?

279
00:26:15,984 --> 00:26:17,277
I don't know.

280
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:21,198
Hey. What do you think relationships are?

281
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:24,034
Relationships?

282
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:27,078
Spending time with someone you love.
Eating, drinking,

283
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:30,332
watching movies, talking on the phone.

284
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:32,000
What's wrong with everyone?

285
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,211
Why? What do you think they are, then?

286
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:38,965
Kissing and having sex with one person.

287
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,221
You didn't
say that to your boyfriend, did you?

288
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:45,347
I didn't…

289
00:26:46,306 --> 00:26:49,559
No, I guess I kind of did.

290
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:53,313
Right. I see why you got dumped.

291
00:26:59,402 --> 00:27:00,529
Hey, cute lady.

292
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:03,156
I'll be there soon.

293
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:05,242
All right.

294
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:24,219
I kept thinking about you.

295
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:27,722
I missed you.

296
00:27:34,604 --> 00:27:36,731
<i>But as always,</i>

297
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:38,817
<i>you're not contacting me.</i>

298
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:51,204
I'M THROWING AWAY ALL YOUR STUFF

299
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:55,959
<i>But at least it doesn't hurt me
as hard as before.</i>

300
00:27:59,754 --> 00:28:02,173
<i>Did I get used to feeling this way?</i>

301
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:05,885
I'M THROWING AWAY ALL YOUR STUFF

302
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:12,434
YANG DO-HYEOK

303
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,191
-Hey, Do-hyeok.
-<i>Hi, Na-bi. Did you arrive home?</i>

304
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:23,278
Yes. I was just about to tell you.

305
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,655
The brownies were good.

306
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:28,491
<i>That's a relief.
It was my first time making them.</i>

307
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,535
You're good at everything.

308
00:28:31,786 --> 00:28:34,539
The cake you made me
on my birthday was great too.

309
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:38,376
I did my best to learn how to make that
since you love chocolate.

310
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,546
I was thinking of becoming
a pastry chef because of you.

311
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,965
What? Really? You're lying, right?

312
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:45,008
Yes.

313
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:46,968
Was it obvious?

314
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:49,763
Hey, that wasn't even funny.

315
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:56,353
It's nice to hear your voice.

316
00:28:57,729 --> 00:28:59,189
The whole neighborhood

317
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:02,233
seems empty without you.

318
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:05,153
Everyone living there will laugh at that.

319
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:08,907
<i>I'm sure they'll understand
if they know how I feel right now.</i>

320
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:13,870
You're going overboard.

321
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,748
What were you doing?

322
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:20,835
I was preparing for the exhibition.

323
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:23,463
I rested for the past few days.

324
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:25,715
I have a lot to do now.

325
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:29,552
I think I'll be going to Seoul soon.
Do you want to meet up?

326
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:34,474
Sure.

327
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:37,394
-<i>Is there anything you want to eat?</i>
-What about you?

328
00:29:38,061 --> 00:29:41,064
You're coming all the way here.
I'll treat you.

329
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:54,786
What?

330
00:29:55,286 --> 00:29:57,330
That's way better.

331
00:29:57,414 --> 00:29:58,832
Isn't it too noisy?

332
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:03,044
What are you talking about?
I was about to raise the volume.

333
00:30:03,128 --> 00:30:05,714
-What? You can't hear that?
-You can hear that?

334
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:09,217
Your hearing is really bad.
You listen to music loudly, don't you?

335
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,844
You should fix that habit.

336
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:12,137
You'll lose your hearing.

337
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,140
The volume you lowered it to
is way too quiet.

338
00:30:15,974 --> 00:30:17,809
Okay. Then just raise it by three.

339
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:20,020
-No.
-Just three more.

340
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:21,896
-My ears hurt.
-Just ten, okay?

341
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,481
-Just ten.
-We can hear it fine.

342
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:25,025
-Just ten.
-What's with you?

343
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:26,359
-Come on.
-Just…

344
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:38,747
Are you okay?

345
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:40,957
Are you hurt?

346
00:30:43,835 --> 00:30:45,712
No. I'm fine.

347
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:48,173
I'm okay.

348
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:54,721
This is my work.

349
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:05,106
Did you made this
to represent an insect?

350
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,900
Yes, it's a butterfly.

351
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:10,862
Why is it about a butterfly
that inspired you?

352
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:12,447
It's the longing for freedom.

353
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:14,407
Well, I can really see it.

354
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:28,379
Thanks for this.

355
00:31:28,463 --> 00:31:29,589
-Sure.
-Thank you.

356
00:31:31,132 --> 00:31:32,842
This place has the best <i>tteokbokki</i>.

357
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:34,761
-Really?
-This place?

358
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:37,722
Hey, Na-bi!

359
00:31:38,765 --> 00:31:39,766
Applying to work late?

360
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:41,351
Yes.

361
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:42,894
Come have some <i>tteokbokki</i>.

362
00:31:43,812 --> 00:31:45,438
-Chopsticks.
-Come and eat.

363
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:48,233
Chopsticks.

364
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,485
Thank you.

365
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:53,196
How is your piece going?
I'm looking forward to it.

366
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,866
Jae-eon volunteered to be her assistant,
so it's going to be great.

367
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,577
But I saw Jae-eon earlier,

368
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:03,331
and he was talking to some foreigners.
What's that about?

369
00:32:03,414 --> 00:32:05,291
They're from VCU.

370
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,418
They saw his works
and wanted to talk to him.

371
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:11,089
Awesome. Why?
Are they trying to scout him?

372
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:13,174
Yes. They wouldn't want
to lose their chance.

373
00:32:13,258 --> 00:32:15,176
They're probably trying to scout

374
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,720
some kids while they're here
for the symposium.

375
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,975
Gosh. He seems a bit overqualified
to be Na-bi's assistant.

376
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:25,270
Hey, that's ridiculous. There's
no such thing as qualifications in art.

377
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:27,605
Of course there is.

378
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:28,565
Right.

379
00:32:29,566 --> 00:32:33,236
Then I guess Jae-eon would become
an artist for sure. Like Su-yeong.

380
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,571
I guess so.

381
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:36,906
You don't have to only become an artist.

382
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,284
There are lots of jobs
related to our major.

383
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,996
That's only for talented people.

384
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:47,625
My parents did so much to send me here,
thinking they'd have

385
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:49,544
an artist in the family.

386
00:32:49,627 --> 00:32:51,212
They spent so much money on me.

387
00:32:52,463 --> 00:32:53,965
I feel so bad.

388
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:58,011
It's fine, Ji-wan.
I'm sure they didn't expect much.

389
00:32:58,595 --> 00:32:59,512
What?

390
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,141
You're getting
the exchange program results soon.

391
00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:04,726
Are you preparing your portfolio?

392
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:08,354
Well, yes.

393
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:11,733
I'm preparing that
along with the exhibition for now.

394
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:14,360
"For now"? What do you want to do, then?

395
00:33:14,986 --> 00:33:16,237
Well…

396
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:19,908
I'm not sure…

397
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:24,913
I'm not sure yet, so if I get accepted--

398
00:33:24,996 --> 00:33:27,665
What you want is more important, you know.

399
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:29,375
Why do you want to go to Paris?

400
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:34,464
Are you doing an interview or what?

401
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:40,428
Working hard is nice, of course,
but you should focus on one thing.

402
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:42,430
-It's a critical time right now.
-Right.

403
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:46,309
I'm worried I might end up
not gaining anything at this rate.

404
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,436
Don't worry. Everyone feels the same.

405
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,355
Even us graduate students.

406
00:33:51,773 --> 00:33:53,566
There must be something you like more.

407
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:57,070
Keep asking yourself what you like.

408
00:33:59,322 --> 00:34:00,448
I will.

409
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:15,797
<i>What I like more…</i>

410
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,757
<i>I thought I already found it, but…</i>

411
00:34:21,803 --> 00:34:23,846
I'll do it. Where should I move it?

412
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,099
It's fine. I'll do it.

413
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:29,894
I should do it.
I'm your assistant, remember?

414
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:31,604
I can do this much.

415
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:37,151
By the way, I was at the office earlier
and Gyeong-jun told me.

416
00:34:37,235 --> 00:34:39,320
I heard you got scouted.

417
00:34:40,571 --> 00:34:42,156
Are you going to America?

418
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,574
I'm going to give it some thought.

419
00:34:45,326 --> 00:34:47,495
Right. I see.

420
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,626
Oh, and I can throw away
your stuff that's at my house, right?

421
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:55,670
You still have them?

422
00:34:58,214 --> 00:34:59,424
I'll throw them away.

423
00:34:59,507 --> 00:35:01,426
No, don't. I'll go get them soon.

424
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:03,803
Fine, then.

425
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:09,017
Do you have a lot of work left?

426
00:35:11,978 --> 00:35:15,356
Well, I did finish…

427
00:35:18,026 --> 00:35:19,110
But why?

428
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:21,404
We have somewhere to go, remember?

429
00:35:48,264 --> 00:35:51,434
INTERNATIONAL ART FAIR

430
00:36:33,142 --> 00:36:33,976
Let's go.

431
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:58,209
You said you wanted to see this.

432
00:37:05,842 --> 00:37:08,469
What do you think? Don't you like it?

433
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,680
Well…

434
00:37:13,724 --> 00:37:15,268
Would it be okay to go closer?

435
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:16,602
Sure.

436
00:37:29,782 --> 00:37:31,200
When did you buy a car?

437
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:34,704
My mom gave it to me for my birthday.

438
00:37:35,663 --> 00:37:37,373
That's a generous gift.

439
00:37:37,957 --> 00:37:40,293
We lived separately since I was ten.

440
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:41,586
I guess she feels sorry.

441
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,008
This exhibition was nice.

442
00:37:48,342 --> 00:37:49,427
I should come again.

443
00:37:50,386 --> 00:37:54,056
Right. It did feel different
seeing the pieces in person.

444
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,683
Honestly, I didn't want to come.

445
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:56,767
Why?

446
00:37:58,311 --> 00:37:59,979
It wasn't because of the exhibition.

447
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:04,400
I just have bad memories about this place.

448
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,527
Really?

449
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:11,157
I saw someone so beautiful here

450
00:38:12,116 --> 00:38:13,910
that I fell in love at first sight.

451
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:16,829
I'm sure.

452
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:19,624
It was snowing that day.

453
00:38:19,707 --> 00:38:20,791
I didn't ask.

454
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,877
It was an opening exhibition
for an artist.

455
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,629
What was the artist's name?

456
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:27,882
It was boring, so I was about to leave.

457
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:31,385
But then I saw a girl standing
in front of a piece for a long time.

458
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,222
Just like you back there.

459
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:41,604
And one day,

460
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:43,898
I ran into her again.

461
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:49,445
I was startled.

462
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:53,574
If I believed in fate,
I would have felt that this was it.

463
00:38:57,578 --> 00:38:58,788
But you don't.

464
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:00,206
I don't.

465
00:39:06,837 --> 00:39:09,131
<i>Right, there's no such thing as fate.</i>

466
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:13,219
<i>Everything is just
a meaningless coincidence.</i>

467
00:39:15,304 --> 00:39:17,265
Yun Sol!

468
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:26,774
All right…

469
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:28,359
Hey, Yun Sol!

470
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:32,113
Your phone's broken, right? I know.

471
00:39:33,447 --> 00:39:34,490
It's not.

472
00:39:34,574 --> 00:39:38,119
Oh, then did your fingers break?
Did they just get healed?

473
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:43,457
Hey. What's going on with you?

474
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:46,127
What?

475
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,130
You keep ignoring my messages.

476
00:39:50,256 --> 00:39:52,216
Are you angry at me about something?

477
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:55,970
Why would I be?

478
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:57,555
What?

479
00:40:00,057 --> 00:40:03,853
It's nothing. I'm just not feeling well.

480
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:05,771
You're not well? Let me see.

481
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:12,028
Well…

482
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,073
I have to finish my project. I'll be off.

483
00:40:31,297 --> 00:40:32,548
Let's go!

484
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:34,884
Keep going forward!

485
00:40:35,593 --> 00:40:37,136
I can only go forward!

486
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,479
FRIENDS LIST
GYUHYUN777

487
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:54,695
SEONGJU-DONG, 24, HANDSOME

488
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:12,755
I'm totally screwed! What do I do?

489
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:14,632
What is it?

490
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:18,052
PART-TIME MODEL:
I CAN'T MAKE IT TODAY

491
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:22,556
I feel like crying.

492
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,558
-Your pizza's here.
-Thank you.

493
00:41:24,642 --> 00:41:28,270
Darn it. It's for today's class.
The professor's going to flip.

494
00:41:28,354 --> 00:41:30,064
Even if we don't pay much,

495
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:32,316
how can they cancel on the day of the job?

496
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:35,569
We should ask
for a bigger budget or something.

497
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:38,280
We can't make up
for missing models too, you know.

498
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,201
Let's contact everyone
who might be able to make time.

499
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:43,369
What class is it?

500
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:45,121
Well…

501
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:53,754
Jae-eon, how would you like
to do a part-time job?

502
00:41:57,842 --> 00:41:59,051
Well, I…

503
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:01,387
Jae-eon, try this too.

504
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:04,098
This looks so filling.
You'll be full with just that.

505
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:05,683
-Eat up.
-Eat up.

506
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:06,684
Go on.

507
00:42:09,729 --> 00:42:11,647
-Isn't it good?
-It's good.

508
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:13,941
-You should eat too. It's good.
-Sure.

509
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:16,527
Isn't it good?

510
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,863
It's great. Jae-eon, try the sauce too.

511
00:42:18,946 --> 00:42:20,531
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

512
00:42:24,326 --> 00:42:25,745
What? It's Mr. An again.

513
00:42:25,828 --> 00:42:28,122
-What?
-Jeez.

514
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:29,999
When are we getting a real model?

515
00:42:30,082 --> 00:42:31,959
Even if we can't get nude models,

516
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:33,919
we can't keep having you as our model…

517
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:35,629
We're getting sick of it now.

518
00:42:35,713 --> 00:42:37,798
You guys, quiet down.

519
00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:44,013
All right. We have
a special model for today's class.

520
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:45,347
-Is it you?
-Me?

521
00:42:45,431 --> 00:42:47,183
It's probably Ms. Jo again.

522
00:42:47,266 --> 00:42:48,726
All right, come in!

523
00:42:55,316 --> 00:42:56,734
No way.

524
00:42:56,817 --> 00:42:59,278
I can draw a hundred sketches of him.

525
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:01,739
He could be our main model.

526
00:43:50,037 --> 00:43:52,206
Next pose, please.

527
00:44:11,892 --> 00:44:15,896
Why did Jae-eon agree to do this, though?

528
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,857
It's so unlike him.

529
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,441
Because Mr. An told him--

530
00:44:26,907 --> 00:44:28,701
Good work today, everyone.

531
00:44:28,784 --> 00:44:30,536
-Thanks. You did good.
-Thank you.

532
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:32,454
-Thank you for today.
-Thank you.

533
00:44:32,538 --> 00:44:33,831
The model was great today.

534
00:44:33,914 --> 00:44:35,332
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

535
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:37,167
She just said the model was great.

536
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:39,003
-Are you going to the studio?
-Should we eat?

537
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:40,671
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

538
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:43,966
-Do you want to go eat?
-Do you want to go eat, Sol?

539
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,217
Go ahead first.

540
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:48,345
Hey, Jae-eon. How do you
do that flirtatious wink?

541
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:51,015
What? Me? I didn't wink.

542
00:44:51,098 --> 00:44:52,766
-Why would you do that?
-I didn't!

543
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,018
How shameless.

544
00:44:59,982 --> 00:45:02,151
Jae-eon, can you help out?

545
00:45:02,234 --> 00:45:04,528
-Jae-eon? Help us.
-Okay.

546
00:45:04,612 --> 00:45:06,322
He was the model, though.

547
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:10,576
Do-hyeok.

548
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:15,914
-It must've been tough coming here.
-It's fine.

549
00:45:15,998 --> 00:45:18,208
-What's that?
-What? Oh, it's nothing.

550
00:45:19,376 --> 00:45:20,794
You're hungry, right? Let's go.

551
00:45:20,878 --> 00:45:22,296
-It's this way.
-Okay.

552
00:45:26,008 --> 00:45:28,844
Gosh. Did you make this yourself?

553
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:30,012
Yes.

554
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:31,847
Gosh…

555
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:36,644
This looks so good.

556
00:45:40,314 --> 00:45:41,482
It's delicious.

557
00:45:42,775 --> 00:45:45,569
I only had delivery
and convenience store food these days.

558
00:45:47,905 --> 00:45:50,199
-I'll make food for you often.
-Sure.

559
00:45:51,742 --> 00:45:53,786
You must've stayed up late making this.

560
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:55,913
It would've been tough coming here too.

561
00:45:55,996 --> 00:45:57,289
No, it didn't take long.

562
00:45:57,873 --> 00:45:59,583
I brought some fruits too.

563
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:01,210
Okay. What's this?

564
00:46:01,794 --> 00:46:02,628
Open it.

565
00:46:04,004 --> 00:46:06,423
-What is it?
-Don't get anxious.

566
00:46:06,507 --> 00:46:08,550
I didn't make a heart
with beans or anything.

567
00:46:09,927 --> 00:46:11,136
You noticed that?

568
00:46:14,723 --> 00:46:16,475
Hey, I love these!

569
00:46:18,185 --> 00:46:20,312
-Dip it in the sauce.
-You should eat too.

570
00:46:20,396 --> 00:46:21,313
I'm okay.

571
00:46:25,818 --> 00:46:28,237
-Thanks for this.
-Enjoy.

572
00:46:30,906 --> 00:46:32,157
Jae-eon!

573
00:46:42,904 --> 00:46:44,072
What is it?

574
00:46:44,155 --> 00:46:45,240
It's nothing.

575
00:46:46,157 --> 00:46:49,119
When you said you'd show me your videos,

576
00:46:49,202 --> 00:46:53,081
I thought you'd send them to me
through email or message.

577
00:46:53,164 --> 00:46:54,207
I see.

578
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,710
I wanted to see you too.

579
00:46:57,294 --> 00:46:58,753
Right. I'm glad you came.

580
00:46:58,837 --> 00:47:01,089
I got to eat a nice meal too.

581
00:47:03,508 --> 00:47:05,886
Let's watch.
I'm curious about your videos.

582
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,221
All right.

583
00:47:13,935 --> 00:47:14,978
Here.

584
00:47:16,897 --> 00:47:17,856
Left ear.

585
00:47:23,236 --> 00:47:24,321
Play.

586
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:27,115
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
DIRECTIONS TO THE NOODLE SHOP

587
00:47:28,158 --> 00:47:29,576
The music is good.

588
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:40,545
Hey! Isn't this the beach
in front of the noodle shop?

589
00:47:40,629 --> 00:47:42,213
Yes, it is.

590
00:47:42,297 --> 00:47:44,841
Gosh. I want to go there too.

591
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:51,932
-It's kind of weird, right?
-No, it's fine.

592
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:57,228
How do you chop so well?

593
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,527
Nice.

594
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,335
This is amazing.

595
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:22,629
Stop looking at it.

596
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:25,090
If you keep looking at it,
you'll see the flaws.

597
00:48:26,216 --> 00:48:28,009
I knew it.

598
00:48:28,593 --> 00:48:30,387
You're really talented.

599
00:48:31,137 --> 00:48:33,974
It's nothing. Everyone can do that much.

600
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:36,142
That again?

601
00:48:37,936 --> 00:48:39,104
Na-bi.

602
00:48:39,813 --> 00:48:43,066
You don't seem to know
how talented and charming you are.

603
00:48:48,113 --> 00:48:49,698
What's with the sudden compliment?

604
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:52,742
You keep saying stuff like that
out of the blue.

605
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:56,621
I'm not the one who doesn't know.
It's you who doesn't know me.

606
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:03,086
Oh, by the way, did you get an assistant?

607
00:49:05,255 --> 00:49:07,674
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

608
00:49:07,757 --> 00:49:10,802
I'm working on it
with two juniors from my department.

609
00:49:12,387 --> 00:49:13,888
-I see.
-Yes.

610
00:49:14,931 --> 00:49:18,643
<i>I can't bring myself to tell him
that Jae-eon is one of them.</i>

611
00:49:21,646 --> 00:49:23,565
<i>Why does it feel like I'm cheating?</i>

612
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:26,234
That's great.

613
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:29,279
It's too bad I lost my chance

614
00:49:30,697 --> 00:49:31,823
to help you, though.

615
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:34,534
Right.

616
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:38,621
Your class must be starting soon.
Go on inside.

617
00:49:39,414 --> 00:49:42,125
No, it's fine.
I'll walk you to the main gate.

618
00:49:44,544 --> 00:49:46,463
Are you going back home today?

619
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,633
I'm visiting the restaurant later,
so I'm not sure.

620
00:49:51,885 --> 00:49:54,220
Oh, right. The one you worked at?

621
00:49:54,304 --> 00:49:55,305
-Yes.
-Okay.

622
00:49:56,181 --> 00:49:57,891
Are you working late again tonight?

623
00:50:00,602 --> 00:50:01,686
Probably.

624
00:50:02,937 --> 00:50:04,481
Isn't it scary at night?

625
00:50:05,523 --> 00:50:06,566
Not at all.

626
00:50:07,317 --> 00:50:09,277
I actually focus better at night.

627
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,949
Thanks for walking me here.

628
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:17,952
I didn't really do much.

629
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:19,662
And thanks for watching my videos.

630
00:50:19,746 --> 00:50:21,915
I'll use some of the ideas you gave me.

631
00:50:21,998 --> 00:50:23,750
Okay, then.

632
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:25,877
-I should get back now.
-Okay.

633
00:50:26,669 --> 00:50:27,837
-I'm really going.
-Okay.

634
00:50:29,255 --> 00:50:30,632
Thanks for the meal.

635
00:50:31,132 --> 00:50:33,134
Thank you. Go on.

636
00:50:33,218 --> 00:50:34,469
Be careful on the way.

637
00:50:36,096 --> 00:50:37,138
<i>I don't ever want</i>

638
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,767
<i>to disappoint Do-hyeok.</i>

639
00:50:47,816 --> 00:50:50,568
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SELECTED
FOR THE EXCHANGE STUDENT PROGRAM

640
00:51:20,306 --> 00:51:21,516
MY SOL

641
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,685
LET'S EAT DINNER TONIGHT IF YOU'RE FREE
SURE, I'M FREE

642
00:51:27,105 --> 00:51:28,606
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE ARE YOU?

643
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,316
LET'S WATCH THIS MOVIE
WHAT ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

644
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:44,539
I…

645
00:51:53,923 --> 00:51:55,758
LET'S WATCH THIS MOVIE
WHAT ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

646
00:52:56,736 --> 00:52:57,904
Aren't you leaving?

647
00:52:58,446 --> 00:52:59,530
You're going?

648
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:02,325
I have plans. What about you?
Are you staying up all night?

649
00:53:03,618 --> 00:53:04,619
I don't know.

650
00:53:05,745 --> 00:53:07,789
Should I just leave too?

651
00:53:08,414 --> 00:53:09,249
Is something up?

652
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:13,419
No, nothing.

653
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:16,005
You don't look so good.
Don't strain yourself.

654
00:53:17,465 --> 00:53:19,175
-All right.
-Bye, then.

655
00:53:20,218 --> 00:53:21,302
Bye.

656
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:41,114
I really don't feel like working.

657
00:53:49,205 --> 00:53:51,582
You're late. Did you eat dinner?

658
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:52,583
I did.

659
00:53:54,669 --> 00:53:57,213
I told you not to drink
straight from the bottle!

660
00:53:57,297 --> 00:53:59,007
Oh, okay.

661
00:54:08,808 --> 00:54:10,184
You look exhausted.

662
00:54:10,268 --> 00:54:12,020
Was it your part-time job at the academy?

663
00:54:12,103 --> 00:54:14,897
No, I was setting up stuff
for the exhibition.

664
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:16,566
My part-time job is on weekends.

665
00:54:16,649 --> 00:54:19,319
Don't strain yourself.
We have to write our thesis too.

666
00:54:20,278 --> 00:54:22,947
By the way, who was your roommate before?

667
00:54:23,531 --> 00:54:25,575
-My roommate? Yun--
-Yun-ji?

668
00:54:25,658 --> 00:54:27,493
Yun-seok, a contemporary art major.

669
00:54:27,577 --> 00:54:29,579
-He went to the military.
-Is that all?

670
00:54:29,662 --> 00:54:31,039
Well, before that,

671
00:54:31,122 --> 00:54:33,458
-there was--
-Oh, never mind.

672
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:36,586
I'm still looking for a room.
I'll be able to leave soon.

673
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:38,129
What's the hurry?

674
00:54:38,212 --> 00:54:41,424
If you're overworking these days
because of that…

675
00:54:41,507 --> 00:54:43,760
Jeez. You're at it again.

676
00:54:44,344 --> 00:54:45,219
What?

677
00:54:46,512 --> 00:54:48,556
Why are you so nosy?

678
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:50,683
You don't need to mind me.

679
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,359
Is that a cat?

680
00:55:01,527 --> 00:55:02,737
Oh, I forgot.

681
00:55:03,738 --> 00:55:05,031
Are you allergic to cats?

682
00:55:05,114 --> 00:55:07,033
No, I'm not. But…

683
00:55:07,116 --> 00:55:08,159
That's a relief.

684
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:11,496
I've been taking care
of this stray cat for a while.

685
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:14,874
I was waiting for its mother,
but she never came.

686
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:17,168
And it must've been in the rain.

687
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:19,837
I thought it shouldn't be alone,
so I brought it home.

688
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:23,591
Gosh, you're taking care of animals now?

689
00:55:24,175 --> 00:55:25,343
You're unbelievable.

690
00:55:25,426 --> 00:55:27,220
-Isn't it cute? Do you want to hold it?
-Sure.

691
00:55:29,097 --> 00:55:31,891
Oh, my gosh. It's so tiny.

692
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:34,143
I guess it likes you.

693
00:55:36,062 --> 00:55:38,439
Hey, I'm the one who brought you here.

694
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:41,067
Have you named it yet?

695
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,985
Not yet. What should I name it?

696
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:44,278
Let's see.

697
00:55:45,738 --> 00:55:47,740
Congratulations.

698
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:50,368
You've met a guardian

699
00:55:50,451 --> 00:55:52,912
who is so nosy and full of compassion.

700
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:57,083
It's trying to go in.

701
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:59,127
It's so cute.

702
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:01,087
What?

703
00:56:26,612 --> 00:56:27,697
Yun Sol.

704
00:56:29,198 --> 00:56:30,658
Let's talk for a minute.

705
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:40,501
I have to meet someone.

706
00:56:41,461 --> 00:56:42,503
Let's talk later.

707
00:56:43,212 --> 00:56:45,715
Who are you meeting at this hour?

708
00:56:47,758 --> 00:56:50,511
It won't take long. I'll be quick.

709
00:56:54,974 --> 00:56:56,517
Well…

710
00:56:57,602 --> 00:57:01,981
I've been thinking about why
you're acting like this to me these days.

711
00:57:03,399 --> 00:57:05,234
I think you've changed

712
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:09,363
since we came back from the workshop.

713
00:57:09,447 --> 00:57:11,324
So I guess

714
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:15,369
it's because of what I did that night.

715
00:57:16,662 --> 00:57:17,914
What I mean to say is…

716
00:57:18,498 --> 00:57:22,043
I remember what happened that night.

717
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:29,050
So?

718
00:57:29,717 --> 00:57:31,052
Is that it?

719
00:57:31,844 --> 00:57:32,970
What?

720
00:57:34,972 --> 00:57:37,475
-No, that's not it.
-What is it, then?

721
00:57:40,144 --> 00:57:41,062
Well…

722
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,941
I don't know!

723
00:57:45,608 --> 00:57:48,778
I thought you'd say something too.

724
00:57:48,861 --> 00:57:52,198
Do you want to apologize
about what you did that night?

725
00:57:53,908 --> 00:57:55,034
What?

726
00:57:55,117 --> 00:57:57,161
Well, I…

727
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:03,084
I guess you think
I should apologize for what I did, then.

728
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:06,420
If what you did

729
00:58:08,297 --> 00:58:10,383
was just a mistake you need to fix.

730
00:58:11,384 --> 00:58:13,928
What? What do you mean?

731
00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:17,306
Because if you did that with no meaning,

732
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:20,518
then you're hurting me.

733
00:58:24,355 --> 00:58:25,439
Because…

734
00:58:26,691 --> 00:58:28,067
I like you.

735
00:58:30,778 --> 00:58:33,531
Of course, I like you too.

736
00:58:33,614 --> 00:58:34,699
Not as friends.

737
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:44,709
Yun Sol. What's going on?

738
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,879
I'm not saying I'll do anything.

739
00:58:49,213 --> 00:58:53,259
And I know very well
that you don't like me.

740
00:58:59,181 --> 00:59:03,269
I thought I'd be able
to act like nothing happened.

741
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:07,523
But it's difficult.

742
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:20,077
I guess I'm the one
who needs to apologize.

743
00:59:22,038 --> 00:59:22,997
I'm sorry…

744
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:25,791
for liking you.

745
00:59:30,254 --> 00:59:31,339
Well…

746
00:59:33,257 --> 00:59:35,384
I'm going to be late. I should get going.

747
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:45,686
It wasn't meaningless.

748
00:59:46,771 --> 00:59:48,272
So I won't apologize.

749
00:59:52,068 --> 00:59:54,904
But I'm not sure how I feel.

750
01:00:30,815 --> 01:00:32,650
Hey, guys. I'm here.

751
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:34,402
Hey, Do-hyeok.

752
01:00:35,319 --> 01:00:36,612
How have you been?

753
01:00:36,696 --> 01:00:38,197
Good. Just the two of us.

754
01:00:38,823 --> 01:00:41,033
-What's this?
-It's nothing special.

755
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:44,245
You look really happy.

756
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:46,956
He's the owner of a restaurant now.

757
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:49,333
I don't think that's it.

758
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:51,377
Your face is totally glowing.

759
01:00:52,628 --> 01:00:55,965
I'm in a pretty good mood these days.

760
01:00:56,048 --> 01:00:57,258
What?

761
01:00:59,093 --> 01:01:01,012
-I get it.
-What?

762
01:01:02,388 --> 01:01:04,932
You're finally dating someone, right?

763
01:01:05,016 --> 01:01:06,475
It's not that.

764
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,936
-Is it true? Who is it?
-No.

765
01:01:09,603 --> 01:01:10,646
That girl from before?

766
01:01:11,814 --> 01:01:12,940
Well…

767
01:02:17,755 --> 01:02:20,966
PARK JAE-EON

768
01:02:36,148 --> 01:02:37,399
PARK JAE-EON

769
01:02:39,276 --> 01:02:41,445
PARK JAE-EON

770
01:03:23,737 --> 01:03:25,281
Do you want to go see butterflies?

771
01:03:41,701 --> 01:03:45,741
NEVERTHELESS,

772
01:03:59,095 --> 01:04:05,068
Subtitle translation by: Ju-young Park

773
01:04:26,508 --> 01:04:27,468
I'll be there soon.

774
01:04:27,551 --> 01:04:30,971
<i>Na-bi keeps looking somewhere else
instead of looking at me.</i>

775
01:04:31,055 --> 01:04:35,309
<i>Na-bi. I really wish you were happy.</i>

776
01:04:35,392 --> 01:04:36,685
<i>Do you like him?</i>

777
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:38,062
<i>Let's not make another mistake.</i>

778
01:04:38,145 --> 01:04:41,565
<i>Maybe Na-bi was already drifting
away from me.</i>

779
01:04:41,649 --> 01:04:43,776
<i>Can we meet right now?</i>

780
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:45,653
<i>If it's not urgent, let's meet next time.</i>

781
01:04:45,736 --> 01:04:47,780
<i>Did you eventually lose to Jae-eon?</i>

782
01:04:47,863 --> 01:04:50,241
<i>Maybe it was all wrong from the beginning.</i>

783
01:04:50,324 --> 01:04:52,076
<i>I can't find a solution.</i>

784
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,410
I miss you.

785
01:04:53,494 --> 01:04:56,247
<i>I'm not used to how I am
when I'm with Na-bi.</i>

786
01:04:56,872 --> 01:05:00,334
Have you felt, even once,
that he sincerely likes you?

787
01:05:00,918 --> 01:05:02,378
<i>Do you really think this is a mistake?</i>

788
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:04,046
<i>-Of course.
-That's a lie.</i>

789
01:05:04,922 --> 01:05:06,674
<i>Let's go out.</i>

790
