1
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:31,520
<i>This is crazy.</i>

2
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:34,565
<i>But it was so good.</i>

3
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:39,069
I want to keep sleeping like this.

4
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:40,696
Me too.

5
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:44,074
Should we skip school?

6
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:31,538
<i>At least if I was drunk,
I could have used that as an excuse.</i>

7
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:41,340
EPISODE 4: I KNOW IT ISN'T LOVE.
NEVERTHELESS,

8
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:51,224
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

9
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:53,602
Where's the hair dryer?

10
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,480
-Darn it.
-Let's talk.

11
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:00,484
Hey, put your clothes on!

12
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:06,740
I must have alcohol-related dementia.

13
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,743
I don't remember what happened yesterday.

14
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:12,412
-So--
-It was a mistake?

15
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:13,622
What?

16
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:21,296
Yes. Honestly, we both
made a mistake while drunk, right?

17
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:25,217
So there's nothing to change between us.

18
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:27,135
Don't you think?

19
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:28,720
I'm leaving.

20
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:32,516
Hey! Wait!

21
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:40,148
Darn it! I must have lost my mind!

22
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:43,193
Why did it have to be him?

23
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,454
Is that mine?

24
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:58,041
Yes. I washed it.

25
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:01,086
It's fine, you can have it.

26
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,839
Or just throw it away.

27
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,342
Right.
I'm going to have breakfast outside.

28
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:09,177
Outside?

29
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:10,470
By myself.

30
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:14,850
Oh, right. I get it.

31
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:17,561
I should get some more sleep.

32
00:03:18,228 --> 00:03:19,479
Go ahead.

33
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:25,777
I want to keep seeing you.

34
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:28,697
What about you?

35
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,907
<i>This is it.</i>

36
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:32,284
What do you mean?

37
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,660
Should we meet up sometimes?

38
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:37,247
<i>So he's asking if I want to meet up</i>

39
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:40,917
<i>and sleep with him sometimes</i>

40
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,669
<i>without dating?</i>

41
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:44,963
I'm not sure.

42
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:47,507
Think about it and tell me.

43
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:52,179
I'll be off. Go to the hospital
if you're not feeling well. Okay?

44
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:54,264
Okay.

45
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,290
Park Jae-eon?

46
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:39,684
-It wasn't a mistake for me.
-What?

47
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:42,938
And things won't be the same
for me, either.

48
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:45,774
So I don't think I can pretend
it didn't happen.

49
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:53,073
What if you don't?

50
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:57,035
I don't think I can stay friends
with you now.

51
00:04:57,118 --> 00:04:58,495
Then what?

52
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,916
-You don't mean…
-Be my girlfriend.

53
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:12,300
Hey! You…

54
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:18,682
You want to date because we slept
together once? You're overreacting.

55
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:19,975
Do you like me?

56
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:26,189
See? You can't answer that.

57
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:29,693
Plus, I really don't want to date
within such a small department.

58
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,236
Rumors will spread so quickly.

59
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,988
It's going to be really irritating.

60
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:38,702
All right.

61
00:05:39,828 --> 00:05:43,164
I understand how you feel,
so I'll take care of my own feelings.

62
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:47,085
What do you mean? Hey!

63
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:54,384
The guy Sol brought over last night.
Was he her boyfriend?

64
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:56,553
I don't know.

65
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:59,514
Jeez!

66
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:02,225
You're the only one who'd know!

67
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:04,477
Who is he? Is it…

68
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,065
Is it serious?

69
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:11,985
Ask her yourself.

70
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:14,946
I don't care who she dates.

71
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,406
This is so annoying.

72
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:18,992
What? Did you two fight?

73
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:24,497
Right. You didn't know about
Sol leaving as an exchange student too.

74
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:28,084
We didn't fight. That's just
the extent of our relationship.

75
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:30,128
I'm going.

76
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,268
Seo Ji-wan.

77
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:48,813
Ji-wan. Ji-wan!

78
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,107
Let me talk to you.

79
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:56,488
Fine. Talk.
What do you want to talk about first?

80
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:59,366
Going abroad? Or your boyfriend?

81
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:01,660
Everyone knew except me.

82
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,370
I was going to tell you.

83
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:05,872
Right. When were you going to tell me?

84
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:08,625
The day before you left?
The day before you got married?

85
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,503
What's with you?
You said you don't care who I date.

86
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:13,088
Right. I don't.

87
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:15,757
I'm just angry because
you're leaving me out like this.

88
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,760
-When did I leave you out--
-You've always done this.

89
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:22,597
You never tell me important things
about yourself. You know that?

90
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,059
Like what?

91
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:43,159
I guess this really is the extent
of our relationship.

92
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:09,436
Thanks.

93
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:12,647
What's your next class?

94
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:16,234
Human Anatomy. It's so hard.

95
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:18,903
I got an A in that class.

96
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:20,321
-Really?
-Yes.

97
00:08:20,405 --> 00:08:23,283
-Then help me study.
-What will you do for me, then?

98
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:29,456
What should I do for you?

99
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,959
Jeez…

100
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,924
By the way…

101
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:43,011
Well…

102
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:48,349
I don't want anyone to know about us.

103
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:52,520
All right.

104
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,190
-Okay.
-Okay.

105
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:58,318
And…

106
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:00,528
Well…

107
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:02,447
You don't…

108
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:08,495
have any diseases or anything, do you?

109
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:12,791
Do you?

110
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,213
Don't laugh! I'm serious.

111
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:21,508
I don't, so don't worry.

112
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:25,136
Okay.

113
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,264
Do you have time later?

114
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,894
Yes, I have some time.

115
00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:35,396
No, should we meet on Saturday?

116
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:38,691
You need to rest the next day, right?

117
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,780
No. It's totally fine.

118
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:21,317
<i>Why did I do that? I acted so impulsively.</i>

119
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:24,487
I must've lost my mind.

120
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:32,245
I should just tell him not to come.

121
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:50,680
-Come in.
-Hey.

122
00:10:57,353 --> 00:10:58,605
What's with the alcohol?

123
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,941
It'll be nice to drink together.

124
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,318
It'll be fun.

125
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,738
Oh, I drank some already.

126
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:09,490
<i>I couldn't do this sober.</i>

127
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,827
This is cheating.

128
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:14,287
What do you mean?

129
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,041
We didn't decide on anything.

130
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,210
Decide what?

131
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:24,756
Weren't we going to study
Human Anatomy together?

132
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:27,926
Oh, right.

133
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:30,845
Right. Human Anatomy.

134
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:35,016
Yes. We should study.

135
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:42,023
Stop laughing.

136
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:45,318
I have a gift for you.

137
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:58,331
<i>Jae-eon is too smooth with everything.</i>

138
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:02,627
<i>It's like everything
comes naturally to him.</i>

139
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:04,712
All done.

140
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:09,801
Do you like it?

141
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:12,512
Yes.

142
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:15,974
It's pretty.

143
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:20,228
It'll be prettier
with the sunlight in the morning.

144
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:35,535
<i>Like this was always
going to happen between us.</i>

145
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:42,458
You got me again.

146
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:49,757
Hang on.

147
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:56,556
PARK JAE-EON

148
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:00,560
You saved my number.

149
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:08,860
<i>I can stop this right now.</i>

150
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:14,657
<i>Because there are so many reasons
why I shouldn't do this.</i>

151
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:20,621
<i>But…</i>

152
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,230
You know, you have a mole here.

153
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:48,107
Where?

154
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:50,109
Here.

155
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:55,156
I didn't know.

156
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:02,997
You look even more pretty today.

157
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:05,875
<i>I'm still attracted to him,
even at this moment.</i>

158
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,420
<i>Like crazy.</i>

159
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:32,610
<i>That one simple reason</i>

160
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:36,489
<i>buries all my concerns again.</i>

161
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,706
Didn't it hurt when you got that tattoo
behind your neck?

162
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:50,420
Of course, it hurt.

163
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:53,214
I almost died.

164
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:56,843
I thought of quitting in the middle.

165
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:03,057
I'm going to get another one soon.

166
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:05,351
Where?

167
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,065
Around here.

168
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,445
Another butterfly?

169
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:16,571
Yes.

170
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:21,909
A butterfly with lots of black spots
on its wings.

171
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:23,369
The name's pretty difficult.

172
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,623
Taiwanese black-star hairstreak butterfly.

173
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:31,169
Taiwan…

174
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:33,838
That's a really long name.

175
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:40,011
They eat flowers instead of leaves

176
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:42,638
when they're caterpillars.

177
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,057
It's unique, right?

178
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:47,935
Yes.

179
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:52,315
<i>Since that day, a lot of things
have changed between us.</i>

180
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:56,360
<i>And Jae-eon slowly seeped into my life.</i>

181
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,117
Get washed.

182
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,878
I'm starting work
at the department office.

183
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:16,881
You decided to do that? Aren't you busy?

184
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:19,926
I won't work that long. Just for a while.

185
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:24,514
It's because of you.

186
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:28,935
Why?

187
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:32,230
Come visit often.

188
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:35,399
-Why would I?
-What?

189
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:38,569
Come visit me.

190
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:42,031
All right?

191
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:43,241
Why would I?

192
00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:46,994
Okay, I will.

193
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,879
Jae-eon, where's that suncatcher
you made last time?

194
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:58,381
The butterfly-shaped one.

195
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:00,049
Oh, that?

196
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,510
I gifted it to someone.

197
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:06,055
That's too bad. I wanted to see it
when it was finished.

198
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:09,058
-Can you tell us how to make it?
-Tell us!

199
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,394
Learn that from
the Ceramics and Glass students.

200
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:13,437
Jae-eon is mine now.

201
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:16,607
What are you talking about?

202
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:18,693
Darn it! You're so noisy.

203
00:17:19,443 --> 00:17:22,738
If you're done, please just leave.

204
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:26,075
-Guys, get out.
-Okay.

205
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:28,160
-Bye.
-Bye.

206
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:34,333
I heard he doesn't date,
but I guess he has a girlfriend.

207
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,711
I wonder who it is.
She must be really pretty.

208
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:55,896
-It's raining a lot.
-It is.

209
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:07,742
-Don't do it.
-I have to do this!

210
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:10,077
Stop working. Let's just sleep.

211
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,954
-Already?
-Yes.

212
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,916
-Already?
-Yes. I'm sleepy.

213
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:28,679
<i>Our relationship only exists
at night, but…</i>

214
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:31,932
Are you washing the dishes?

215
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:35,186
Yes. It seems like you don't do the dishes
when I'm coming.

216
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,021
You caught me.

217
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:39,899
I think you're pretty good at housework.

218
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:42,485
Will you do the laundry too?

219
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:45,237
-Should I?
-Yes.

220
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:49,408
-Then let's do it together.
-No. I don't want to do it.

221
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:53,079
<i>It sometimes felt like we were lovers.</i>

222
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,373
What's your goal today?

223
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,503
Really? Can you do it?

224
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:04,048
Don't strain yourself.

225
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:11,055
What was that?

226
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:16,602
My tongue gets numb when I eat this.

227
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:18,604
So I kissed you first.

228
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:21,774
<i>Jae-eon is still a mystery to me.</i>

229
00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:23,234
What are you on about?

230
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,527
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

231
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:27,363
Here.

232
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:35,329
You said your tongue gets numb.
This is good, though.

233
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,956
-Really?
-Yes.

234
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,255
Just eat.

235
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,679
-It's good, right?
-Yes. It's tastier today.

236
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:17,079
<i>I can't tell if he's warm or cold,</i>

237
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:20,499
<i>serious or joking.</i>

238
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:37,099
Are you done with assignments?

239
00:20:37,725 --> 00:20:38,934
No.

240
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,687
Go sleep at your house.

241
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:46,817
I can't just leave.

242
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:03,334
<i>My anxiety about Jae-eon
hasn't disappeared, but…</i>

243
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,555
<i>We're much more compatible than I thought.</i>

244
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:24,605
So the transverse arch

245
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:26,690
can be seen the best from the front.

246
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:29,902
I see. You're right.

247
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:33,489
This is the transverse arch?

248
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:35,032
Yes.

249
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:38,452
And this is the medial longitudinal arch.

250
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:42,331
-Yes.
-This is the lateral longitudinal arch.

251
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:44,291
Correct.

252
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:49,380
-What about this?
-Stop. It tickles.

253
00:21:49,463 --> 00:21:50,673
Stop.

254
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:52,675
I'm studying right now.

255
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:55,094
What about this?

256
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:57,137
Hey, it tickles.

257
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,772
<i>And I enjoy</i>

258
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:09,233
<i>spending nights with him.</i>

259
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:19,451
Thank you.

260
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:23,872
-It looks delicious.
-I want corn.

261
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:25,291
I thought you were on a diet.

262
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:28,627
-That's why I'm only eating the shrimp.
-Oh, is that right?

263
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,425
Are you dating someone these days?

264
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:36,051
Me?

265
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:40,264
No. Why?

266
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:44,143
You just seem to be in a good mood
these days.

267
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:46,812
Your face seems to be glowing a bit.

268
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,274
I've been sleeping well.

269
00:22:54,403 --> 00:22:57,281
I mean, I've been getting lots of sleep.

270
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:02,119
Right. Sleeping is the best way
to improve the condition of your skin.

271
00:23:02,911 --> 00:23:06,290
Oh, right!
Gyu-hyun, would you like a blind date?

272
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,879
A blind date? With who?

273
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:13,297
My high school friend.

274
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,050
She saw a photo of you on social media,
and she wants to meet you.

275
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:19,428
She hasn't been dating for a while,
so she's always saying she's lonely.

276
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:20,929
Tell your friend

277
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:23,807
that seeing any guy just because
she's lonely won't end well.

278
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:26,977
Lonely people will be lonely
even if they date someone.

279
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:28,395
And I think

280
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:31,273
that if you're in a relationship,

281
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:35,361
you have a kind of duty
not to make the other feel lonely.

282
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:37,071
You're right about that.

283
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:38,280
<i>Today?</i>

284
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:40,074
Let me see her photo.

285
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:41,867
All right.

286
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,868
Let me see.

287
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:45,663
-She's pretty.
-Do you like her?

288
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:46,997
Introduce me to her.

289
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:49,500
Should I give you her number, then?

290
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:51,210
She likes you.

291
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:54,922
<i>I'm not going to give you what you want.</i>

292
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,219
So are you interested?

293
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,392
-Send me her number.
-No way. She's going to be so happy.

294
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:09,311
-Come on, eat.
-I don't feel like it.

295
00:24:09,395 --> 00:24:12,272
BRING ICE CREAM
OKAY

296
00:24:12,356 --> 00:24:14,274
-Can I eat the shrimp, then?
-Just eat it.

297
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:20,948
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

298
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:23,367
-Bow.
-Hello. And then…

299
00:24:24,618 --> 00:24:27,037
-Take one step forward.
-One step forward.

300
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:28,956
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

301
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:32,000
-Are you really okay?
-Yes. I'm fine.

302
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:33,419
Let's try it again.

303
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:38,465
Grab each other's hands…

304
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:41,135
-Go.
-Go.

305
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:43,470
-One, two.
-One, two.

306
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:45,764
-Turn.
-Three, four.

307
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:47,850
-One, two.
-All right.

308
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:50,352
-Here.
-Now? Oh, my gosh.

309
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:53,981
Are you okay?

310
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:56,066
You're going to break my feet soon.

311
00:24:57,943 --> 00:24:59,695
Should I just give up?

312
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:01,572
I got scammed by Bit-na.

313
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:03,824
She said this class was really easy.

314
00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:07,703
Do you really think it's her fault?

315
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:11,623
Let's try it just once more.

316
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:14,418
You seemed to have potential,
from what I saw at the club.

317
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:16,503
Forget it. Stop teasing me.

318
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:21,341
Why are you so good at dancing, though?
Did you learn this before?

319
00:25:21,425 --> 00:25:23,093
Or are you a natural?

320
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:24,970
I'm not sure.

321
00:25:25,554 --> 00:25:26,889
My mom's a dancer.

322
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:29,725
Really? Does she still dance?

323
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:39,318
Do you have time this Sunday?

324
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:42,905
Sunday? Well…

325
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:45,449
Today's Friday, though.

326
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,160
What?

327
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:51,747
Do you think I'm a sex maniac?

328
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:53,332
Then what is it?

329
00:25:53,415 --> 00:25:57,503
There's an exhibit that ends this weekend.
I thought we'd go together.

330
00:25:57,586 --> 00:25:58,879
Oh, that?

331
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:02,382
I did want to go…

332
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:03,717
Should we go together?

333
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:08,889
I'll think about it…

334
00:26:08,972 --> 00:26:11,475
Let's go together, okay?

335
00:26:35,624 --> 00:26:37,835
<i>He probably doesn't even know
what day it is.</i>

336
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:40,546
<i>I'm weird for thinking about this.</i>

337
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:46,260
AUNTIE

338
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,935
Auntie. Did you pull an all-nighter again?

339
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:56,770
I should work as hard as you.

340
00:26:56,854 --> 00:26:59,273
I'm used to this anyway.

341
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:01,859
Are you going to your mom's this Sunday?

342
00:27:01,942 --> 00:27:04,361
It's your birthday,
so I was thinking of visiting.

343
00:27:04,444 --> 00:27:06,947
<i>You don't need to come.
It'll only be tiring for you.</i>

344
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,366
I'll visit you once the semester is over.

345
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,785
Do you want anything as a present, then?

346
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:14,037
I'll get you anything you want.

347
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:18,417
Gosh, I wish you were my mom.

348
00:27:19,459 --> 00:27:22,713
<i>You're lucky because you have
both your mom and your aunt.</i>

349
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:31,805
You should spend your birthday with
the person you want to be with the most.

350
00:27:36,351 --> 00:27:38,103
The person I want to be with?

351
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:58,832
Hi. I just finished. I'll be there soon.

352
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:05,380
This looks good.

353
00:28:09,176 --> 00:28:10,719
Hello.

354
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:12,930
Jae-eon just left.

355
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:17,100
What? Oh, I just came to apply
for late-night work.

356
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:21,146
-Did you eat?
-Come sit. You can eat with us.

357
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,023
We ordered three servings.

358
00:28:23,106 --> 00:28:24,399
All right.

359
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:40,165
Do you have something to say?

360
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:44,336
Well…

361
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:48,757
Would it be weird to spend your birthday
with someone you're not dating?

362
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,969
Then you're getting to know each other?

363
00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:55,264
It's not like that.

364
00:28:56,265 --> 00:28:57,849
But if you do everything else…

365
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:00,519
Do everything else? What do you mean?

366
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:07,818
Oh, then I'd say no. A birthday gift would
be fine, but spending the day together…

367
00:29:08,402 --> 00:29:09,903
That's a bit too much.

368
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:12,948
Right?

369
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:16,118
-Do you love him?
-What?

370
00:29:17,452 --> 00:29:20,998
No, I wasn't talking about myself.
It's about my friend.

371
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,626
-Does she love him?
-You're always going on about love.

372
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,586
That's not a good relationship.

373
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,506
You're sure to regret it soon.

374
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:32,509
Tell your friend to use birth control.

375
00:29:35,137 --> 00:29:36,138
Okay.

376
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,188
Do you still have the butterflies?

377
00:29:45,272 --> 00:29:48,567
Yes. We're getting along very well.

378
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:51,987
You said you'll let them go.

379
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:55,866
Did I say that?

380
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:03,457
I thought about it,
and I guess you were right.

381
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:06,835
About what?

382
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,921
Your butterflies.

383
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:14,593
You said you were keeping them
from their freedom.

384
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:17,846
I think you're right.

385
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:23,143
There's a huge world
just outside the glass.

386
00:30:24,227 --> 00:30:25,729
You're giving them false hope.

387
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:29,316
Did I say that?

388
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:32,486
But…

389
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:36,073
I don't want to let go. Not yet.

390
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:38,116
Then at least be good to them.

391
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,703
You know what your problem is, right?
You torment the things you like.

392
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,126
Hang on.

393
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,045
YU NA-BI

394
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,632
<i>Can you talk right now?</i>

395
00:30:54,216 --> 00:30:56,510
Yes. What is it?

396
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,387
<i>I just called to say</i>

397
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:02,140
<i>that I can't come with you to the exhibit
this weekend.</i>

398
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:04,851
<i>I'm going to see my mom.</i>

399
00:31:05,352 --> 00:31:06,603
Really?

400
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:08,855
That's too bad.

401
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:10,899
<i>Sorry. You can go with someone else.</i>

402
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:12,567
All right.

403
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:15,404
Is there anything else?

404
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:19,449
No, that's it. Bye, then.

405
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:46,726
Na-bi?

406
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:52,190
Yu Na-bi?

407
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,236
Do-hyeok?

408
00:31:57,028 --> 00:31:58,196
Yes.

409
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,616
Yang Do-hyeok?

410
00:32:03,118 --> 00:32:05,537
Hey, it's been such a long time!

411
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,331
Has it been about 10 years?

412
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:11,710
That's right. I thought I'd never
get to see you again.

413
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:15,213
Me too. What are the chances?

414
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,008
-Are you living in Seoul?
-Yes.

415
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:20,677
I'm learning to cook here
after military service.

416
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,637
You're cooking? Like your grandpa?

417
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:27,100
I'm working at a noodle place
at Hongseo University Intersection.

418
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:29,728
Hongseo University Intersection?

419
00:32:31,188 --> 00:32:33,315
-I know that place.
-What?

420
00:32:33,815 --> 00:32:36,568
I never went there before,
but my friends said it was good.

421
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:38,069
Really?

422
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:40,363
You should come sometime.

423
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:42,240
All right, I will.

424
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,455
Do-hyeok, I have to get off.

425
00:32:49,456 --> 00:32:52,292
Hey, Na-bi. Here.

426
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,336
Can you give me your number?

427
00:32:55,378 --> 00:32:56,213
Oh, right.

428
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:58,590
Of course.

429
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:03,595
Here.

430
00:33:04,804 --> 00:33:05,972
Oh, my gosh!

431
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,728
Oh, no.

432
00:33:15,482 --> 00:33:16,816
Are you getting off?

433
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:20,153
-Sir, just a minute!
-It's fine. Go.

434
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:22,822
Sorry, I should go.

435
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:47,764
It's raining.

436
00:33:48,974 --> 00:33:51,726
I'll take you to where you're going.

437
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:55,146
What about your potatoes?

438
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:05,907
That's so funny.

439
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:13,665
How are the others?
I'm curious how they're doing.

440
00:34:13,748 --> 00:34:15,875
Some came to Seoul like you.

441
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:18,587
I only keep in touch with a few of them.

442
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,214
I see.

443
00:34:22,924 --> 00:34:25,343
I thought we'd all keep in touch
back then.

444
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,599
I know. It would've been nice
if we had kept meeting up often.

445
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:34,060
What about the noodle place?

446
00:34:34,144 --> 00:34:36,479
Your grandpa's noodles were amazing.

447
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:39,441
He's not doing so well,
so it's closed for now.

448
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,402
I'm preparing to run it again.

449
00:34:43,445 --> 00:34:45,363
Then you'll run it by yourself?

450
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:46,406
For now.

451
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,451
Just until my grandpa feels better.

452
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:53,038
I can't open it right away,

453
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:55,081
but I'm learning bit by bit.

454
00:34:55,165 --> 00:34:56,791
You're so cool.

455
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,462
You made a big decision.
I'm sure your grandpa will be happy.

456
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:04,049
I'm not sure. He always nags me
about how I'm not that reliable.

457
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:06,843
I'm sure he's proud of you, though.

458
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,058
You should come visit when I open it.
We have a guest house,

459
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:16,728
and it'll be fun to hang out together.

460
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:20,732
Sure, of course. I will.

461
00:35:20,815 --> 00:35:23,234
We're here.
I just have to turn the corner here.

462
00:35:23,318 --> 00:35:25,320
Oh, really?

463
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:32,452
Oh, no. You're all wet.

464
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:33,745
-My gosh.
-It's fine.

465
00:35:34,454 --> 00:35:36,122
You should have said so.

466
00:35:37,707 --> 00:35:42,212
It's so nice to see you again.

467
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:51,638
Thanks for walking me home.
I should go inside.

468
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:54,599
Right. Take this.

469
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:57,268
-No, it's fine!
-I can just use my hood.

470
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:02,899
Hey, Na-bi. Is it…

471
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,945
Is it okay if I message you?

472
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:08,988
Sure.

473
00:36:10,073 --> 00:36:11,533
Go inside, then.

474
00:36:36,683 --> 00:36:38,309
Ttoli!

475
00:36:38,893 --> 00:36:40,145
Ttoli!

476
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:43,898
Hey, it's been a long time.

477
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:00,373
Mom.

478
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:02,625
Mom?

479
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,800
I thought you'd come in the evening.
Why did you come so early?

480
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,513
Stay in your room.

481
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:19,934
Or why don't you go for a walk with Ttoli?

482
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:22,103
Come on. Hurry.

483
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:24,355
Go walk Ttoli, okay? Come on.

484
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,107
Go, Ttoli.

485
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:31,070
You're neglecting me again.

486
00:37:31,654 --> 00:37:32,614
What?

487
00:37:33,323 --> 00:37:35,450
He's going to leave soon.

488
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:37,619
Just stay in your room.

489
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,919
-You went to the signing event, right?
-Yes.

490
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:29,921
-Did you take photos?
-I couldn't!

491
00:38:30,004 --> 00:38:32,006
You should have taken photos.

492
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,551
I know. But he was so handsome.

493
00:38:34,634 --> 00:38:37,470
-Did you shake his hand?
-Of course!

494
00:38:37,554 --> 00:38:39,597
And you went to the concert, right?

495
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:41,683
-Was it fun?
-I watched from the front row.

496
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:43,309
It was amazing.

497
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,649
<i>There was a time
when all I cared about were friends.</i>

498
00:38:49,732 --> 00:38:51,192
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

499
00:38:51,276 --> 00:38:54,320
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

500
00:38:54,404 --> 00:38:56,281
<i>Happy birthday, dear Yu Na-bi</i>

501
00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:57,740
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

502
00:39:00,743 --> 00:39:02,996
Hey!

503
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,790
-Make a wish!
-Make a wish!

504
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:07,375
All right. My wish.

505
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:13,464
<i>And when I started dating,</i>

506
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:16,593
<i>I thought love was everything.</i>

507
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:21,848
<i>And it's been almost two months</i>

508
00:39:21,931 --> 00:39:23,892
<i>since my crazy first relationship ended.</i>

509
00:39:43,161 --> 00:39:46,331
<i>I have friends that I talk to
and have meals with</i>

510
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:48,708
<i>from time to time.</i>

511
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,300
<i>And a friend I have sex with.</i>

512
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,103
Do you want anything for your birthday?

513
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:10,146
I want you.

514
00:40:12,315 --> 00:40:13,441
But where are we going?

515
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:16,152
-It's a secret.
-Come on.

516
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:19,739
-Why isn't the train coming?
-It's late.

517
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,282
How about an amusement park?

518
00:40:21,366 --> 00:40:24,619
<i>But I don't have anyone to spend</i>

519
00:40:25,662 --> 00:40:26,746
<i>my birthday with.</i>

520
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:22,677
THE TRAIN FOR GUJA
WILL BE ARRIVING SHORTLY

521
00:42:02,842 --> 00:42:04,135
I got you!

522
00:43:14,247 --> 00:43:16,999
<i>I thought our relationship
only existed at night.</i>

523
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:25,174
Do you like your gift?

524
00:43:26,926 --> 00:43:29,428
I've never been forced to receive
a gift like this.

525
00:43:29,512 --> 00:43:32,849
Come on. Can't you express your
happiness so I can feel proud?

526
00:43:32,932 --> 00:43:36,018
All right. Thank you!

527
00:43:36,102 --> 00:43:37,436
Wear it tomorrow, okay?

528
00:43:38,146 --> 00:43:39,355
Okay.

529
00:43:40,314 --> 00:43:43,568
But weren't you going to the exhibit?
It's the last day today.

530
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:47,780
How could I think about that right now?

531
00:43:48,322 --> 00:43:50,199
<i>He's making me get my hopes up again.</i>

532
00:43:50,283 --> 00:43:51,284
Then…

533
00:43:52,285 --> 00:43:55,329
You got me a gift,
so let me buy you a meal.

534
00:43:55,955 --> 00:43:57,331
Well…

535
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,877
Oh, do you have plans?

536
00:44:01,544 --> 00:44:02,628
Then--

537
00:44:02,712 --> 00:44:04,881
No. It's your birthday, so…

538
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:09,051
INSTANT SEAWEED SOUP

539
00:44:13,306 --> 00:44:15,516
<i>I thought it was the worst birthday ever.</i>

540
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:19,353
<i>But I guess life is full of variables.</i>

541
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:22,982
Hang on. I'll make this right away.

542
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:29,864
You're talking
as if you're really cooking.

543
00:44:31,073 --> 00:44:32,783
It's the heart that matters.

544
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:37,496
It's been a while since I had
seaweed soup for my birthday.

545
00:44:39,832 --> 00:44:41,208
Really?

546
00:44:41,918 --> 00:44:44,587
I thought everyone had it except for me.

547
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:46,547
I feel comforted now.

548
00:44:57,767 --> 00:44:58,768
What?

549
00:44:58,851 --> 00:45:01,020
You've never told me
something like that before.

550
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,482
You don't talk much about yourself.

551
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:07,401
Well…

552
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:15,576
That's because
you know me so well already.

553
00:45:18,955 --> 00:45:20,706
I don't know anything about you.

554
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:28,589
I really don't.

555
00:45:29,715 --> 00:45:31,509
You're still such a mystery to me.

556
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:42,645
Stop fooling around
and finish making this.

557
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:44,438
Not that.

558
00:45:46,941 --> 00:45:48,150
Then what?

559
00:46:51,714 --> 00:46:55,217
<i>Why can't you be my boyfriend?</i>

560
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,807
So when are you going to make me
the seaweed soup?

561
00:47:04,185 --> 00:47:05,519
I'll make it now.

562
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:08,105
Why aren't you getting up, then?

563
00:47:08,898 --> 00:47:11,067
I have no energy. Five more minutes.

564
00:47:24,538 --> 00:47:26,332
SEOL-A

565
00:47:29,543 --> 00:47:30,503
Let me take a call.

566
00:47:31,796 --> 00:47:33,089
Hang on.

567
00:47:38,177 --> 00:47:40,346
Should we have a drink first?

568
00:47:40,429 --> 00:47:43,015
Or go right away?

569
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:45,518
Well, whatever you prefer.

570
00:47:51,774 --> 00:47:53,526
Let's drink here.

571
00:47:58,322 --> 00:47:59,698
What's your ideal type?

572
00:47:59,782 --> 00:48:00,991
-Me?
-Yes.

573
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:06,247
Are you okay?

574
00:48:08,707 --> 00:48:10,292
Yes. I'm okay.

575
00:48:19,093 --> 00:48:23,013
This place is actually pretty lame.

576
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,726
-Let's drink somewhere else.
-What?

577
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,854
-Let's go.
-Somewhere else?

578
00:48:41,323 --> 00:48:42,908
Do you know her?

579
00:48:43,534 --> 00:48:45,202
No, I don't.

580
00:48:45,286 --> 00:48:47,621
Excuse me. Can I have some ice water?

581
00:48:51,959 --> 00:48:54,837
Sorry. Something urgent came up
with a friend.

582
00:48:56,714 --> 00:48:58,632
Okay. You should go, then.

583
00:48:59,216 --> 00:49:03,262
Make sure to eat.
And don't ignore your mom.

584
00:49:05,848 --> 00:49:07,016
I'll get going.

585
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:09,226
Okay.

586
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:41,842
I'm hungry.

587
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:41,777
Do-hyeok…

588
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,495
Come in.

589
00:50:57,126 --> 00:50:59,211
Sorry. You're closed, right? I…

590
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:00,421
We're not.

591
00:51:07,594 --> 00:51:10,806
What? You have 3,000 subscribers?

592
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,933
You started only three months ago.

593
00:51:13,017 --> 00:51:14,643
You have so many views.

594
00:51:14,727 --> 00:51:16,687
Do you edit the videos yourself?

595
00:51:17,438 --> 00:51:18,647
Yes.

596
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:22,234
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER

597
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:24,570
I saw this before.

598
00:51:25,446 --> 00:51:28,032
The channel name reminded me of you.

599
00:51:28,115 --> 00:51:29,616
You thought about me?

600
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,452
Of course.

601
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,789
I can't believe it really was you.

602
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:37,333
And a culinary arts major?

603
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,129
The Yang Do-hyeok I know

604
00:51:42,212 --> 00:51:44,923
always played with food.

605
00:51:48,844 --> 00:51:50,512
I knew you'd major in art, though.

606
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,349
You were always good at drawing.

607
00:51:55,642 --> 00:51:57,019
Well…

608
00:51:58,979 --> 00:52:00,189
Not that good.

609
00:52:00,731 --> 00:52:02,483
I just liked it.

610
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:08,572
Your videos are really good.

611
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:13,744
Here you go.

612
00:52:18,832 --> 00:52:21,168
Weren't you making noodles for me?

613
00:52:21,794 --> 00:52:22,878
Next time.

614
00:52:23,629 --> 00:52:25,756
Isn't it your birthday today?

615
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,467
You're right.

616
00:52:32,262 --> 00:52:34,932
You have a good memory.
You remembered my birthday?

617
00:52:35,557 --> 00:52:36,642
Of course, I…

618
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:42,606
I have a good memory.

619
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:44,108
Right.

620
00:52:44,775 --> 00:52:47,027
-Do you still like chocolate?
-Yes.

621
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,240
Did you make this yourself, too?

622
00:52:52,032 --> 00:52:54,076
-Yes.
-You're so skilled.

623
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:55,411
It looks delicious.

624
00:53:00,499 --> 00:53:01,500
What?

625
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:05,170
Make a wish.

626
00:53:06,296 --> 00:53:07,673
A wish?

627
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,842
All right.

628
00:53:29,194 --> 00:53:30,279
Happy birthday, Na-bi.

629
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,491
Thank you. I can't believe
I'm with you like this on my birthday.

630
00:53:34,575 --> 00:53:36,493
Life is full of surprises.

631
00:53:37,077 --> 00:53:39,997
I know.
I never imagined this would happen.

632
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:44,460
-It's so good.
-Really?

633
00:53:44,543 --> 00:53:46,128
-Yes!
-That's a relief.

634
00:53:46,712 --> 00:53:48,630
I felt this last time,

635
00:53:48,714 --> 00:53:51,508
but it's not awkward
even when we haven't met for a long time.

636
00:53:52,009 --> 00:53:54,261
Maybe since we're childhood friends.

637
00:53:54,344 --> 00:53:55,637
Do you think so?

638
00:53:55,721 --> 00:53:58,015
What's that response? Do you feel awkward?

639
00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:01,727
I feel kind of nervous.

640
00:54:07,774 --> 00:54:11,320
Remember when we had a birthday party
at the beach?

641
00:54:11,403 --> 00:54:12,654
Yes. Right.

642
00:54:13,947 --> 00:54:14,948
Of course I remember.

643
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:18,410
We set up a tent and made <i>ramyeon</i>.

644
00:54:18,494 --> 00:54:21,121
Right. And we played with fireworks.

645
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:23,123
Right.

646
00:54:23,207 --> 00:54:24,917
It was so fun.

647
00:54:26,835 --> 00:54:28,378
I want to go back to that moment.

648
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:08,752
Do you like your gift?

649
00:55:10,379 --> 00:55:13,006
I've never been forced to receive
a gift like this.

650
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,133
Wear it tomorrow, okay?

651
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,998
-Hello?
-<i>Are you at school?</i>

652
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:46,999
Yes. Why?

653
00:55:47,082 --> 00:55:50,002
I'm on my way. I'll be there soon.

654
00:55:50,836 --> 00:55:52,254
Me too.

655
00:56:09,229 --> 00:56:10,606
It looks good on you.

656
00:56:14,484 --> 00:56:16,278
Because you bought it?

657
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:18,864
Well, the model is pretty.

658
00:56:21,325 --> 00:56:22,409
You're right.

659
00:56:24,578 --> 00:56:26,413
Right, I made up with my mom.

660
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:28,457
Well, it was more like

661
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,834
I just listened to her talk and hung up.

662
00:56:32,586 --> 00:56:33,795
Good job.

663
00:56:36,256 --> 00:56:39,259
What about you?
You went to see your friend.

664
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:41,720
Right.

665
00:56:43,555 --> 00:56:44,681
It wasn't anything good.

666
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:48,518
<i>He's drawing the line again.</i>

667
00:56:53,899 --> 00:56:55,442
Why aren't you giving me one?

668
00:56:56,485 --> 00:56:58,195
What flavor is it?

669
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:12,417
Are you crazy? We're at school!

670
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:16,630
A pretty girl was gazing at me, asking me

671
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:19,007
the flavor of my candy.

672
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,391
I was only looking at your candy.

673
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,270
-This?
-Yes, that.

674
00:57:35,065 --> 00:57:36,108
It tastes good, right?

675
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:38,819
-Is it good?
-No.

676
00:57:38,902 --> 00:57:40,445
-It's not?
-No.

677
00:57:41,488 --> 00:57:44,574
There's something between them.
And my friend said

678
00:57:44,658 --> 00:57:48,203
she saw Jae-eon several times at the
convenience store near Na-bi's house.

679
00:57:48,286 --> 00:57:50,872
Come on. She lives near our school.

680
00:57:50,956 --> 00:57:52,916
He never goes to that convenience store.

681
00:57:53,959 --> 00:57:56,461
You know so much about Jae-eon, honey.

682
00:57:56,545 --> 00:57:58,088
Did you just call me "honey"?

683
00:57:58,171 --> 00:58:00,048
Come to think of it,

684
00:58:00,132 --> 00:58:02,843
they were giving each other looks
before they disappeared!

685
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:04,636
Are they dating, then?

686
00:58:05,721 --> 00:58:07,472
Jae-eon doesn't date.

687
00:58:07,556 --> 00:58:09,683
Then are they just sleeping
with each other?

688
00:58:09,766 --> 00:58:11,977
You can gossip among yourselves later.

689
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,814
We still have to discuss the venue
and budget of our workshop.

690
00:58:15,897 --> 00:58:18,150
Didn't we decide to finish this
in an hour?

691
00:58:18,233 --> 00:58:20,736
Come on, don't be so serious.

692
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:22,195
It's all right.

693
00:58:22,279 --> 00:58:24,489
I guess he's in a hurry to go on a date.

694
00:58:25,115 --> 00:58:26,658
Let's finish up quickly.

695
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:33,373
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine. Sit down.

696
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:38,128
The professor wants us to check
the venue in person beforehand.

697
00:58:38,211 --> 00:58:40,130
We should go this weekend.

698
00:58:40,714 --> 00:58:42,466
Who can't make it?

699
00:58:47,179 --> 00:58:49,765
What? You can't make it, Jae-eon?

700
00:58:50,682 --> 00:58:51,767
No.

701
00:58:53,602 --> 00:58:54,644
Why?

702
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:02,569
Hey, Na-bi!

703
00:59:03,111 --> 00:59:05,447
Why are you so dressed up today?

704
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,491
-Is it okay?
-It looks great on you.

705
00:59:10,911 --> 00:59:12,370
Why weren't you at school?

706
00:59:12,454 --> 00:59:15,290
I was a little sick.
Don't you think I lost some weight?

707
00:59:15,874 --> 00:59:18,043
Yes, it looks like it. Are you okay now?

708
00:59:18,126 --> 00:59:20,921
I'm fine.
Right, and how was your birthday?

709
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:22,547
Sorry I couldn't contact you.

710
00:59:22,631 --> 00:59:24,216
You don't need to be sorry.

711
00:59:24,758 --> 00:59:28,053
Did you talk to Sol?
She seemed pretty worried about you.

712
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:32,140
The weather's really nice today.

713
00:59:32,724 --> 00:59:35,352
-It's totally spring, isn't it?
-It is.

714
00:59:37,187 --> 00:59:39,147
I don't want to work on assignments.

715
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:41,608
Hey, Na-bi. You look so pretty.

716
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:42,984
-Here to work?
-So pretty.

717
00:59:43,068 --> 00:59:45,612
-We're just having a short meeting.
-They're both pretty.

718
00:59:47,656 --> 00:59:48,740
Okay.

719
00:59:50,617 --> 00:59:51,660
Go on.

720
01:00:02,671 --> 01:00:04,714
What about me?

721
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:06,424
It's been a while, Ji-wan.

722
01:00:06,508 --> 01:00:08,552
Why did you suddenly go off the grid?

723
01:00:08,635 --> 01:00:10,220
I was a bit sick.

724
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:15,100
How does a fit girl like you
suddenly get sick?

725
01:00:15,684 --> 01:00:17,144
I know. Ji-wan is built like a brick.

726
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:18,895
What were you sick with?

727
01:00:19,771 --> 01:00:23,066
Well, Jae-eon can't come
since he has plans.

728
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:24,651
Anyone else who can't come?

729
01:00:25,694 --> 01:00:29,489
Na-bi. We're going to check the venue
for our workshop. Want to come?

730
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:31,616
Well…

731
01:00:36,538 --> 01:00:38,415
I have plans.

732
01:00:39,332 --> 01:00:42,586
Right. If you have plans, I guess not.

733
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:02,230
Na-bi and Jae-eon really seem
to be dating, right?

734
01:01:02,731 --> 01:01:04,774
I thought Na-bi had a crush on me.

735
01:01:05,483 --> 01:01:08,236
Are you still on about that?

736
01:01:09,237 --> 01:01:11,448
Do you guys want to go out for drinks?

737
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:12,991
I have plans.

738
01:01:14,701 --> 01:01:16,620
Me too. I have plans, too.

739
01:01:29,257 --> 01:01:31,801
Jeez…

740
01:01:40,352 --> 01:01:41,478
What are you doing here?

741
01:01:41,561 --> 01:01:44,356
Na-bi. I'm really heartbroken.

742
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:46,191
I know you're in a lot of pain after--

743
01:01:46,274 --> 01:01:47,734
What are you talking about?

744
01:01:50,654 --> 01:01:53,740
I heard the rumors. A lot of my students
attend your school.

745
01:01:53,823 --> 01:01:56,785
I keep hearing rumors about you,
even if I try not to.

746
01:01:56,868 --> 01:01:58,036
What do you mean?

747
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:01,456
-What rumors?
-I heard you're seeing

748
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:04,459
some jerk named Park Jae-eon or something.

749
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,212
I heard he sleeps with everybody.

750
01:02:07,295 --> 01:02:09,798
I was so shocked when I heard
you were seeing him.

751
01:02:14,678 --> 01:02:17,222
I don't enjoy hearing that about my ex.

752
01:02:19,683 --> 01:02:20,767
Let go of me.

753
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:24,187
You're giving me advice?
Who do you think you are?

754
01:02:24,271 --> 01:02:27,107
What? Then it's true?
You're seeing that jerk?

755
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,067
Who are you to call him a jerk?

756
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:30,694
-Yu Na-bi!
-What?

757
01:02:34,072 --> 01:02:36,324
You're not that kind of girl.

758
01:02:36,408 --> 01:02:40,745
You must've been lonely after we broke up.
But still, seeing a guy like that?

759
01:02:40,829 --> 01:02:42,330
Shut up and get lost.

760
01:02:49,254 --> 01:02:50,714
Hey, Na-bi…

761
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:56,845
LAUNDRY

762
01:03:08,106 --> 01:03:10,150
That bastard.
Who is he to say such things?

763
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:36,551
<i>I feel like I'm doing something wrong.</i>

764
01:03:38,261 --> 01:03:40,096
Don't you know any hot girls?

765
01:03:40,805 --> 01:03:43,058
Ask Jae-eon to introduce you.

766
01:03:44,142 --> 01:03:45,018
Park Jae-eon?

767
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,229
To be honest,
we don't feel comfortable with him.

768
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,566
Why? Did something happen?

769
01:03:51,649 --> 01:03:54,778
Don't you feel that he shows off
about being popular?

770
01:03:54,861 --> 01:03:57,238
When I asked him to introduce me
to a girl,

771
01:03:57,322 --> 01:04:01,034
he said something about feeling guilty
towards them. It totally pissed me off.

772
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:04,454
Jae-eon really said that to you?

773
01:04:04,537 --> 01:04:06,164
He did.

774
01:04:06,247 --> 01:04:08,083
He's so rude just because he's popular.

775
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:10,043
We don't think of him as a real friend.

776
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:12,295
The others don't consider him
a friend, either.

777
01:04:12,379 --> 01:04:15,298
They just keep him close
since he's good-looking, that's all.

778
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:18,593
His target is Na-bi these days.

779
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:20,845
They seem to be getting close.

780
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:22,430
I could totally tell.

781
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:24,849
I did hear about that.

782
01:04:25,517 --> 01:04:27,310
So the rumors spread already.

783
01:04:27,394 --> 01:04:29,354
Jae-eon has nothing to lose.

784
01:04:29,437 --> 01:04:30,563
He must be so proud.

785
01:04:31,731 --> 01:04:34,984
I didn't think Na-bi would be like that.
She must be pretty open-minded…

786
01:04:35,735 --> 01:04:39,406
Open-minded?
That's just a nice way to put it.

787
01:04:40,115 --> 01:04:43,451
You really can't judge a book
by its cover.

788
01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:46,162
I should get going now.

789
01:04:46,746 --> 01:04:48,248
Okay. Let's go together.

790
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,712
Yu Na-bi?

791
01:04:58,258 --> 01:04:59,926
Hello, Professor.

792
01:05:02,846 --> 01:05:04,097
Is this for the exhibit?

793
01:05:05,432 --> 01:05:07,976
Yes, I'm thinking of handing this one in.

794
01:05:16,568 --> 01:05:18,194
Is something troubling you?

795
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:19,696
It's in pretty bad shape.

796
01:05:20,405 --> 01:05:21,739
<i>A right hook.</i>

797
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,162
But still, if you focus well
and keep working on it,

798
01:05:27,996 --> 01:05:29,456
it could be a decent piece.

799
01:05:29,539 --> 01:05:32,083
All right. I'll work harder.

800
01:05:47,974 --> 01:05:52,479
People gossip about others

801
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:54,814
and criticize others so easily.

802
01:05:54,898 --> 01:05:57,859
It's especially worse in Korea,
since it's a small country.

803
01:05:59,152 --> 01:06:02,614
That's why you should be careful
when you're young.

804
01:06:03,615 --> 01:06:06,993
You might think reckless behavior
can be forgiven because you're young.

805
01:06:10,163 --> 01:06:12,790
But from what I experienced,
it's not the case.

806
01:06:13,374 --> 01:06:14,584
There are consequences.

807
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:17,837
You'll get hit with the aftermath
at a crucial moment later on.

808
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:19,380
<i>A left hook.</i>

809
01:06:19,464 --> 01:06:22,217
No one will take responsibility
for your own life.

810
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:25,845
So keep your head on straight.
You're graduating soon, you know.

811
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:28,348
Everyone finds a job
before they graduate these days.

812
01:06:28,973 --> 01:06:30,683
<i>And an uppercut.</i>

813
01:06:31,518 --> 01:06:32,602
Right.

814
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:34,854
I know how you feel,

815
01:06:34,938 --> 01:06:38,066
so I'm giving you advice since
I care about you. So keep that in mind.

816
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,235
Yes, Professor.

817
01:06:40,944 --> 01:06:43,863
-Focus on your work.
-I will.

818
01:06:50,745 --> 01:06:51,955
<i>KO.</i>

819
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:06,803
<i>It feels like</i>

820
01:07:06,886 --> 01:07:10,348
<i>the whole universe is telling me
to end it with Jae-eon.</i>

821
01:07:11,182 --> 01:07:12,350
Na-bi.

822
01:07:14,894 --> 01:07:18,022
Are you okay? You could've
fallen down on the trash.

823
01:07:18,898 --> 01:07:21,109
Yes, I'm fine.

824
01:07:21,901 --> 01:07:24,070
This is good timing.

825
01:07:24,153 --> 01:07:27,156
Could we meet for a moment later?
Just the two of us?

826
01:07:29,242 --> 01:07:31,661
Well, I like that you're asking first,

827
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:35,123
but I'll be a bit tired
since I have lots of work today.

828
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:39,252
What? I'm not talking about that.

829
01:07:41,546 --> 01:07:43,631
Let's talk.

830
01:07:44,757 --> 01:07:47,552
Okay. Will it be okay
to meet late at night?

831
01:07:47,635 --> 01:07:48,761
Yes, it's fine.

832
01:07:50,054 --> 01:07:51,514
I'll call you when I'm done.

833
01:07:53,016 --> 01:07:54,017
Okay.

834
01:08:05,737 --> 01:08:08,448
-Let's send it to the professor tomorrow.
-Okay.

835
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:10,408
She won't read it until tomorrow anyway.

836
01:08:19,042 --> 01:08:20,627
-Aren't you leaving?
-What?

837
01:08:21,169 --> 01:08:26,049
Oh, well… I'm just going to finish
reading the paper I was looking at.

838
01:08:28,009 --> 01:08:29,052
Where is it?

839
01:08:29,135 --> 01:08:31,679
All right, then. I'll be off first.

840
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,182
Okay. Bye.

841
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:40,188
I thought about it, and I guess
I must have lost it after breaking up.

842
01:08:40,271 --> 01:08:42,106
I don't know why I'm doing this

843
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,108
with you.

844
01:08:47,445 --> 01:08:48,780
What do you mean?

845
01:08:51,366 --> 01:08:53,951
I want to focus on my work and school.

846
01:08:56,579 --> 01:08:58,456
This is an important time for me.

847
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:02,168
I guess I'm talking too much, right?

848
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:06,839
Yes. Aren't you going overboard?
We're not even going out.

849
01:09:11,344 --> 01:09:12,553
We should end it.

850
01:09:18,142 --> 01:09:20,353
Does this sound like I want to cut ties?

851
01:09:24,941 --> 01:09:27,568
But whatever I say,

852
01:09:27,652 --> 01:09:30,947
Jae-eon won't even blink an eye.

853
01:09:36,953 --> 01:09:40,790
<i>He's always so relaxed and calm,
but I'm always anxious.</i>

854
01:09:40,873 --> 01:09:44,335
<i>My ex cheated on me,
I got rejected by a guy who liked me,</i>

855
01:09:44,419 --> 01:09:46,963
<i>and rumors spread about me
being sex partners with the guy I like.</i>

856
01:09:49,549 --> 01:09:52,176
It sounds even worse like that.

857
01:10:01,018 --> 01:10:02,437
<i>We should end it.</i>

858
01:10:03,354 --> 01:10:04,939
<i>That's all I have to say.</i>

859
01:10:22,623 --> 01:10:23,916
Let's talk.

860
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,626
You have more to say?

861
01:10:27,253 --> 01:10:30,465
To be honest, I don't get
why you're so upset.

862
01:10:32,341 --> 01:10:34,427
You didn't need to ghost me like that.

863
01:10:38,556 --> 01:10:40,308
I said I'll see you at your house.

864
01:10:42,059 --> 01:10:44,312
I thought you'd take a long time.

865
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,900
I thought I'd finish by 10 p.m.,
but it's taking longer than expected.

866
01:10:49,525 --> 01:10:50,526
Right.

867
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,446
I see.

868
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:57,074
<i>I ran thousands of simulations
inside my head…</i>

869
01:10:58,159 --> 01:10:59,577
You look pretty serious.

870
01:11:02,163 --> 01:11:03,623
What did you want to say?

871
01:11:03,706 --> 01:11:06,000
<i>But the moment I looked into his eyes,</i>

872
01:11:07,543 --> 01:11:09,629
<i>my mind went blank.</i>

873
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:11,005
Well…

874
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:15,885
My ex-boyfriend came to my house.

875
01:11:15,968 --> 01:11:18,721
He seemed to have heard rumors about us.

876
01:11:20,932 --> 01:11:22,809
He said I should just date him instead.

877
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:27,021
What did you say?

878
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:29,774
I told him not to talk nonsense.

879
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:32,026
Really?

880
01:11:32,109 --> 01:11:35,071
<i>"Really?" Is that it?</i>

881
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:41,828
Is that what you wanted to say?

882
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:49,126
Is there someone else you're seeing?

883
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:50,628
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

884
01:11:51,128 --> 01:11:53,673
<i>Why am I asking this
when I was about to end everything?</i>

885
01:11:58,803 --> 01:11:59,887
No.

886
01:12:01,305 --> 01:12:02,223
Really?

887
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,532
Excuse me.

888
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:22,743
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

889
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:25,204
Yes.

890
01:12:26,873 --> 01:12:28,249
So it's you.

891
01:12:31,294 --> 01:12:33,087
You bastard!

892
01:12:35,006 --> 01:12:36,883
Sir! What's wrong?

893
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:39,010
-What are you doing?
-Move.

894
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:40,511
-Wait!
-Move!

895
01:12:40,595 --> 01:12:43,180
-Why are you doing this?
-Get out of the way!

896
01:12:45,266 --> 01:12:46,225
Na-bi!

897
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:45,743
<i>Park Jae-eon has never been mine.
But it feels like I've lost him.</i>

898
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:48,496
<i>How could Na-bi date a guy like Jae-eon?</i>

899
01:13:48,579 --> 01:13:52,166
-My girlfriend?
-Call me. Even if it's nothing special.

900
01:13:52,249 --> 01:13:55,211
<i>My whole house is filled
with traces of Jae-eon.</i>

901
01:13:55,294 --> 01:13:56,128
<i>Jerk.</i>

902
01:13:56,837 --> 01:13:58,339
<i>I guess it worked.</i>

903
01:13:58,422 --> 01:14:00,007
<i>How long are you going to avoid me?</i>

904
01:14:00,091 --> 01:14:01,884
We didn't get to finish
what we were talking about.

905
01:14:01,968 --> 01:14:05,721
This is how we always make up.
As if nothing happened.

906
01:14:05,805 --> 01:14:07,515
I just picked it up, thinking of you.

907
01:14:07,598 --> 01:14:09,558
-A gift for me?
-Yes.

908
01:14:09,642 --> 01:14:11,352
I was jealous.
Good luck on your presentation.

909
01:14:11,435 --> 01:14:13,854
<i>Who would like to assist Yu Na-bi?</i>

910
01:14:13,938 --> 01:14:16,023
I thought it'd be fun. Seems interesting.

911
01:14:16,107 --> 01:14:17,984
<i>Hey, Seol-a. I'll be there right away.</i>

912
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:20,361
<i>How can he not even call once?</i>

913
01:14:20,444 --> 01:14:21,904
<i>I miss him.</i>

914
01:14:22,446 --> 01:14:26,575
