1
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,520
<i>This is crazy.</i>

2
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,565
<i>But it was so good.</i>

3
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,069
I want to keep sleeping like this.

4
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:10,696
Me too.

5
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,074
Should we skip school?

6
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,538
<i>At least if I was drunk,
I could have used that as an excuse.</i>

7
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:11,340
EPISODE 4: I KNOW IT ISN'T LOVE.
NEVERTHELESS,

8
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,224
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

9
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,602
Where's the hair dryer?

10
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,480
-Darn it.
-Let's talk.

11
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,484
Hey, put your clothes on!

12
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,740
I must have alcohol-related dementia.

13
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,743
I don't remember what happened yesterday.

14
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,412
-So--
-It was a mistake?

15
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,622
What?

16
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,296
Yes. Honestly, we both
made a mistake while drunk, right?

17
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,217
So there's nothing to change between us.

18
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,135
Don't you think?

19
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm leaving.

20
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,516
Hey! Wait!

21
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,148
Darn it! I must have lost my mind!

22
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,193
Why did it have to be him?

23
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,454
Is that mine?

24
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,041
Yes. I washed it.

25
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,086
It's fine, you can have it.

26
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,839
Or just throw it away.

27
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,342
Right.
I'm going to have breakfast outside.

28
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,177
Outside?

29
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,470
By myself.

30
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,850
Oh, right. I get it.

31
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,561
I should get some more sleep.

32
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,479
Go ahead.

33
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,777
I want to keep seeing you.

34
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,697
What about you?

35
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,907
<i>This is it.</i>

36
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,284
What do you mean?

37
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,660
Should we meet up sometimes?

38
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,247
<i>So he's asking if I want to meet up</i>

39
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,917
<i>and sleep with him sometimes</i>

40
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,669
<i>without dating?</i>

41
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,963
I'm not sure.

42
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,507
Think about it and tell me.

43
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,179
I'll be off. Go to the hospital
if you're not feeling well. Okay?

44
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,264
Okay.

45
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,290
Park Jae-eon?

46
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,684
-It wasn't a mistake for me.
-What?

47
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,938
And things won't be the same
for me, either.

48
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,774
So I don't think I can pretend
it didn't happen.

49
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,073
What if you don't?

50
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:27,035
I don't think I can stay friends
with you now.

51
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,495
Then what?

52
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,916
-You don't mean…
-Be my girlfriend.

53
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,300
Hey! You…

54
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,682
You want to date because we slept
together once? You're overreacting.

55
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,975
Do you like me?

56
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,189
See? You can't answer that.

57
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,693
Plus, I really don't want to date
within such a small department.

58
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,236
Rumors will spread so quickly.

59
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,988
It's going to be really irritating.

60
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,702
All right.

61
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:13,164
I understand how you feel,
so I'll take care of my own feelings.

62
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,085
What do you mean? Hey!

63
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,384
The guy Sol brought over last night.
Was he her boyfriend?

64
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,553
I don't know.

65
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,514
Jeez!

66
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,225
You're the only one who'd know!

67
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,477
Who is he? Is it…

68
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,065
Is it serious?

69
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,985
Ask her yourself.

70
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,946
I don't care who she dates.

71
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,406
This is so annoying.

72
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,992
What? Did you two fight?

73
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,497
Right. You didn't know about
Sol leaving as an exchange student too.

74
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,084
We didn't fight. That's just
the extent of our relationship.

75
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,128
I'm going.

76
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,268
Seo Ji-wan.

77
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,813
Ji-wan. Ji-wan!

78
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,107
Let me talk to you.

79
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,488
Fine. Talk.
What do you want to talk about first?

80
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,366
Going abroad? Or your boyfriend?

81
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,660
Everyone knew except me.

82
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,370
I was going to tell you.

83
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,872
Right. When were you going to tell me?

84
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,625
The day before you left?
The day before you got married?

85
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,503
What's with you?
You said you don't care who I date.

86
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,088
Right. I don't.

87
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,757
I'm just angry because
you're leaving me out like this.

88
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,760
-When did I leave you out--
-You've always done this.

89
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,597
You never tell me important things
about yourself. You know that?

90
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,059
Like what?

91
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,159
I guess this really is the extent
of our relationship.

92
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,436
Thanks.

93
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,647
What's your next class?

94
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,234
Human Anatomy. It's so hard.

95
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,903
I got an A in that class.

96
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,321
-Really?
-Yes.

97
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,283
-Then help me study.
-What will you do for me, then?

98
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,456
What should I do for you?

99
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,959
Jeez…

100
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,924
By the way…

101
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,011
Well…

102
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:18,349
I don't want anyone to know about us.

103
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,520
All right.

104
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,190
-Okay.
-Okay.

105
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,318
And…

106
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,528
Well…

107
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,447
You don't…

108
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:38,495
have any diseases or anything, do you?

109
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,791
Do you?

110
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,213
Don't laugh! I'm serious.

111
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,508
I don't, so don't worry.

112
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,136
Okay.

113
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,264
Do you have time later?

114
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,894
Yes, I have some time.

115
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,396
No, should we meet on Saturday?

116
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,691
You need to rest the next day, right?

117
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,780
No. It's totally fine.

118
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>Why did I do that? I acted so impulsively.</i>

119
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,487
I must've lost my mind.

120
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,245
I should just tell him not to come.

121
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,680
-Come in.
-Hey.

122
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,605
What's with the alcohol?

123
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,941
It'll be nice to drink together.

124
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,318
It'll be fun.

125
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,738
Oh, I drank some already.

126
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,490
<i>I couldn't do this sober.</i>

127
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,827
This is cheating.

128
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,287
What do you mean?

129
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,041
We didn't decide on anything.

130
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,210
Decide what?

131
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,756
Weren't we going to study
Human Anatomy together?

132
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,926
Oh, right.

133
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,845
Right. Human Anatomy.

134
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,016
Yes. We should study.

135
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,023
Stop laughing.

136
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,318
I have a gift for you.

137
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,331
<i>Jae-eon is too smooth with everything.</i>

138
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,627
<i>It's like everything
comes naturally to him.</i>

139
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,712
All done.

140
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,801
Do you like it?

141
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,512
Yes.

142
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,974
It's pretty.

143
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,228
It'll be prettier
with the sunlight in the morning.

144
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,535
<i>Like this was always
going to happen between us.</i>

145
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,458
You got me again.

146
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,757
Hang on.

147
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,556
PARK JAE-EON

148
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,560
You saved my number.

149
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,860
<i>I can stop this right now.</i>

150
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,657
<i>Because there are so many reasons
why I shouldn't do this.</i>

151
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,621
<i>But…</i>

152
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,230
You know, you have a mole here.

153
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,107
Where?

154
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,109
Here.

155
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,156
I didn't know.

156
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,997
You look even more pretty today.

157
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,875
<i>I'm still attracted to him,
even at this moment.</i>

158
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,420
<i>Like crazy.</i>

159
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,610
<i>That one simple reason</i>

160
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,489
<i>buries all my concerns again.</i>

161
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,706
Didn't it hurt when you got that tattoo
behind your neck?

162
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,420
Of course, it hurt.

163
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,214
I almost died.

164
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,843
I thought of quitting in the middle.

165
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,057
I'm going to get another one soon.

166
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,351
Where?

167
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,065
Around here.

168
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,445
Another butterfly?

169
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,571
Yes.

170
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,909
A butterfly with lots of black spots
on its wings.

171
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,369
The name's pretty difficult.

172
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,623
Taiwanese black-star hairstreak butterfly.

173
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,169
Taiwan…

174
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,838
That's a really long name.

175
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,011
They eat flowers instead of leaves

176
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,638
when they're caterpillars.

177
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,057
It's unique, right?

178
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,935
Yes.

179
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,315
<i>Since that day, a lot of things
have changed between us.</i>

180
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,360
<i>And Jae-eon slowly seeped into my life.</i>

181
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,117
Get washed.

182
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,878
I'm starting work
at the department office.

183
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,881
You decided to do that? Aren't you busy?

184
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,926
I won't work that long. Just for a while.

185
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,514
It's because of you.

186
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:58,935
Why?

187
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,230
Come visit often.

188
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,399
-Why would I?
-What?

189
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,569
Come visit me.

190
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,031
All right?

191
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,241
Why would I?

192
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,994
Okay, I will.

193
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,879
Jae-eon, where's that suncatcher
you made last time?

194
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,381
The butterfly-shaped one.

195
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,049
Oh, that?

196
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,510
I gifted it to someone.

197
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,055
That's too bad. I wanted to see it
when it was finished.

198
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,058
-Can you tell us how to make it?
-Tell us!

199
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,394
Learn that from
the Ceramics and Glass students.

200
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,437
Jae-eon is mine now.

201
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,607
What are you talking about?

202
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,693
Darn it! You're so noisy.

203
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,738
If you're done, please just leave.

204
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,075
-Guys, get out.
-Okay.

205
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,160
-Bye.
-Bye.

206
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,333
I heard he doesn't date,
but I guess he has a girlfriend.

207
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,711
I wonder who it is.
She must be really pretty.

208
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,896
-It's raining a lot.
-It is.

209
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,742
-Don't do it.
-I have to do this!

210
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,077
Stop working. Let's just sleep.

211
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,954
-Already?
-Yes.

212
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,916
-Already?
-Yes. I'm sleepy.

213
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,679
<i>Our relationship only exists
at night, but…</i>

214
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,932
Are you washing the dishes?

215
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,186
Yes. It seems like you don't do the dishes
when I'm coming.

216
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,021
You caught me.

217
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,899
I think you're pretty good at housework.

218
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,485
Will you do the laundry too?

219
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,237
-Should I?
-Yes.

220
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:19,408
-Then let's do it together.
-No. I don't want to do it.

221
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:23,079
<i>It sometimes felt like we were lovers.</i>

222
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,373
What's your goal today?

223
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,503
Really? Can you do it?

224
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,048
Don't strain yourself.

225
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,055
What was that?

226
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,602
My tongue gets numb when I eat this.

227
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,604
So I kissed you first.

228
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,774
<i>Jae-eon is still a mystery to me.</i>

229
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,234
What are you on about?

230
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,527
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

231
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,363
Here.

232
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,329
You said your tongue gets numb.
This is good, though.

233
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,956
-Really?
-Yes.

234
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,255
Just eat.

235
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,679
-It's good, right?
-Yes. It's tastier today.

236
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,079
<i>I can't tell if he's warm or cold,</i>

237
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,499
<i>serious or joking.</i>

238
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,099
Are you done with assignments?

239
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,934
No.

240
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,687
Go sleep at your house.

241
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,817
I can't just leave.

242
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,334
<i>My anxiety about Jae-eon
hasn't disappeared, but…</i>

243
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,555
<i>We're much more compatible than I thought.</i>

244
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,605
So the transverse arch

245
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,690
can be seen the best from the front.

246
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,902
I see. You're right.

247
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,489
This is the transverse arch?

248
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,032
Yes.

249
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,452
And this is the medial longitudinal arch.

250
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,331
-Yes.
-This is the lateral longitudinal arch.

251
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,291
Correct.

252
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,380
-What about this?
-Stop. It tickles.

253
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,673
Stop.

254
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,675
I'm studying right now.

255
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,094
What about this?

256
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,137
Hey, it tickles.

257
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,772
<i>And I enjoy</i>

258
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,233
<i>spending nights with him.</i>

259
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,451
Thank you.

260
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,872
-It looks delicious.
-I want corn.

261
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,291
I thought you were on a diet.

262
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,627
-That's why I'm only eating the shrimp.
-Oh, is that right?

263
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,425
Are you dating someone these days?

264
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,051
Me?

265
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,264
No. Why?

266
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:14,143
You just seem to be in a good mood
these days.

267
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,812
Your face seems to be glowing a bit.

268
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,274
I've been sleeping well.

269
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,281
I mean, I've been getting lots of sleep.

270
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,119
Right. Sleeping is the best way
to improve the condition of your skin.

271
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,290
Oh, right!
Gyu-hyun, would you like a blind date?

272
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,879
A blind date? With who?

273
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,297
My high school friend.

274
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,050
She saw a photo of you on social media,
and she wants to meet you.

275
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,428
She hasn't been dating for a while,
so she's always saying she's lonely.

276
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,929
Tell your friend

277
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,807
that seeing any guy just because
she's lonely won't end well.

278
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,977
Lonely people will be lonely
even if they date someone.

279
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,395
And I think

280
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,273
that if you're in a relationship,

281
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:05,361
you have a kind of duty
not to make the other feel lonely.

282
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,071
You're right about that.

283
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,280
<i>Today?</i>

284
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,074
Let me see her photo.

285
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:11,867
All right.

286
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,868
Let me see.

287
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,663
-She's pretty.
-Do you like her?

288
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:16,997
Introduce me to her.

289
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,500
Should I give you her number, then?

290
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,210
She likes you.

291
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,922
<i>I'm not going to give you what you want.</i>

292
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,219
So are you interested?

293
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,392
-Send me her number.
-No way. She's going to be so happy.

294
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,311
-Come on, eat.
-I don't feel like it.

295
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,272
BRING ICE CREAM
OKAY

296
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,274
-Can I eat the shrimp, then?
-Just eat it.

297
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,948
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

298
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,367
-Bow.
-Hello. And then…

299
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,037
-Take one step forward.
-One step forward.

300
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,956
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

301
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,000
-Are you really okay?
-Yes. I'm fine.

302
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,419
Let's try it again.

303
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,465
Grab each other's hands…

304
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,135
-Go.
-Go.

305
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,470
-One, two.
-One, two.

306
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,764
-Turn.
-Three, four.

307
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,850
-One, two.
-All right.

308
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,352
-Here.
-Now? Oh, my gosh.

309
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,981
Are you okay?

310
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,066
You're going to break my feet soon.

311
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,695
Should I just give up?

312
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,572
I got scammed by Bit-na.

313
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,824
She said this class was really easy.

314
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,703
Do you really think it's her fault?

315
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,623
Let's try it just once more.

316
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,418
You seemed to have potential,
from what I saw at the club.

317
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,503
Forget it. Stop teasing me.

318
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,341
Why are you so good at dancing, though?
Did you learn this before?

319
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,093
Or are you a natural?

320
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,970
I'm not sure.

321
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,889
My mom's a dancer.

322
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,725
Really? Does she still dance?

323
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,318
Do you have time this Sunday?

324
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,905
Sunday? Well…

325
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,449
Today's Friday, though.

326
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,160
What?

327
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,747
Do you think I'm a sex maniac?

328
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,332
Then what is it?

329
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,503
There's an exhibit that ends this weekend.
I thought we'd go together.

330
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,879
Oh, that?

331
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,382
I did want to go…

332
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,717
Should we go together?

333
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,889
I'll think about it…

334
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,475
Let's go together, okay?

335
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,835
<i>He probably doesn't even know
what day it is.</i>

336
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,546
<i>I'm weird for thinking about this.</i>

337
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,260
AUNTIE

338
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,935
Auntie. Did you pull an all-nighter again?

339
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,770
I should work as hard as you.

340
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,273
I'm used to this anyway.

341
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,859
Are you going to your mom's this Sunday?

342
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,361
It's your birthday,
so I was thinking of visiting.

343
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,947
<i>You don't need to come.
It'll only be tiring for you.</i>

344
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,366
I'll visit you once the semester is over.

345
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,785
Do you want anything as a present, then?

346
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,037
I'll get you anything you want.

347
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,417
Gosh, I wish you were my mom.

348
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,713
<i>You're lucky because you have
both your mom and your aunt.</i>

349
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:01,805
You should spend your birthday with
the person you want to be with the most.

350
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,103
The person I want to be with?

351
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,832
Hi. I just finished. I'll be there soon.

352
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,380
This looks good.

353
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,719
Hello.

354
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,930
Jae-eon just left.

355
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:47,100
What? Oh, I just came to apply
for late-night work.

356
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,146
-Did you eat?
-Come sit. You can eat with us.

357
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,023
We ordered three servings.

358
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,399
All right.

359
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,165
Do you have something to say?

360
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,336
Well…

361
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,757
Would it be weird to spend your birthday
with someone you're not dating?

362
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,969
Then you're getting to know each other?

363
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,264
It's not like that.

364
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,849
But if you do everything else…

365
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,519
Do everything else? What do you mean?

366
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,818
Oh, then I'd say no. A birthday gift would
be fine, but spending the day together…

367
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,903
That's a bit too much.

368
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,948
Right?

369
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,118
-Do you love him?
-What?

370
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,998
No, I wasn't talking about myself.
It's about my friend.

371
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,626
-Does she love him?
-You're always going on about love.

372
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,586
That's not a good relationship.

373
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,506
You're sure to regret it soon.

374
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,509
Tell your friend to use birth control.

375
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,138
Okay.

376
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,188
Do you still have the butterflies?

377
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,567
Yes. We're getting along very well.

378
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,987
You said you'll let them go.

379
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,866
Did I say that?

380
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:33,457
I thought about it,
and I guess you were right.

381
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:36,835
About what?

382
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,921
Your butterflies.

383
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,593
You said you were keeping them
from their freedom.

384
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,846
I think you're right.

385
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,143
There's a huge world
just outside the glass.

386
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,729
You're giving them false hope.

387
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,316
Did I say that?

388
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,486
But…

389
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,073
I don't want to let go. Not yet.

390
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,116
Then at least be good to them.

391
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,703
You know what your problem is, right?
You torment the things you like.

392
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,126
Hang on.

393
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,045
YU NA-BI

394
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,632
<i>Can you talk right now?</i>

395
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,510
Yes. What is it?

396
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,387
<i>I just called to say</i>

397
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,140
<i>that I can't come with you to the exhibit
this weekend.</i>

398
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,851
<i>I'm going to see my mom.</i>

399
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,603
Really?

400
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,855
That's too bad.

401
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,899
<i>Sorry. You can go with someone else.</i>

402
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,567
All right.

403
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,404
Is there anything else?

404
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,449
No, that's it. Bye, then.

405
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,726
Na-bi?

406
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,190
Yu Na-bi?

407
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,236
Do-hyeok?

408
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,196
Yes.

409
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,616
Yang Do-hyeok?

410
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,537
Hey, it's been such a long time!

411
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,331
Has it been about 10 years?

412
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,710
That's right. I thought I'd never
get to see you again.

413
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,213
Me too. What are the chances?

414
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,008
-Are you living in Seoul?
-Yes.

415
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,677
I'm learning to cook here
after military service.

416
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,637
You're cooking? Like your grandpa?

417
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,100
I'm working at a noodle place
at Hongseo University Intersection.

418
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,728
Hongseo University Intersection?

419
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,315
-I know that place.
-What?

420
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,568
I never went there before,
but my friends said it was good.

421
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,069
Really?

422
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,363
You should come sometime.

423
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,240
All right, I will.

424
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,455
Do-hyeok, I have to get off.

425
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,292
Hey, Na-bi. Here.

426
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,336
Can you give me your number?

427
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,213
Oh, right.

428
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,590
Of course.

429
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,595
Here.

430
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,972
Oh, my gosh!

431
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,728
Oh, no.

432
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,816
Are you getting off?

433
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,153
-Sir, just a minute!
-It's fine. Go.

434
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,822
Sorry, I should go.

435
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,764
It's raining.

436
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,726
I'll take you to where you're going.

437
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,146
What about your potatoes?

438
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,907
That's so funny.

439
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:43,665
How are the others?
I'm curious how they're doing.

440
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,875
Some came to Seoul like you.

441
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,587
I only keep in touch with a few of them.

442
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,214
I see.

443
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,343
I thought we'd all keep in touch
back then.

444
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,599
I know. It would've been nice
if we had kept meeting up often.

445
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,060
What about the noodle place?

446
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,479
Your grandpa's noodles were amazing.

447
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,441
He's not doing so well,
so it's closed for now.

448
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,402
I'm preparing to run it again.

449
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,363
Then you'll run it by yourself?

450
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,406
For now.

451
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,451
Just until my grandpa feels better.

452
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,038
I can't open it right away,

453
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,081
but I'm learning bit by bit.

454
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,791
You're so cool.

455
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,462
You made a big decision.
I'm sure your grandpa will be happy.

456
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,049
I'm not sure. He always nags me
about how I'm not that reliable.

457
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,843
I'm sure he's proud of you, though.

458
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,058
You should come visit when I open it.
We have a guest house,

459
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,728
and it'll be fun to hang out together.

460
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,732
Sure, of course. I will.

461
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,234
We're here.
I just have to turn the corner here.

462
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,320
Oh, really?

463
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,452
Oh, no. You're all wet.

464
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,745
-My gosh.
-It's fine.

465
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,122
You should have said so.

466
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:12,212
It's so nice to see you again.

467
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,638
Thanks for walking me home.
I should go inside.

468
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,599
Right. Take this.

469
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,268
-No, it's fine!
-I can just use my hood.

470
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,899
Hey, Na-bi. Is it…

471
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,945
Is it okay if I message you?

472
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:38,988
Sure.

473
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,533
Go inside, then.

474
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,309
Ttoli!

475
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,145
Ttoli!

476
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,898
Hey, it's been a long time.

477
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,373
Mom.

478
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,625
Mom?

479
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,800
I thought you'd come in the evening.
Why did you come so early?

480
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,513
Stay in your room.

481
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,934
Or why don't you go for a walk with Ttoli?

482
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,103
Come on. Hurry.

483
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,355
Go walk Ttoli, okay? Come on.

484
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,107
Go, Ttoli.

485
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,070
You're neglecting me again.

486
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,614
What?

487
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,450
He's going to leave soon.

488
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,619
Just stay in your room.

489
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,919
-You went to the signing event, right?
-Yes.

490
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,921
-Did you take photos?
-I couldn't!

491
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,006
You should have taken photos.

492
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,551
I know. But he was so handsome.

493
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,470
-Did you shake his hand?
-Of course!

494
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,597
And you went to the concert, right?

495
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,683
-Was it fun?
-I watched from the front row.

496
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,309
It was amazing.

497
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,649
<i>There was a time
when all I cared about were friends.</i>

498
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,192
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

499
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:24,320
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

500
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,281
<i>Happy birthday, dear Yu Na-bi</i>

501
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,740
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

502
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,996
Hey!

503
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,790
-Make a wish!
-Make a wish!

504
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,375
All right. My wish.

505
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,464
<i>And when I started dating,</i>

506
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,593
<i>I thought love was everything.</i>

507
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,848
<i>And it's been almost two months</i>

508
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,892
<i>since my crazy first relationship ended.</i>

509
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,331
<i>I have friends that I talk to
and have meals with</i>

510
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,708
<i>from time to time.</i>

511
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,300
<i>And a friend I have sex with.</i>

512
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,103
Do you want anything for your birthday?

513
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,146
I want you.

514
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,441
But where are we going?

515
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,152
-It's a secret.
-Come on.

516
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,739
-Why isn't the train coming?
-It's late.

517
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,282
How about an amusement park?

518
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:54,619
<i>But I don't have anyone to spend</i>

519
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:56,746
<i>my birthday with.</i>

520
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,677
THE TRAIN FOR GUJA
WILL BE ARRIVING SHORTLY

521
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,135
I got you!

522
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,999
<i>I thought our relationship
only existed at night.</i>

523
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,174
Do you like your gift?

524
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,428
I've never been forced to receive
a gift like this.

525
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:02,849
Come on. Can't you express your
happiness so I can feel proud?

526
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:06,018
All right. Thank you!

527
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,436
Wear it tomorrow, okay?

528
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,355
Okay.

529
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,568
But weren't you going to the exhibit?
It's the last day today.

530
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,780
How could I think about that right now?

531
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,199
<i>He's making me get my hopes up again.</i>

532
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:21,284
Then…

533
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:25,329
You got me a gift,
so let me buy you a meal.

534
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,331
Well…

535
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,877
Oh, do you have plans?

536
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,628
Then--

537
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,881
No. It's your birthday, so…

538
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,051
INSTANT SEAWEED SOUP

539
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,516
<i>I thought it was the worst birthday ever.</i>

540
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,353
<i>But I guess life is full of variables.</i>

541
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,982
Hang on. I'll make this right away.

542
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,864
You're talking
as if you're really cooking.

543
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,783
It's the heart that matters.

544
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,496
It's been a while since I had
seaweed soup for my birthday.

545
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,208
Really?

546
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:14,587
I thought everyone had it except for me.

547
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,547
I feel comforted now.

548
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:28,768
What?

549
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,020
You've never told me
something like that before.

550
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,482
You don't talk much about yourself.

551
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,401
Well…

552
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,576
That's because
you know me so well already.

553
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,706
I don't know anything about you.

554
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,589
I really don't.

555
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,509
You're still such a mystery to me.

556
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,645
Stop fooling around
and finish making this.

557
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:14,438
Not that.

558
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,150
Then what?

559
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:25,217
<i>Why can't you be my boyfriend?</i>

560
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,807
So when are you going to make me
the seaweed soup?

561
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,519
I'll make it now.

562
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,105
Why aren't you getting up, then?

563
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,067
I have no energy. Five more minutes.

564
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,332
SEOL-A

565
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,503
Let me take a call.

566
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,089
Hang on.

567
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,346
Should we have a drink first?

568
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,015
Or go right away?

569
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,518
Well, whatever you prefer.

570
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,526
Let's drink here.

571
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,698
What's your ideal type?

572
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:30,991
-Me?
-Yes.

573
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,247
Are you okay?

574
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,292
Yes. I'm okay.

575
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:53,013
This place is actually pretty lame.

576
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,726
-Let's drink somewhere else.
-What?

577
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,854
-Let's go.
-Somewhere else?

578
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,908
Do you know her?

579
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,202
No, I don't.

580
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,621
Excuse me. Can I have some ice water?

581
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,837
Sorry. Something urgent came up
with a friend.

582
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,632
Okay. You should go, then.

583
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:33,262
Make sure to eat.
And don't ignore your mom.

584
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,016
I'll get going.

585
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,226
Okay.

586
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,842
I'm hungry.

587
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:11,777
Do-hyeok…

588
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,495
Come in.

589
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,211
Sorry. You're closed, right? I…

590
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,421
We're not.

591
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,806
What? You have 3,000 subscribers?

592
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,933
You started only three months ago.

593
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,643
You have so many views.

594
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,687
Do you edit the videos yourself?

595
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,647
Yes.

596
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,234
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER

597
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,570
I saw this before.

598
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,032
The channel name reminded me of you.

599
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,616
You thought about me?

600
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,452
Of course.

601
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,789
I can't believe it really was you.

602
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,333
And a culinary arts major?

603
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,129
The Yang Do-hyeok I know

604
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,923
always played with food.

605
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,512
I knew you'd major in art, though.

606
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,349
You were always good at drawing.

607
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,019
Well…

608
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,189
Not that good.

609
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,483
I just liked it.

610
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,572
Your videos are really good.

611
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:43,744
Here you go.

612
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,168
Weren't you making noodles for me?

613
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:52,878
Next time.

614
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,756
Isn't it your birthday today?

615
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,467
You're right.

616
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,932
You have a good memory.
You remembered my birthday?

617
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,642
Of course, I…

618
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,606
I have a good memory.

619
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,108
Right.

620
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,027
-Do you still like chocolate?
-Yes.

621
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,240
Did you make this yourself, too?

622
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,076
-Yes.
-You're so skilled.

623
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,411
It looks delicious.

624
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,500
What?

625
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,170
Make a wish.

626
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,673
A wish?

627
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,842
All right.

628
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,279
Happy birthday, Na-bi.

629
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,491
Thank you. I can't believe
I'm with you like this on my birthday.

630
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,493
Life is full of surprises.

631
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,997
I know.
I never imagined this would happen.

632
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,460
-It's so good.
-Really?

633
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,128
-Yes!
-That's a relief.

634
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,630
I felt this last time,

635
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,508
but it's not awkward
even when we haven't met for a long time.

636
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,261
Maybe since we're childhood friends.

637
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,637
Do you think so?

638
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:28,015
What's that response? Do you feel awkward?

639
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,727
I feel kind of nervous.

640
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,320
Remember when we had a birthday party
at the beach?

641
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,654
Yes. Right.

642
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:44,948
Of course I remember.

643
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,410
We set up a tent and made <i>ramyeon</i>.

644
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:51,121
Right. And we played with fireworks.

645
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,123
Right.

646
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,917
It was so fun.

647
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,378
I want to go back to that moment.

648
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:38,752
Do you like your gift?

649
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:43,006
I've never been forced to receive
a gift like this.

650
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,133
Wear it tomorrow, okay?

651
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,998
-Hello?
-<i>Are you at school?</i>

652
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:16,999
Yes. Why?

653
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,002
I'm on my way. I'll be there soon.

654
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,254
Me too.

655
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,606
It looks good on you.

656
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,278
Because you bought it?

657
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,864
Well, the model is pretty.

658
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:52,409
You're right.

659
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,413
Right, I made up with my mom.

660
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,457
Well, it was more like

661
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,834
I just listened to her talk and hung up.

662
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:03,795
Good job.

663
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,259
What about you?
You went to see your friend.

664
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,720
Right.

665
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,681
It wasn't anything good.

666
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,518
<i>He's drawing the line again.</i>

667
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,442
Why aren't you giving me one?

668
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,195
What flavor is it?

669
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,417
Are you crazy? We're at school!

670
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,630
A pretty girl was gazing at me, asking me

671
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,007
the flavor of my candy.

672
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,391
I was only looking at your candy.

673
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,270
-This?
-Yes, that.

674
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,108
It tastes good, right?

675
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,819
-Is it good?
-No.

676
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,445
-It's not?
-No.

677
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,574
There's something between them.
And my friend said

678
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:18,203
she saw Jae-eon several times at the
convenience store near Na-bi's house.

679
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,872
Come on. She lives near our school.

680
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,916
He never goes to that convenience store.

681
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,461
You know so much about Jae-eon, honey.

682
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,088
Did you just call me "honey"?

683
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,048
Come to think of it,

684
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,843
they were giving each other looks
before they disappeared!

685
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,636
Are they dating, then?

686
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:37,472
Jae-eon doesn't date.

687
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,683
Then are they just sleeping
with each other?

688
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,977
You can gossip among yourselves later.

689
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,814
We still have to discuss the venue
and budget of our workshop.

690
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,150
Didn't we decide to finish this
in an hour?

691
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,736
Come on, don't be so serious.

692
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,195
It's all right.

693
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,489
I guess he's in a hurry to go on a date.

694
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,658
Let's finish up quickly.

695
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,373
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine. Sit down.

696
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,128
The professor wants us to check
the venue in person beforehand.

697
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,130
We should go this weekend.

698
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,466
Who can't make it?

699
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:19,765
What? You can't make it, Jae-eon?

700
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:21,767
No.

701
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:24,644
Why?

702
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,569
Hey, Na-bi!

703
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,447
Why are you so dressed up today?

704
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,491
-Is it okay?
-It looks great on you.

705
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,370
Why weren't you at school?

706
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:45,290
I was a little sick.
Don't you think I lost some weight?

707
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:48,043
Yes, it looks like it. Are you okay now?

708
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,921
I'm fine.
Right, and how was your birthday?

709
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,547
Sorry I couldn't contact you.

710
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,216
You don't need to be sorry.

711
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:58,053
Did you talk to Sol?
She seemed pretty worried about you.

712
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,140
The weather's really nice today.

713
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,352
-It's totally spring, isn't it?
-It is.

714
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:09,147
I don't want to work on assignments.

715
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:11,608
Hey, Na-bi. You look so pretty.

716
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,984
-Here to work?
-So pretty.

717
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,612
-We're just having a short meeting.
-They're both pretty.

718
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:18,740
Okay.

719
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,660
Go on.

720
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,714
What about me?

721
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,424
It's been a while, Ji-wan.

722
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,552
Why did you suddenly go off the grid?

723
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,220
I was a bit sick.

724
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,100
How does a fit girl like you
suddenly get sick?

725
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,144
I know. Ji-wan is built like a brick.

726
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,895
What were you sick with?

727
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:53,066
Well, Jae-eon can't come
since he has plans.

728
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,651
Anyone else who can't come?

729
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:59,489
Na-bi. We're going to check the venue
for our workshop. Want to come?

730
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,616
Well…

731
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:08,415
I have plans.

732
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,586
Right. If you have plans, I guess not.

733
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:32,230
Na-bi and Jae-eon really seem
to be dating, right?

734
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,774
I thought Na-bi had a crush on me.

735
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:38,236
Are you still on about that?

736
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,448
Do you guys want to go out for drinks?

737
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,991
I have plans.

738
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,620
Me too. I have plans, too.

739
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,801
Jeez…

740
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,478
What are you doing here?

741
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,356
Na-bi. I'm really heartbroken.

742
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,191
I know you're in a lot of pain after--

743
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,734
What are you talking about?

744
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:23,740
I heard the rumors. A lot of my students
attend your school.

745
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,785
I keep hearing rumors about you,
even if I try not to.

746
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,036
What do you mean?

747
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,456
-What rumors?
-I heard you're seeing

748
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,459
some jerk named Park Jae-eon or something.

749
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,212
I heard he sleeps with everybody.

750
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,798
I was so shocked when I heard
you were seeing him.

751
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:47,222
I don't enjoy hearing that about my ex.

752
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:50,767
Let go of me.

753
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,187
You're giving me advice?
Who do you think you are?

754
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,107
What? Then it's true?
You're seeing that jerk?

755
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,067
Who are you to call him a jerk?

756
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,694
-Yu Na-bi!
-What?

757
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:06,324
You're not that kind of girl.

758
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:10,745
You must've been lonely after we broke up.
But still, seeing a guy like that?

759
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,330
Shut up and get lost.

760
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:20,714
Hey, Na-bi…

761
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,845
LAUNDRY

762
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:40,150
That bastard.
Who is he to say such things?

763
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,551
<i>I feel like I'm doing something wrong.</i>

764
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,096
Don't you know any hot girls?

765
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,058
Ask Jae-eon to introduce you.

766
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,018
Park Jae-eon?

767
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,229
To be honest,
we don't feel comfortable with him.

768
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,566
Why? Did something happen?

769
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,778
Don't you feel that he shows off
about being popular?

770
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,238
When I asked him to introduce me
to a girl,

771
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:31,034
he said something about feeling guilty
towards them. It totally pissed me off.

772
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,454
Jae-eon really said that to you?

773
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,164
He did.

774
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,083
He's so rude just because he's popular.

775
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,043
We don't think of him as a real friend.

776
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,295
The others don't consider him
a friend, either.

777
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:45,298
They just keep him close
since he's good-looking, that's all.

778
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,593
His target is Na-bi these days.

779
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,845
They seem to be getting close.

780
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,430
I could totally tell.

781
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,849
I did hear about that.

782
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,310
So the rumors spread already.

783
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,354
Jae-eon has nothing to lose.

784
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:00,563
He must be so proud.

785
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,984
I didn't think Na-bi would be like that.
She must be pretty open-minded…

786
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,406
Open-minded?
That's just a nice way to put it.

787
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:13,451
You really can't judge a book
by its cover.

788
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:16,162
I should get going now.

789
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,248
Okay. Let's go together.

790
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:24,712
Yu Na-bi?

791
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:29,926
Hello, Professor.

792
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:34,097
Is this for the exhibit?

793
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,976
Yes, I'm thinking of handing this one in.

794
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:48,194
Is something troubling you?

795
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,696
It's in pretty bad shape.

796
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:51,739
<i>A right hook.</i>

797
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,162
But still, if you focus well
and keep working on it,

798
01:05:57,996 --> 01:05:59,456
it could be a decent piece.

799
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,083
All right. I'll work harder.

800
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:22,479
People gossip about others

801
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,814
and criticize others so easily.

802
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:27,859
It's especially worse in Korea,
since it's a small country.

803
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:32,614
That's why you should be careful
when you're young.

804
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:36,993
You might think reckless behavior
can be forgiven because you're young.

805
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,790
But from what I experienced,
it's not the case.

806
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,584
There are consequences.

807
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,837
You'll get hit with the aftermath
at a crucial moment later on.

808
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,380
<i>A left hook.</i>

809
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:52,217
No one will take responsibility
for your own life.

810
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,845
So keep your head on straight.
You're graduating soon, you know.

811
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:58,348
Everyone finds a job
before they graduate these days.

812
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,683
<i>And an uppercut.</i>

813
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:02,602
Right.

814
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,854
I know how you feel,

815
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:08,066
so I'm giving you advice since
I care about you. So keep that in mind.

816
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,235
Yes, Professor.

817
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,863
-Focus on your work.
-I will.

818
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:21,955
<i>KO.</i>

819
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,803
<i>It feels like</i>

820
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:40,348
<i>the whole universe is telling me
to end it with Jae-eon.</i>

821
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,350
Na-bi.

822
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,022
Are you okay? You could've
fallen down on the trash.

823
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,109
Yes, I'm fine.

824
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,070
This is good timing.

825
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:57,156
Could we meet for a moment later?
Just the two of us?

826
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,661
Well, I like that you're asking first,

827
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:05,123
but I'll be a bit tired
since I have lots of work today.

828
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,252
What? I'm not talking about that.

829
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:13,631
Let's talk.

830
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,552
Okay. Will it be okay
to meet late at night?

831
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:18,761
Yes, it's fine.

832
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,514
I'll call you when I'm done.

833
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,017
Okay.

834
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:38,448
-Let's send it to the professor tomorrow.
-Okay.

835
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,408
She won't read it until tomorrow anyway.

836
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,627
-Aren't you leaving?
-What?

837
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:56,049
Oh, well… I'm just going to finish
reading the paper I was looking at.

838
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,052
Where is it?

839
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,679
All right, then. I'll be off first.

840
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,182
Okay. Bye.

841
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:10,188
I thought about it, and I guess
I must have lost it after breaking up.

842
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,106
I don't know why I'm doing this

843
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,108
with you.

844
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:18,780
What do you mean?

845
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:23,951
I want to focus on my work and school.

846
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,456
This is an important time for me.

847
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,168
I guess I'm talking too much, right?

848
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:36,839
Yes. Aren't you going overboard?
We're not even going out.

849
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:42,553
We should end it.

850
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,353
Does this sound like I want to cut ties?

851
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,568
But whatever I say,

852
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:00,947
Jae-eon won't even blink an eye.

853
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,790
<i>He's always so relaxed and calm,
but I'm always anxious.</i>

854
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:14,335
<i>My ex cheated on me,
I got rejected by a guy who liked me,</i>

855
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,963
<i>and rumors spread about me
being sex partners with the guy I like.</i>

856
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:22,176
It sounds even worse like that.

857
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,437
<i>We should end it.</i>

858
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,939
<i>That's all I have to say.</i>

859
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:53,916
Let's talk.

860
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,626
You have more to say?

861
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,465
To be honest, I don't get
why you're so upset.

862
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,427
You didn't need to ghost me like that.

863
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,308
I said I'll see you at your house.

864
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,312
I thought you'd take a long time.

865
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,900
I thought I'd finish by 10 p.m.,
but it's taking longer than expected.

866
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,526
Right.

867
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,446
I see.

868
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:27,074
<i>I ran thousands of simulations
inside my head…</i>

869
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,577
You look pretty serious.

870
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:33,623
What did you want to say?

871
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,000
<i>But the moment I looked into his eyes,</i>

872
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,629
<i>my mind went blank.</i>

873
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,005
Well…

874
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,885
My ex-boyfriend came to my house.

875
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,721
He seemed to have heard rumors about us.

876
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,809
He said I should just date him instead.

877
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,021
What did you say?

878
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,774
I told him not to talk nonsense.

879
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,026
Really?

880
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:05,071
<i>"Really?" Is that it?</i>

881
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,828
Is that what you wanted to say?

882
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,126
Is there someone else you're seeing?

883
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,628
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

884
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,673
<i>Why am I asking this
when I was about to end everything?</i>

885
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:29,887
No.

886
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,223
Really?

887
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:49,532
Excuse me.

888
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:52,743
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

889
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,204
Yes.

890
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,249
So it's you.

891
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,087
You bastard!

892
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:06,883
Sir! What's wrong?

893
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,010
-What are you doing?
-Move.

894
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,511
-Wait!
-Move!

895
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:13,180
-Why are you doing this?
-Get out of the way!

896
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,225
Na-bi!

897
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,743
<i>Park Jae-eon has never been mine.
But it feels like I've lost him.</i>

898
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:18,496
<i>How could Na-bi date a guy like Jae-eon?</i>

899
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:22,166
-My girlfriend?
-Call me. Even if it's nothing special.

900
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:25,211
<i>My whole house is filled
with traces of Jae-eon.</i>

901
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,128
<i>Jerk.</i>

902
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,339
<i>I guess it worked.</i>

903
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,007
<i>How long are you going to avoid me?</i>

904
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:31,884
We didn't get to finish
what we were talking about.

905
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:35,721
This is how we always make up.
As if nothing happened.

906
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:37,515
I just picked it up, thinking of you.

907
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,558
-A gift for me?
-Yes.

908
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,352
I was jealous.
Good luck on your presentation.

909
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,854
<i>Who would like to assist Yu Na-bi?</i>

910
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,023
I thought it'd be fun. Seems interesting.

911
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,984
<i>Hey, Seol-a. I'll be there right away.</i>

912
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,361
<i>How can he not even call once?</i>

913
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:51,904
<i>I miss him.</i>

914
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:56,575
