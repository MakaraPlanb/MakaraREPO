1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:08,067
NEVERTHELESS,

2
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:11,087
NEVERTHELESS,

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,953
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,744
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:28,659
When is
your silent treatment going to end?

6
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,623
Never mind.

7
00:00:35,457 --> 00:00:36,291
Keep going, then.

8
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,960
Did we break up?

9
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,338
What? No!

10
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:42,965
Do you want to break up?

11
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:44,591
You didn't contact me since then.

12
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:46,718
-You didn't, either.
-I did.

13
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:50,139
What are you on about?
You didn't talk to me sincerely.

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,267
Hey, we're here.

15
00:00:54,476 --> 00:00:56,937
-Gosh, my shoulders.
-Fine.

16
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:00,774
Why were you together?

17
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:03,360
Oh, we just ran into each other.

18
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:05,362
Only Ji-wan's left, then.

19
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:07,906
Ji-wan's always late!

20
00:01:08,532 --> 00:01:10,784
She's arriving soon. Sorry.

21
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:14,329
-Why is she apologizing?
-Yun Sol!

22
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:18,208
She…

23
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:22,588
I guess she can only see Yun Sol.

24
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:24,214
Can't you see us?

25
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:26,967
I'm so sorry, guys.

26
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,678
I came out early, but I missed the bus.

27
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:31,680
She always makes this excuse.

28
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,475
But what about Jae-eon?

29
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:38,562
-He's not coming.
-What? Why? Oh, no…

30
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:40,981
Why not? Do you have a crush on him too?

31
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:43,358
It's not that…

32
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:44,735
I don't!

33
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:47,112
It seems weirder if you react like that.

34
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:49,823
Forget it. Let's go.
Everyone else already left.

35
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:52,784
-Let's go.
-Na-bi will come, though.

36
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:01,418
Who's driving?

37
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:03,545
I'll do it.

38
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:06,465
Hurry up, then.

39
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:08,592
What?

40
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:11,678
Why do I feel lonely?

41
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,181
Wait for me!

42
00:02:52,344 --> 00:02:53,845
They look delicious.

43
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:56,932
Can we have two of those, please?

44
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,433
-Two?
-Yes.

45
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:00,644
What about these?

46
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,729
-Let's eat them later.
-Okay.

47
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:04,439
Thank you.

48
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:06,775
-Here. Thank you.
-This looks great.

49
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:08,735
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

50
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:13,824
-Bye.
-Thank you.

51
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:20,998
Isn't it heavy?

52
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:23,083
-It's fine.
-I'll carry one.

53
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,501
It's fine.

54
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:30,674
Aren't you tired?

55
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:34,219
I'm okay.

56
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:40,600
Let's go.

57
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:43,145
Right…

58
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:50,777
EPISODE 7: I KNOW THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.
NEVERTHELESS,

59
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,877
Excuse me. Where's the Mansari Temple?

60
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,253
-The temple?
-Yes.

61
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:11,214
-Go that way.
-Keep going that way.

62
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:12,299
Oh, all right.

63
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:20,117
Are you sleeping here with your friends?

64
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,244
No, I'm going to sleep at my aunt's.

65
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:26,832
Really? Then I'll take you home.
I need to tell you something.

66
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:28,208
Tell me what?

67
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,584
I'll tell you later.

68
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,643
Do-hyeok, where should I put this?

69
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:49,354
Over there. No, I'll put that away.

70
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,977
Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.

71
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:33,064
Hello. I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

72
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:41,489
The weather is so nice today!

73
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:43,825
What? You said you weren't coming.

74
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,076
Na-bi!

75
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:49,206
Hello. I'm Na-bi's friend, Oh Bit-na.

76
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,833
-It's nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

77
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,294
I'm enjoying your videos too.

78
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:56,296
I see. Thank you.

79
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:57,672
It's really cool.

80
00:06:58,298 --> 00:06:59,716
-Hello.
-Hello.

81
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,676
-Welcome, everyone.
-I'm Se-yeong.

82
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,137
You said you weren't close.

83
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:05,222
When did you get here?

84
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:08,016
It's not like that.
My aunt lives nearby, that's all.

85
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:10,894
So there was a reason
why she was out of touch.

86
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:13,104
-It's nothing like that.
-Come on.

87
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:15,607
Excuse me, Do-hyeok.

88
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,943
-Where should I sleep?
-Where do we put our stuff?

89
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:19,152
My shoulders hurt.

90
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:22,489
She's going around so casually
as if it's her own home.

91
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,241
-Jeez.
-Let's go.

92
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:28,870
-Hey, I want the big room!
-That's mine!

93
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:31,957
-It takes forever to take off my shoes.
-Let's get some rest here.

94
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,293
Where are the keys?

95
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:37,212
Did you bring them?

96
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:39,589
Jeez.

97
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,677
Are you okay?

98
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,556
-What do you mean?
-Sorry I lied to you.

99
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,518
I thought you'd say you wouldn't come
if I told you he was coming.

100
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,062
It's fine.

101
00:07:58,817 --> 00:07:59,985
But…

102
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:04,072
What happened with you and Jae-eon?

103
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:06,908
You two seemed to be getting along well.

104
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:11,329
-Well--
-He did something wrong

105
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:13,164
like last time at the station, right?

106
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:15,584
I can totally imagine it.

107
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:16,918
No.

108
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:21,840
I'm the one who made a mistake.

109
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:27,304
He's probably pretty upset.

110
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:29,014
Oh.

111
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:32,100
I'll help you.

112
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,693
I got two rooms prepared.

113
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:43,403
First, this one.

114
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:48,116
And this way.

115
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,410
-It's so nice.
-Should we sleep here?

116
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:52,037
Give me my bag.

117
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:54,289
What about the guys' room?

118
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,627
This place is so pretty.

119
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,920
-Hey, let's sleep here!
-Is this the guys' room?

120
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,758
Come this way.

121
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,135
Can you wait just a minute?

122
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:10,805
-Ji-wan.
-Yes?

123
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:18,647
If you tell me an hour before
starting the barbecue,

124
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,482
-I'll get everything prepared.
-Okay.

125
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:22,609
-What are you doing later?
-What?

126
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,528
We're all Na-bi's friends.
Come hang out with us.

127
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,155
We're going to the amusement park.

128
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:29,366
I have to prepare the food.

129
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:32,410
Come on. We can all prepare it
together when we come back.

130
00:09:32,494 --> 00:09:34,621
You can take some photos
and hang out with us.

131
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,498
Oh, right. You have a YouTube channel.

132
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:38,333
I bet you'll be a good photographer.

133
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,838
-Then hang on.
-Okay.

134
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:45,715
Is he going to talk to Na-bi?

135
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,679
What are you doing here?
I can take care of this.

136
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:53,264
I have nothing to do, anyway.
Did you talk to everyone?

137
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:54,724
Yes.

138
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:57,394
They asked me to come
to the amusement park too.

139
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:00,563
If you don't want to,
I'll tell them for you.

140
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:03,191
No. I want to hang out with you.

141
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:05,902
All right, then.

142
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:08,029
Okay.

143
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:13,326
Wasn't that kind of rude?
You put him in a tight spot.

144
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:15,537
I was only asking him to hang out.

145
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,373
Let's ask him to eat barbecue with us too!

146
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:23,211
I already feel exhausted.

147
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:25,505
What are you on about?
It's just the beginning!

148
00:10:25,588 --> 00:10:27,048
You can't get exhausted!

149
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,136
-But why isn't Na-bi coming?
-I know.

150
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:33,471
Let's just go first.
We don't have seats anyway.

151
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:34,848
You can go by yourself.

152
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:36,349
Se-hun!

153
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:38,810
-Should we go?
-Let's go.

154
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:42,272
Jae-eon. Bring Na-bi later then.

155
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,486
-Be careful.
-Okay. Go first.

156
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,988
Se-hun, hurry up.

157
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:51,322
Let's go.

158
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:53,533
Wait for me.

159
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:10,341
Get in. Everyone left first.

160
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:32,197
Why are you sitting at the back?

161
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,744
Hang on. Do-hyeok's coming soon.

162
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:14,739
Unbelievable.

163
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:20,078
THE ALARM WILL RING IN 5 MINUTES

164
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:23,206
How many alarms did you set?

165
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:29,587
Gyeong-jun. Get up.
Your alarms are ringing.

166
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:32,340
Why do you set your alarms on the weekend?

167
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:39,430
It's so strange.

168
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:43,476
Whenever he takes his glasses off…

169
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:01,536
I…

170
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:05,748
Why do you set so many alarms?
I always wake up because of them.

171
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,836
I'm worried I'll keep sleeping
without hearing them.

172
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,672
I'll wake you up,
so just set two alarms, okay?

173
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:15,717
Really? Okay, then.

174
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:22,140
Yes?

175
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:24,100
<i>You're still looking for a place, right?</i>

176
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,102
<i>There's one out. Come and check it.</i>

177
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:27,228
I see…

178
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:31,190
There's a place?
All right, I'll head over.

179
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:36,029
Who was that? What place?

180
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:39,824
It was the real estate agent.
There's a decent place.

181
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:47,540
I was going to stay only until
I found a place, anyway.

182
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,711
-Should I come with you?
-Aren't you busy?

183
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:55,048
I'd appreciate it, but it's the weekend.

184
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:57,425
It's fine.
I like looking around for a house.

185
00:13:58,092 --> 00:14:00,970
Then dinner's on me tonight.
What do you want?

186
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:03,848
Well… <i>Tteokbokki</i>?

187
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:05,934
Again?

188
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:08,853
I thought you liked <i>tteokbokki</i>.

189
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:13,149
What?

190
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,277
Wear your glasses.

191
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:19,280
I have to wash my face.

192
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:44,973
I heard you met Seol-a at school.

193
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:47,976
Yes.

194
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,019
She said you were attractive.

195
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:52,855
She wanted to talk to you more,
but you left.

196
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:57,735
I thought she was pretty too.

197
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:23,636
The door lock was too old.

198
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:27,181
And did you see the mold? It's terrible.

199
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,934
Stop that. The house was pretty decent.

200
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:31,519
What do you mean?

201
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:34,063
Just say it
if there's something not to your liking.

202
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:36,399
-Stop it.
-Is it really urgent?

203
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,776
I worked so hard to find a place for you.

204
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:41,362
Your husband's complaining so much.

205
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:42,947
My husband?

206
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:46,159
-He's not my husband.
-He's not?

207
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:48,286
He was so picky,
I thought you were a couple.

208
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:50,371
What will you do, then?

209
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:52,498
I'm sure you know,
but this is a rare chance.

210
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,753
Think about it properly.
There are lots of problems.

211
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:58,671
It seemed fine.

212
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:01,049
You don't like it either, right?

213
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:02,300
What?

214
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:04,427
Sorry, but we'll think about it some more.

215
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,637
My goodness. All right, then.

216
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:08,473
You might lose your chance, though.

217
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:09,557
Goodness.

218
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:14,771
Hey. It was totally fine.

219
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,106
You saw the mold. There was too much.

220
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,775
Let's go. Come on.

221
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:19,901
Let's go.

222
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:25,782
-Can you get me a doll?
-That one?

223
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:28,284
Yes, that one! The huge one over there.

224
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,162
SHOOTING RANGE
BASEBALL THROW, BALLOON DARTS

225
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:33,915
I'm leaving.

226
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:35,917
-This is easy.
-You guys try it too!

227
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,794
-Watch me.
-I'll show you my skills.

228
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:39,504
-Let's make a bet.
-Okay, then.

229
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:40,838
What are you doing here?

230
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:43,382
This is so fun!

231
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:44,842
Gosh.

232
00:16:44,926 --> 00:16:47,261
Na-bi, you try it too.
I'll take a photo of you.

233
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:49,639
I'm not sure I can do it.

234
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:52,767
Let me show you something cool.

235
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,560
Look at your posture. It's so bad.

236
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:00,691
Hang on.

237
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,070
That's a strike.

238
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:15,081
-Isn't this fun? Did you win that?
-Yes!

239
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,296
Are you going to do this?

240
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,310
-You got it!
-I got it.

241
00:17:36,394 --> 00:17:38,855
You got it! He got it!

242
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:39,772
He hit it!

243
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,026
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

244
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:47,655
He won that.

245
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:49,699
That's my favorite character…

246
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:52,952
Na-bi, that's my favorite character…

247
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:55,830
Of course. It's okay.

248
00:17:57,165 --> 00:18:00,168
Thank you so much! Oh, my gosh! Sol, look!

249
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:23,232
Stop!

250
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:26,444
Hey, stop there. Hey!

251
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:28,946
-Go!
-Hey!

252
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:33,075
Why did you have to come with me?

253
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:37,413
Security is the most important,
but it didn't look that safe.

254
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:39,373
The neighborhood too.

255
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:40,875
It seemed pretty dangerous.

256
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,710
It'll cost more money for that.

257
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,172
What if someone takes that house?

258
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:48,591
Should I just say I'll take it?

259
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,344
I'm just going to take it.

260
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:53,846
Hey.

261
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,264
You didn't like it, either.

262
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:57,642
Of course, it's not as good as your house.

263
00:18:57,725 --> 00:19:00,061
Then you can keep staying at my house.

264
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:06,734
Enjoy.

265
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:09,153
Oh. Thank you.

266
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:14,200
Wait, my phone.

267
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:17,954
It's my first time actually riding this.

268
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:19,705
Me too.

269
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:22,500
It'll be so nice since the sun's setting.

270
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,670
Na-bi. Isn't this a great photo?

271
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,923
Yes. That's a great shot.

272
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:32,718
I'll print this photo,
and the ones from the beach last time.

273
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:37,974
It's all right.

274
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:41,686
Let's take a nice selfie up there.

275
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:44,522
-Okay?
-It's going to be so pretty.

276
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:52,488
Four people can ride one, so ride with us.

277
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:55,199
Can you take photos for us?

278
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:56,450
-Come on.
-Join us.

279
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:59,036
-Okay?
-It's going to be so fun.

280
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:15,553
Next four, please.

281
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:17,847
We'll take the next one with our friends.

282
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:19,515
Then you two, come up.

283
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,706
I don't want to ride this.

284
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,541
-What?
-I'll wait here.

285
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:46,709
Why?

286
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:49,295
I'm afraid of heights.

287
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,881
Oh, really?

288
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:55,760
Then let's wait here together.
I'm afraid of heights too.

289
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,971
-All right.
-You're such cowards.

290
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:02,767
Will you be okay?
You're afraid of heights too.

291
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,478
I'm fine. We came all the way here,
so I should ride it.

292
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,688
Plus, it's not a scary ride.

293
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,984
Really? Okay, I'll ride it with you.

294
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:15,154
Really? Nice. Let's go.

295
00:21:15,237 --> 00:21:17,323
Hey, there's Jin-su.

296
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:18,532
Hi, Jin-su!

297
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:28,417
We can see the ocean!

298
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,880
-Can you take a photo of me?
-Me too!

299
00:21:32,963 --> 00:21:35,591
-Count to three.
-One, two, three.

300
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:37,968
One, two, three.

301
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:39,970
Don't lean back!

302
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:43,057
-I want one just by myself.
-Move!

303
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,475
One, two, three.

304
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:46,143
Move out of the way.

305
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:48,020
Can you take one of me?

306
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:49,939
One, two, three.

307
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:55,861
-Hey, let's take one together.
-It's dangerous. Just stay still.

308
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:00,491
Why do you have to talk like that?

309
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:37,194
It's so pretty.

310
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:48,414
Right. So pretty.

311
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:09,518
You should see the view.

312
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:13,230
Right. I am.

313
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,984
Are you scared?

314
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:21,697
It's slower than I thought.
It's kind of scary.

315
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:23,407
Jeez.

316
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,203
Oh, my gosh!

317
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:31,081
Look at the view! I bet
we can see the guesthouse from here.

318
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:32,541
Really? Where?

319
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,503
Over there. This is amazing.

320
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:40,507
Hey, stop that.

321
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:43,093
Right. Sorry. Let's sit.

322
00:23:45,137 --> 00:23:46,722
But you know,

323
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:50,059
the thrill of riding Ferris wheels
is in the shaking.

324
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:52,811
Sorry.

325
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:57,816
But Sol. You're jealous of us, aren't you?

326
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,152
-Stop it.
-I'm really sorry.

327
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:10,246
We can get off soon, so hang in there.

328
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:14,500
What? Right. But I'm okay now.

329
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:16,877
Really?

330
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:18,879
Yes. I'm fine.

331
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:51,287
I heard other Ferris wheels have music.

332
00:24:52,246 --> 00:24:53,998
I guess there's no music here.

333
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:01,005
Why are you looking at me?

334
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:04,466
-Look outside.
-How have you been?

335
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,176
Fine.

336
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:08,637
So-so.

337
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:10,347
I haven't been well.

338
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:19,398
-Sorry, I--
-Why didn't you contact me?

339
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:20,774
What?

340
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:25,571
-I…
-It was my birthday.

341
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:29,575
You have lots of people to wish you
a happy birthday.

342
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,248
<i>I can't waver again.</i>

343
00:25:36,332 --> 00:25:38,083
Anyway, I wanted to say…

344
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:42,504
that I'm sorry for being harsh to Seol-a.

345
00:26:04,193 --> 00:26:05,194
I wanted

346
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:08,364
to hear you say happy birthday to me.

347
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:30,594
<i>His familiar smells</i>

348
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:33,847
<i>are haunting me.</i>

349
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:52,282
You could have just told me instead.

350
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:57,830
You're making me feel upset.

351
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,291
Do you hate me that much?

352
00:27:25,481 --> 00:27:27,357
He should be back by now.

353
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:29,985
Why is he taking so long
to just buy some beer?

354
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:32,654
What took you so long?

355
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:35,115
Did you go all the way
to a beer brewery or what?

356
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:38,994
-Who are you?
-And who are you?

357
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:41,288
Well, I'm…

358
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:45,584
Mom!

359
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,669
Mom?

360
00:27:51,632 --> 00:27:52,466
Hey.

361
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:54,968
Do-yeon. Why are you here?

362
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:57,137
To start the fire.

363
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:00,182
Good job. But is that it?

364
00:28:00,265 --> 00:28:01,892
No. I was bored.

365
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:03,393
I want to join you.

366
00:28:03,477 --> 00:28:06,522
Do-yeon, don't bother the guests.

367
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:09,733
Hey, why are you so mean to her?
Did you fix the bike?

368
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:10,859
-Yes.
-Is there meat?

369
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:13,195
-The Ferris wheel…
-There's meat, but…

370
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:14,696
-Who's the prettiest?
-The meat…

371
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:17,366
Na-bi, who's that guy?

372
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:19,576
Do I look like someone
who grew up cooking?

373
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,703
-You're good at cooking meat.
-Yes, I am.

374
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:23,997
He's my junior.

375
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:25,833
He's not a theater major?

376
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,794
I should transfer to your university.

377
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:33,090
Hello.

378
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:35,050
Hi. I'm Yang Do-yeon.

379
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:41,265
Hi, I'm Park Jae-eon.

380
00:28:43,475 --> 00:28:46,728
-Hello.
-Hello.

381
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,063
Hello.

382
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,399
Na-bi, can you help me?

383
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,151
All right.

384
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:56,113
Did you have dinner?

385
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:58,365
I already unbuckled my belt.

386
00:28:58,448 --> 00:28:59,700
You have to cook the meat.

387
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:02,286
I'm going to unbuckle my belt.

388
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:03,745
No, I haven't eaten yet.

389
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,622
Then we can eat together.

390
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:14,715
-Alcohol? Yes, I like drinking.
-Have a shot.

391
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,384
-Do you like drinking?
-Yes. What kind do you like?

392
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:20,220
I like soju.

393
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:22,472
Oh, would you like some?

394
00:29:22,556 --> 00:29:23,849
Shall we?

395
00:29:27,978 --> 00:29:30,564
-Let me pour you a shot.
-Thank you.

396
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:32,566
Just a little.

397
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:38,947
Cheers.

398
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:50,500
How are you so good at taking photos?

399
00:29:50,584 --> 00:29:51,627
Seriously.

400
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,963
Do-hyeok,
can I see the photos you took earlier?

401
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:58,383
You're such a good photographer.
But I look awful in this one.

402
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:00,177
Oh, Jin-su!

403
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,262
This one's nice, right?

404
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:03,764
-Gosh.
-Awesome.

405
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:06,016
I'll send the photos to your emails later.

406
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,894
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

407
00:30:08,977 --> 00:30:10,479
Can we look?

408
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:12,022
Sure. Go ahead.

409
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:14,066
Look at this.

410
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:16,234
-Hey.
-This photo's nice.

411
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:19,029
I just got two of these.

412
00:30:19,112 --> 00:30:21,031
-This doesn't look like you at all.
-Here.

413
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:24,785
You'll feel really refreshed
the next morning after you eat this.

414
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:26,244
I see.

415
00:30:30,332 --> 00:30:32,709
-What do you think?
-You look pretty.

416
00:30:32,793 --> 00:30:35,212
-He's an amazing photographer.
-Right.

417
00:30:36,046 --> 00:30:38,215
-Is that a compliment?
-You look really nice.

418
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:41,301
Do-hyeok took this photo
at the Ferris wheel.

419
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,553
Don't forget that I gave this to you.

420
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,890
Let's clink glasses.

421
00:30:48,725 --> 00:30:51,103
-You're drinking without eating anything?
-Come on.

422
00:30:51,186 --> 00:30:53,355
-Cheers. Come on.
-Jeez.

423
00:30:58,652 --> 00:31:00,737
Unbelievable.

424
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:05,826
This is so nice.

425
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:09,746
Sol. Meat!

426
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,956
It's almost done.

427
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,917
You're not even helping them.

428
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,460
I'm so hungry.

429
00:31:15,544 --> 00:31:16,962
Sol. Need any help?

430
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,090
-No, it's fine.
-Is everything okay?

431
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:21,425
You need any help?

432
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:23,343
Just stay back. You're bothering us.

433
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:25,929
"Just stay back. You're bothering us."

434
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:29,808
Hey, just sit quietly
and don't bother Sol.

435
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,226
What about the meat?

436
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:34,688
Sit down comfortably.

437
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:36,440
You're so kind.

438
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:37,983
-What…
-Chopsticks.

439
00:31:41,903 --> 00:31:44,156
Anyone want to drink with Ji-wan?

440
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:46,575
Nobody?

441
00:31:46,658 --> 00:31:49,369
I'm so lonely.

442
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,632
There's no alcohol…

443
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,765
What about me?

444
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:11,433
His photos are amazing.

445
00:32:21,193 --> 00:32:23,737
-Here.
-You can keep looking.

446
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,781
-All right.
-It's so…

447
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,997
Do you like the moon?

448
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:36,374
Yes.

449
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,961
Do you like the crescent moon
or the full moon?

450
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:40,921
-I just…
-Sol!

451
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:42,255
Put it there.

452
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,007
…like it if it's pretty.

453
00:32:55,644 --> 00:32:59,773
<i>He really has nothing to do with me now,
but why…</i>

454
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:01,191
Are you jealous?

455
00:33:01,858 --> 00:33:03,193
Show them to me next time.

456
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:04,528
I will. Come and visit.

457
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:06,363
What are you on about?

458
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:10,659
Jae-eon has a new target now.

459
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:13,161
I don't care.

460
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:20,877
What is it this time?

461
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:23,338
Why do you keep avoiding him?

462
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:28,385
-When did I avoid him?
-Don't lie.

463
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:32,055
I should know what's going on
to keep things in order.

464
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:35,976
Okay? Everyone's here to have a fun time.

465
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:37,561
You two keep ruining the vibe.

466
00:33:40,272 --> 00:33:41,857
I'll be careful.

467
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,901
So tell me. Did something happen
with him at the Ferris wheel?

468
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:47,946
No. We were just looking at the view.

469
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:49,197
You're such a bad liar.

470
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:52,117
Nothing happened, okay?
Stop jumping to conclusions.

471
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:56,246
Is it because of Do-hyeok?

472
00:33:57,581 --> 00:33:59,332
He's charming.

473
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,710
I wouldn't mind if you went after him.

474
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:09,759
Jae-eon has a girlfriend.

475
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:11,678
-What?
-Be quiet.

476
00:34:12,387 --> 00:34:13,263
Really?

477
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:15,473
Who?

478
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:19,686
I don't know. But he does,
so stop talking about us like that.

479
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:22,856
What? That's impossible.

480
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,066
Are you sure about that?

481
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,319
He could he… There's no way.

482
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:28,820
That's enough. Just take this.

483
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,575
A girlfriend? For real?

484
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:37,579
Come over here.

485
00:34:37,662 --> 00:34:38,747
Excuse me.

486
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:41,499
Hey, Na-bi.

487
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:44,336
There's some left.
We can put this back in the kitchen.

488
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:48,048
They look like newlyweds.

489
00:34:49,299 --> 00:34:51,343
I hope you have a happy marriage!

490
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:56,014
Hey, Yu Se-hun. You're so ridiculous.

491
00:34:56,097 --> 00:34:57,849
-What?
-Are you that clueless?

492
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,559
What about me?

493
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:01,019
Are you drunk?

494
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:05,482
Do-hyeok. How did you come to know Na-bi?

495
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,987
We were childhood neighborhood friends.

496
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:14,991
I love stories like that!

497
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:18,995
Childhood friends, first love,
stuff like that.

498
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,664
It's like a romance drama!

499
00:35:20,747 --> 00:35:22,332
-Just like a drama.
-It's not like that.

500
00:35:22,415 --> 00:35:23,250
I know.

501
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:31,174
It's true that Na-bi is my first love.

502
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:33,635
What?

503
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:36,012
-You should get married!
-I'm jealous.

504
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:40,308
-You should get married!
-You should get married!

505
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:43,311
-You should get married!
-You should get married!

506
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:44,688
What? Are you drunk?

507
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:46,106
It's true, though.

508
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:48,108
Will you accept my proposal?

509
00:35:48,191 --> 00:35:50,777
-My dear.
-You only know him, right?

510
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:52,487
I'll do it.

511
00:36:15,552 --> 00:36:17,178
Your girlfriend?

512
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:19,389
Yes.

513
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:22,225
We haven't dated for long.

514
00:36:22,892 --> 00:36:25,270
About two, three… Three months.

515
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:28,648
It's only been three months,
and you're living together?

516
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:32,444
I begged her to move in.

517
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:36,072
I really like her a lot.

518
00:36:58,345 --> 00:36:59,471
Thanks for this.

519
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:02,724
All right. Enjoy the food. I'm leaving.

520
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,434
I'm moving out soon.

521
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:06,144
Already?

522
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:09,856
Well…

523
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:13,485
I know it's not easy to live
with someone else.

524
00:37:14,194 --> 00:37:15,653
Especially him.

525
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:19,657
He's so nosy, but he doesn't know
how to take care of himself.

526
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:21,618
-He even snores.
-Mom.

527
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:25,580
No, Gyeong-jun is really good to me.

528
00:37:26,456 --> 00:37:29,584
I felt that he received a lot of love
since he is bright and kind.

529
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:30,919
I guess I was right.

530
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:34,839
My goodness. You're so sweet.

531
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:49,062
<i>-Bit-na's favorite random game!
-Bit-na's favorite random game!</i>

532
00:37:49,145 --> 00:37:50,480
<i>-What game?
-What game?</i>

533
00:37:50,563 --> 00:37:52,857
<i>-Game, start.
-Game, start.</i>

534
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:54,818
The Whisper Game. I'll start.

535
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:57,153
-What is it?
-I don't know.

536
00:38:03,076 --> 00:38:04,869
-Seo Ji-wan.
-Really?

537
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,955
-Me?
-You're not fooling us.

538
00:38:07,038 --> 00:38:08,498
No, it's really unexpected.

539
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:10,208
What is it?

540
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,418
What? What is it?

541
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,045
This is really shocking.

542
00:38:14,129 --> 00:38:15,213
I'm so curious.

543
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,548
This is tough.

544
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:22,554
The question was, "Who's the ugliest one?"

545
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:24,222
Come here, you jerk.

546
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:27,392
Hey! You want to die?

547
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:30,437
They'll fall in love
after squabbling like that.

548
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,148
-What was the question?
-It's obvious.

549
00:38:33,731 --> 00:38:36,192
-You're not uncomfortable?
-It's fine.

550
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:38,862
-I'm not ugly!
-I'm sorry!

551
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:41,990
I'll just reveal the question.
"Who's the ugliest one here?"

552
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:45,201
-I knew it!
-I knew it!

553
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:49,205
-That's so childish.
-This game's supposed to be childish.

554
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:51,040
I'm going to beat you up!

555
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:56,129
All right. It's my turn.

556
00:38:56,212 --> 00:38:57,505
She's so drunk.

557
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,097
The noodle shop grandson.

558
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:10,727
Really? I can't believe it!

559
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,354
What? What was the question?

560
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,899
Honey. It's so obvious.

561
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:19,110
Guys, it's so obvious.
There's no point in drinking.

562
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:23,198
That's what I mean. It's too obvious.

563
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:26,201
Gyu-hyun,
why would you want to know the question?

564
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:29,621
Right. It's nothing. Why would you drink?

565
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:31,456
I'm just curious.

566
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:35,835
All right, the question
I asked Bit-na was,

567
00:39:39,088 --> 00:39:41,633
"Who's your ideal type
among the people here?"

568
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:48,181
Okay. Anything you want to know, Do-hyeok?

569
00:39:57,899 --> 00:40:00,902
Who makes you smile the most
among the people here?

570
00:40:03,404 --> 00:40:04,531
You.

571
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:09,327
I knew it!

572
00:40:10,954 --> 00:40:13,831
What is it? What's the question?

573
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:16,793
-What is it?
-I knew it!

574
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:18,795
Let me hear the question!

575
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,047
What is it?

576
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,173
Let's let this slide.

577
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:24,342
-No!
-Okay, let's let it slide.

578
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:25,718
You can ask instead of me.

579
00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:28,888
Me? Okay, I'll do it.

580
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:31,808
My question is,

581
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:34,811
"Who is the prettiest here?"

582
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:36,980
Se-yeong, of course.

583
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:38,231
Then it's my turn again.

584
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:40,733
-Who's the loveliest one?
<i>-I'm leaving for a minute.</i>

585
00:40:40,817 --> 00:40:43,444
<i>-Bring the others to the beach later.</i>
-You, Se-yeong.

586
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,154
-Jeez.
-Excuse me.

587
00:40:45,238 --> 00:40:47,282
-Stop it.
-Where are you going?

588
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:49,534
What about you, Do-yeon?

589
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:51,411
Well…

590
00:41:18,062 --> 00:41:19,397
Yu Na-bi.

591
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:39,667
What is it?

592
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:41,044
What?

593
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:44,005
-What's that reaction?
-Right.

594
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:46,424
Is she drinking out of jealousy?

595
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:48,343
I should drink for this one.

596
00:41:48,426 --> 00:41:49,927
-Me too!
-Me too.

597
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:51,220
Me too.

598
00:41:55,808 --> 00:41:56,726
What's the question?

599
00:41:59,812 --> 00:42:01,356
Me!

600
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:06,903
-Oh, my gosh!
-Let's stop. This is boring.

601
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:11,866
Hey, guys. Let's stop playing games
and just chat.

602
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:14,577
Why? This is fun. Let's continue.

603
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,496
Come on!

604
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:20,333
Sol. Why does Ji-wan always act
like she's tough? She always gets drunk.

605
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,377
She gets drunk faster
when drinking outside.

606
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,753
Give me that.

607
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:25,546
Stop drinking.

608
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,217
You're such close friends.
You know everything about each other.

609
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,012
Well, we've been close friends
since middle school.

610
00:42:34,222 --> 00:42:36,933
Was Ji-wan popular in middle school?

611
00:42:37,016 --> 00:42:40,019
She says boys were lining up to date her.

612
00:42:40,103 --> 00:42:42,146
Yes. She was popular.

613
00:42:43,815 --> 00:42:44,857
She's pretty.

614
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:48,444
Hey! You must be drunk.

615
00:42:49,112 --> 00:42:52,615
She's just a bit charming,

616
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:54,909
to be generous.

617
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:58,788
It's true. Guys always hit on her
even when she had a boyfriend.

618
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:02,291
I told you, Bit-na! I wasn't lying!

619
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:06,087
I was really pretty, I'm telling you!

620
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,589
I was one
of the prettiest girls in school!

621
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:09,757
Hey.

622
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:12,301
She's the prettiest.

623
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:13,803
What's with you? Stop it.

624
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:15,596
-What?
-Jeez.

625
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,099
You guys are all looking down on me.

626
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:20,685
Sol. Have you ever dated anyone?

627
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:24,856
Yu Se-hun, stop it.

628
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:28,276
Sol doesn't like you!

629
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:30,319
Shut up. Why are you so clueless?

630
00:43:30,403 --> 00:43:32,029
-I should take her to bed.
-Me?

631
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:34,365
Gosh, she's so noisy.

632
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:36,492
I want to hang out with you!

633
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:38,745
She's so noisy!

634
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:41,914
I want to keep playing games.

635
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,209
Guys! I want to go shoot fireworks too!

636
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:47,670
Why did you drink so much?

637
00:43:48,463 --> 00:43:50,715
Do you want a hangover like last time?

638
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:53,718
That was my mistake.

639
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:56,429
Just get some sleep, okay?

640
00:43:57,305 --> 00:44:00,892
-Sol! My friend Sol!
-Hey.

641
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:03,060
-Let go of me.
-My old friend.

642
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:04,520
Let me go.

643
00:44:16,616 --> 00:44:19,619
What's with you?
Stop drinking from now on.

644
00:44:20,411 --> 00:44:21,245
Sol.

645
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,668
Can you hold my hand again?

646
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:47,772
I like you the most.

647
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:51,275
I like you more than my mom and dad.

648
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,819
You're my favorite person in the world.

649
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:56,656
What about you?

650
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,408
Who's your favorite person?

651
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:03,371
Stop the nonsense. Go to sleep.

652
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:06,123
Do you have feelings for that guy?
Ju-hyeok?

653
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:10,753
Or Yu Se-hun? I don't want you to.

654
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:13,047
Because…

655
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,717
I just don't like it.

656
00:45:19,637 --> 00:45:21,847
Don't hang out with anyone else.

657
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:25,268
Just like me, okay?

658
00:45:26,477 --> 00:45:29,939
Just me. Please.

659
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:35,236
Please, Sol. Only like me.

660
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:39,782
Seo Ji-wan.

661
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,998
Stop making me get my hopes up.

662
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,339
<i>-So exciting! So fun!
-So exciting! So fun!</i>

663
00:46:36,422 --> 00:46:38,299
<i>-The Game of Death!
-The Game of Death!</i>

664
00:46:39,592 --> 00:46:42,762
-Come on. Join us.
-No thanks.

665
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:45,181
What's gotten into you?
Is something going on?

666
00:46:45,264 --> 00:46:48,643
He's right! You've changed!

667
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:51,312
It seems like he's become
a bit sentimental.

668
00:46:52,313 --> 00:46:53,773
Are you going for a new image?

669
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:55,900
Why? What was he like before?

670
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:58,736
Jae-eon was incredible. As you can see.

671
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:00,196
You know, he's so handsome.

672
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:02,573
What's going on?

673
00:47:03,324 --> 00:47:08,663
Or has he finally found his soulmate?

674
00:47:16,754 --> 00:47:20,091
He's suddenly drinking!

675
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:22,176
<i>-Who's the target?
-Who's the target?</i>

676
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:24,053
<i>-Who is it?
-Who is it?</i>

677
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:26,764
Let's stop. Let's just go to the beach.

678
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:30,267
-You wanted to watch fireworks.
-Come on. Everyone was curious.

679
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:35,106
Everyone was gossiping about whether
Jae-eon met his soulmate or something.

680
00:47:35,815 --> 00:47:38,609
Jae-eon,
why don't you just tell us honestly?

681
00:47:38,693 --> 00:47:40,986
Is there a girl who's captured your heart?

682
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,531
-Is there?
-Is there?

683
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:48,869
Yes.

684
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:54,834
Then would you like to kiss her?

685
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:57,586
-Would you?
-Would you?

686
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:01,924
Are you guys drunk?

687
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:09,640
Bit-na, stop it.

688
00:48:11,434 --> 00:48:13,185
Let's just keep playing games.

689
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:16,188
Come on. This is all a game too.

690
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:18,149
All right, Jae-eon.

691
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:21,902
Is that girl here with us right now?

692
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:25,197
-Is she?
-Is she?

693
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:33,164
-Don't move.
-You'll get hurt.

694
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:36,167
Are you okay?

695
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:39,420
-She's hurt.
-What do we do?

696
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:41,213
-Don't touch it.
-Don't touch it!

697
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:43,424
-She's hurt.
-Hey, she's hurt.

698
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:46,218
The cut is deep. Let's get this treated.

699
00:48:46,844 --> 00:48:48,220
She's hurt.

700
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:49,805
Are you…

701
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,682
What do we do about this?

702
00:48:53,142 --> 00:48:55,478
-Be careful.
-You spilled that.

703
00:48:56,896 --> 00:48:58,063
It must hurt.

704
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:00,691
Is it bad?

705
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,027
I'm fine.

706
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:09,909
The cut isn't too deep,
but we should still disinfect it.

707
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:15,748
Gyu-hyun, take the others
to the beach first.

708
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:17,291
We'll catch up later.

709
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:18,918
Why? We can wait.

710
00:49:19,502 --> 00:49:21,545
Do-yeon's going to feel embarrassed.

711
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:22,880
Right. Go on without us.

712
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:26,217
Do-hyeok's already
setting up the fireworks at the beach.

713
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:28,761
That's why he left.

714
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:32,640
Don't tell Do-hyeok about this.

715
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:33,849
We'll head over soon.

716
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,811
All right, then. Be careful on the way.

717
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,646
Okay.

718
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:42,358
I totally ruined all the fun.

719
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:44,693
You didn't. It's fine.

720
00:49:44,777 --> 00:49:47,780
Take antibiotics, just in case.

721
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,325
By the way,

722
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:55,329
what's your relationship to Jae-eon?

723
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:58,249
There's nothing between us.

724
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,543
It seemed like there was something.

725
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:03,712
I mean it.
My friends just like teasing us.

726
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,548
Really?

727
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:08,592
He seemed
to have feelings for you, though.

728
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:13,347
Why do you think that?

729
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,724
During the Whisper Game,

730
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:18,894
I asked Jae-eon

731
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:24,149
who he wanted to kiss tonight.

732
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:38,539
He's always like that.

733
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:41,041
He's never sincere.

734
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,002
You don't need to pay attention to that.

735
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:47,882
All done.

736
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,177
Let's go to the beach now.

737
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:54,597
Well…

738
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,308
I'm going to my aunt's house.

739
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:01,228
Why? You should come.
Do-hyeok's probably waiting for you.

740
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:05,232
I really want to, but I'm so tired.

741
00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:07,943
Go on and have fun.

742
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:10,362
Okay. Then get some rest,
and see you tomorrow.

743
00:51:10,446 --> 00:51:11,780
Okay.

744
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:14,450
Make sure to take antibiotics.

745
00:51:31,634 --> 00:51:34,428
-Come on.
-Hurry.

746
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,890
Hey. Do this dance.

747
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:40,434
Starting from that end. Go.

748
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:42,061
Why are we doing this?

749
00:51:42,645 --> 00:51:44,521
I hate this!

750
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,484
Why are we doing this?

751
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:50,694
Am I doing this right?

752
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,989
-Hey!
-Come on!

753
00:51:54,073 --> 00:51:55,866
This is so stupid!

754
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,785
NA-BI

755
00:51:57,868 --> 00:51:59,244
Can you take a photo of me?

756
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:02,039
-Sure.
-Hey, let's do this.

757
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:04,458
Let's write "love" with these.

758
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:05,584
Come on.

759
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,010
-Thank you.
-I'll write "love."

760
00:52:15,094 --> 00:52:16,845
Can you take a photo of us too?

761
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:18,389
You draw the heart.

762
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:20,099
You have to get the heart.

763
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:22,685
With the word "love" too.

764
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:25,521
All right. One, two, three.

765
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:37,157
Why are you sitting here all alone?

766
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:41,036
I brought these to hang out with you.

767
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:49,211
What is it? Why have you been
looking so upset the whole day?

768
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:51,380
-Is it fun?
-What?

769
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:54,550
Is it fun to tease people
and make them feel uncomfortable?

770
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:56,093
What are you talking about?

771
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:58,012
Like just now.

772
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:00,514
You talk about others
just for your enjoyment.

773
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,392
You're making other people
feel uncomfortable.

774
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:05,519
So stop doing things like that.

775
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:07,187
It's not like that.

776
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,440
Everyone was whispering behind his back.

777
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:11,275
So I just asked for them.

778
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,069
Plus, it's obvious
that Na-bi and Jae-eon like each other.

779
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:15,612
It's sad to see them like that.

780
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:20,576
All right. Fine, I'll stop.

781
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:22,077
I promise.

782
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:24,872
Come on, try this.
I brought it so we could make up.

783
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:26,874
Hold it,

784
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:29,752
and if we light the end…

785
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:32,629
Isn't it pretty?

786
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:38,218
Look.

787
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:45,851
Stop trying to justify yourself.

788
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,853
You know it too.

789
00:53:52,775 --> 00:53:55,360
Stop playing games with me.

790
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:59,656
What are you talking about?

791
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,118
I started this knowing that
you thought of me as a joke.

792
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:04,787
But I can't stand it anymore.

793
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:06,497
What do you mean?

794
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,460
Let's end this.

795
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:18,133
Hey!

796
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,017
Yang Do-hyeok!

797
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:30,020
Do it like this.

798
00:54:30,104 --> 00:54:31,563
You're here.

799
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:33,774
What happened?

800
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:36,735
-I just got hurt a little.
-How?

801
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:38,070
Is it bad?

802
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:40,864
It's fine. Na-bi took good care of it.

803
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:44,493
Gosh, it must hurt.
You should have been careful.

804
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:46,370
Where's Na-bi?

805
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:49,873
She said she's too tired to come.

806
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,959
-She's not coming?
-Are you that upset?

807
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:56,130
She went to her aunt's?

808
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:58,340
Probably. Why?

809
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:01,218
It's nothing.

810
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:04,888
But where is Jae-eon?

811
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:14,189
This is the worst.

812
00:55:15,274 --> 00:55:16,525
What is?

813
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:23,991
Didn't you go to the beach
with the others?

814
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:27,286
I came to see if you treated it.

815
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:33,083
Don't worry. I treated her properly.

816
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:35,711
Do-yeon just left. Didn't you see her?

817
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:41,466
Why are you smiling?

818
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:50,517
What are you doing?

819
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:52,895
I meant you.

820
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,063
You got hurt too.

821
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:57,691
It's none of your business.

822
00:55:58,692 --> 00:55:59,943
It hurts, right?

823
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:05,699
Stop drinking. You had enough already.

824
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:13,874
Why would you care whether I drink or not?

825
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:17,961
It's fine. I'll do it.

826
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:21,173
-Let me do it.
-I said I'll do it.

827
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:27,346
You get angry at me so often

828
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:29,223
when you don't with others.

829
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:39,900
<i>Why can't I ever refuse him?</i>

830
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:48,825
<i>I feel like I'm going
to crumble down again.</i>

831
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:52,913
You saw me get hurt?

832
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:55,082
Of course I saw it.

833
00:56:56,208 --> 00:57:00,254
But you would have gotten angry
if I did something about it.

834
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:04,049
You're ridiculous.

835
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,846
I can't say
I didn't have other intentions.

836
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:19,523
-Stop it.
-What?

837
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,152
What you're doing right now.

838
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:28,657
What am I doing?

839
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:32,286
-Stop smiling.
-I can't even smile?

840
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:34,496
Do you enjoy playing with me?

841
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:37,666
Why did you say that in front
of the others? They'll misunderstand.

842
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:42,504
Are you really asking

843
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:44,840
because you don't know?

844
00:57:46,717 --> 00:57:48,510
I kept thinking about you.

845
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:51,763
I missed you.

846
00:57:52,973 --> 00:57:54,933
Didn't you miss me?

847
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:06,737
Do you hate me that much?

848
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,197
You have a girlfriend.

849
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:10,949
That's not the issue.

850
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:14,036
Right. It has nothing to do with me.

851
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:15,621
Then be honest.

852
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:18,415
Let go of me.

853
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:26,673
Running away again?

854
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:30,552
I never ran away.

855
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:32,679
Do you really want me to let go?

856
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:37,434
Just tell me

857
00:58:38,143 --> 00:58:39,728
if you don't want this.

858
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:44,316
Then I'll stop.

859
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,710
YANG DO-HYEOK

860
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:57,889
Is this really okay?

861
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:04,396
If we continue,

862
01:00:06,106 --> 01:00:07,983
I don't think I can stop.

863
01:00:27,465 --> 01:00:31,505
NEVERTHELESS,

Subtitle translation by: Ju-young Park

865
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:17,260
Right now, I like you so much
that I don't know what to do.

866
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:19,513
<i>I know exactly what my tears mean.</i>

867
01:01:19,596 --> 01:01:20,430
Did you sleep well?

868
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:22,182
We didn't get to finish.

869
01:01:22,265 --> 01:01:23,934
<i>You must like her a lot.</i>

870
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:25,435
Yes. Unlike someone.

871
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:28,313
<i>Are you and Do-hyeok dating?</i>

872
01:01:28,396 --> 01:01:29,564
<i>He's such a coward.</i>

873
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:31,358
Did you get an assistant?

874
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:33,276
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

875
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,737
<i>Why does it feel like I'm cheating?</i>

876
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:38,073
<i>I heard you got scouted.</i>

877
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:39,074
Are you going to America?

878
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:40,784
<i>I'm going to give it some thought.</i>
