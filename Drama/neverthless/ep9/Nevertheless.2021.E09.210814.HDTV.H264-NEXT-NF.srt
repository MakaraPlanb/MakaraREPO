1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:08,067
NEVERTHELESS,

2
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:11,087
NEVERTHELESS,

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,953
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,744
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:31,116
You're drinking a lot.

6
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:36,079
Is something going on?

7
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:46,632
No.

8
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,636
Nothing.

9
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,389
<i>Is work going well?</i>

10
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:59,102
<i>No, I came outside
because I couldn't focus.</i>

11
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:05,108
<i>Na-bi keeps looking somewhere else
instead of looking at me.</i>

12
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,320
I saw you with him

13
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:10,948
at school.

14
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:16,453
-What?
-Yang Do-hyeok.

15
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:21,875
I see.

16
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:28,882
Do you like him?

17
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:33,720
Why do you ask?

18
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,518
I'm just curious.

19
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:46,108
I do.

20
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,861
He's a good guy.

21
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,877
What makes you say that?

22
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,092
He's a good cook,

23
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,595
and he's considerate.

24
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:19,975
He's cute sometimes too.

25
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:27,107
And most of all,
I feel comfortable when I'm with him.

26
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,911
Then why aren't you dating him?

27
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,171
That's not something you should be asking.

28
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:53,216
Maybe not.

29
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:05,604
If I date him,
he'd get disappointed in me.

30
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,319
I'm not the kind of person he thinks I am.

31
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:19,284
At least to him,

32
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:25,082
I want to seem like a good person.

33
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,179
Then what about me?

34
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:58,698
EPISODE 9: I KNOW IT'S OVER.
NEVERTHELESS,

35
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:07,124
-Do you like her that much?
-Yes, I do.

36
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,709
And I miss her all the time.

37
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:12,421
Then what are you waiting for?
Be more bold.

38
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:16,591
Well, I can't really do that right now.

39
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,095
I feel like I might mess things up.

40
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,764
My goodness. So frustrating.

41
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,393
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

42
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,857
DID YOU GO HOME?
ARE YOU HAVING FUN?

43
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:34,985
Is she home?

44
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,154
Don't look.

45
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:41,324
-Look at what?
-Not you. Just keep sleeping.

46
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:42,742
Sorry.

47
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:44,703
Do-hyeok.

48
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,540
Just take my advice,
and ask her to meet up right now.

49
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,625
You said you forgot to give her that.

50
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,586
That's a bit…

51
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,671
It's not even urgent.

52
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,009
Plus, I'm a bit tipsy.

53
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:01,178
So frustrating.

54
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:04,222
You're a decent guy,
but you're not making any bold moves.

55
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:12,647
Love is all about timing, you know.

56
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:15,692
If you keep hesitating like that,
you'll never get her.

57
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:20,822
It's because
I really don't want to lose her.

58
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:24,242
If you don't want to lose her,
then ask her to meet right now.

59
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:28,955
If you're not going to,
then just bring another bottle.

60
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,415
We're out.

61
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,293
All right.

62
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,768
I'll get going now.

63
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:51,436
Are you walking home?

64
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:55,815
Yes. I should sober up a bit.
See you tomorrow, then.

65
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,330
Why are you following me?

66
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:12,290
I'm not following you.

67
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,925
Then where are you going?

68
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,134
Your house.

69
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:25,053
-What?
-To get my stuff.

70
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:27,514
I see.

71
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,035
She won't be asleep already, will she?

72
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:10,098
-Wait out here.
-Out here?

73
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:14,019
I didn't pack everything yet.
I didn't think you'd suddenly come for it.

74
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,314
I'll pack them with you.

75
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:31,661
I can go inside, right?

76
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:33,913
Sure.

77
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,389
-Cheers.
-You have to clink glasses.

78
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:55,727
Look over there. Isn't that guy handsome?

79
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:57,771
What's with you?

80
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:02,817
Hey, slow down.
We didn't come here to drink, you know.

81
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:04,694
I came here to drink.

82
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:08,073
-You're unbelievable.
-Why did we come here then?

83
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,742
Look at that guy.

84
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:14,329
-I think the cute guys are over there.
-There are so many decent guys.

85
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,747
-Are you lonely?
-Yes.

86
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:24,506
That guy over there looks pretty cute too.

87
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,384
SHARE WITH
NAM GYU-HYUN

88
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:34,140
Hey. My friends
say they want to come here too.

89
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:35,684
Three guys. What do you think?

90
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:38,770
-That's perfect. Tell them to come.
-Okay.

91
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:41,564
Are they good-looking?

92
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:42,565
I'm leaving.

93
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,234
-What?
-Hey.

94
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:47,654
-Have fun.
-Hey!

95
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:52,242
Jeez. Call just two guys, then.

96
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:15,223
Do you like it?

97
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,392
Yes.

98
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:20,645
It's pretty.

99
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,607
You look even more pretty today.

100
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,482
<i>HUMAN ART ANATOMY FOR SCULPTORS</i>

101
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:09,194
I think that's all your stuff.

102
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:10,320
Right.

103
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:12,864
But I feel a bit disappointed.

104
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:16,785
-What do you mean?
-I thought you'd have

105
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,413
a late birthday present for me.

106
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:23,917
There's nothing like that.

107
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:26,628
If that's everything,
you should get going.

108
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,379
I'm a bit tired.

109
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:49,901
You're all better now.

110
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:52,362
Yes.

111
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:55,198
I did a good job of treating you.

112
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:16,094
Let's not make another mistake.

113
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,222
You should go.

114
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,959
Do you really think this is a mistake?

115
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,298
Of course. I'm sure you feel the same.

116
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:55,883
<i>That's a lie.</i>

117
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,306
I don't.

118
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,187
I enjoy being with you.

119
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:10,356
Are you kidding me?

120
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,028
I like your angry face too.

121
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:17,030
Is this fun to you?

122
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,533
I'm not teasing you.

123
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:26,205
Let's go out.

124
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:30,710
What?

125
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,263
Think about it and tell me.

126
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,266
Bye.

127
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:34,607
Go sleep in the bedroom.
You'll catch a cold.

128
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,609
No, I can't sleep right now.

129
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:37,902
I still have lots to do.

130
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:39,696
What?

131
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,533
What? She got in, but Na-bi got rejected?

132
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:46,452
The school Na-bi applied to
is pretty tough to get into.

133
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:47,578
Right.

134
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:50,289
I have to make all the calls
and prepare the documents.

135
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,793
I'm totally screwed.

136
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,753
I can help you make the calls tomorrow.

137
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:57,338
So go to bed.

138
00:13:57,422 --> 00:13:59,507
It's fine. You have a lot to do too.

139
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,592
I have some time tomorrow.

140
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:04,887
What?

141
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:06,639
Well…

142
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:08,808
I feel kind of embarrassed.

143
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,143
Why?

144
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:13,771
I always told you to stop poking
your nose in other people's businesses.

145
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:16,774
But it feels like
I'm getting the most benefit out of that.

146
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:20,445
That means you're thankful, right?

147
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:23,990
Well, I guess.

148
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:28,786
You're likeable.

149
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:31,414
What?

150
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:34,333
It stays near you all the time.

151
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:41,257
Oh, I guess you're right.

152
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:48,199
Let's go out.

153
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:24,569
<i>I'm not used to how I am</i>

154
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:29,699
<i>when I'm with Na-bi.</i>

155
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:48,968
Let's go out.

156
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,850
What was that, all of a sudden?

157
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,526
Did he really mean it?

158
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,502
<i>Can we meet right now?</i>

159
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:44,941
<i>I just read your message. Sorry.</i>

160
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:48,778
<i>If it's not urgent, let's meet next time.</i>

161
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,781
<i>I'm a bit tired,
so I'm going to bed early.</i>

162
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:00,998
YU NA-BI

163
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:22,537
Block him!

164
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:30,837
I guess you're not
in a good condition today.

165
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:34,215
-You seem way too tense.
-I'm not improving.

166
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:36,634
I want to be better.

167
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:40,722
Things won't work out well
if you start to get greedy.

168
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:43,058
Did I get greedy?

169
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:46,561
It's nothing bad.
You can try harder if you get greedy.

170
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:50,440
So do your best.

171
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:54,652
Come on, let's play another game.

172
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:56,780
Okay.

173
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:03,995
-Hi, Na-bi. Hi, Sol.
-Hey.

174
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,414
-Hi!
-Hi.

175
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,544
Sol.

176
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:15,048
-Sol.
-Yes?

177
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:19,219
What if someone says "Let's go out"
without even saying they like you?

178
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:21,012
It's one or the other.

179
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,182
That person's a jerk

180
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:27,936
or they thought it was unnecessary
because it's so obvious.

181
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,527
What time is your progress report?

182
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,238
Progress report?

183
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:40,990
For the exhibition.

184
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:44,119
Oh, right.

185
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,871
-When was it?
-Tomorrow.

186
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:48,915
You didn't prepare for it?

187
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:51,918
No.

188
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:53,920
What? Is something going on?

189
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:56,005
No.

190
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,677
-Hey, Ji-wan.
-What?

191
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,391
Na-bi, I'll be in the lecture room.

192
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:07,434
We can go together.

193
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:09,894
No, it's fine. See you later.

194
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:14,816
What's up with her?

195
00:20:17,277 --> 00:20:18,236
I don't know.

196
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:12,624
Nothing has changed here.

197
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,424
Hey, Do-hyeok.

198
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:25,136
Do you remember that spot?

199
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:28,014
We were playing in there

200
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:31,809
and I broke a glass cup,
and you got scolded by your grandpa.

201
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:33,186
You remember that?

202
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:34,479
Of course.

203
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:39,609
Back then, it was so fun
to hide somewhere and play.

204
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:44,531
Right. It was so exciting
when we were in elementary school.

205
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:45,698
Yes.

206
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,795
You're pretty good.

207
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,301
Make it tasty for me.

208
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:08,012
All right.

209
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:12,850
Do-hyeok!

210
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:17,814
The reactions are great.

211
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:22,277
Listening to Na-bi's advice
was a great idea.

212
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:39,544
Try tasting this.

213
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:49,929
-Why does it taste like this?
-Why? Is it bad?

214
00:22:58,354 --> 00:23:00,773
Hey. Grandson of a noodle shop owner.

215
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:03,609
What happened in Seoul?
Why are you acting like this?

216
00:23:03,693 --> 00:23:05,236
Nothing happened.

217
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:10,033
You were so excited to see Na-bi.

218
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,869
But you look like a zombie now.
Stop lying.

219
00:23:14,162 --> 00:23:16,205
Did you eventually lose to Jae-eon?

220
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:21,878
My gosh.
Just give up and find someone else.

221
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,589
You're popular, you know.

222
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,257
Can you make some noodles for me?

223
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,259
I'm hungry.

224
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,262
Make it yourself.

225
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,697
Should I just give up on everything?

226
00:24:08,591 --> 00:24:09,509
Jae-eon.

227
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:12,095
What are you making?

228
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,846
A pendant.

229
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:17,683
Then what's this?

230
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,987
Thanks.

231
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:01,853
Was it that good?

232
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:04,522
What do you mean?

233
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:05,690
The meat.

234
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:10,194
The barbecue was amazing that day,
wasn't it?

235
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:16,742
What's he going around doing these days?

236
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:18,911
He works part-time at an internet cafe.

237
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:22,582
-A part-time job?
-Yes. You didn't know?

238
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:24,542
I thought you two shared everything.

239
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:28,504
The internet cafe he works at
has a really romantic name.

240
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:31,045
-What is it?
-Perhaps Love.

241
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:37,013
Gyu-hyun,
do you want to have drinks today?

242
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:40,391
Not me.
I have gastritis, so I can't drink.

243
00:25:40,475 --> 00:25:41,851
What? Gastritis?

244
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:43,728
You're totally healthy.

245
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:46,230
Whatever!

246
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:49,317
-It must be because of stress.
-Hey, Bit-na.

247
00:25:51,777 --> 00:25:52,987
What?

248
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,198
Let's go somewhere and talk.

249
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:58,534
-Just talk here.
-It won't take long.

250
00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:03,956
What the…

251
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:19,514
What? What is it?

252
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:25,811
-Oh, this…
-Why did you order this to my house?

253
00:26:33,236 --> 00:26:35,821
I've made a grave mistake.

254
00:26:36,614 --> 00:26:38,282
Is this what you wanted to say?

255
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,201
Yes.

256
00:26:42,245 --> 00:26:43,788
All right, then.

257
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,958
Isn't that mine?

258
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,962
You gave this to me to wear last time.

259
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:52,213
Do you want it back?

260
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:54,632
No, it's fine.

261
00:26:56,968 --> 00:27:00,638
You're actually really petty, aren't you?

262
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:02,181
Just take it.

263
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:10,022
What are you doing this weekend?

264
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,440
Well…

265
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:17,196
This exhibition's opening this week.

266
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:19,198
PARK DAE-SEONG EXHIBITION

267
00:27:19,782 --> 00:27:20,783
Let's go together.

268
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,368
Together?

269
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:25,663
Yes. I'm asking you out on a date.

270
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:29,458
I like you, Sol.

271
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:32,837
I've liked you since I first met you
at the cafe.

272
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:35,798
Oh…

273
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:38,801
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

274
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:41,262
I'm not, but…

275
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:45,266
I actually have someone I like.

276
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:50,438
I see. Do you have a crush on someone?

277
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:57,653
Then did you…

278
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:01,490
I guess it's too personal. I'm sorry.

279
00:28:01,991 --> 00:28:04,702
I did tell them how I feel.

280
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,039
Because my desires kept growing.

281
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:10,916
I see.

282
00:28:13,377 --> 00:28:15,254
So you're saying

283
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:17,757
that your friend said they like you

284
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,216
and you like them back.

285
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:23,179
But you're afraid
of ruining your friendship?

286
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:27,516
Yes. If we start dating
but break up later…

287
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,187
My friend is capable and has everything,

288
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:33,940
so losing me won't be a big deal.

289
00:28:34,023 --> 00:28:35,733
But without my friend,

290
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:39,028
it'd be the same as losing half my life.

291
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:41,364
I'd be screwed.

292
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:45,660
I envy you.

293
00:28:46,243 --> 00:28:50,122
What? I'm so confused right now.
Why would you envy me?

294
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:52,166
Your friend's your other half.

295
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:56,003
That means you're both
so sure about your feelings.

296
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,298
That's a great thing.

297
00:28:59,382 --> 00:29:00,758
Still…

298
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:04,387
Plus, from my experience…

299
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,305
I mean,

300
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:10,601
what I think is that you two
can't go back to the way things were.

301
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:13,729
Unless you both lose your memories,

302
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:15,940
you'll never be able
to just be friends again.

303
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:20,903
Please stop stating cold hard facts.

304
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:25,700
So don't suffer like this all by yourself
and talk to your friend.

305
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:27,076
Who knows?

306
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:29,578
That friend
might be thinking the same thing.

307
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:35,876
I'm scared to tell them though.

308
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:39,422
I know how that feels.

309
00:29:57,356 --> 00:29:59,400
EXCHANGE PROGRAM APPLICATION RESULTS

310
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:04,113
YU NA-BI
REJECTED

311
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:18,586
It doesn't seem that bad,

312
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:21,797
but it's not as good as I expected.

313
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:29,013
Don't you have two assistants?
Where's the other one?

314
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:32,725
Jin-su is at his part-time job right now.

315
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:34,894
Are you getting a lot of help from them?

316
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:41,067
Yes, they're helping out a lot.

317
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,943
We have meetings often too.

318
00:30:46,155 --> 00:30:47,031
Is that so?

319
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:54,872
I thought you two
would make a great piece together.

320
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:58,793
I guess you two haven't
figured out each other's strong points.

321
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:05,382
Na-bi. I've told you this
many times before.

322
00:31:06,383 --> 00:31:07,635
You really have talent,

323
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:11,931
but I can't feel your emotion
in your works.

324
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:14,809
It's not just about finishing your piece.

325
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:16,769
You have to inspire other people.

326
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:21,023
Pieces that receive compliments and
ones that attract attention are different.

327
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:23,984
Right.

328
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:28,072
Are you passionate about this piece?
Do you really care about it?

329
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:31,075
Of course.

330
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,163
I'm sure you'd feel upset
about me saying this when you tried hard.

331
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:39,375
You may think it's nonsense,
but it's because I know you can do better.

332
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:42,795
I really think you can make
an amazing piece with just a bit more.

333
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:51,303
I wanted you to learn that from Jae-eon.

334
00:31:58,644 --> 00:31:59,895
I'll do my best.

335
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:05,317
Let me see yours, Geon-ung.

336
00:32:12,116 --> 00:32:17,454
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK TRIPE

337
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:39,685
Here you go.

338
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:50,154
This tastes amazing.

339
00:32:53,574 --> 00:32:55,242
How was the critique?

340
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:58,537
Awful.

341
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,957
Come on. Everybody gets criticized
by that professor.

342
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:06,253
Except for Jae-eon, I guess.

343
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:08,756
Aren't you busy?

344
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,674
I am,

345
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,762
but I should take good care of you guys.

346
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:16,889
This and this…

347
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:22,770
Isn't it good?

348
00:33:23,354 --> 00:33:24,647
It is.

349
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:30,694
I'm sorry for not being able to make it.
I'll get you a lot of freebies.

350
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:33,489
It's fine. Thanks.

351
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,075
Enjoy your food.

352
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:38,911
This is pretty good.

353
00:33:39,536 --> 00:33:42,039
I promise I won't miss anything
or be late next time.

354
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:48,963
This must be about Gyu-hyun.

355
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:50,589
What? Let me see.

356
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:53,926
"I heard he's a Sculpture major.

357
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:56,387
He's totally my style.

358
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,430
I'm going to the internet cafe every day.

359
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,392
Please give me 22 extra minutes
as a sign, if you like me too."

360
00:34:01,892 --> 00:34:03,894
This is Gyu-hyun for sure!

361
00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:07,356
"Handsome"?
Are you kidding me? Is that it?

362
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:08,482
Yes.

363
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,280
What is this?

364
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:18,534
What? There are more female customers now?

365
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:21,745
YOU'VE PASSED THE FIRST SCREENING TEST

366
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:26,458
I passed! I can't believe it!

367
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:28,502
Oh, my gosh.

368
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:33,757
I acted like I got the job already.

369
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:35,759
I just passed the first test.

370
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:39,388
Come on. That's a huge achievement.

371
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:41,515
Then you should prepare
for the interview now.

372
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:44,435
Good luck!

373
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:26,060
<i>The ocean is so pretty, Do-hyeok.</i>

374
00:35:26,143 --> 00:35:27,394
I miss you.

375
00:35:40,824 --> 00:35:42,159
<i>I saw the new video.</i>

376
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:43,702
<i>It's great.</i>

377
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:50,042
Emotions…

378
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,177
Emotions…

379
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:09,770
How do I portray my emotions?

380
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:31,708
Hey, Do-hyeok.

381
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:36,880
<i>Can you talk right now?
I don't want to bother you.</i>

382
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:40,592
No, it's fine. I was spacing out
because the critique went badly.

383
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:42,928
<i>-Critique?</i>
-Our professor

384
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:45,597
evaluates and critiques our works.

385
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,102
I got scolded.

386
00:36:51,395 --> 00:36:53,188
This semester really is the worst.

387
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:57,776
I didn't get accepted
to the exchange program either.

388
00:36:58,402 --> 00:36:59,695
<i>Oh…</i>

389
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:22,092
<i>Is something going on?</i>

390
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:24,094
No.

391
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:27,097
Nothing.

392
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:29,433
Let's not make another mistake.

393
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:33,312
<i>Maybe Na-bi was already</i>

394
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:36,607
<i>drifting away from me.</i>

395
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:51,413
<i>That's too bad.</i>

396
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:54,458
<i>That school has a bad eye for talent.</i>

397
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:59,087
<i>I'm going to Seoul soon. Can we meet up?</i>

398
00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:02,549
Of course. When are you coming?

399
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:03,884
<i>It's not decided yet.</i>

400
00:38:06,178 --> 00:38:09,973
I guess you're feeling bothered
by what I said.

401
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:13,477
Are you trying to cheer me up?

402
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:17,856
Na-bi. You're already doing so well.

403
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:21,318
So don't let that discourage you.

404
00:38:23,862 --> 00:38:25,155
Thanks.

405
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,990
You know I'm your greatest fan, right?

406
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,659
Make use of me all you want.

407
00:38:29,993 --> 00:38:32,996
You can call me whenever
you need something to cheer you up.

408
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,291
I'll rush right over.

409
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:38,502
<i>Thanks for saying that.</i>

410
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:40,337
I feel a bit better.

411
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:45,050
Anyway, I'll call you again later.

412
00:38:45,842 --> 00:38:46,718
Bye.

413
00:38:54,518 --> 00:38:56,228
Did I go overboard?

414
00:38:57,271 --> 00:38:58,480
I'm getting married.

415
00:38:59,189 --> 00:39:00,774
What? You're getting married?

416
00:39:01,483 --> 00:39:02,734
Why are you so startled?

417
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:04,486
When will you get married?

418
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,154
The beginning of next year?

419
00:39:06,238 --> 00:39:08,240
I feel like we'd break up if we don't.

420
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:10,659
It's already been over five years.

421
00:39:11,243 --> 00:39:13,287
And we've been working
for three years now.

422
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:15,497
I wanted some change in my life.

423
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:17,708
It's like a turning point
in our relationship.

424
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,547
A turning point in a relationship…

425
00:39:32,347 --> 00:39:33,265
Sol.

426
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:37,644
-Yes?
-If I say

427
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:40,230
that I don't like you

428
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:43,567
in that way…

429
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,946
Then what will happen to us?

430
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:54,786
Then I'll keep liking you

431
00:39:55,412 --> 00:39:57,164
like I do now,

432
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:01,418
and you won't return my feelings.

433
00:40:03,962 --> 00:40:06,298
And if I say I do like you?

434
00:40:07,716 --> 00:40:08,717
What?

435
00:40:11,553 --> 00:40:14,014
Then we'll break up someday.

436
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:20,145
But I don't want us
to stay like this, either.

437
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:33,992
Is that what was troubling you?

438
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:36,912
What do we do?

439
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:45,796
Seo Ji-wan.

440
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,007
My feelings will never change.

441
00:40:55,347 --> 00:40:56,348
So…

442
00:40:58,016 --> 00:40:59,309
don't worry.

443
00:41:26,336 --> 00:41:27,504
Are you done?

444
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:30,674
Yes. I'm going to head home now.

445
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:33,802
Let's go. I'll take you home.

446
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:35,887
It's fine. It's not far.

447
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:39,266
I was waiting all this time
to go with you.

448
00:41:41,017 --> 00:41:43,603
I heard you stayed up all night.
You must be tired.

449
00:41:58,994 --> 00:42:01,496
Thanks for the ride. I'll get going.

450
00:42:03,457 --> 00:42:04,583
Wait.

451
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:15,385
A present.

452
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:31,818
Did you make this?

453
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:34,321
Yes, while I was working on my pieces.

454
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:36,406
It's pretty.

455
00:42:37,657 --> 00:42:39,326
You could actually sell this.

456
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:43,955
Why are things so funny when you say them?

457
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,461
Go inside. And get some sleep.

458
00:42:51,713 --> 00:42:53,673
I will. Thanks.

459
00:43:36,758 --> 00:43:39,427
INTERNET CAFE PART-TIMER
THE PART-TIMER AT PERHAPS LOVE IS HOT

460
00:43:41,388 --> 00:43:42,681
Hey, Bit-na!

461
00:43:44,015 --> 00:43:45,976
Hey, my trainer! Long time no see.

462
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:47,894
Why aren't you coming to our gym?

463
00:43:47,978 --> 00:43:50,564
I've been feeling lazy these days.

464
00:43:50,647 --> 00:43:52,732
But I still have my muscles.
Check them out.

465
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:55,485
Your biceps! Okay.

466
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:57,362
Are you meeting someone?

467
00:43:57,445 --> 00:43:59,447
No, I'm going home. I live nearby.

468
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:00,574
Oh, I see.

469
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:06,872
Since we haven't met in a while,
how about we go play some games?

470
00:44:06,955 --> 00:44:08,456
Games? That sounds nice.

471
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,543
Right? I know a place around here.

472
00:44:22,637 --> 00:44:23,555
Welcome.

473
00:44:27,058 --> 00:44:29,728
-This place looks nice.
-Right?

474
00:44:33,857 --> 00:44:35,233
Sit anywhere you'd like.

475
00:44:36,943 --> 00:44:38,028
Pardon?

476
00:44:39,696 --> 00:44:41,114
I'm Choi Jin-woo.

477
00:44:41,197 --> 00:44:43,491
Right. I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

478
00:44:43,575 --> 00:44:44,909
It's nice to meet you.

479
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:48,496
GKC Entertainment was very impressed
by your social media.

480
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,790
Thank you.

481
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:53,418
And…

482
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:56,171
this is an exclusive contract.

483
00:44:56,254 --> 00:44:57,756
Read through it.

484
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,424
All right.

485
00:45:03,595 --> 00:45:05,597
Sorry, but I have to take this call.

486
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,849
-Sure.
-Take your time.

487
00:45:22,405 --> 00:45:24,616
<i>Okay. I'll see you there later.</i>

488
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,912
I'll see you later…

489
00:45:57,065 --> 00:46:00,443
When's your flight? I'll drive you there.

490
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:03,613
No, I want to go alone.
I just came to say goodbye.

491
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,281
Let me take you.

492
00:46:07,409 --> 00:46:10,245
It's fine. I don't want
that kind of vague generosity from you.

493
00:46:11,037 --> 00:46:12,497
I don't want to get swayed.

494
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,210
I've decided not to pretend anymore.

495
00:46:17,293 --> 00:46:21,423
They say that you can't act indifferent
if you really like someone.

496
00:46:21,923 --> 00:46:23,717
I've realized that it's true.

497
00:46:25,552 --> 00:46:26,720
Sorry.

498
00:46:28,972 --> 00:46:30,348
It pays off to be honest.

499
00:46:30,932 --> 00:46:32,350
You're actually apologizing.

500
00:46:35,478 --> 00:46:37,647
I'll contact you if I go to the States.

501
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:39,190
We can meet up.

502
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:42,736
No.

503
00:46:44,779 --> 00:46:47,407
I'm not going to see you anymore.

504
00:46:50,118 --> 00:46:52,078
Having no relationship with you at all

505
00:46:52,662 --> 00:46:54,622
is better than being
by your side like this.

506
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:04,758
Give me a last goodbye hug.

507
00:47:16,478 --> 00:47:17,312
Bye.

508
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:51,930
Nice.

509
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:54,516
Thanks.

510
00:47:57,018 --> 00:47:58,228
Is it not going well?

511
00:48:02,273 --> 00:48:04,025
I should keep working on it,

512
00:48:05,401 --> 00:48:07,111
but my head feels blocked.

513
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,700
But you know,
some things just work out suddenly

514
00:48:13,201 --> 00:48:15,995
even when you think there's no hope.

515
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:19,374
I guess something good is going on.

516
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,501
What?

517
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,963
No, nothing's going on.

518
00:48:28,466 --> 00:48:29,551
I'm happy for you, Sol.

519
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:33,596
Jeez, Seo Ji-wan.

520
00:48:36,391 --> 00:48:38,685
Ji-wan didn't tell me directly.

521
00:48:39,602 --> 00:48:40,895
I just realized it myself.

522
00:48:41,479 --> 00:48:44,315
I'm sure she was being really obvious.

523
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:46,025
You were more obvious, you know.

524
00:48:48,152 --> 00:48:50,989
I didn't think I'd be like this.

525
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:57,036
Ji-wan said you're an excellent counselor.

526
00:48:58,037 --> 00:49:00,081
It's easy to give advice to others,

527
00:49:01,749 --> 00:49:03,209
but I can't do anything myself.

528
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:07,755
-Is it really over with you and Jae-eon?
-What?

529
00:49:09,465 --> 00:49:11,885
I thought you two made a good couple.

530
00:49:13,344 --> 00:49:14,470
Why?

531
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,807
Well, it's just…

532
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:22,103
Getting attracted to each other like that
already makes it special.

533
00:49:25,773 --> 00:49:27,108
It's a miracle.

534
00:49:28,776 --> 00:49:31,863
A miracle? That's what I'd say
about you and Ji-wan.

535
00:49:31,946 --> 00:49:33,781
It's nothing different.

536
00:49:33,865 --> 00:49:36,284
It's totally different for us.

537
00:49:39,954 --> 00:49:44,334
Maybe it was all wrong from the beginning.

538
00:49:45,168 --> 00:49:46,961
It just feels that way.

539
00:49:56,137 --> 00:49:57,639
I can't find a solution.

540
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,436
Maybe the problem
is that you're trying to find one.

541
00:50:14,906 --> 00:50:17,158
<i>Excuse me. Why isn't my food coming?</i>

542
00:50:17,992 --> 00:50:19,535
<i>Who's going to eat it?</i>

543
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:20,995
What's he on about?

544
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:23,998
<i>It's all for me.</i>

545
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:26,834
<i>My friend's on a strict diet,
so he only eats chicken breast.</i>

546
00:50:28,378 --> 00:50:31,631
<i>Well, that's a relief.
I didn't place your order yet.</i>

547
00:50:31,714 --> 00:50:33,132
What?

548
00:50:33,216 --> 00:50:35,093
You asshole.

549
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:40,723
You're not picking up?

550
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:45,186
What? Where did he go?

551
00:50:51,484 --> 00:50:53,111
OH MY SUNSHINE

552
00:50:58,992 --> 00:51:00,118
What is it?

553
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:01,619
Why wasn't my order placed?

554
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:03,496
I've been waiting so long for my food.

555
00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:06,207
You shouldn't eat stuff like that.
You have gastritis.

556
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,667
It'll ruin your stomach.

557
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,293
You and your nagging.

558
00:51:09,377 --> 00:51:11,504
You'll get fired
if you keep working like this.

559
00:51:11,587 --> 00:51:13,589
What's it to you
whether I get fired or not?

560
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:16,259
Then what's it to you
whether my stomach hurts or not?

561
00:51:16,342 --> 00:51:17,468
Who are you to nag me?

562
00:51:21,305 --> 00:51:22,265
I'm your friend.

563
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:26,686
Friends can worry
about each other's health.

564
00:51:33,192 --> 00:51:35,695
What's gotten into you?
Why are you smiling like that?

565
00:51:39,615 --> 00:51:41,367
"Oh My Sunshine"? That's so childish.

566
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:44,078
What are you on about? Where's my phone?

567
00:51:44,662 --> 00:51:45,538
I already saw it.

568
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:48,374
Hey, you shouldn't snoop.

569
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:53,296
It didn't mean anything. I only wrote that
because your name means "shine."

570
00:51:53,379 --> 00:51:56,299
I just wrote your name in English.
Oh Sunshine.

571
00:51:56,883 --> 00:51:59,343
Never mind that.
When do you get off work today?

572
00:51:59,427 --> 00:52:00,428
What?

573
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:02,263
Let's go on a date.

574
00:52:04,182 --> 00:52:05,892
This looks delicious.

575
00:52:06,434 --> 00:52:07,727
Why isn't Jae-eon coming?

576
00:52:09,437 --> 00:52:13,107
Hang on. Let's eat these
before he comes. Ta-da!

577
00:52:15,526 --> 00:52:17,153
I'm only giving that to you.

578
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:19,072
Thanks.

579
00:52:19,155 --> 00:52:20,907
You know how much I like you, right?

580
00:52:27,705 --> 00:52:31,167
You were always late to our meetings,
but you came early today.

581
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,377
Come on. Don't be so harsh.

582
00:52:33,878 --> 00:52:36,756
I'm already anxious
because Jae-eon's working so hard.

583
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:40,885
You know, he's doing glass projects
because of your piece.

584
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:44,180
I'm getting suspicious.

585
00:52:44,263 --> 00:52:47,100
There's something going on
between you two, right?

586
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:50,061
Stop that nonsense. Just eat up.

587
00:52:50,144 --> 00:52:54,315
If it's not Jae-eon,
then is it that noodle shop guy?

588
00:52:54,899 --> 00:52:56,901
Ever since our workshop,

589
00:52:56,984 --> 00:53:00,404
we've been saying there's a higher chance
of you dating him. Is that right?

590
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:04,534
-What?
-Come on. Tell me.

591
00:53:05,243 --> 00:53:07,662
I swear I won't tell anyone else.

592
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:11,290
Why should I tell you?

593
00:53:13,584 --> 00:53:17,004
Jeez. Why are you suddenly
getting so upset?

594
00:53:17,713 --> 00:53:19,048
Hey, Jae-eon.

595
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:22,677
-What took you so long?
-Sorry.

596
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:27,181
Since you're here now, let's drink.

597
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:29,016
Here you go.

598
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,186
You too. Here.

599
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,279
Cheers!

600
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:56,085
The weather is pretty nice.

601
00:54:00,131 --> 00:54:01,632
Oh, right!

602
00:54:08,264 --> 00:54:11,976
This is what I ordered
to your house last time.

603
00:54:12,977 --> 00:54:14,312
They're matching keyrings.

604
00:54:14,854 --> 00:54:17,398
It's like a heart lock and key.

605
00:54:17,899 --> 00:54:20,026
I got these
because they're a limited edition.

606
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:22,612
I had no idea we would break up
before I gave it to you.

607
00:54:24,822 --> 00:54:25,907
Aren't they pretty?

608
00:54:27,783 --> 00:54:29,368
Yes. They're pretty.

609
00:54:32,455 --> 00:54:36,042
So what's going to happen between us now?

610
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,585
-Us?
-Yes.

611
00:54:40,546 --> 00:54:41,672
Well…

612
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:43,758
I…

613
00:54:44,675 --> 00:54:47,678
Do I have to say this out loud?

614
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:49,722
You need to talk for me to understand.

615
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:56,270
Give me your hand.

616
00:55:00,274 --> 00:55:02,443
Let's start dating again.

617
00:55:03,277 --> 00:55:06,781
Be my boyfriend again.
I'll really be good to you.

618
00:55:08,115 --> 00:55:10,743
It was all my fault.
I promise I won't do that again.

619
00:55:10,826 --> 00:55:13,246
I'll do my best. I'll change.

620
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:16,540
Can't you be serious for a single second?

621
00:55:16,624 --> 00:55:20,336
Hey. You're always serious.
If I become serious too,

622
00:55:20,419 --> 00:55:22,797
then there won't be
any chemistry between us.

623
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,008
-You're right.
-Right?

624
00:55:29,303 --> 00:55:30,304
What…

625
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:38,479
-Thank you.
-Thank you too.

626
00:55:42,692 --> 00:55:44,777
I missed this smell.

627
00:55:48,364 --> 00:55:49,240
Are you a pervert?

628
00:55:49,323 --> 00:55:51,826
How can you say that to your sunshine?

629
00:55:54,495 --> 00:55:56,080
I missed you too.

630
00:55:57,331 --> 00:55:59,166
Let's go on a lot of dates from now on.

631
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,544
We can go to theaters, amusement parks,

632
00:56:01,627 --> 00:56:03,087
beaches, and mountains.

633
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,130
All right.

634
00:56:05,423 --> 00:56:08,801
I'll try being abstinent just for you.

635
00:56:08,884 --> 00:56:11,137
What? Abstinent?

636
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,264
I'll do my best. I mean it.

637
00:56:13,347 --> 00:56:16,017
You don't need to go that far. I mean…

638
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:20,396
I'm a man, you know, and…

639
00:56:22,148 --> 00:56:23,357
I like it too.

640
00:56:23,941 --> 00:56:26,319
You like what? Be more specific.

641
00:56:29,572 --> 00:56:31,657
Do I really have to say that out loud?

642
00:56:31,741 --> 00:56:33,367
You just said I needed to!

643
00:56:33,451 --> 00:56:35,870
You're not sticking to your word.

644
00:56:35,953 --> 00:56:37,455
-No…
-What do you mean?

645
00:56:37,538 --> 00:56:38,581
You know what I mean.

646
00:56:38,664 --> 00:56:41,334
How would I know?
Hey, don't talk like that.

647
00:56:44,337 --> 00:56:45,379
What?

648
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,507
Are you calling me small? I'm pretty tall!

649
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,773
Don't worry, Mom.

650
00:57:05,149 --> 00:57:08,611
All right. Tell Dad I'll call him later.

651
00:57:08,694 --> 00:57:10,029
I should really get going.

652
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:12,448
I'll call you when I arrive.

653
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:45,898
Hey, Do-hyeok.

654
00:57:47,066 --> 00:57:48,651
Yes, I'm heading out now.

655
00:57:48,734 --> 00:57:51,320
No, you don't need to come.
I can just take a cab.

656
00:57:51,987 --> 00:57:54,699
Okay. I'll be there soon.

657
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:09,922
Do-hyeok!

658
00:58:10,589 --> 00:58:12,299
-Hey.
-I brought coffee…

659
00:58:24,145 --> 00:58:25,146
Oh, right.

660
00:58:29,692 --> 00:58:32,069
-What's this?
-I got them printed.

661
00:58:32,653 --> 00:58:33,821
-The photos?
-Yes.

662
00:58:34,947 --> 00:58:36,240
Gosh!

663
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:39,660
I can't believe
you got them printed like this.

664
00:58:43,873 --> 00:58:45,541
You're really good at taking photos.

665
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:46,959
How about cooking?

666
00:58:47,543 --> 00:58:49,253
Your cooking is a bit…

667
00:58:54,216 --> 00:58:56,719
The weather was amazing.

668
00:58:57,303 --> 00:58:58,596
And here.

669
00:58:59,764 --> 00:59:01,932
-What's this?
-It's going to rain later.

670
00:59:03,184 --> 00:59:04,393
-Today?
-Yes.

671
00:59:06,228 --> 00:59:08,689
It doesn't look like it'll rain at all.

672
00:59:08,773 --> 00:59:11,400
Use that if it rains. I have another one.

673
00:59:13,652 --> 00:59:15,070
All right. Thanks.

674
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,868
So did the meeting go well?

675
00:59:20,951 --> 00:59:22,578
Yes. It was okay.

676
00:59:22,661 --> 00:59:25,790
We're meeting again
after revising the contract a little.

677
00:59:26,499 --> 00:59:27,708
A contract?

678
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:30,461
Then you're going to have an agency?

679
00:59:30,544 --> 00:59:32,880
I don't know much about it yet, though.

680
00:59:34,381 --> 00:59:37,468
Your new video got a lot of views too.

681
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:39,261
It's all thanks to you.

682
00:59:39,887 --> 00:59:41,013
Thanks.

683
00:59:41,096 --> 00:59:44,058
I told you, it's not me. It's all you.

684
00:59:44,141 --> 00:59:47,269
I only thought of doing it
since you gave me all that advice.

685
00:59:47,353 --> 00:59:48,437
That's why.

686
00:59:53,192 --> 00:59:56,111
Thanks for saying that.

687
01:00:00,282 --> 01:00:02,535
The day we met at your school,

688
01:00:03,118 --> 01:00:07,039
I went to your house at night
to give you the photos.

689
01:00:07,665 --> 01:00:11,085
Oh, really? Why didn't you say anything?

690
01:00:11,168 --> 01:00:13,170
I saw you and Jae-eon

691
01:00:14,296 --> 01:00:16,715
going into your house together.

692
01:00:21,804 --> 01:00:24,932
I know I said I could wait for you
as long as it takes.

693
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:30,604
But I felt so jealous.

694
01:00:36,443 --> 01:00:37,403
Do-hyeok.

695
01:00:38,195 --> 01:00:42,616
Na-bi. I really wish you were happy.

696
01:00:44,243 --> 01:00:45,786
But Park Jae-eon…

697
01:00:52,459 --> 01:00:57,548
Have you felt, even once,
that he sincerely likes you?

698
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:20,965
Jae-eon?

699
01:02:21,548 --> 01:02:22,508
Why are you here?

700
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,761
Hey.

701
01:02:26,762 --> 01:02:28,681
Why are you home so late?

702
01:02:28,764 --> 01:02:30,683
Were you with Do-hyeok this whole time?

703
01:02:31,266 --> 01:02:32,768
Are you drunk?

704
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:34,812
And it's none of your business.

705
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:37,147
How cold.

706
01:02:38,315 --> 01:02:42,403
Am I boring to you
since you have someone else now?

707
01:02:43,487 --> 01:02:45,656
Let's talk again when you're sober.

708
01:02:52,371 --> 01:02:56,417
Does he still like you
even after seeing us

709
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,584
entering your house?

710
01:02:59,044 --> 01:03:00,212
What?

711
01:03:01,547 --> 01:03:02,506
Incredible.

712
01:03:03,007 --> 01:03:06,051
Is that why you choose him instead of me?

713
01:03:09,763 --> 01:03:12,266
You knew that Do-hyeok was here that day?

714
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:13,976
Did you know too?

715
01:03:16,437 --> 01:03:19,148
So you're saying
you saw Do-hyeok here that day?

716
01:03:19,732 --> 01:03:20,774
Yes.

717
01:03:22,317 --> 01:03:24,403
You should have seen his face.

718
01:03:24,486 --> 01:03:26,530
It seemed like he'd burst into tears.

719
01:03:26,613 --> 01:03:28,407
Why didn't you tell me?

720
01:03:28,991 --> 01:03:30,159
Why would I do that?

721
01:03:31,035 --> 01:03:34,788
Oh, right. You said
you didn't want to disappoint him.

722
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,251
Then should I have told you
to explain things to him?

723
01:03:39,334 --> 01:03:42,963
But it's true
that we had a relationship like that.

724
01:03:48,594 --> 01:03:49,803
Have you lost your mind?

725
01:03:49,887 --> 01:03:51,430
You shouldn't get angry at me.

726
01:03:51,513 --> 01:03:54,016
I'm just telling the truth like you did.

727
01:04:06,111 --> 01:04:08,947
Is that why you asked me out?

728
01:04:09,531 --> 01:04:10,991
Isn't that what you wanted?

729
01:04:14,161 --> 01:04:17,915
Oh, I guess
that's not what you wanted from me.

730
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:20,793
And you say you really like me?

731
01:04:21,376 --> 01:04:22,252
That's nonsense.

732
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:24,421
What about you?
Why did you say that to Seol-a?

733
01:04:24,505 --> 01:04:27,257
Was that just to screw me over?
It wasn't, right?

734
01:04:27,341 --> 01:04:30,719
It was. I just did that to screw you over.

735
01:04:30,803 --> 01:04:33,180
You were leading me on
but saying I was a friend,

736
01:04:33,263 --> 01:04:36,725
then I found out you had a girlfriend.
I did it because you were a jerk.

737
01:04:37,392 --> 01:04:38,352
Hey.

738
01:04:39,311 --> 01:04:40,771
So am I the only jerk here?

739
01:04:42,189 --> 01:04:43,023
Do you regret it?

740
01:04:45,192 --> 01:04:46,318
Do you regret

741
01:04:47,778 --> 01:04:48,821
what we did?

742
01:04:53,408 --> 01:04:54,368
Yes.

743
01:04:56,161 --> 01:04:57,246
I regret it.

744
01:05:00,374 --> 01:05:03,836
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we did.

745
01:05:05,963 --> 01:05:07,798
But I won't blame you.

746
01:05:08,674 --> 01:05:09,800
I brought it on myself.

747
01:05:11,301 --> 01:05:14,721
I knew there was no happy ending for us,

748
01:05:14,805 --> 01:05:18,684
but I was an idiot for getting my hopes up
and thinking you could be sincere.

749
01:05:22,187 --> 01:05:25,274
You told me that I had
the right to decide our relationship.

750
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:30,362
I don't want to see you ever again.

751
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,451
<i>I lost</i>

752
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:02,704
<i>Na-bi…</i>

753
01:07:04,164 --> 01:07:05,165
<i>for good.</i>

754
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:10,017
NEVERTHELESS,

756
01:07:50,961 --> 01:07:52,671
<i>Hey, Na-bi!</i>

757
01:07:52,754 --> 01:07:55,674
<i>It feels like I'm having terrible,
recurring nightmares.</i>

758
01:07:55,757 --> 01:07:57,259
Let's fix this.

759
01:07:57,342 --> 01:07:59,594
<i>You look the happiest
when you're working on your pieces.</i>

760
01:07:59,678 --> 01:08:00,595
And the prettiest.

761
01:08:01,179 --> 01:08:03,515
<i>-I'm excited to see it.
-But can you come?</i>

762
01:08:03,598 --> 01:08:05,058
<i>Don't strain yourself.</i>

763
01:08:05,142 --> 01:08:07,936
No, I have to make it.
It's your exhibition.

764
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:13,108
<i>How can I define the feelings
I have left for Jae-eon?</i>

765
01:08:13,191 --> 01:08:14,901
<i>-Na-bi.
-If you decided to be a jerk,</i>

766
01:08:14,985 --> 01:08:16,653
<i>you should've stayed that way.
Why are you here like this?</i>

767
01:08:16,737 --> 01:08:18,238
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

768
01:08:18,322 --> 01:08:20,449
<i>I'll stay away from you. I promise.</i>

769
01:08:20,532 --> 01:08:24,703
<i>Lingering affection? Regret? Hate? Or…</i>

770
01:08:24,786 --> 01:08:26,705
Do I still have a chance with you?

771
01:08:27,456 --> 01:08:28,498
Please accept this.
