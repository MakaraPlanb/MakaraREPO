1
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:59,434
GYMNASIUM

2
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,978
Go.

3
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,251
I always

4
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,171
feel satisfied with a moderate distance

5
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,131
in a relationship.

6
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,883
What? You get to dance with girls?

7
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,260
I should have taken that class.

8
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,097
Look at all those guys without partners.

9
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,058
They're all guys like you.

10
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,531
He seems to have a crush on Na-bi.

11
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,243
I bet he'll ask her out
on the last day of class.

12
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,828
Let's go.

13
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,044
We didn't make any mistakes!
I did good, right? Did you see?

14
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,339
We're getting an A+ for sure. Let's go!

15
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,313
You danced pretty well.

16
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,859
-Did you see?
-Yes. I saw it when I was passing by.

17
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,029
I knew you'd be a good dancer.

18
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,365
I never stepped on my partner's foot.

19
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,326
-Thanks.
-Is that it?

20
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,162
I'll buy you a meal.

21
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,038
All right.

22
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,794
Did you stay up all night?

23
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,380
You're overworking yourself.

24
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,716
I've gotten a grip on myself
thanks to you.

25
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,968
You told me to be sincere.

26
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,931
I was only talking about dating.

27
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,977
I tried applying lacquer on glass,
but I screwed up.

28
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,771
It just keeps falling off.

29
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:14,485
-Isn't there a way to do this?
-You should make the surface rough.

30
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,862
How do you know that?

31
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,199
My aunt does pottery.
I learned some from her.

32
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,746
I want to learn, too.

33
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,123
I tried baking glass with glaze on it,

34
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,834
and the color came out different
each time. It was cool.

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,463
I'll teach you.

36
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,715
I'll be better at it than you.

37
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,845
A distance that's close enough
yet not too close

38
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,222
to hurt each other.

39
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,432
-Isn't it good?
-No.

40
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,642
It's bad?

41
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,270
Isn't it pretty?

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,154
EPISODE 6: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS LOVE.
NEVERTHELESS,

43
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:03,326
But are you really just friends with him?

44
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,247
Yes. We're just friends.

45
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,873
That's a relief.

46
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,668
I thought maybe I said something
I shouldn't have.

47
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,220
You should just keep your hair that way.

48
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,680
What?

49
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,473
Jae-eon…

50
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,434
likes doing it with your hair tied.

51
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,421
Everyone, take a look at what I gave you.

52
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,048
There's a list of commonly used colors

53
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,844
and the image and keywords

54
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,639
that people associate with those colors.

55
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,184
Even if it's the same color,
the associated images

56
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,146
could be the exact opposite.

57
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,233
And some are different
according to the culture or country.

58
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,696
And of course, it could be different
for each individual.

59
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,072
Good work today.

60
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,700
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

61
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,912
It's finally over!

62
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,040
-Is this it?
-Give me my bag.

63
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,835
Did anyone see Na-bi today?

64
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,629
Na-bi? I haven't seen her.

65
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,214
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

66
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,508
-What about you?
-She ignored my message.

67
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,720
-Did she not contact you either?
-No.

68
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,263
Is something wrong?

69
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,140
She's not answering her phone, either.

70
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,060
I'm sure
she just felt like skipping class today.

71
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,227
Na-bi isn't like you.

72
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,022
We'll be off. See you tomorrow!

73
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,356
-Good work today.
-Bye.

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,317
Hey, where are you going? Wait for me.

75
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,152
-Bye.
-We're eating lunch.

76
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,613
-I'll be back after lunch.
-Hey!

77
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,822
How about tteokbokki?

78
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,783
Do you want to eat tteokbokki?

79
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,285
-Sure.
-Did you bring your wallet?

80
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,454
My treat.

81
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,830
All right.

82
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,501
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

83
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:27,280
NOODLE SHOP

84
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,766
I'm worried.

85
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,895
About what?

86
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,772
Na-bi. I can't get in touch with her.

87
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,567
Really?

88
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,694
She must have been shocked.

89
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,739
-What?
-It's nothing.

90
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,740
She's attractive.

91
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,535
You only saw her for a minute,
and you felt that?

92
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,204
I could see why you fell for her.

93
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,830
What are you talking about?

94
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,708
It's not like that.

95
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,836
I broke up with Chris.

96
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:25,922
Why?

97
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,844
You're actually asking me why?

98
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,099
He said he thought he would be okay

99
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,936
with me seeing other guys, but he wasn't.

100
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,232
But I think I can understand
how that feels now.

101
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,985
So that's it?

102
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,155
Yes. I just let him go.

103
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,616
I did good, right?

104
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,248
What? That's what you hate the most.

105
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,833
Getting clingy.

106
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,340
Ms. Yun Seol-a. This way, please.

107
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,844
You can go if you're busy.

108
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,596
It's fine. Go on.

109
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,655
WHERE ARE YOU?

110
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,659
YU NA-BI

111
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:46,377
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please try again later…

112
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,946
She disappeared.

113
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,875
Thank you!

114
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,793
Yu Na-bi!

115
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,629
Auntie!

116
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,968
Oh, my.

117
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,013
It's so nice to see you.

118
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,850
-Right, Auntie.
-Yes?

119
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,561
Don't tell my mom I'm here, okay?

120
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,563
Are you involved in some crime?

121
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,317
It's nothing like that.

122
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,902
Then it's fine.

123
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,029
How long are you staying?

124
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,282
About a week?

125
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,409
That long?

126
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,538
What? You don't want me to stay?

127
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,998
It's not that.

128
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,710
I'll clean the house.

129
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,713
All right. Let's take care
of all the household chores

130
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,299
that I've been putting off all this time.

131
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,635
Okay. I'll do my best.

132
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,564
POTTERY WORKSHOP

133
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,778
This feels so great.

134
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,697
-The weather's so nice.
-It is.

135
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,575
Oh, right. I saw Do-hyeok at the market.

136
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,660
He grew up so well.

137
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,246
Do-hyeok came, too?

138
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,917
When you headed back to Seoul
when you were little,

139
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,338
all the other kids came to see you off
but Do-hyeok didn't come.

140
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,256
That's right.

141
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:59,802
You were crying and whining about it
the whole way there.

142
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,929
No way. I didn't cry.

143
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,266
You did. You two were so close.

144
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,144
Right.

145
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,980
I did like Do-hyeok a lot.

146
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,941
-You liked him the most.
-Come on, it wasn't like that.

147
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,193
-Yes, it was.
-No!

148
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,532
-Give it to me.
-No, I can carry it.

149
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,119
-We're going to your workshop, right?
-Yes. Let's go.

150
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,873
Let's go!

151
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,334
-Come down after you unpack.
-Okay.

152
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,336
-See you later!
-See you later.

153
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,261
You're so cute.

154
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,597
-What are you on about?
-You're so adorable.

155
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,099
-Let's eat.
-No.

156
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,520
-No!
-We don't have time.

157
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,774
But…

158
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,944
don't you think
we should tell the others now?

159
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,987
-Tell them what?
-That we're dating.

160
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,950
Why? It's not like we're getting married.

161
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,910
I want to tell them, though.

162
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,745
Why should we hide it?

163
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,333
No, I don't want to.

164
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,293
Why?

165
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,548
They'll just keep talking about us
if we tell them.

166
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,261
Why don't we kiss some more
instead of arguing?

167
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,304
You're just trying to change the subject.

168
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,306
-No…
-There's no one here!

169
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,183
-Come on, there's nobody…
-Let go of me.

170
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,601
What are you two doing here?

171
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,811
We're eating!

172
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,772
What are you doing here?
Did you come here to make out?

173
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,275
What? We have a platonic relationship.

174
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,360
Wait. I have something to ask.

175
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,572
I heard Ms. Jo and Mr. An

176
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,867
were seen coming out of a motel together.
Is that true?

177
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,036
It wasn't a motel. It was a house.

178
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,414
What? They were in the same house?

179
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,916
-Yes.
-Then they're living together?

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,379
Even if they're not,
it means they're dating at least.

181
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,839
No way!

182
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,841
-Why?
-They don't suit each other.

183
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,759
They are so different.

184
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,637
Yes, it's ridiculous.
I don't believe the rumors.

185
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:54,101
They spend a lot of time together,
so they could have fallen for each other.

186
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,699
YUN SOL

187
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,245
-Hey, Sol.
-Hey, Na-bi!

188
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,206
-Why did you ignore my calls
-Lower your voice.

189
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,791
and answer Sol's?

190
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,337
Oh, it's you, Ji-wan.

191
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,048
You're coming to the workshop, right?
Sol's coming too.

192
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,510
I don't think I can come.

193
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,472
Really? I thought we changed the location
because of you.

194
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,390
What? To where?

195
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:37,394
You know, the guesthouse
that your noodle shop friend is running.

196
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,731
-You're coming here?
-"Here"? You're there right now?

197
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,777
No, I'm not.

198
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,030
But my aunt lives nearby.

199
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,908
Are you staying there until the weekend?

200
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,036
I am, but…

201
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,413
I still can't come.

202
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,459
Why? You're nearby. Come hang out with us.

203
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,919
-Come on.
-Well…

204
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,131
Is Jae-eon coming?

205
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:10,386
What? No, he said he has other plans.

206
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,971
Oh, really?

207
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,223
I'll go if I have the time.

208
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,685
And don't tell the others I'm here.

209
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,687
Okay, I won't tell.

210
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,772
Don't ignore my calls anymore, all right?

211
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,483
Okay. Bye, then.

212
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,280
Didn't Jae-eon say he's coming?

213
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,491
-Yes, he did.
-Then why did you lie to her?

214
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,119
I know, right? Why did I do that?

215
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,455
Whatever. I had to say that
to get Na-bi to come.

216
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,458
That might cause huge trouble.

217
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,753
No, they could get back together
thanks to us.

218
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,798
Please don't say "us."

219
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,134
You heard me, so you're an accomplice now.

220
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,886
She doesn't even like him.

221
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,639
I know.

222
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,766
But when she asked if he was coming,

223
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,060
it sounded like she wanted him to come.

224
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,189
So don't tell Na-bi, okay?
You better keep this a secret.

225
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,734
-Okay.
-Let's go watch a movie today.

226
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,069
I have plans.

227
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,072
What? Who? You didn't even tell me.

228
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,241
Se-hun asked to eat lunch with me.

229
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,827
What's he up to this time?

230
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,371
He's not up to anything.

231
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,332
He wanted to ask me something about work.

232
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,126
He can just ask you over the phone.

233
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,971
You have to come to the workshop.

234
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,517
PARK JAE-EON
WHERE ARE YOU?

235
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:47,107
Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.

236
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,654
You're crazy.

237
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,284
Why are you so pathetic?

238
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,079
No…

239
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,924
I can't do this.

240
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,640
POWER OFF

241
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,755
Hey, Na-bi.

242
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,424
I heard you came today.

243
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,553
Yes. I just arrived.

244
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,889
Where are you headed?

245
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,809
Me? I was going to go see you.

246
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:04,852
What?

247
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,856
-You were coming to see me?
-Yes.

248
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,277
Then you should've called me.
We could've missed each other.

249
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,904
I did, but your phone was off.

250
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,739
I got worried.

251
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,743
Oh, right. I turned off my phone.

252
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,455
Were you headed somewhere?

253
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,791
I was just taking a walk.

254
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,918
A walk? Then…

255
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,964
Do you want to go to the beach?

256
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,420
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
BEEF TARTARE NOODLES AT A FISHING VILLAGE

257
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,506
Why isn't he showing his face
when he's so handsome?

258
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm sure he'd get
way more viewers if he did.

259
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,554
You didn't change the workshop location
because of money, right?

260
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,723
You just want to see him, right?

261
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,893
No. I mean, that's one reason.

262
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,728
It's not the only reason, though.

263
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,774
Don't misunderstand.
I'm just a fan. I mean it.

264
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,109
Come here.

265
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,362
-Oh, my head.
-Why did you do that?

266
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,073
It hurts. Come here and nurse me.

267
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,493
Come on.

268
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,870
-Let's go outside today.
-What?

269
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,122
We kept staying inside.

270
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,793
-Don't you feel stuffy?
-No, not at all.

271
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,295
Come on! Come here.

272
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,799
MYEONGWON-DONG, 26, DIMPLES

273
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,551
Why are you so heavy?

274
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,888
What? Who is it?

275
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,482
-Who is it?
-Just some guy I know.

276
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:19,403
His name's…
Gosh, I can't remember his name.

277
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,363
Kim…

278
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,117
What? I didn't pick up.

279
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,994
That seems more strange.

280
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,829
Why would he call you?

281
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,956
How would I know? Should I ask him?

282
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,752
You didn't delete that dating app?

283
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,965
Jeez.

284
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,635
Stop trying to change me.

285
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,886
You're suffocating me.

286
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,513
What? Suffocating you?

287
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,224
Yes, you're making a fuss over nothing.

288
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,477
What do you think
being in a relationship means?

289
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,771
Why do you even date me?

290
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,481
Because I like you.

291
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,066
-You like me?
-Yes.

292
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,819
-You really like me?
-Yes. I told you.

293
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,657
Not just having sex with me?

294
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,701
Is it that different?

295
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,787
Gyu-hyun…

296
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,542
Why is everything so complicated for you?

297
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,960
It's not complicated.

298
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,005
To be honest, you haven't changed
at all since we started dating.

299
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,715
Hey, that's ridiculous.

300
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,177
Have you changed, then?
Why am I the only one who has to change?

301
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,106
What are you doing?

302
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,411
I knew you'd be like this.
You boring nerd.

303
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,137
It's been a while since I came here.
It's so nice.

304
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,892
Are you sure it's okay to hang out?

305
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,770
-Don't you need to get ready to open?
-It's okay.

306
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,398
Both the noodle shop and the guesthouse
aren't opening yet.

307
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,776
That's a relief, then.

308
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,319
Can I help you with anything?

309
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,322
I'm good at cooking and cutting.
Use me as your assistant.

310
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,408
It's done.

311
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,371
Wait right here.

312
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,584
All right.

313
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,634
Did you see this yesterday?

314
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,678
I did.

315
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,805
It's amazing.

316
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,516
Oh, right. I wanted to go somewhere.

317
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,018
-This place is popular too.
-Where?

318
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,813
This one. I think it's nearby.

319
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,150
-I reserved a table for two.
-It looks nice.

320
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,777
-Right?
-I didn't know you'd be coming along.

321
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,364
I've always wanted to come here.

322
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,742
And I heard
that you guys were meeting here.

323
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,703
How could I not come?

324
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,957
If you're going to have a serious talk,
I'll leave you two alone.

325
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,835
Is it something important?

326
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,670
What?

327
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,090
Oh, well. It's…

328
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,510
No, it's nothing special.

329
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,554
I just wanted
to have a nice meal together.

330
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,597
I'll pay.

331
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,183
No, my treat. I asked to eat with you.

332
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,729
I'll pay for yours too, Ji-wan.

333
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,147
-Okay.
-Enjoy.

334
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,773
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

335
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,525
This looks good! Let's take a photo.

336
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,781
This is awesome.
When did you prepare all this?

337
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,703
I prepared this
when I heard you were coming.

338
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,790
You're really not filming this?

339
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,628
-I shouldn't be the only one seeing this.
-You saw it, so it's fine.

340
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,633
Hey, you're kind of good
at saying sweet things.

341
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,509
You must've dated a lot.

342
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,221
I haven't.

343
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,847
You've never dated?

344
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,682
No. So what?

345
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,103
No, I'm not saying it's weird.
It's just unexpected.

346
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,314
You must be pretty popular.

347
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,400
You have a very gentle and pure image.

348
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,447
I don't know why,

349
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,785
but I kept liking someone
who had a boyfriend.

350
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,120
Oh.

351
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,708
I see…

352
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,087
I'm okay. I have to drive.

353
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,380
Oh, right.

354
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,007
Should I drink alone, then?

355
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,720
Then I'll do this,
so it's like I'm drinking too.

356
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,019
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

357
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,401
This is so nice.

358
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,452
Do you have someone?

359
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,496
What?

360
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,293
Do you have someone you like?
Or a boyfriend?

361
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,590
Not now.

362
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,682
Eat up.

363
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,851
Okay. Let's eat.

364
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,014
So I dated that jerk for a long time

365
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,516
and broke up early this year.

366
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,068
What? Why are you grinning like that?

367
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,444
Are you laughing at me?

368
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,321
It's not that.

369
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,657
You had a boyfriend before too.

370
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,493
I did?

371
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,954
What do you mean?
That was my first relationship.

372
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,748
What? No, it isn't.

373
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,668
You said you were dating,
so I gave up last time.

374
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,712
"Gave up"?

375
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,429
What?

376
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,474
Hey, don't you need to drive?

377
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,267
You're my first love.

378
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,067
What?

379
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,073
I had a crush on you,

380
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,785
but you were leaving for Seoul,
so I was about to tell you I liked you.

381
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,789
But you said you had a boyfriend,
so I gave up.

382
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,673
I told you I had a boyfriend?

383
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:41,428
Not to me. You told someone else.

384
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,931
I don't remember saying that.

385
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,227
I guess I didn't want to get teased
for not having a boyfriend.

386
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,606
Hang on.

387
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,985
Is that why you didn't come to see me
when I was leaving?

388
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,738
Yes.

389
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,782
Hey, I was so upset about that!

390
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:08,413
Would you have accepted me
if I confessed my feelings to you?

391
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,254
I don't know. But I would've
stayed in touch with you.

392
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,841
We were best friends.

393
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,889
Then I guess things
would have been different.

394
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,187
I don't know! You were such an idiot.

395
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,530
-Look at the red dot.
-Okay.

396
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,115
One, two, three.

397
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,243
You did great.

398
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,620
It's my turn now.

399
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,808
Can I sit here?

400
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,228
You're already sitting there.

401
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,731
Are you with someone?

402
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,025
No, I'm not.

403
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,086
Can you hand me the menu?

404
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,463
Sure.

405
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,523
That butterfly is pretty.

406
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,442
What meaning does it have?

407
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,113
The ugliness and pain of happiness,

408
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,531
and lack of freedom.

409
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,658
That's what butterfly tattoos symbolize.

410
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,993
I see.

411
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,204
I just did it
because I like butterflies, though.

412
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,291
Come to think of it,
butterflies look so pretty

413
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,293
but some people say

414
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,963
if you rub your eyes after touching
butterfly wings, you'll become blind.

415
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,009
That's not true.

416
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,679
There's a kind of scale powder
on their wings,

417
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:33,808
and it's not really that harmful.
It can only cause some allergies.

418
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,687
-No way.
-It's funny, right?

419
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,609
-What do you mean?
-People are so funny.

420
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,945
The butterflies are the ones
that get hurt.

421
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,989
If they lose their scales,

422
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,825
they'll lose the patterns and colors
on their wings.

423
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,620
And they won't be able to fly.

424
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,543
Do you want to see some?

425
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,144
It was my last vacation in the military,

426
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,689
and my friend asked
if I wanted to go see an exhibition.

427
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,526
To be honest, I don't know much about art.

428
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,737
It was my first time going
to an art exhibit.

429
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,739
Right.

430
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,033
But I saw someone

431
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,912
who really looked like you.

432
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,638
I was almost sure it was you,

433
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,183
but it had been such a long time
so I couldn't call your name.

434
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,394
I regretted that after.

435
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,773
But I met you again on the bus.

436
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,110
It really was you at the exhibition.

437
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,114
My heart was beating like crazy.

438
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,199
Isn't that stupid?

439
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,670
Hey, Do-hyeok.

440
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,758
-Do-hyeok!
-Na-bi. Did you sleep well?

441
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,720
Why did you give me the blankets
when you were sleeping outside?

442
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,055
It's okay.

443
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,562
-The thing about Youtube is…
-That's right.

444
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,982
-It's no joke.
-You're talking about views, right?

445
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,443
Getting one million views is amazing.

446
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,945
-That's amazing.
-It is.

447
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,571
-Our couple number 12.
-Couple 12.

448
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,116
When Jae-joon ordered noodles…

449
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,325
Gyeong-jun.

450
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,996
Gyeong-jun! You can't hear me, right?

451
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,761
You startled me.

452
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,681
What the…

453
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,022
-You're not wearing your glasses.
-No.

454
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,818
What?

455
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,987
What is it?

456
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,746
My glasses.

457
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,998
What?

458
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,126
-Those are my glasses.
-What do you mean? They're mine.

459
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,753
Oh, they're yours.

460
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,255
Then where are mine?

461
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,007
Yours?

462
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,550
Oh.

463
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,260
I see.

464
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,054
No wonder. You looked a bit weird.

465
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,431
Here.

466
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,856
What is it this time?

467
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,650
-Thankfully, it doesn't smell.
-What?

468
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,486
I guess you just fart loudly.

469
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,199
What are you talking about? That's not me!

470
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,618
You were pretty loud!

471
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,870
-Farty pants!
-It wasn't me!

472
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,246
Jeez.

473
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,333
What's with you? I told you, it wasn't me!

474
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,793
You're so annoying!

475
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,568
YU NA-BI

476
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,516
What are you doing here?

477
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,852
Hey.

478
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,897
Did you see Bit-na by any chance?

479
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,149
No, I didn't.

480
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,942
Okay.

481
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,487
Are you joining the workshop?

482
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,614
No. I'm not going.

483
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:49,243
Why? Everyone will make a fuss
if they hear you're not going.

484
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,830
What about Na-bi?

485
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,499
Na-bi's not coming either.

486
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,419
-You didn't know?
-No.

487
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,630
We're not talking much these days.

488
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,761
You did something wrong, didn't you?

489
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,805
Well…

490
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,224
I'm not sure.

491
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,770
Don't lie. You know what it is.

492
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,358
But still, she likes you.

493
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,862
Can't you treat her sincerely?

494
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,497
Na-bi, be careful
when you're taking them out.

495
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,332
Don't worry.

496
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,598
My stomach hurts.

497
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,393
You must've drunk so much.

498
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,478
I guess it was fun.

499
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,440
-The food was so delicious.
-I know.

500
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,984
And the beach was so pretty.

501
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,365
I should head back to Seoul soon.

502
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,991
I'm resting too much.

503
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,744
That's why you came, though.

504
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,539
Oh, but you should fix that shelf
for me before you go.

505
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,499
Okay.

506
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,086
Look at how pretty they are.

507
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,089
These look a bit strange, though.

508
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:28,467
Why is the color different?
It's the same glaze.

509
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,344
It was a bit windy a while ago.

510
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,346
Even if you apply the same glaze,

511
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,558
they look different depending
on the humidity or temperature.

512
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,060
So once you start baking them,

513
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,855
you don't get to decide
what color they turn out to be.

514
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,732
Doesn't that make you uneasy?

515
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,987
What do you mean?
It's fun because it's unpredictable.

516
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,614
That's why
I've been doing pottery for so long.

517
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,992
I tried baking glass with glaze on it,

518
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,412
and the color came out different
each time. It was cool.

519
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,669
You're saying the same thing.

520
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,380
What? Same as who?

521
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,425
Never mind.

522
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,761
It's getting scary to do sculpture though.

523
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,182
One mistake could ruin everything.

524
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,227
I feel like it'll be better
to do something digital

525
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,563
where I can save and undo my work.

526
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,733
My goodness.
You're not living up to your name.

527
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,902
You know why your name's Na-bi?

528
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,696
Yes. You said you named me
because your favorite author--

529
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,325
No. You said you had to present it
at school,

530
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,076
so I made that up.

531
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,995
What?

532
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:41,874
Your mom says she named you like that
so your life would be as sweet as honey.

533
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,001
But butterflies don't always eat honey.

534
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,255
Insects and poop
are all nutrients for them too.

535
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,841
Everything you're going through
in your life right now

536
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,801
are your nutrients.

537
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,346
So what's there to fear?

538
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,312
To be honest,
I don't think I can take it anymore.

539
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:07,399
When we're together, she acts like
I'm the only one in her life,

540
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,778
so I thought she cared for me too.

541
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,407
But then when she gets interested
in something else, she ignores me.

542
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,036
So I keep getting depressed
even while I'm with her.

543
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:24,124
She does say that she likes me.
I want to believe that,

544
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,793
but I can't help doubting it.

545
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,089
This isn't what I'm usually like.

546
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,427
Maybe I should have just stuck
to being friends with her.

547
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,680
I've never seen you talk so much.

548
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,434
Why was I blabbering on about that to you?

549
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,979
Have you told her honestly

550
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,189
about what you just said?

551
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,732
No. Never.

552
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,318
It's not easy to be honest with her.

553
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,905
-What?
-I have pride, you know.

554
00:42:56,073 --> 00:43:00,077
I'm already upset since I feel like
I'm the only one who likes her.

555
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,329
What do you want from her?

556
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,625
Certainty about the relationship
and sincerity toward me.

557
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,503
That's unrealistic.

558
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,923
As soon as you have certainty,
that relationship becomes weak.

559
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,011
How does one get

560
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,221
that certainty?

561
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,890
Are you sure it'll help you?

562
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,935
You're pretty twisted, aren't you?

563
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,021
I think you're the one who's twisted.

564
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,566
But anyway, I'm sure there's a reason
why she's staying by your side.

565
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,543
SONG SEO-YEON: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
KIM EUN-JU: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY?

566
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,977
KANG SEO-YEON: YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME
IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY!

567
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,858
Oh, Do-hyeok. Come inside.

568
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:55,901
Yes.

569
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,734
This place is so pretty.

570
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:41,947
What?

571
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,576
I think I remember this place.

572
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,619
-Really?
-Yes.

573
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,623
You know what?

574
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,918
They say that if you catch a falling leaf
and make a wish,

575
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,545
it'll come true.

576
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,592
What? You believe stuff like that?

577
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,218
It's romantic.

578
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,304
You don't?

579
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,306
No.

580
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,516
I don't.

581
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,101
Why?

582
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,396
Just because. There's no evidence.

583
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,065
But that's why I like it.

584
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,610
I just have to believe in it. That's all.

585
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,655
Is that so?

586
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,716
-I caught one.
-Make a wish.

587
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,390
I don't believe stuff like this.

588
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,268
Forget it. Just give me the camera.

589
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:04,029
Do-hyeok, why don't you try uploading
vlogs of your daily life?

590
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:07,491
You can film stuff like preparing
to open your restaurant

591
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,369
instead of always just showing
your hands and scenery.

592
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,371
I bet you'll get way more viewers.

593
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,831
Are my videos boring?

594
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,376
It's not that.

595
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,258
You look really great on camera.

596
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,719
If you reveal your face,
I'm sure you'll get way more subscribers.

597
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,764
-No way. Come on.
-Hey, just once.

598
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,641
Just once. Please?

599
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,985
What's that?

600
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,612
One, two, three.

601
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,990
See? You look great.

602
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,784
-Let me take a photo of you too.
-No, not me.

603
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,287
I look awful in photos.

604
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,038
No, you looked pretty.

605
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,874
What?

606
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:03,297
Oh, to be honest,
I took a photo of you last time.

607
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,881
-Sorry.
-When?

608
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,884
-At the beach.
-Do you have it now?

609
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,177
-Yes.
-Let me see.

610
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,689
They look good, right?

611
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,317
Well…

612
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,277
This one is nice.

613
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,533
They came out nice.

614
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,348
Happy birthday.

615
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,682
Thanks.

616
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,186
-You don't have a gift for me?
-A gift?

617
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:03,190
Of course I do.
But I don't know if you'll like it.

618
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,664
-Did you want this that badly?
-I must have lost my mind.

619
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,124
I wanted to have it.

620
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,797
I lied to your friend Na-bi.

621
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:31,218
-Lied about what?
-She asked if we were dating,

622
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,178
and I said yes.

623
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,018
She believed me right away.
I didn't know she'd disappear like that.

624
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,646
Sorry about that.

625
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,281
She didn't just stay quiet though.

626
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:15,971
We're here.

627
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,306
You should go.

628
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,436
-I'll come and pick you up tomorrow.
-No, it's fine.

629
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,896
I'll see you at the market.
I can go there alone.

630
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,857
It's dangerous at that hour.

631
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,067
I'll be off. See you tomorrow.

632
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,445
Okay…

633
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,455
PARK JAE-EON

634
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:44,916
PARK JAE-EON

635
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,881
PARK JAE-EON
WHERE ARE YOU, LET'S TALK

636
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,110
Na-bi, let's eat some apples.

637
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,571
Okay. I'm all done.

638
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,832
"Where are you? Let's talk."

639
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,002
That means you're angry, right?

640
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,172
What's this random question?

641
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,134
I promised myself I would never date

642
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,303
while watching my mom.

643
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,889
When did you make such a decision?

644
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,682
When I was little.

645
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,643
The day before I left for Seoul,

646
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,229
Mom came here and cried her eyes out.

647
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,563
Oh, that day.

648
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,441
She really liked that man.

649
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,528
It was pretty intense.

650
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:58,365
I told her he was a scumbag
and that she should break up with him,

651
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,075
but she never listened.

652
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,452
But still, she dated him.

653
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,789
There was nothing between us.
I don't know why I did that.

654
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,707
I was so stupid. It's so embarrassing.

655
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,835
This is the worst.

656
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:14,047
Hey, there is always
something between people.

657
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,264
I still respect your mom.

658
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,765
She got so hurt,

659
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,893
but she falls passionately in love
with new people.

660
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,647
That's nonsense.

661
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,401
Your mom said that dating

662
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,445
isn't about picking the nicest person.

663
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,781
It's about meeting someone special to you.

664
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,036
I think that's why she failed each time.

665
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,246
You're wrong about that.

666
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,456
If she failed each time,

667
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,959
how could she have gotten
such a precious daughter?

668
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,423
Here.

669
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,761
The shelf's crooked.

670
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,806
Oh, no. I drilled all the holes already.

671
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,977
Why isn't anything working out?

672
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,877
You look great today, as usual. Come in.

673
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,133
Happy birthday.

674
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,720
I heard that there's a lot of things

675
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,014
to carry and move for sculpture majors.

676
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,476
This is too much.

677
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,186
Let me at least do this.

678
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,070
Thank you.

679
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:08,995
Mom.

680
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,916
Did the performance go well?

681
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,251
Yes. I'm performing in Paris next.

682
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,506
How is Paris?

683
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,258
It's nice.

684
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,136
Do you want to come with me?

685
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,099
Someone wanted to go there.

686
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,726
It must be someone you like.

687
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,522
No.

688
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,984
Just someone bothersome.

689
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,826
Jae-eon.

690
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,079
You know what I regret the most?

691
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,291
Not knowing my own feelings.

692
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,626
No…

693
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,796
pretending not to know.

694
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,219
Who would love someone

695
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:08,346
who doesn't even take care of themselves?

696
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,927
All right.

697
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,045
Who would love someone

698
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,130
who doesn't even take care of themselves?

699
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:30,887
I know very well that a person
who doesn't know how to love someone

700
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,138
can never be happy.

701
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,307
That's what you hate the most.

702
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,392
Getting clingy.

703
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,186
What?

704
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,022
You always draw the line like this.

705
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:45,026
You just want to see me when you want,

706
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,653
but you're scared I'll get clingy?

707
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,321
Don't worry.

708
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,740
That's not going to happen.

00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,544
YANG DO-HYEOK

712
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,853
It's what you made for me.

713
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,858
You still have that? I'm touched.

714
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,031
Of course. You gave it to me. Good night.

715
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,910
Good night.

716
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,300
Hey, Na-bi.

717
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,636
-Hi.
-Hi.

718
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,687
Did you sleep well?

719
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,774
-Yes. You?
-Me too.

720
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,192
-Should we go?
-Okay.

721
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,538
-Sir.
-Yes?

722
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:44,706
Can you watch these?

723
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,000
-Sure. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

724
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,543
Thank you.

725
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,052
Hey, let's try this.

726
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,892
-Could we have some sweet potatoes?
-Okay.

727
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,728
Hello.

728
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,646
Oh, you brought your girlfriend.

729
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:13,234
You two look so sweet together.

730
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,361
We're not…

731
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,448
-Well…
-Why aren't you saying anything?

732
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,786
That will be 8,000 won.

733
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,497
Some potatoes too.

734
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,458
-Potatoes?
-Just a few.

735
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,376
Let's see.

736
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,045
You look so happy.

737
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,213
That's 13,000 won.

738
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,298
Thirteen thousand?

739
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:39,302
I'll give you a discount
since your girlfriend is so pretty.

740
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,846
-Just give me 10,000 won.
-Thank you.

741
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,931
-You're so pretty.
-Thank you.

742
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,143
-You got a discount thanks to me.
-Okay. I'll cook something nice.

743
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,187
-Bye.
-Bye.

744
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,022
It's so pretty.

745
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,190
How much are those?

746
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,442
Those flowers? They're 23,000 won.

747
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,444
-What? 23,000 won?
-Yes.

748
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,029
-I'll take those.
-All right.

749
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:00,740
-Hey.
-What?

750
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,992
It's fine. We'll come back next time.

751
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,958
It seems like it's broken.

752
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,672
Why did you do that, Do-hyeok?

753
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,049
-I didn't do it.
-Jeez.

754
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,385
Hey, Na-bi.

755
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,098
Hey, it's really Na-bi!

756
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:29,394
-Who…
-Oh, I guess you don't remember.

757
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,396
My cousin, Do-yeon.

758
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:37,110
Oh, right. Do-yeon.

759
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,361
It's been a long time.

760
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:41,781
-You're unbelievable!
-Don't say anything weird.

761
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,200
I mean, I was so surprised.
You look so pretty!

762
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,160
-You're right.
-No…

763
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,454
You've grown so much.
I didn't recognize you.

764
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:53,292
Na-bi. The tire's flat.
You can't ride it now.

765
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,335
Did I do that?

766
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:58,214
No, it's not your fault.
I think someone played a prank.

767
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:01,092
-Let's go get it fixed.
-Okay.

768
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,468
There's no need for that.

769
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,804
You two can ride yours together.

770
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,098
I'll get this fixed and ride it home.

771
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,894
What are you waiting for? Come on.

772
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,604
Bye.

773
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,525
-See you later, Do-yeon.
-Thanks!

774
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,457
What are you doing?

775
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,793
Oh, in case it's uncomfortable for you.

776
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:43,968
Get on.

777
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,106
Let's go.

778
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,466
Are you sleeping here with your friends?

779
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,219
No, I'm going to sleep at my aunt's.

780
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:30,473
Really? Then I'll take you home.
I need to tell you something.

781
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,849
Tell me what?

782
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,226
I'll tell you later.

783
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:53,996
Do-hyeok, where should I put this?

784
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,916
Over there. No, I'll put that away.

785
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,632
Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.

786
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,927
Hello. I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

787
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,282
How have you been?

788
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,034
Fine. So-so.

789
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,452
I haven't been well.

790
01:05:56,535 --> 01:06:00,498
His familiar smells are haunting me.

791
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,125
He's charming.
I wouldn't mind if you went after him.

792
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,628
They look like newlyweds.

793
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,130
It's true that Na-bi is my first love.

794
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:11,759
What is your relationship to Jae-eon?

795
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,052
There's nothing between us.

796
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:16,681
I kept thinking about you. I missed you.

797
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,182
You have a girlfriend.

798
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,100
That's not the issue.

799
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:21,435
Stop playing games with me.

800
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,895
Let's end this.

801
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,188
-Stop it.
-What?

802
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,314
What you're doing right now.

803
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,315
Where's Na-bi?

804
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,484
-She said she's too tired to come.
-She's not coming?

805
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:31,195
Just tell me if you don't want this.

806
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:36,534
