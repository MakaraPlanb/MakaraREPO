1
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:30,434
GYMNASIUM

2
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,978
Go.

3
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,251
I always

4
00:00:57,169 --> 00:00:59,171
feel satisfied with a moderate distance

5
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:01,131
in a relationship.

6
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:02,883
What? You get to dance with girls?

7
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,260
I should have taken that class.

8
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:09,097
Look at all those guys without partners.

9
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,058
They're all guys like you.

10
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:25,531
He seems to have a crush on Na-bi.

11
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:29,243
I bet he'll ask her out
on the last day of class.

12
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:30,828
Let's go.

13
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:39,044
We didn't make any mistakes!
I did good, right? Did you see?

14
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:42,339
We're getting an A+ for sure. Let's go!

15
00:01:56,937 --> 00:01:58,313
You danced pretty well.

16
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:01,859
-Did you see?
-Yes. I saw it when I was passing by.

17
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:06,029
I knew you'd be a good dancer.

18
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:08,365
I never stepped on my partner's foot.

19
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,326
-Thanks.
-Is that it?

20
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,162
I'll buy you a meal.

21
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:15,038
All right.

22
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:20,794
Did you stay up all night?

23
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:23,380
You're overworking yourself.

24
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:25,716
I've gotten a grip on myself
thanks to you.

25
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:27,968
You told me to be sincere.

26
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:32,931
I was only talking about dating.

27
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:36,977
I tried applying lacquer on glass,
but I screwed up.

28
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:39,771
It just keeps falling off.

29
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:45,485
-Isn't there a way to do this?
-You should make the surface rough.

30
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:46,862
How do you know that?

31
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:51,199
My aunt does pottery.
I learned some from her.

32
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:55,746
I want to learn, too.

33
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,123
I tried baking glass with glaze on it,

34
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:00,834
and the color came out different
each time. It was cool.

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,463
I'll teach you.

36
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:06,715
I'll be better at it than you.

37
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:11,845
A distance that's close enough
yet not too close

38
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:13,222
to hurt each other.

39
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:15,432
-Isn't it good?
-No.

40
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:16,642
It's bad?

41
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:20,270
Isn't it pretty?

42
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,154
EPISODE 6: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS LOVE.
NEVERTHELESS,

43
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:34,326
But are you really just friends with him?

44
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:38,247
Yes. We're just friends.

45
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,873
That's a relief.

46
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,668
I thought maybe I said something
I shouldn't have.

47
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:53,220
You should just keep your hair that way.

48
00:03:53,804 --> 00:03:54,680
What?

49
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,473
Jae-eon…

50
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,434
likes doing it with your hair tied.

51
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:27,421
Everyone, take a look at what I gave you.

52
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:30,048
There's a list of commonly used colors

53
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:33,844
and the image and keywords

54
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:37,639
that people associate with those colors.

55
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:41,184
Even if it's the same color,
the associated images

56
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:44,146
could be the exact opposite.

57
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:48,233
And some are different
according to the culture or country.

58
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:52,696
And of course, it could be different
for each individual.

59
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,072
Good work today.

60
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:56,700
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

61
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:00,912
It's finally over!

62
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:03,040
-Is this it?
-Give me my bag.

63
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:06,835
Did anyone see Na-bi today?

64
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:09,629
Na-bi? I haven't seen her.

65
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,214
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

66
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:13,508
-What about you?
-She ignored my message.

67
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:16,720
-Did she not contact you either?
-No.

68
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:18,263
Is something wrong?

69
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:20,140
She's not answering her phone, either.

70
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:23,060
I'm sure
she just felt like skipping class today.

71
00:05:23,143 --> 00:05:24,227
Na-bi isn't like you.

72
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,022
We'll be off. See you tomorrow!

73
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:28,356
-Good work today.
-Bye.

74
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,317
Hey, where are you going? Wait for me.

75
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,152
-Bye.
-We're eating lunch.

76
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:34,613
-I'll be back after lunch.
-Hey!

77
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:35,822
How about tteokbokki?

78
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:37,783
Do you want to eat tteokbokki?

79
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:40,285
-Sure.
-Did you bring your wallet?

80
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,454
My treat.

81
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:43,830
All right.

82
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:47,501
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

83
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:58,280
NOODLE SHOP

84
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:26,766
I'm worried.

85
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:29,895
About what?

86
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:32,772
Na-bi. I can't get in touch with her.

87
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:35,567
Really?

88
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:37,694
She must have been shocked.

89
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,739
-What?
-It's nothing.

90
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:41,740
She's attractive.

91
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:45,535
You only saw her for a minute,
and you felt that?

92
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:47,204
I could see why you fell for her.

93
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:48,830
What are you talking about?

94
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:51,708
It's not like that.

95
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:54,836
I broke up with Chris.

96
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:56,922
Why?

97
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:02,844
You're actually asking me why?

98
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:08,099
He said he thought he would be okay

99
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,936
with me seeing other guys, but he wasn't.

100
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:15,232
But I think I can understand
how that feels now.

101
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:18,985
So that's it?

102
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,155
Yes. I just let him go.

103
00:08:23,532 --> 00:08:24,616
I did good, right?

104
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:31,248
What? That's what you hate the most.

105
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:33,833
Getting clingy.

106
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:40,340
Ms. Yun Seol-a. This way, please.

107
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:44,844
You can go if you're busy.

108
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:46,596
It's fine. Go on.

109
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:03,655
WHERE ARE YOU?

110
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,659
YU NA-BI

111
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:17,377
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please try again later…

112
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:44,946
She disappeared.

113
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:56,875
Thank you!

114
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,793
Yu Na-bi!

115
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:00,629
Auntie!

116
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:06,968
Oh, my.

117
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:10,013
It's so nice to see you.

118
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:13,850
-Right, Auntie.
-Yes?

119
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,561
Don't tell my mom I'm here, okay?

120
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:18,563
Are you involved in some crime?

121
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:22,317
It's nothing like that.

122
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,902
Then it's fine.

123
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:26,029
How long are you staying?

124
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:29,282
About a week?

125
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,409
That long?

126
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:35,538
What? You don't want me to stay?

127
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:36,998
It's not that.

128
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,710
I'll clean the house.

129
00:10:40,794 --> 00:10:43,713
All right. Let's take care
of all the household chores

130
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:46,299
that I've been putting off all this time.

131
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:48,635
Okay. I'll do my best.

132
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:01,564
POTTERY WORKSHOP

133
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:06,778
This feels so great.

134
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:09,697
-The weather's so nice.
-It is.

135
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:12,575
Oh, right. I saw Do-hyeok at the market.

136
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:13,660
He grew up so well.

137
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:16,246
Do-hyeok came, too?

138
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:20,917
When you headed back to Seoul
when you were little,

139
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,338
all the other kids came to see you off
but Do-hyeok didn't come.

140
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:26,256
That's right.

141
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,802
You were crying and whining about it
the whole way there.

142
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:32,929
No way. I didn't cry.

143
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:36,266
You did. You two were so close.

144
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:39,144
Right.

145
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:41,980
I did like Do-hyeok a lot.

146
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:44,941
-You liked him the most.
-Come on, it wasn't like that.

147
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:47,193
-Yes, it was.
-No!

148
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,532
-Give it to me.
-No, I can carry it.

149
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:56,119
-We're going to your workshop, right?
-Yes. Let's go.

150
00:11:58,496 --> 00:11:59,873
Let's go!

151
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:03,334
-Come down after you unpack.
-Okay.

152
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,336
-See you later!
-See you later.

153
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:55,261
You're so cute.

154
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:57,597
-What are you on about?
-You're so adorable.

155
00:12:58,348 --> 00:13:00,099
-Let's eat.
-No.

156
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:03,520
-No!
-We don't have time.

157
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:07,774
But…

158
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,944
don't you think
we should tell the others now?

159
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:12,987
-Tell them what?
-That we're dating.

160
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:16,950
Why? It's not like we're getting married.

161
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:18,910
I want to tell them, though.

162
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:20,745
Why should we hide it?

163
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:25,333
No, I don't want to.

164
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:27,293
Why?

165
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:31,548
They'll just keep talking about us
if we tell them.

166
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,261
Why don't we kiss some more
instead of arguing?

167
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:38,304
You're just trying to change the subject.

168
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:40,306
-No…
-There's no one here!

169
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,183
-Come on, there's nobody…
-Let go of me.

170
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:43,601
What are you two doing here?

171
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:44,811
We're eating!

172
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:47,772
What are you doing here?
Did you come here to make out?

173
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:50,275
What? We have a platonic relationship.

174
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:52,360
Wait. I have something to ask.

175
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:55,572
I heard Ms. Jo and Mr. An

176
00:13:55,655 --> 00:13:58,867
were seen coming out of a motel together.
Is that true?

177
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:02,036
It wasn't a motel. It was a house.

178
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,414
What? They were in the same house?

179
00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:06,916
-Yes.
-Then they're living together?

180
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,379
Even if they're not,
it means they're dating at least.

181
00:14:11,462 --> 00:14:12,839
No way!

182
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,841
-Why?
-They don't suit each other.

183
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:16,759
They are so different.

184
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:19,637
Yes, it's ridiculous.
I don't believe the rumors.

185
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:25,101
They spend a lot of time together,
so they could have fallen for each other.

186
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:39,699
YUN SOL

187
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:44,245
-Hey, Sol.
-Hey, Na-bi!

188
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,206
-Why did you ignore my calls
-Lower your voice.

189
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,791
and answer Sol's?

190
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:52,337
Oh, it's you, Ji-wan.

191
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,048
You're coming to the workshop, right?
Sol's coming too.

192
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,510
I don't think I can come.

193
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:02,472
Really? I thought we changed the location
because of you.

194
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:04,390
What? To where?

195
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:08,394
You know, the guesthouse
that your noodle shop friend is running.

196
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:11,731
-You're coming here?
-"Here"? You're there right now?

197
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,777
No, I'm not.

198
00:15:16,527 --> 00:15:19,030
But my aunt lives nearby.

199
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:21,908
Are you staying there until the weekend?

200
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:25,036
I am, but…

201
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:27,413
I still can't come.

202
00:15:27,497 --> 00:15:31,459
Why? You're nearby. Come hang out with us.

203
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:32,919
-Come on.
-Well…

204
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:37,131
Is Jae-eon coming?

205
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,386
What? No, he said he has other plans.

206
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:42,971
Oh, really?

207
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:45,223
I'll go if I have the time.

208
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:48,685
And don't tell the others I'm here.

209
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:50,687
Okay, I won't tell.

210
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,772
Don't ignore my calls anymore, all right?

211
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:55,483
Okay. Bye, then.

212
00:15:57,944 --> 00:16:01,280
Didn't Jae-eon say he's coming?

213
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:03,491
-Yes, he did.
-Then why did you lie to her?

214
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:06,119
I know, right? Why did I do that?

215
00:16:06,202 --> 00:16:09,455
Whatever. I had to say that
to get Na-bi to come.

216
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,458
That might cause huge trouble.

217
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:15,753
No, they could get back together
thanks to us.

218
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,798
Please don't say "us."

219
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:21,134
You heard me, so you're an accomplice now.

220
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,886
She doesn't even like him.

221
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:26,639
I know.

222
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:28,766
But when she asked if he was coming,

223
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,060
it sounded like she wanted him to come.

224
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:35,189
So don't tell Na-bi, okay?
You better keep this a secret.

225
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:37,734
-Okay.
-Let's go watch a movie today.

226
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:40,069
I have plans.

227
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:43,072
What? Who? You didn't even tell me.

228
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:45,241
Se-hun asked to eat lunch with me.

229
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:47,827
What's he up to this time?

230
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,371
He's not up to anything.

231
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:53,332
He wanted to ask me something about work.

232
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,126
He can just ask you over the phone.

233
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,971
You have to come to the workshop.

234
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:11,517
PARK JAE-EON
WHERE ARE YOU?

235
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:18,107
Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.

236
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:23,654
You're crazy.

237
00:17:25,823 --> 00:17:28,284
Why are you so pathetic?

238
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:31,079
No…

239
00:17:41,923 --> 00:17:42,924
I can't do this.

240
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:50,640
POWER OFF

241
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:22,755
Hey, Na-bi.

242
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:25,424
I heard you came today.

243
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:28,553
Yes. I just arrived.

244
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:31,889
Where are you headed?

245
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,809
Me? I was going to go see you.

246
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:35,852
What?

247
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:39,856
-You were coming to see me?
-Yes.

248
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:44,277
Then you should've called me.
We could've missed each other.

249
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:46,904
I did, but your phone was off.

250
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:48,739
I got worried.

251
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:52,743
Oh, right. I turned off my phone.

252
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:56,455
Were you headed somewhere?

253
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,791
I was just taking a walk.

254
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,918
A walk? Then…

255
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,964
Do you want to go to the beach?

256
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:44,420
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
BEEF TARTARE NOODLES AT A FISHING VILLAGE

257
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:47,506
Why isn't he showing his face
when he's so handsome?

258
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,800
I'm sure he'd get
way more viewers if he did.

259
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:53,554
You didn't change the workshop location
because of money, right?

260
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:55,723
You just want to see him, right?

261
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,893
No. I mean, that's one reason.

262
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:00,728
It's not the only reason, though.

263
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:04,774
Don't misunderstand.
I'm just a fan. I mean it.

264
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:07,109
Come here.

265
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:09,362
-Oh, my head.
-Why did you do that?

266
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:12,073
It hurts. Come here and nurse me.

267
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:15,493
Come on.

268
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:17,870
-Let's go outside today.
-What?

269
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:20,122
We kept staying inside.

270
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:23,793
-Don't you feel stuffy?
-No, not at all.

271
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:26,295
Come on! Come here.

272
00:20:28,214 --> 00:20:29,799
MYEONGWON-DONG, 26, DIMPLES

273
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:32,551
Why are you so heavy?

274
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:35,888
What? Who is it?

275
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:46,482
-Who is it?
-Just some guy I know.

276
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:50,403
His name's…
Gosh, I can't remember his name.

277
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:52,363
Kim…

278
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:56,117
What? I didn't pick up.

279
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,994
That seems more strange.

280
00:20:58,077 --> 00:20:59,829
Why would he call you?

281
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:01,956
How would I know? Should I ask him?

282
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,752
You didn't delete that dating app?

283
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:10,965
Jeez.

284
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:14,635
Stop trying to change me.

285
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:15,886
You're suffocating me.

286
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,513
What? Suffocating you?

287
00:21:17,596 --> 00:21:20,224
Yes, you're making a fuss over nothing.

288
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:23,477
What do you think
being in a relationship means?

289
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:25,771
Why do you even date me?

290
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:27,481
Because I like you.

291
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:29,066
-You like me?
-Yes.

292
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,819
-You really like me?
-Yes. I told you.

293
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:36,657
Not just having sex with me?

294
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:38,701
Is it that different?

295
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:41,787
Gyu-hyun…

296
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:46,542
Why is everything so complicated for you?

297
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,960
It's not complicated.

298
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:51,005
To be honest, you haven't changed
at all since we started dating.

299
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:52,715
Hey, that's ridiculous.

300
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,177
Have you changed, then?
Why am I the only one who has to change?

301
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:09,106
What are you doing?

302
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:22,411
I knew you'd be like this.
You boring nerd.

303
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:40,137
It's been a while since I came here.
It's so nice.

304
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:44,892
Are you sure it's okay to hang out?

305
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:47,770
-Don't you need to get ready to open?
-It's okay.

306
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:51,398
Both the noodle shop and the guesthouse
aren't opening yet.

307
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:53,776
That's a relief, then.

308
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:55,319
Can I help you with anything?

309
00:22:55,402 --> 00:22:58,322
I'm good at cooking and cutting.
Use me as your assistant.

310
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,408
It's done.

311
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:05,371
Wait right here.

312
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,584
All right.

313
00:23:17,258 --> 00:23:18,634
Did you see this yesterday?

314
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:20,678
I did.

315
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:22,805
It's amazing.

316
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:25,516
Oh, right. I wanted to go somewhere.

317
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,018
-This place is popular too.
-Where?

318
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:30,813
This one. I think it's nearby.

319
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:34,150
-I reserved a table for two.
-It looks nice.

320
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:36,777
-Right?
-I didn't know you'd be coming along.

321
00:23:37,736 --> 00:23:40,364
I've always wanted to come here.

322
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:43,742
And I heard
that you guys were meeting here.

323
00:23:43,826 --> 00:23:45,703
How could I not come?

324
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:49,957
If you're going to have a serious talk,
I'll leave you two alone.

325
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,835
Is it something important?

326
00:23:53,627 --> 00:23:54,670
What?

327
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:58,090
Oh, well. It's…

328
00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:01,510
No, it's nothing special.

329
00:24:01,594 --> 00:24:03,554
I just wanted
to have a nice meal together.

330
00:24:03,637 --> 00:24:04,597
I'll pay.

331
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,183
No, my treat. I asked to eat with you.

332
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:11,729
I'll pay for yours too, Ji-wan.

333
00:24:11,812 --> 00:24:13,147
-Okay.
-Enjoy.

334
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,773
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

335
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:16,525
This looks good! Let's take a photo.

336
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:22,781
This is awesome.
When did you prepare all this?

337
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:27,703
I prepared this
when I heard you were coming.

338
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:31,790
You're really not filming this?

339
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:35,628
-I shouldn't be the only one seeing this.
-You saw it, so it's fine.

340
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:40,633
Hey, you're kind of good
at saying sweet things.

341
00:24:41,383 --> 00:24:42,509
You must've dated a lot.

342
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:45,221
I haven't.

343
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:46,847
You've never dated?

344
00:24:46,931 --> 00:24:48,682
No. So what?

345
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:53,103
No, I'm not saying it's weird.
It's just unexpected.

346
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:55,314
You must be pretty popular.

347
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:58,400
You have a very gentle and pure image.

348
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:03,447
I don't know why,

349
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:07,785
but I kept liking someone
who had a boyfriend.

350
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:10,120
Oh.

351
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,708
I see…

352
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:18,087
I'm okay. I have to drive.

353
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,380
Oh, right.

354
00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:22,007
Should I drink alone, then?

355
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:26,720
Then I'll do this,
so it's like I'm drinking too.

356
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:34,019
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

357
00:25:38,524 --> 00:25:40,401
This is so nice.

358
00:25:47,408 --> 00:25:50,452
Do you have someone?

359
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:52,496
What?

360
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,293
Do you have someone you like?
Or a boyfriend?

361
00:26:02,214 --> 00:26:03,590
Not now.

362
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:11,682
Eat up.

363
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:13,851
Okay. Let's eat.

364
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:52,014
So I dated that jerk for a long time

365
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:54,516
and broke up early this year.

366
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:04,068
What? Why are you grinning like that?

367
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:05,444
Are you laughing at me?

368
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,321
It's not that.

369
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:10,657
You had a boyfriend before too.

370
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:12,493
I did?

371
00:27:13,577 --> 00:27:15,954
What do you mean?
That was my first relationship.

372
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:17,748
What? No, it isn't.

373
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:21,668
You said you were dating,
so I gave up last time.

374
00:27:22,795 --> 00:27:23,712
"Gave up"?

375
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:32,429
What?

376
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:35,474
Hey, don't you need to drive?

377
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:37,267
You're my first love.

378
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:45,067
What?

379
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,073
I had a crush on you,

380
00:27:51,156 --> 00:27:54,785
but you were leaving for Seoul,
so I was about to tell you I liked you.

381
00:27:55,661 --> 00:27:58,789
But you said you had a boyfriend,
so I gave up.

382
00:28:05,462 --> 00:28:07,673
I told you I had a boyfriend?

383
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:12,428
Not to me. You told someone else.

384
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:15,931
I don't remember saying that.

385
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:20,227
I guess I didn't want to get teased
for not having a boyfriend.

386
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:24,606
Hang on.

387
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,985
Is that why you didn't come to see me
when I was leaving?

388
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:30,738
Yes.

389
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:33,782
Hey, I was so upset about that!

390
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:39,413
Would you have accepted me
if I confessed my feelings to you?

391
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:47,254
I don't know. But I would've
stayed in touch with you.

392
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:50,841
We were best friends.

393
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:56,889
Then I guess things
would have been different.

394
00:29:00,684 --> 00:29:03,187
I don't know! You were such an idiot.

395
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:13,530
-Look at the red dot.
-Okay.

396
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,115
One, two, three.

397
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,243
You did great.

398
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:19,620
It's my turn now.

399
00:29:39,723 --> 00:29:40,808
Can I sit here?

400
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:44,228
You're already sitting there.

401
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:47,731
Are you with someone?

402
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:50,025
No, I'm not.

403
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:09,086
Can you hand me the menu?

404
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:11,463
Sure.

405
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:29,523
That butterfly is pretty.

406
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:32,442
What meaning does it have?

407
00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:36,113
The ugliness and pain of happiness,

408
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:37,531
and lack of freedom.

409
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:39,658
That's what butterfly tattoos symbolize.

410
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:40,993
I see.

411
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,204
I just did it
because I like butterflies, though.

412
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:47,291
Come to think of it,
butterflies look so pretty

413
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,293
but some people say

414
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:52,963
if you rub your eyes after touching
butterfly wings, you'll become blind.

415
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:57,009
That's not true.

416
00:30:57,926 --> 00:31:00,679
There's a kind of scale powder
on their wings,

417
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:04,808
and it's not really that harmful.
It can only cause some allergies.

418
00:31:06,268 --> 00:31:08,687
-No way.
-It's funny, right?

419
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:13,609
-What do you mean?
-People are so funny.

420
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:16,945
The butterflies are the ones
that get hurt.

421
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:18,989
If they lose their scales,

422
00:31:19,072 --> 00:31:21,825
they'll lose the patterns and colors
on their wings.

423
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:24,620
And they won't be able to fly.

424
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:31,543
Do you want to see some?

425
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:49,144
It was my last vacation in the military,

426
00:31:49,895 --> 00:31:52,689
and my friend asked
if I wanted to go see an exhibition.

427
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,526
To be honest, I don't know much about art.

428
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,737
It was my first time going
to an art exhibit.

429
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:00,739
Right.

430
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:03,033
But I saw someone

431
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:06,912
who really looked like you.

432
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:24,638
I was almost sure it was you,

433
00:32:25,138 --> 00:32:28,183
but it had been such a long time
so I couldn't call your name.

434
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,394
I regretted that after.

435
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:34,773
But I met you again on the bus.

436
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:38,110
It really was you at the exhibition.

437
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:42,114
My heart was beating like crazy.

438
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:44,199
Isn't that stupid?

439
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:20,670
Hey, Do-hyeok.

440
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:24,758
-Do-hyeok!
-Na-bi. Did you sleep well?

441
00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:28,720
Why did you give me the blankets
when you were sleeping outside?

442
00:34:28,804 --> 00:34:30,055
It's okay.

443
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,562
-The thing about Youtube is…
-That's right.

444
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:40,982
-It's no joke.
-You're talking about views, right?

445
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:43,443
Getting one million views is amazing.

446
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:44,945
-That's amazing.
-It is.

447
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:46,571
-Our couple number 12.
-Couple 12.

448
00:34:46,655 --> 00:34:49,116
When Jae-joon ordered noodles…

449
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,325
Gyeong-jun.

450
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,996
Gyeong-jun! You can't hear me, right?

451
00:35:08,385 --> 00:35:09,761
You startled me.

452
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,681
What the…

453
00:35:18,061 --> 00:35:21,022
-You're not wearing your glasses.
-No.

454
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:24,818
What?

455
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:26,987
What is it?

456
00:35:35,287 --> 00:35:36,746
My glasses.

457
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,998
What?

458
00:35:38,582 --> 00:35:41,126
-Those are my glasses.
-What do you mean? They're mine.

459
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:43,753
Oh, they're yours.

460
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:45,255
Then where are mine?

461
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:47,007
Yours?

462
00:35:47,716 --> 00:35:48,550
Oh.

463
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:50,260
I see.

464
00:35:50,343 --> 00:35:53,054
No wonder. You looked a bit weird.

465
00:35:53,597 --> 00:35:54,431
Here.

466
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:02,856
What is it this time?

467
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:05,650
-Thankfully, it doesn't smell.
-What?

468
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:08,486
I guess you just fart loudly.

469
00:36:09,362 --> 00:36:12,199
What are you talking about? That's not me!

470
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:14,618
You were pretty loud!

471
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:16,870
-Farty pants!
-It wasn't me!

472
00:36:16,953 --> 00:36:18,246
Jeez.

473
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,333
What's with you? I told you, it wasn't me!

474
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,793
You're so annoying!

475
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:48,568
YU NA-BI

476
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:01,516
What are you doing here?

477
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:03,852
Hey.

478
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:07,897
Did you see Bit-na by any chance?

479
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:09,149
No, I didn't.

480
00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:10,942
Okay.

481
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:14,487
Are you joining the workshop?

482
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:16,614
No. I'm not going.

483
00:38:16,698 --> 00:38:20,243
Why? Everyone will make a fuss
if they hear you're not going.

484
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,830
What about Na-bi?

485
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,499
Na-bi's not coming either.

486
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:29,419
-You didn't know?
-No.

487
00:38:30,962 --> 00:38:32,630
We're not talking much these days.

488
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:37,761
You did something wrong, didn't you?

489
00:38:39,471 --> 00:38:40,805
Well…

490
00:38:42,057 --> 00:38:43,224
I'm not sure.

491
00:38:43,892 --> 00:38:46,770
Don't lie. You know what it is.

492
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:51,358
But still, she likes you.

493
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:55,862
Can't you treat her sincerely?

494
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,497
Na-bi, be careful
when you're taking them out.

495
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,332
Don't worry.

496
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:23,598
My stomach hurts.

497
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:26,393
You must've drunk so much.

498
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:28,478
I guess it was fun.

499
00:39:29,562 --> 00:39:32,440
-The food was so delicious.
-I know.

500
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:34,984
And the beach was so pretty.

501
00:39:37,946 --> 00:39:40,365
I should head back to Seoul soon.

502
00:39:40,448 --> 00:39:41,991
I'm resting too much.

503
00:39:42,575 --> 00:39:44,744
That's why you came, though.

504
00:39:44,828 --> 00:39:47,539
Oh, but you should fix that shelf
for me before you go.

505
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:49,499
Okay.

506
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:53,086
Look at how pretty they are.

507
00:39:54,254 --> 00:39:56,089
These look a bit strange, though.

508
00:39:56,172 --> 00:39:59,467
Why is the color different?
It's the same glaze.

509
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:01,344
It was a bit windy a while ago.

510
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:03,346
Even if you apply the same glaze,

511
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,558
they look different depending
on the humidity or temperature.

512
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,060
So once you start baking them,

513
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:11,855
you don't get to decide
what color they turn out to be.

514
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:14,732
Doesn't that make you uneasy?

515
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:18,987
What do you mean?
It's fun because it's unpredictable.

516
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,614
That's why
I've been doing pottery for so long.

517
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:23,992
I tried baking glass with glaze on it,

518
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:27,412
and the color came out different
each time. It was cool.

519
00:40:33,168 --> 00:40:34,669
You're saying the same thing.

520
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,380
What? Same as who?

521
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:40,425
Never mind.

522
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:43,761
It's getting scary to do sculpture though.

523
00:40:44,637 --> 00:40:47,182
One mistake could ruin everything.

524
00:40:47,974 --> 00:40:51,227
I feel like it'll be better
to do something digital

525
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:53,563
where I can save and undo my work.

526
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:56,733
My goodness.
You're not living up to your name.

527
00:40:57,317 --> 00:40:58,902
You know why your name's Na-bi?

528
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:01,696
Yes. You said you named me
because your favorite author--

529
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:05,325
No. You said you had to present it
at school,

530
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:07,076
so I made that up.

531
00:41:07,577 --> 00:41:08,995
What?

532
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:12,874
Your mom says she named you like that
so your life would be as sweet as honey.

533
00:41:12,957 --> 00:41:15,001
But butterflies don't always eat honey.

534
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:19,255
Insects and poop
are all nutrients for them too.

535
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:21,841
Everything you're going through
in your life right now

536
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:23,801
are your nutrients.

537
00:41:24,677 --> 00:41:26,346
So what's there to fear?

538
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,312
To be honest,
I don't think I can take it anymore.

539
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:38,399
When we're together, she acts like
I'm the only one in her life,

540
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:41,778
so I thought she cared for me too.

541
00:41:42,654 --> 00:41:46,407
But then when she gets interested
in something else, she ignores me.

542
00:41:47,116 --> 00:41:50,036
So I keep getting depressed
even while I'm with her.

543
00:41:50,703 --> 00:41:55,124
She does say that she likes me.
I want to believe that,

544
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,793
but I can't help doubting it.

545
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:01,089
This isn't what I'm usually like.

546
00:42:03,383 --> 00:42:06,427
Maybe I should have just stuck
to being friends with her.

547
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:08,680
I've never seen you talk so much.

548
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,434
Why was I blabbering on about that to you?

549
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,979
Have you told her honestly

550
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:18,189
about what you just said?

551
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:19,732
No. Never.

552
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:22,318
It's not easy to be honest with her.

553
00:42:23,528 --> 00:42:25,905
-What?
-I have pride, you know.

554
00:42:27,073 --> 00:42:31,077
I'm already upset since I feel like
I'm the only one who likes her.

555
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,329
What do you want from her?

556
00:42:33,913 --> 00:42:37,625
Certainty about the relationship
and sincerity toward me.

557
00:42:39,085 --> 00:42:40,503
That's unrealistic.

558
00:42:40,587 --> 00:42:43,923
As soon as you have certainty,
that relationship becomes weak.

559
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:48,011
How does one get

560
00:42:49,095 --> 00:42:50,221
that certainty?

561
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:52,890
Are you sure it'll help you?

562
00:42:53,766 --> 00:42:55,935
You're pretty twisted, aren't you?

563
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:58,021
I think you're the one who's twisted.

564
00:42:58,104 --> 00:43:01,566
But anyway, I'm sure there's a reason
why she's staying by your side.

565
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,543
SONG SEO-YEON: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
KIM EUN-JU: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY?

566
00:43:36,643 --> 00:43:37,977
KANG SEO-YEON: YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME
IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY!

567
00:44:23,523 --> 00:44:25,858
Oh, Do-hyeok. Come inside.

568
00:44:25,942 --> 00:44:26,901
Yes.

569
00:45:06,607 --> 00:45:08,734
This place is so pretty.

570
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:12,947
What?

571
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:16,576
I think I remember this place.

572
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:18,619
-Really?
-Yes.

573
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:22,623
You know what?

574
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,918
They say that if you catch a falling leaf
and make a wish,

575
00:45:26,002 --> 00:45:27,545
it'll come true.

576
00:45:29,213 --> 00:45:32,592
What? You believe stuff like that?

577
00:45:32,675 --> 00:45:34,218
It's romantic.

578
00:45:35,052 --> 00:45:36,304
You don't?

579
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:38,306
No.

580
00:45:39,474 --> 00:45:40,516
I don't.

581
00:45:41,225 --> 00:45:42,101
Why?

582
00:45:43,102 --> 00:45:45,396
Just because. There's no evidence.

583
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,065
But that's why I like it.

584
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:50,610
I just have to believe in it. That's all.

585
00:45:53,696 --> 00:45:54,655
Is that so?

586
00:46:11,756 --> 00:46:13,716
-I caught one.
-Make a wish.

587
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:21,390
I don't believe stuff like this.

588
00:46:21,974 --> 00:46:24,268
Forget it. Just give me the camera.

589
00:46:31,108 --> 00:46:35,029
Do-hyeok, why don't you try uploading
vlogs of your daily life?

590
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:38,491
You can film stuff like preparing
to open your restaurant

591
00:46:38,574 --> 00:46:41,369
instead of always just showing
your hands and scenery.

592
00:46:41,452 --> 00:46:43,371
I bet you'll get way more viewers.

593
00:46:43,454 --> 00:46:45,831
Are my videos boring?

594
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:48,376
It's not that.

595
00:46:52,255 --> 00:46:55,258
You look really great on camera.

596
00:46:55,341 --> 00:46:58,719
If you reveal your face,
I'm sure you'll get way more subscribers.

597
00:46:59,428 --> 00:47:01,764
-No way. Come on.
-Hey, just once.

598
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:03,641
Just once. Please?

599
00:47:12,608 --> 00:47:13,985
What's that?

600
00:47:14,652 --> 00:47:16,612
One, two, three.

601
00:47:17,405 --> 00:47:18,990
See? You look great.

602
00:47:19,073 --> 00:47:21,784
-Let me take a photo of you too.
-No, not me.

603
00:47:23,077 --> 00:47:24,287
I look awful in photos.

604
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,038
No, you looked pretty.

605
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:28,874
What?

606
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:34,297
Oh, to be honest,
I took a photo of you last time.

607
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,881
-Sorry.
-When?

608
00:47:36,507 --> 00:47:38,884
-At the beach.
-Do you have it now?

609
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:40,177
-Yes.
-Let me see.

610
00:47:50,438 --> 00:47:51,689
They look good, right?

611
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:54,317
Well…

612
00:47:55,192 --> 00:47:56,277
This one is nice.

613
00:48:01,574 --> 00:48:02,533
They came out nice.

614
00:48:24,513 --> 00:48:25,348
Happy birthday.

615
00:48:25,431 --> 00:48:26,682
Thanks.

616
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:30,186
-You don't have a gift for me?
-A gift?

617
00:48:31,312 --> 00:48:34,190
Of course I do.
But I don't know if you'll like it.

618
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,664
-Did you want this that badly?
-I must have lost my mind.

619
00:48:50,998 --> 00:48:52,124
I wanted to have it.

620
00:48:54,752 --> 00:48:57,797
I lied to your friend Na-bi.

621
00:48:58,964 --> 00:49:02,218
-Lied about what?
-She asked if we were dating,

622
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,178
and I said yes.

623
00:49:07,515 --> 00:49:11,018
She believed me right away.
I didn't know she'd disappear like that.

624
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:13,646
Sorry about that.

625
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:24,281
She didn't just stay quiet though.

626
00:49:46,011 --> 00:49:46,971
We're here.

627
00:49:48,472 --> 00:49:49,306
You should go.

628
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:53,436
-I'll come and pick you up tomorrow.
-No, it's fine.

629
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:55,896
I'll see you at the market.
I can go there alone.

630
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,857
It's dangerous at that hour.

631
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,067
I'll be off. See you tomorrow.

632
00:50:01,277 --> 00:50:02,445
Okay…

633
00:50:09,618 --> 00:50:12,455
PARK JAE-EON

634
00:50:14,957 --> 00:50:15,916
PARK JAE-EON

635
00:50:19,587 --> 00:50:21,881
PARK JAE-EON
WHERE ARE YOU, LET'S TALK

636
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:43,110
Na-bi, let's eat some apples.

637
00:50:44,153 --> 00:50:45,571
Okay. I'm all done.

638
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:56,832
"Where are you? Let's talk."

639
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:00,002
That means you're angry, right?

640
00:51:01,629 --> 00:51:03,172
What's this random question?

641
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:07,134
I promised myself I would never date

642
00:51:07,218 --> 00:51:09,303
while watching my mom.

643
00:51:09,386 --> 00:51:11,889
When did you make such a decision?

644
00:51:11,972 --> 00:51:13,682
When I was little.

645
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:15,643
The day before I left for Seoul,

646
00:51:15,726 --> 00:51:18,229
Mom came here and cried her eyes out.

647
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:19,563
Oh, that day.

648
00:51:20,147 --> 00:51:22,441
She really liked that man.

649
00:51:23,317 --> 00:51:25,528
It was pretty intense.

650
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:29,365
I told her he was a scumbag
and that she should break up with him,

651
00:51:29,448 --> 00:51:31,075
but she never listened.

652
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:33,452
But still, she dated him.

653
00:51:33,536 --> 00:51:36,789
There was nothing between us.
I don't know why I did that.

654
00:51:36,872 --> 00:51:38,707
I was so stupid. It's so embarrassing.

655
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:40,835
This is the worst.

656
00:51:41,418 --> 00:51:45,047
Hey, there is always
something between people.

657
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:53,264
I still respect your mom.

658
00:51:53,347 --> 00:51:54,765
She got so hurt,

659
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:57,893
but she falls passionately in love
with new people.

660
00:52:00,271 --> 00:52:01,647
That's nonsense.

661
00:52:02,648 --> 00:52:05,401
Your mom said that dating

662
00:52:05,484 --> 00:52:08,445
isn't about picking the nicest person.

663
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:10,781
It's about meeting someone special to you.

664
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,036
I think that's why she failed each time.

665
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,246
You're wrong about that.

666
00:52:17,872 --> 00:52:19,456
If she failed each time,

667
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,959
how could she have gotten
such a precious daughter?

668
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:27,423
Here.

669
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,761
The shelf's crooked.

670
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:35,806
Oh, no. I drilled all the holes already.

671
00:52:37,266 --> 00:52:39,977
Why isn't anything working out?

672
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:04,877
You look great today, as usual. Come in.

673
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,133
Happy birthday.

674
00:53:12,134 --> 00:53:14,720
I heard that there's a lot of things

675
00:53:14,803 --> 00:53:17,014
to carry and move for sculpture majors.

676
00:53:19,558 --> 00:53:20,476
This is too much.

677
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,186
Let me at least do this.

678
00:53:29,902 --> 00:53:31,070
Thank you.

679
00:53:38,827 --> 00:53:39,995
Mom.

680
00:53:41,705 --> 00:53:43,916
Did the performance go well?

681
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:46,251
Yes. I'm performing in Paris next.

682
00:53:49,213 --> 00:53:50,506
How is Paris?

683
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,258
It's nice.

684
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,136
Do you want to come with me?

685
00:53:58,681 --> 00:54:00,099
Someone wanted to go there.

686
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,726
It must be someone you like.

687
00:54:05,562 --> 00:54:06,522
No.

688
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:09,984
Just someone bothersome.

689
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:18,826
Jae-eon.

690
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,079
You know what I regret the most?

691
00:54:24,123 --> 00:54:26,291
Not knowing my own feelings.

692
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:27,626
No…

693
00:54:29,545 --> 00:54:30,796
pretending not to know.

694
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,219
Who would love someone

695
00:54:37,302 --> 00:54:39,346
who doesn't even take care of themselves?

696
00:55:17,676 --> 00:55:18,927
All right.

697
00:55:50,584 --> 00:55:53,045
Who would love someone

698
00:55:53,128 --> 00:55:55,130
who doesn't even take care of themselves?

699
00:55:57,508 --> 00:56:01,887
I know very well that a person
who doesn't know how to love someone

700
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:03,138
can never be happy.

701
00:56:03,722 --> 00:56:05,307
That's what you hate the most.

702
00:56:05,808 --> 00:56:07,392
Getting clingy.

703
00:56:07,976 --> 00:56:09,186
What?

704
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:12,022
You always draw the line like this.

705
00:56:13,107 --> 00:56:16,026
You just want to see me when you want,

706
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,653
but you're scared I'll get clingy?

707
00:56:17,736 --> 00:56:19,321
Don't worry.

708
00:56:19,905 --> 00:56:21,740
That's not going to happen.

00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:15,544
YANG DO-HYEOK

712
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:32,853
It's what you made for me.

713
00:57:35,314 --> 00:57:37,858
You still have that? I'm touched.

714
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:44,031
Of course. You gave it to me. Good night.

715
00:57:46,617 --> 00:57:47,910
Good night.

716
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:03,300
Hey, Na-bi.

717
00:58:04,218 --> 00:58:05,636
-Hi.
-Hi.

718
00:58:14,311 --> 00:58:15,687
Did you sleep well?

719
00:58:15,771 --> 00:58:18,774
-Yes. You?
-Me too.

720
00:58:18,857 --> 00:58:20,192
-Should we go?
-Okay.

721
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:14,538
-Sir.
-Yes?

722
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:15,706
Can you watch these?

723
00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:18,000
-Sure. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

724
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,543
Thank you.

725
00:59:27,551 --> 00:59:29,052
Hey, let's try this.

726
00:59:33,932 --> 00:59:35,892
-Could we have some sweet potatoes?
-Okay.

727
00:59:35,976 --> 00:59:37,728
Hello.

728
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:39,646
Oh, you brought your girlfriend.

729
00:59:41,189 --> 00:59:44,234
You two look so sweet together.

730
00:59:44,735 --> 00:59:46,361
We're not…

731
00:59:47,237 --> 00:59:49,448
-Well…
-Why aren't you saying anything?

732
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:54,786
That will be 8,000 won.

733
00:59:56,121 --> 00:59:57,497
Some potatoes too.

734
00:59:57,581 --> 00:59:59,458
-Potatoes?
-Just a few.

735
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:01,376
Let's see.

736
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,045
You look so happy.

737
01:00:03,795 --> 01:00:05,213
That's 13,000 won.

738
01:00:05,297 --> 01:00:06,298
Thirteen thousand?

739
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:10,302
I'll give you a discount
since your girlfriend is so pretty.

740
01:00:10,385 --> 01:00:12,846
-Just give me 10,000 won.
-Thank you.

741
01:00:12,929 --> 01:00:14,931
-You're so pretty.
-Thank you.

742
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:18,143
-You got a discount thanks to me.
-Okay. I'll cook something nice.

743
01:00:18,226 --> 01:00:20,187
-Bye.
-Bye.

744
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:22,022
It's so pretty.

745
01:00:22,105 --> 01:00:23,190
How much are those?

746
01:00:23,273 --> 01:00:25,442
Those flowers? They're 23,000 won.

747
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:27,444
-What? 23,000 won?
-Yes.

748
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:29,029
-I'll take those.
-All right.

749
01:00:30,572 --> 01:00:31,740
-Hey.
-What?

750
01:00:31,823 --> 01:00:33,992
It's fine. We'll come back next time.

751
01:00:39,998 --> 01:00:41,958
It seems like it's broken.

752
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:46,672
Why did you do that, Do-hyeok?

753
01:00:46,755 --> 01:00:49,049
-I didn't do it.
-Jeez.

754
01:00:50,384 --> 01:00:51,385
Hey, Na-bi.

755
01:00:53,762 --> 01:00:56,098
Hey, it's really Na-bi!

756
01:00:57,307 --> 01:01:00,394
-Who…
-Oh, I guess you don't remember.

757
01:01:00,477 --> 01:01:02,396
My cousin, Do-yeon.

758
01:01:04,189 --> 01:01:08,110
Oh, right. Do-yeon.

759
01:01:08,193 --> 01:01:09,361
It's been a long time.

760
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:12,781
-You're unbelievable!
-Don't say anything weird.

761
01:01:12,864 --> 01:01:15,200
I mean, I was so surprised.
You look so pretty!

762
01:01:15,283 --> 01:01:17,160
-You're right.
-No…

763
01:01:17,244 --> 01:01:19,454
You've grown so much.
I didn't recognize you.

764
01:01:20,122 --> 01:01:24,292
Na-bi. The tire's flat.
You can't ride it now.

765
01:01:24,376 --> 01:01:25,335
Did I do that?

766
01:01:25,419 --> 01:01:29,214
No, it's not your fault.
I think someone played a prank.

767
01:01:29,297 --> 01:01:32,092
-Let's go get it fixed.
-Okay.

768
01:01:32,175 --> 01:01:33,468
There's no need for that.

769
01:01:33,969 --> 01:01:35,804
You two can ride yours together.

770
01:01:35,887 --> 01:01:38,098
I'll get this fixed and ride it home.

771
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,894
What are you waiting for? Come on.

772
01:01:43,478 --> 01:01:44,604
Bye.

773
01:01:45,856 --> 01:01:48,525
-See you later, Do-yeon.
-Thanks!

774
01:02:02,414 --> 01:02:03,457
What are you doing?

775
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:06,793
Oh, in case it's uncomfortable for you.

776
01:02:13,842 --> 01:02:14,968
Get on.

777
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,106
Let's go.

778
01:02:52,631 --> 01:02:54,466
Are you sleeping here with your friends?

779
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:57,219
No, I'm going to sleep at my aunt's.

780
01:02:58,428 --> 01:03:01,473
Really? Then I'll take you home.
I need to tell you something.

781
01:03:01,556 --> 01:03:02,849
Tell me what?

782
01:03:02,933 --> 01:03:04,226
I'll tell you later.

783
01:03:22,744 --> 01:03:24,996
Do-hyeok, where should I put this?

784
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,916
Over there. No, I'll put that away.

785
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,632
Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.

786
01:04:19,175 --> 01:04:20,927
Hello. I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

787
01:05:22,781 --> 01:05:24,282
How have you been?

788
01:05:24,366 --> 01:05:26,034
Fine. So-so.

789
01:05:26,117 --> 01:05:27,452
I haven't been well.

790
01:05:27,535 --> 01:05:31,498
His familiar smells are haunting me.

791
01:05:31,581 --> 01:05:34,125
He's charming.
I wouldn't mind if you went after him.

792
01:05:34,209 --> 01:05:36,628
They look like newlyweds.

793
01:05:36,711 --> 01:05:39,130
It's true that Na-bi is my first love.

794
01:05:39,214 --> 01:05:42,759
What is your relationship to Jae-eon?

795
01:05:42,842 --> 01:05:44,052
There's nothing between us.

796
01:05:44,844 --> 01:05:47,681
I kept thinking about you. I missed you.

797
01:05:47,764 --> 01:05:49,182
You have a girlfriend.

798
01:05:49,265 --> 01:05:50,100
That's not the issue.

799
01:05:50,183 --> 01:05:52,435
Stop playing games with me.

800
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:53,895
Let's end this.

801
01:05:53,979 --> 01:05:55,188
-Stop it.
-What?

802
01:05:55,271 --> 01:05:56,314
What you're doing right now.

803
01:05:56,398 --> 01:05:57,315
Where's Na-bi?

804
01:05:57,399 --> 01:05:59,484
-She said she's too tired to come.
-She's not coming?

805
01:05:59,567 --> 01:06:02,195
Just tell me if you don't want this.

806
01:06:03,321 --> 01:06:07,534
