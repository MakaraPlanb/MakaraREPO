1
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,062
You smell of cigarettes.

2
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,861
Should we continue after I brush my teeth?

3
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,279
What?

4
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,781
The others must be waiting. Let's go back.

5
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,453
<i><font color="white">I did it.</font></i>

6
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:14,801
EPISODE 3: IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.
NEVERTHELESS,

7
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,078
<i><font color="white">What is this emotion?</font></i>

8
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,464
<i><font color="white">I hope it's just love.</font></i>

9
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,134
<i><font color="white">Not childish jealousy.</font></i>

10
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,069
Something seems to be going on
between Na-bi and Jae-eon, right?

11
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,488
-Why do you say so?
-Those two

12
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,824
disappeared for a while last night.

13
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,660
And it seemed like something happened
between them.

14
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,787
I could tell from her expression.

15
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,583
And I saw them whispering something
by the door early in the morning.

16
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,252
I couldn't hear what they said though.

17
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,670
Are you the only one who saw?

18
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,715
Yes, and I didn't tell Bit-na.
Good thing I didn't, right?

19
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,800
-Good thinking.
-I'm starving.

20
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,344
The noodles are here.

21
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,973
It looks so good!

22
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,310
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

23
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,187
And don't say anything to Na-bi.

24
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,813
Don't worry.

25
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,607
I'm going to steal this from you!

26
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,991
Would it be okay though?

27
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,993
What? Your belly fat?

28
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,079
No! I mean Na-bi.

29
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,792
She's probably having a hard time
after breaking up with her ex.

30
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,086
She could get involved in gossip
by hanging out with him.

31
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,798
I don't think
she should be seeing Jae-eon.

32
00:04:58,882 --> 00:04:59,966
Really?

33
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,221
I think Jae-eon is better than her ex.

34
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,057
What? Really? Why?

35
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,812
I don't know. I can just feel it.

36
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,940
They look good together.

37
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,696
Got drunk and kissed…

38
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,865
RECENT SEARCHES
KISSING SOMEONE BEFORE DATING

39
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,576
I GOT DRUNK AND KISSED MY FRIEND
WHO I HAVE NO FEELINGS FOR

40
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,913
I MADE A MISTAKE WHILE DRUNK
EVERYONE THINKS WEIRDLY OF ME

41
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,290
I GOT DRUNK AND KISSED MY FRIEND
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

42
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,210
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT AFTER
WAS IT JUST A DRUNKEN MISTAKE?

43
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,712
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
ONCE YOU'VE TOUCHED FIRST BASE

44
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,881
YOU'LL END UP BECOMING SP
OR DRIFTING APART

45
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,092
"SP"?

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,388
"SP"? As in…

47
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,891
"Sex partners"?

48
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,227
Na-bi.

49
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,480
You startled me.

50
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,856
What were you looking at?

51
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,776
Just looking for some references.

52
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,574
Sol.

53
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,036
If you want to kiss someone,

54
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,916
does that mean you want
to sleep with them as well?

55
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,211
Are you asking about me?

56
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,089
Or is it about you?

57
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,800
What? Me?

58
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,178
No, it's not about me.

59
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,058
I mean, generally. I just want to know
how people usually feel.

60
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,854
I'm just trying to come up
with an idea for my assignment.

61
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,106
I'm not sure.

62
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,443
I guess it'll depend on
who the other person is.

63
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,529
The other person…

64
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,484
SEOL-A

65
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,946
<i><font color="white">I just got on the plane!</font></i>

66
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,411
One-night…

67
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,207
<i><font color="white">I'm not sure.</font></i>

68
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,919
I guess it'll depend on
who the other person is.

69
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,920
"The other person"?

70
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,507
You may want to kiss and have sex
with someone,

71
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,552
or you might kiss someone
and not want to go further.

72
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,807
So in the end, it depends
on who the other person is.

73
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,892
<i><font color="white">Then what kind of person</font></i>

74
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,645
<i><font color="white">am I to him?</font></i>

75
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,107
ONE-NIGHT STAND?

76
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,127
PARK JAE-EON

77
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,505
SHOULDN'T WE TALK ABOUT YESTERDAY?

78
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,216
<i><font color="white">Would I seem too clingy?</font></i>

79
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,272
-Hey!
-Hi!

80
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,191
Hey, Na-bi.

81
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,609
Hi.

82
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,320
My battery's dead again.
Maybe I should get a new phone.

83
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,490
-Where's Ji-wan?
-She's meeting someone.

84
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,325
-What are you doing?
-I need a charger.

85
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,703
She's watching a movie
with her blind date.

86
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,496
She doesn't care much about school.

87
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,332
Let's see…

88
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,461
<i><font color="white">I want to ask</font></i>

89
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:10,800
<i><font color="white">what I should say to get Jae-eon
to tell me how he really feels about me.</font></i>

90
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,844
Do you really like that guy?

91
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,637
-Yes.
-You don't look that way.

92
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,598
Do you dance excitedly

93
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,850
whenever you like someone's post?

94
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,435
That's different though.

95
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,566
Why would you sleep with someone

96
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,820
you're not even dating?

97
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,031
Isn't that meaningless?

98
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,240
Gosh.

99
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,078
Why do you always associate sex
with dating? Are you that old-fashioned?

100
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,038
-Watch your mouth.
-Lower your voice!

101
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,665
-Someone might hear you.
-I'm not saying anything wrong.

102
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,335
I can say it even louder! Should I?

103
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,462
Let's begin class!

104
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,632
All right, let's begin class.

105
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,927
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello.

106
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,595
-Hello.
-Hello.

107
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,353
Try this.

108
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,690
-You're not with your cute friend today.
-She's hanging out with someone else.

109
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,360
She must be having fun.
I'll get you your food right away.

110
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,445
Thank you. Give us a large serving.

111
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,696
All right.

112
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,199
You must be a regular here.

113
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,494
Yes. My friend loves this place.

114
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,413
But this place is quite famous
in this neighborhood.

115
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,250
Danpunggol was the most popular
when I was in school.

116
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,752
You went to school here?

117
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,462
Yes. I was an Economics major.

118
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,215
-I graduated two years ago.
-I see.

119
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,515
I'm really sorry about last time.

120
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,892
I put in an estimated amount.

121
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,270
Tell me if it's not enough.

122
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,938
It's really fine.

123
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,191
It's okay. Keep it.

124
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,534
This isn't why I asked to see you.

125
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,995
Sorry? Then why…

126
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,001
Here's your food.

127
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,920
It's hot, so be careful. Enjoy.

128
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:11,963
Thank you.

129
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,176
-What's wrong?
-You're really strong.

130
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,844
Do you work out?

131
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,179
Oh, I major in sculpture.

132
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,100
I always work with clay,
so I have a lot of strength in my hands.

133
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,610
Just buy me this meal. That's enough.

134
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,614
I wouldn't feel comfortable with that.

135
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,827
-Then buy me coffee, too.
-I'll buy dessert as well.

136
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,204
Okay.

137
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,082
-Like this?
-Yes.

138
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,335
-Do it like that.
-Thank you.

139
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,886
That's it for today.

140
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,597
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

141
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,433
The weather is so nice today.

142
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,352
You should all go on a date.

143
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,354
-Okay.
-Come on.

144
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,482
Why aren't you answering?

145
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,359
Don't tell me you guys are all single.

146
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:19,781
You should at least
have one proper relationship at your age.

147
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,493
What they say about art
coming from loneliness is nonsense.

148
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:28,039
Dating is the best way
to get inspiration for art.

149
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,333
She's at it again.

150
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,210
Didn't she say class was over?

151
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,296
Love is what can make
even the roughest person become

152
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,008
as soft as sand on a beach.

153
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,428
I can't believe you guys.

154
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,305
You guys are art majors, you know.

155
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,474
They have no inspiration.

156
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,396
One student told me a while ago

157
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,731
that he doesn't want a relationship.

158
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,692
He just wants to flirt and date around.

159
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,530
Basically, he wants to have fun
with no strings attached.

160
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,199
He should have one-night stands instead.

161
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,702
It's so sad, isn't it?

162
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,662
Goodness.

163
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,541
Find your inspirations, all right?

164
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,251
-Yes, ma'am.
-That's what art is.

165
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,919
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

166
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,922
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for today.

167
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,853
PARK YE-SOM, KANG SEO-YEON, LEE YE-HWA

YU NA-BI

WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

170
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,829
Jae-eon.

171
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,876
Welcome back.

172
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,086
You've gotten more handsome.

173
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,178
You must've enjoyed it, Ji-wan.

174
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,514
Yes, it was so fun.
It was much better than I expected.

175
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,517
-I want to watch it again with my friend.
-Your friend?

176
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,937
-It's not a guy, right?
-It's a girl, of course.

177
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,648
Her name's Sol. She's been my bestie
since middle school.

178
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,026
I think she'll enjoy it, too.

179
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,152
I'll watch it with her.

180
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,114
Then Ji-wan,

181
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,617
watch it again with me next time, too.

182
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,869
Well, okay.

183
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,538
But you didn't seem to enjoy it
as much as I did.

184
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,540
I really enjoyed it too.

185
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,628
It wasn't what I expected though.

186
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,631
-What do you mean?
-I thought it would be about romance,

187
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,966
but it was about friendship.

188
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,719
Oh. Friendship?

189
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:50,223
I felt that it was clearly about love,

190
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,266
but I guess you could've seen it that way.

191
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,227
Still, it was good.

192
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,981
If you're hungry, should we go eat?

193
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,983
Yes. I'm really hungry.

194
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,113
I said I'd buy. Why did you pay?

195
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,951
Well, I didn't think it'd be enough
to repay me.

196
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,912
I knew it.

197
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,754
Can you pay next time?

198
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,340
I'd like to see you again.

199
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:26,801
Why?

200
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,472
It was fun hearing about your projects.

201
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,059
-You ate…
-I eat quite a lot.

202
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,270
Hey, it's Sol.

203
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,230
She's the friend I just told you about.

204
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,442
That's strange.
I'm not really a smooth talker.

205
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,652
No, I really enjoyed listening to you.

206
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,531
Who's that next to her?

207
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,366
Where are you headed now?

208
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,535
I'm taking the bus here.

209
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,621
-I'll come with you.
-No, I can go by myself.

210
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,251
Why don't you try calling her?

211
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,003
No, it's fine.

212
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,840
You two must be really close.

213
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,176
Yes.

214
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,344
Let's go.

215
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,641
SCULPTURE STUDIO 3

216
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,674
I'm so hungry.

217

<i><font color="white">Jae-eon still isn't contacting me.</font></i>

218

00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,648
Hey, Seol-a.

224
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,443
I knew it was you.

225
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,863
Hang on. I'll be there soon.

226
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,640
<i><font color="white">Who is Seol-a?</font></i>

227
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,977
Seol-a.

228
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,237
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-It's okay.

229
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,948
-<i><font color="white">Who is she…</font></i>
-Should we get something to drink?

230

-<i><font color="white">to make him smile…</font></i>
-Okay.

231
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,826
-<i><font color="white">like that?</font></i>
-Let's go.

232
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,925

233
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,094

234
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,727

235
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,940
<i><font color="white">She's the one Jae-eon's heart belongs to.</font></i>

236
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,445
Welcome.

237
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,406
Oh, Na-bi!

238
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,119
I sat next to you yesterday.

239
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,579
You stole my water, remember?

240
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,540
Oh, that's my water.

241
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,380
Oh, right. The freshman.
Your name is Kang Eun-han, right?

242
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,006
It's Kim Eun-han.

243
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,217
You're bad at remembering people.

244
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,928
Sorry, there were
so many people yesterday.

245
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,054
Do you work here?

246
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,181
Yes. Just in the evenings. I just started.

247
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,517
Was it fun last night?

248
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,771
I wanted to hang out longer,
but I had to come and work.

249
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,816
You haven't had dinner?

250
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,818
No. I was working on my assignment.

251
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,530
In that case. I was saving this,

252
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,574
but you can have it.

253
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,868
No, it's fine. You should have it.

254
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,244
It's okay.

255
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,371
I want you to have it.

256
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,373
Thanks.

257
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,792
I'll enjoy this.
Good luck with work, then.

258
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,127
Na-bi.

259
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,045
Can you give me your phone?

260
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,215
-My phone?
-Yes.

261
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,894
Do you know them?

262
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,022
You keep looking at them.

263
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,442
A freshman in our department.
He must work there.

264
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,693
Not him.

265
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,157
Is that girl a freshman, too?

266
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,658
Here's my number.

267
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,161
-I'll contact you later.
-Okay.

268
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,872
No. She's my senior.

269
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,250
Or maybe a friend.

270
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,341
-Take care, then.
-Bye.

271
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,884
-See you later.
-See you.

272
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,684
You're still using that?

273
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,147
-What about you?
-Me?

274
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,109
I lost it a long time ago.

275
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,155
That's disappointing.

276
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,910
How are your butterflies doing?

277
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,953
They're fine.

278
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,665
But I'm going to set them free soon.

279
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,291
Why?

280
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,169
I feel guilty.

281
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,257
They're supposed to be free,
but they're locked up

282
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,008
because of me.

283
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,971
You've grown up.

284
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,559
That girl…

285
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,895
Her name's Na-bi.

286
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,943
So you haven't grown up.
You just found another butterfly.

287
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,070
It's not like that.

288
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,614
She's just a friend.

289
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,909
You're lying.

290
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,037
Even her name is Na-bi.

291
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,456
Is it fate?

292
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,959
Don't be ridiculous.

293
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,211
You're my fate.

294
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,509

297
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,403

298
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,946
He messaged me right away.

299
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,657
<i><font color="white">Right. Hi.</font></i>

300
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,951
<i><font color="white">Are you coming to the flea market?</font></i>

301
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,494
<i><font color="white">I'm serving at our booth!</font></i>

302
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,456
<i><font color="white">Or you can come to the after-party.</font></i>

303
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,917
<i><font color="white">I hope you'll come.</font></i>

304
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,753
<i><font color="white">Okay, then.</font></i>

305
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,298
<i><font color="white">Really? Then I'll see you there!</font></i>

306
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,388
<i><font color="white">To be honest, it doesn't feel bad.</font></i>

307
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,485
<i><font color="white">By the way, are there days
when you don't have class?</font></i>

308
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,321
<i><font color="white">Oh, was that too personal?</font></i>

309
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,697
<i><font color="white">My apologies.</font></i>

310
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,949
<i><font color="white">Good night. See you at the festival!</font></i>

311
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,911
<i><font color="white">Sadly, I have class every day.</font></i>

312
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,038
<i><font color="white">Good night.</font></i>

313

PARK JAE-EON

314
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,884
Jae-eon!

315
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,889
No way! You can do glass art, too?

316
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,474
What are you making?

317
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,476
What?

318
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,271
Oh, I'm making a suncatcher.

319
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,732
It's so pretty.
You're making a butterfly again.

320
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,817
You really love butterflies, don't you?

321
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,949
What? Do you have a cold?

322
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,868
Stay away from me.

323
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,704
I don't know. I have a headache.

324
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,332
Are you sick from quitting Jae-eon?

325
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,959
Withdrawal symptoms?

326
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,502
What are you on about?

327
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,421
You haven't been hanging out with him.

328
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,298
Is it over now?

329
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,051
I don't think we really click.

330
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,015
I'm disappointed.

331
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,517
The quiet kids usually end up causing
huge trouble.

332
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,060
That disappoints you?

333
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,439
Of course. I was looking forward to
some drama. This is so boring.

334
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:11,236
You seem to want to push me into
Hell's pit just for your entertainment.

335
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,364
Come on, don't say it like that.

336
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,283
Like when you all came to my house.

337
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,036
Why did you have to talk about
testing him and stuff?

338
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,120
What about it?

339
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,957
Why? Did something happen
between you two that day?

340
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,806
I mean, it was useless
because nothing happened.

341
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,557
You saw what it was like.

342
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,978
Do you know what you need
to catch a big fish, Na-bi?

343
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,814
You're going to say "patience," right?

344
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,234
And he's not even a catch.

345
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:51,777
He isn't?

346
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,822
Well, it depends.

347
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,866
Anyhow, are you sure he doesn't date?

348
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,202
I'm sure. I told you.

349
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,831
Why? Did he ask you out?

350
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:08,502
No, it seemed like he was dating someone.
But maybe I'm mistaken.

351
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,754
Na-bi! Hi!

352
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,214
-Hi.
-Hi.

353
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,509
Hi, Eun-han. Are you going to eat lunch?

354
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,136
-Yes.
-Enjoy your lunch.

355
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,597
-You too.
-Okay.

356
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,687
What was that with Eun-han?

357
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,689
We got close recently.

358
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,025
Is there something about him, too?

359
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,112
No. Not that I know of.

360
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:40,450
I knew it. You're receiving attention
as soon as you come out of your bubble.

361
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,287
Gosh, but Eun-han's a bit boring.

362
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,456
Leave me out of your fun, okay?

363
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,627
So you're thinking of seeing him?

364
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,713
It's not like that.

365
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,800
This is a bit disappointing.

366
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,227
Hi.

367
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,897
You should get some vitamins.

368
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:13,859
Thanks.

369
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,985
How is that going?

370
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,615
It's bad. I'm screwed this semester.

371
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,618
No way. You're so good.

372
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,369
What do you know?

373
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,163
I know quite a lot.

374
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:31,209
I actually saw your piece when I was here
for the entrance exam last year.

375
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:32,920
Last year?

376
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,757
Then it would have been…

377
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,226
<i><font color="white">LOVE</font></i>
YU NA-BI

378
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,477
"<i><font color="white">Love</font></i>"?

379
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,063
"Yu Na-bi."

380
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,276
<i><font color="white">-The one about love?
-Yes.</font></i>

381
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,738
I got scolded for making the same thing
over and over.

382
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,949
I loved it. I even took a photo.

383
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,492
Let me see.

384
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,871
There aren't many pieces
that depict love just as it is.

385
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,250
Everyone thinks they have to
make it look cool.

386
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,419
Where is it?

387
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,339
Oh, right. I got a new phone.

388
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,800
Na-bi. Could I see it again?

389
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,510
I promise to back up my photos.

390
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,721
-Well…
-Yes?

391
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,556
I threw it away.

392
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,393
-Really?
-<i><font color="white">Because my ex was the inspiration.</font></i>

393
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,978
Is it really not here?

394
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,940
Thanks.

395
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,566
For what?

396
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,196
To be honest, I gave up on the piece
I was working on,

397
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,614
and I didn't know what to do.

398
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,075
But you cheered me up.

399
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:53,166
<i><font color="white">He does seem pretty cute.</font></i>

400
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,962
But it's a bit awkward
since you're talking so formally to me.

401
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:57,963
Just talk casually.

402
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,174
It's hard for me to do that
to people older than me.

403
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,467
Oh, really?

404
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,721
All right, then. Whatever you prefer.

405
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,764
No. I'll talk casually

406
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,766
from now on.

407
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,601
Okay.

408
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:15,772
Na-bi, everyone said this movie was good.
Did you watch it?

409
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,029
No, I didn't. I haven't been
to a movie theater in a while.

410
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,739
Do you want to watch it with me?

411
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,493
-Is it a romantic movie?
-Yes.

412
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,124
Hi.

413
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:35,834
Hello.

414
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,921
Oh, hi.

415
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,133
What are you two talking about?

416
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,553
We're going to watch a movie together.

417
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,265
Should we watch something else, then?

418
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,602
-Well…
-Hey.

419
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,604
You're talking casually to her?

420
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,067
Were you two close?

421
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,241
Yes. We're close.
Closer than you and me, anyway.

422
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,663
Let's watch this, Eun-han.
I like romantic movies.

423
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,083
Okay, then.

424
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,834
Hey.

425
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,879
Isn't this erotic?

426
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,714
That's better, then.

427
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,008
Let's watch it.

428
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,053
Right. You'll need a reference.

429
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,096
What do you mean?

430
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,680
The male lead.

431
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,724
He's a good kisser.

432
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,186
Na-bi's fussy about kisses.

433
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,690
Be careful because she'll push you away
if she doesn't like it.

434
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:41,900
See me outside.

435
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,080
-What was that about?
-What?

436
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,416
Why would you
suddenly mention kissing? Hey.

437
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,168
Stop playing games with me.

438
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,713
Playing games? You're the one
who pushed my hand away.

439
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,424
I never let you touch my shoulder.

440
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,551
There's nothing between us, you know.

441
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,428
-Why are you so upset?
-I'm not upset!

442
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,476
I'm not upset.

443
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,481
You never contacted me since that day.
You know that?

444
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,108
You didn't, either.

445
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,236
And what's so wrong about that?

446
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,244
I'm sorry,
but I'm not that kind of person.

447
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,956
What do you mean by that?

448
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,626
I thought you were enjoying it.

449
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,588
Don't worry.

450
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,090
I won't try anything with you.

451
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,052
Good luck with Eun-han.

452
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,727
Fine.

453
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,944
Well, you left your phone…

454
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,281
Right. Thanks.

455
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,366
Na-bi.

456
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,328
Should we go watch the movie?

457
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:21,750
All right.

458
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,602
Na-bi.

459
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,022
I like butterflies
way more than dragonflies.

460
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,440
You didn't eat, right?

461
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,860
This place is really amazing. Try it.

462
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:52,530
And you don't seem to be
in a good mood. So eat up.

463
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,699
You should eat to cheer up.

464
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,076
You should eat too.

465
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,790
-Here, have some water.
-Thank you.

466
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,875
Na-bi. That's my water.

467
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,294
Stop that!

468
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,755
-You seemed to like water.
-Stop it.

469
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,341
<i><font color="white">This is it.
Going on a date in the daytime.</font></i>

470
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,677
-Right.
-<i><font color="white">Sweet and innocent attraction.</font></i>

471
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,812
I saw it!

472
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,193
-"Miracle"?
-"Past"?

473
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,196
That's great.

474
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,906
-It's open.
-Yes! It's open!

475
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,246
Could you take a photo of us?

476
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,706
Thank you.

477
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,208
All right, then. One, two.

478
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,254
Can I have a combo set, please?

479
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,172
Which flavor would you like?

480
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,176
Well…

481
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,351
<i><font color="white">Eating and watching a movie together,

482

483
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,701
Come on, just once.

484
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,287
One, two, three.

485
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,293
It's a good photo. Let me take one of you.

486
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,171
One, two, three.

487
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,883
Let's eat.

488
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,385
Here.

489
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,307
Enjoy your meal.

490
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,605
This is really good.

491
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,023
-Is it?
-Yes.

492
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,524
<i><font color="white">Why do I…</font></i>

493
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,277
<i><font color="white">still have this on my phone?</font></i>

494
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,696
Na-bi.

495
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,533
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I got everything.

496
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,660
Oh, okay.

497
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,372
-Should I buy more?
-No, it's fine. Thanks.

498
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,126
This is really tasty.

499

What are you thinking, Na-bi?

507
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,005
I wasn't thinking of anything. Why?

508
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,884
You didn't seem to be in a good mood
since we were in the theater.

509
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,471
-So I thought you didn't like the movie.
-Well…

510
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,765
I'm just not feeling too good.

511
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,185
It was a bit too cheesy, right?

512
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,895
Really?

513
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,732
I enjoyed it a lot.

514
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,611
It made me want to have
a relationship like that too.

515
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,072
I suddenly got that feeling…

516
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,122
Actually, I heard you and Jae-eon earlier.

517
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,126
Oh, I see.

518
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,089
-But he's…
-I know. It's over now, right?

519
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,466
"Over"?

520
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,516
You know that he only hurts other people.

521
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,520
Don't let someone who was never sincere
toward you hurt you.

522
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,688
I know…

523
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,609
what it's like. But it's all meaningless.

524
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,236
And most of all,
you two don't suit each other.

525
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,450
All right.

526
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,829
Okay.

527
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,843
Sorry, Eun-han.

528
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,345
I…

529
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,097
I was about to sneeze.

530
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,349
Forget it.

531
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,853
I really did! Eun-han!

532
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,802
He is pretty cute, but…

533
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,476
Are you with someone?

534
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,811
Because you're cute.

00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,888
I should've been notified
at least three months in advance, then.

-<i><font color="white">Whatever. I relayed the message.</font></i>

548
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,938
Darn it.

Oh, my gosh!

-Na-bi!
-Hello!

551
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,742
Hey, you look really good in that.

552
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,410
Thank you, my lady.

553
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,371
Are you not coming to our booth?

554
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,208
I'm okay. How are the preparations going?

555
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,335
I'm sure it's going great.
They have Jae-eon.

556
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,171
My friends said they're coming,
but there might not be seats.

557
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,298
-You have friends?
-Of course I do!

558
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,844
So what will you do?
Can you find a house within a month?

559
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,431
If I can't, I'll have to find
a small studio or something.

560
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,433
Or some housemates.

561
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,936
What about all your stuff?

562
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:24,524
I guess I'll have to use
a storage service.

563
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,070
Darn it! What do I do?

564
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,988
The rent is expensive around here now.

565
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,741
It'll be impossible to find
another place with cheap rent.

566
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,035
I'm screwed!

567
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,038
Hey, calm down.

568
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,998
How much was the rent?

569
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,669
-Hello!
-Hello!

570
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,629
-Hi.
-Can we have more butane?

571
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,798
And where can we get more folding chairs?

572
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,216
In the clubroom.

573
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,634
Oh, right.

574
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,845
Tell Sol not to come to the booth.

575
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,681
She'll run into Professor Lee
and get nagged to death.

576
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,558
Why would she get nagged?

577
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,934
Don't you know?

578
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:01,936
The exchange program.

579
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,439
It's really exhausting for me, too.

580
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,067
She'll get a full scholarship.
What's holding her back?

581
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,736
Some people are dying to go.

582
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,905
It's not an easy decision to make though.
Here you go.

583
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,532
Exchange program?

584
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,410
What? You didn't know?

585
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,412
-No.
-How did you not know?

586
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,873
All the professors are going.

587
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,249
-Let's take these.
-Okay.

588
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,584
Let's go.

589
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,128
-I'll go with them.
-Bye.

590
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,337
Let's go.

591
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,925
What's going on?

592
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,927
Goodness.

593
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,199
What are you doing here?

594
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:57,867
Nothing.

595
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,037
Aren't you going to the flea market?

596
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,122
-Are you going to see Eun-han?
-What?

597
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,417
I heard something's going on
between you and him.

598
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,128
-I heard everything.
-From Bit-na, right?

599
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,379
I'm glad.

600
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,884
I don't know him well,
but he's way better than Jae-eon.

601
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,892
Last time, when the professor
called you and Sol…

602
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,436
It was because
of the exchange program, right?

603
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,230
Well…

604
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:31,818
Yes.

605
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,571
I see.

606
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,949
But Bit-na didn't hear from Sol, either.

607
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,828
Sol was probably thinking
of telling you first.

608
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,622
And I only heard when I met
the professor with her.

609
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:46,499
I don't know.

610
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:50,169
I bet she didn't tell me
because I'd feel upset.

611
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,588
Did I tell you before?

612
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,799
I started art because of Sol.

613
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:55,967
Really?

614
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,593
I didn't know.

615
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,972
She wanted to major in art
since she was in middle school.

616
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,474
And I worked so hard to join her.

617
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,271
I thought I'd at least be able
to keep up with her if I did my best.

618
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,608
But I guess there are things
you can never do.

619
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,194
I can barely get my assignments done.

620
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,198
I don't even know if I can graduate.

621
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,079
I'm so jealous of her.

622
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,416
That kind of presence
only comes naturally.

623
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,834
Right.

624
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,254
Some people are gifted like that.

625
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,219
Let's go to the flea market.

626
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,347
-All right. Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,443
Is everything going okay?

629
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,365
All right, the next two people. Come in.

630
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,743
She's just not my type.

631
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:10,875
Why is he here?

632
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,670
I know, right? He's not even here to help.

633
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,631
-He's not even paying.
-Right.

634
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,674
He's just here to watch us.

635
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,635
-That looks nice.
-No.

636
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:22,845
-Here you go.
-Can I…

637
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,847
have your number?

638
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,933
Sorry.

639
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,768
What was that? Namaste?

640
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,687
-I should use this gesture too.
-Where would you use that?

641
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:35,232
Hey, let's go.

642
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,901
Why? You wanted to come.

643
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,570
It's too noisy and crowded in here.

644
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,948
-And there aren't any pretty girls.
-But there are.

645
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,575
Let's just go. Come on.

646
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:47,078
Hey, they're leaving.

647
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,746
-What a relief.
-Why's he leaving?

648
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,706
-You're leaving?
-Yes!

649
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,376
Hey, they're gone. Go and serve the food.

650
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,379
Gosh. It's a festival,
but they're not selling drinks, Professor.

651
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,756
This is unbelievable.

652
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,051
-He really is popular, isn't he?
-This place is so nice.

653
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,595
-You're so handsome.
-Thank you.

654
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,305
-You must be tired.
-Can I have your number?

655
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,266
-Sorry.
-They're all smiling from ear to ear.

656
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,478
-Are you two dating?
-What? No!

657
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,481
Why are you overreacting?
Kids like you always end up dating.

658
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,984
Professor, that's never going to happen.

659
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,319
Watch what you say.
It could really happen.

660
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:23,656
No way. Hey, Jin-su. Come over here.

661
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,282
Professor, this is…

662
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,575
By the way,

663
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,663
that student over there.
He's Park Jae-eon, right?

664
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,289
-Yes.
-Yes.

665
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:36,168
I remember him since he's very competent.

666
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:41,590
I should get going.

667
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,217
-Have fun.
-All right.

668
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,386
-Don't cause any trouble.
-Okay.

669
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,430
-Jin-su will show you out.
-I'll escort you.

670
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,641
Okay. I have some work
to finish up, so I'll get going.

671
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,476
-Bye, then.
-I'll see you later.

672
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,104
-Bye.
-Don't cause any trouble.

673
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,272
Bye, Professor.

674
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,607
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

675
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,736
I thought she'd leave
like three hours ago.

676
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:06,198
So she remembers him
because of his competency?

677
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:10,494
I bet she remembers him
because he's so handsome.

678
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,455
Hey, where did you steal this?

679
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,040
We can't sell alcohol here.

680
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,791
I bought it at a convenience store.

681
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,668
Can't I even do that?

682
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:21,630
You're going to drink at the after-party.
Can't you hold yourself back?

683
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:25,551
Seriously, you nag more than my mom.

684
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:29,221
If you get drunk today, I'm really
going to abandon you on the streets.

685
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,690
That looks delicious.

686
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,276
Hey, Ji-wan! Over here.

687
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,446
Hey! You got really good seats.

688
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,865
Why don't you join us?
I'll introduce you to them.

689
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,658
No, I'm fine. Have fun.

690
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,160
Then call me if you get bored.

691
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,661
Okay.

692
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:54,663
-Have fun.
-Okay.

693
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,126
When did you come?

694
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,336
You should've called me.

695
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,672
ARTISTS THAT SHINE
LOOKING FOR ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE

696
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,388
This is the usual serving.

00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:14,475
But I added more
since you seemed like you'd eat a lot.

698
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,276
Eun-han.

699
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:30,991
Hey, Na-bi.

700
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,869
There are so many people.

701
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,123
-Our department's the most crowded.
-Right. Well…

702
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,000
-Are you here with anyone?
-What?

703
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,129
There are so many people.
I didn't think it'd get so crowded.

704
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,047
Maybe you should just go somewhere else.

705
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,800
No, I just came to see you for a moment.

706
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,009
As I promised.

707
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,806
Right.

708
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,182
Eun-han!

709
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:02,565
When do you get off?
We're thinking of getting drinks.

710
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,364
Who is she? Your friend?

711
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,200
She's a senior that I'm close with.

712
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,706
Oh, hello.

713
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:22,001
Right. Hi.

714
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:26,755
Well, why don't you go ahead first?
I'll join you after I finish.

715
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,049
Okay. Call me when you're done.

716
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,301
All right.

717
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,975
-I'll see you later, then.
-It's not like that.

718
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,854
I've liked her since I was in high school,
but she rejected me.

719
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,523
And she suddenly contacted me yesterday…

720
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,281
I'm really sorry.

721
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,824
All right.

722
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,585
Let's begin the game. Se-hun?

723
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,129
-All right. Let's spin the wheel!
-Spin the wheel!

724
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,256
-That looks fun.
-Let's try that later.

725
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,758
Speed quiz!

726
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,052
-Is it only for couples?
-I don't think so.

727
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,055
By the way, that guy has a crush
on Sol, right?

728
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,681
You got it right!

729
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,308
-Right or…
-Wrong.

730
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:21,560
How would I know?

731
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,897
I'm sure of it. I told him we were
Sol's friends,

732
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,565
and he gave us so much food.

733
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,401
Sol's not that close to him.

734
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,988
Well, since you two are so close.
Don't you get sick of each other?

735
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,743
We don't hang out as much as we did
these days.

736
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,621
Right. You've been dating a lot.

737
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,248
-Spin the wheel!
-Spin the wheel!

738
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:45,251
-Spin!
-But I kind of feel sorry for him.

739
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:49,046
If Sol goes to the States, she'll be
hanging out with hot American guys.

740
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,758
Wasn't she going to England?
It seemed like she was going to Europe.

741
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,551
Is she really going though? When?

742
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,345
How did you guys know?

743
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,847
What do you mean?
Can I have some of your juice?

744
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:00,724
-Here.
-Thanks.

745
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,936
Hey, there's Sol!

746
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,312
She's with someone though.

747
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,480
Hey, Sol!

748
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,315
Isn't he the guy from the café?

749
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,818
Hey, I think he is.

750
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,320
Hi, I'm Jung Ju-hyeok.

751
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,656
-Hi!
-Hi.

752
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,574
Is he your boyfriend, Sol?

753
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,285
No.

754
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:22,246
Have you been seeing each other
since then?

755
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:26,375
I had business nearby, and I asked her
to show me around school.

756
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,628
-Let's go!
-Let's go play a couple's game!

757
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,089
-A couple's game!
-Couple's game!

758
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,507
All right.

759
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,426
-Let's…
-Sol!

760
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,845
Sol! Come play…

761
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,097
Are you…

762
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,349
Are you two a couple?

763
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,894
-You're here to play the couple's game!
-Don't they look good together?

764
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:48,314
-Let me through.
-You have to throw a dart

765
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,733
and play the game it lands on.

766
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,693
That's all you have to do.

767
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,986
You try it.

768
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,321
-Me?
-Yes.

769
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,823
You should give up.
You're no match to him.

770
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,160
Okay, let's go.

771
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,162
Se-hun, spin the wheel.

772
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,789
All right, I'll spin the wheel.

773
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,834
Spin the wheel!

774
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:13,380
Oh, it's "Pop the Balloon"!
The most exciting game.

775
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,215
-What is it?
-You two, come over here.

776
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:18,844
I can't believe Sol's hanging out with
a guy. He's really handsome, isn't he?

777
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,512
I'll put a balloon right here.

778
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,515
-What?
-Stick together like this.

779
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,059
And pop it with your bodies.

780
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,102
You succeed if you pop it in five seconds.

781
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,937
All right, let's begin.

782
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,690
Ready, go.

783
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,320
You did it! Congratulations!

784
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,988
Take your prize.

785
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,823
-There's a prize?
-Take your pick.

786
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,200
Did Sol tell you anything?

787
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,620
No, she didn't.
She said they're not dating.

788
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,330
It doesn't seem like that.

789
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,750
I can totally tell from the guy's face.

790
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,461
Why else would he have come here?
There's nothing to see.

791
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,755
He just came to take a look around.

792
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,050
Sol's so lucky.

793
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,886
You know how they say
you'll get really lucky with men

794
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,888
after you have no one for a while.

795
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,891
It's an undeniable truth, you know.

796
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,976
She said they're not dating.

797
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,899
-Why are you giving me this?
-You like that character.

798
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,443
I don't like it anymore.

799
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,113
Is there something going on?

800
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,991
We were supposed to hang out together.
Why did you bring a guy along?

801
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:23,909
Oh…

802
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,370
I…

803
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,164
Well…

804
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,919
Sorry. I didn't think
it would make you uncomfortable.

805
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,630
If I knew, I would've brought a guy too.

806
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,841
Did you enjoy playing the couple's game?

807
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:43,429
I need to smoke.

808
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,556
-Hey.
-What's with you?

809
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,569
Lime?

810
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,863
I think you'll like it.

811
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,199
-Me?
-You said so at the club.

812
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,537
You remember that?

813
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,218
You must be exhausted.

814
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,511
Good work.

815
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:27,890
But the after-party begins now,
so let's go have fun!

816
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,353
You're all going to get wasted today!

817
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:38,108
-Guys, take this.
-Thanks!

818
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,069
-Move!
-Move over!

819
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,674
Gosh, my head.

820
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,192
I should go buy medicine.

821
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,410
I've liked her since I was in high school,
but she rejected me.

822
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:33,497
And she suddenly contacted me yesterday.

823
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,040
I'm really sorry.

824
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,960
<i><font color="white">So I was just a replacement?</font></i>

825
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,295
<i><font color="white">Whatever. I don't care now.</font></i>

826
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:42,422
<i><font color="white">But…</font></i>

827
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:45,008
She suddenly contacted me yesterday.
I'm really sorry.

828
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,557
<i><font color="white">So embarrassing…</font></i>

829
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:09,074
Who is this?

830
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,208
Hello?

831
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:19,376
<i><font color="white">What are you doing?</font></i>

832
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,254
Park Jae-eon?

833
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:23,922
Wait.

834
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:25,841
Did you delete my number?

835
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,926
Well…

836
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,062
Why did you call?

837
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,607
What's wrong with your voice?

838
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:43,900
Are you sick?

839
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,612
I'm not feeling well.

840
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,866
<i><font color="white">I'm near your house right now.</font></i>

841
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,495
So?

842
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,752
Why would you come here?

843
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,379
My friend lives nearby.

844
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:07,299
<i><font color="white">Okay. Have fun.</font></i>

845
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,508
Na-bi.

846
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,346
Yes?

847
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,890
Do you want to meet right now?

848
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,519
Right now?

849
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,005
So cold.

850
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,428
Why don't they have any medicine?

851
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,402
There must've been an accident.

852
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,404
-There's even a police car.
-Is someone hurt?

853
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,280
-What's going on?
-Why is there a police car?

854
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,366
Was there an accident?

855
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,409
Is it a student?

856
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,912
-A student lives there.
-Excuse me.

857
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,247
EMERGENCY RESPONSE

858
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,915
-The third floor?
-Isn't that her?

859
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,502
Hey! Can you hear me?

860
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,504
I think something happened to her! Hurry!

861
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,423
Calm down and stay back.

862
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,174
We should open it.

863
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,927
-Hurry.
-Wait!

864
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,804
Wait, sir. Wait!

865
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,807
What are you doing? Who called you?

866
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,149
I'm sorry.

867
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,067
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. We'll get going.

868
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,540
You know you totally overreacted, right?

869
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,084
I was just worried.

870
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,713
You said you were sick.
Plus, you live alone.

871
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:19,139
All right.
Well, you know that I'm alive now.

872
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:20,849
Bye.

873
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,684
Are you really okay?

874
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,520
I'm fine.

875
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,483
You have a fever.
Let's go to the hospital.

876
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,609
It's fine.

877
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,446
I'll be fine if I get some sleep.

878
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:38,825
Bye.

879
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:01,848
Hey.

880
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,310
Let's go. Come on.

881
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,978
Everyone left.

882
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,318
I'm really leaving.

883
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,571
Get a grip.

884
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,949
Don't you know how late it is?

885
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,748
What are you doing?

886
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,669
Come on, let's--

887
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:33,171
Shut up.

888
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,593
You kind of…

889
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,178
look…

890
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:42,931
handsome up close.

891
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:25,515
<i><font color="white">Was I too cold?</font></i>

892
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,518
No.

893
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,645
I did the right thing.

894
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,940
I should just get some sleep.

895
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:41,823
Who is it?

896
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,121
Can I come in?

897
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,082
Oh, sure.

898
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,799
There weren't any pharmacies open,
so I went to a convenience store.

899
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,305
Take some medicine after you eat.

900
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,724
Okay. Thanks.

901
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,727
Get some sleep, then. Bye.

902
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,647
<i><font color="white">You really came back because of this?</font></i>

903
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,273
Hey, Jae-eon.

904
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,319
I don't like this.

905
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,279
Take it back.

906
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,246
I'm hungry.

907
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,167
You didn't even eat until this hour?

908
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:37,754
I didn't have an appetite
since I smelled food all day.

909
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,007
But I'm hungry now.

910
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:52,769
Then you can eat this here.

911
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,696
This is really tasty.

912
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,994
-I haven't had homemade food in a while.
-My aunt made all this.

913
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,829
The aunt who named you?

914
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,790
Yes.

915
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,421
You must be sleepy.

916
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,507
Yes. Probably because of the medicine.

917
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,426
I'm so sleepy now.

918
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,846
-Go lie down.
-It's fine.

919
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,181
I'll sleep after you leave.

920
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,476
I ate your food,

921
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,397
so let me help you.

922
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:39,649
What?

923
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:42,318
Hey! What are you doing?

924
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,613
Hey, let me down.

925
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,158
Wait!

926
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,937
"There was a boy in the small store.

927
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:21,107
He waited for the girl every day."

928
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,277
What are you doing?

929
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,029
Go home now.

930
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,282
I'll go home when you fall asleep.
Don't worry.

931
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,702
It's worse to see you gone
when I wake up later.

932
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,539
Should I stay, then?

933
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,169
I didn't mean that…

934
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,507
<i><font color="white">Right. I don't want you to leave.</font></i>

935
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,512
You're really weird.

936
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,473
The way you talk, and the things you do…

937
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,475
You even called 911.

938
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,731
You mean you want to think of me
as a jerk,

939
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,025
but I actually seem okay, right?

940
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,820
You're so annoying.

941
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,033
To tell you the truth,

942
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,370
I was shocked when I saw you with Eun-han.

943
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,374
-Why?
-I don't know.

944
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,294
Maybe I got jealous.

945
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:25,171
You deleted my number,

946
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,715
but you seemed happy with him.

947
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,513
Then you would've felt good

948
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,307
when you saw me get rejected.

949
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:44,691
Save my number again.

950
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:48,236
I'm not such a bad guy, am I?

951
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:54,242
<i><font color="white">I don't know if it's because of
the fever or because of him,</font></i>

952
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,743
<i><font color="white">but I feel so dizzy.</font></i>

953
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:01,249
Why are you doing this to me?
Because my name means "butterfly"?

954
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,836
I've been attracted to you
from the beginning.

955
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,340
Oh, I see.

956
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:14,137
You're so funny, you know that?

957
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,139
What's so funny?

958
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,474
Why do you ask
if you won't even believe me?

959
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,810
You're not really trustworthy, you know.

960
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:24,063
Then will you see me in a different light
if I try to earn your trust?

961
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:21,162
<i><font color="white">Maybe he really…</font></i>

962
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,680
Your fever's down.

963
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,893
You really nursed me
the old-fashioned way?

964
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,271
Classic methods are the best.

965
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:49,649
You're right.

966
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,530
I should get ready for school.

967
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,803
Why don't you leave your hair down?

968
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:23,016
-It's uncomfortable.
-Still.

969
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,393
Just for me.

970
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,170
Then…

971
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,383
I want to see your hair tied up.

972
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,138
It's pretty.

973
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:21,165
<i><font color="white">His touch and his scent.
I already got used to them.</font></i>

974
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:24,001
<i><font color="white">I want to keep seeing you. What about you?</font></i>

975
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,337
<i><font color="white">Jae-eon is too smooth with everything.</font></i>

976
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,297

-You're overreacting.</font></i>

977
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,341
<i><font color="white">-Do you like me?
-Na-bi?</font></i>

978
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:34,679

983
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,107
<i><font color="white">Is there someone else you're seeing?</font></i>

984
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,192
Aren't you going overboard?
We're not even going out.

985
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,568
We should end it.

01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,195
<i><font color="white">I don't want to let go.</font></i>

987
