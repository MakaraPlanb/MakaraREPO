1
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:48,787
There it is.

2
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:52,916
By the way,

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,086
don't you think there's something
going on between Na-bi and Jae-eon?

4
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:59,673
Hey. Honestly, how could Na-bi date
a guy like Jae-eon?

5
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:01,591
Why? Na-bi's pretty.

6
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:04,344
That's not what I mean.
Jae-eon is the problem.

7
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:06,513
He's not sincere toward anyone.

8
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:09,516
That's why I ended things
after a few dates.

9
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:13,520
Really? You're the one who rejected him?

10
00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:18,191
Yes. I got away from him,
but Na-bi didn't.

11
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:19,693
There are rumors about her.

12
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:21,862
What a way to end her school life.

13
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:23,363
I know, right?

14
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:25,824
-Did you get everything?
-Yes. Let's go.

15
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:40,839
<i>Are you working?
I'm arriving at school soon.</i>

16
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:47,262
Is there someone else you're seeing?

17
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:49,890
No.

18
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,225
Really?

19
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:09,326
Excuse me.

20
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:12,329
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

21
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:14,206
Yes.

22
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,959
So it's you.

23
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:21,672
You bastard!

24
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:25,175
Sir! What are you doing?

25
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:27,219
-Move!
-Why are you doing this?

26
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:32,849
To be honest,
I don't get why you're so upset.

27
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,684
You didn't need to ghost me like that.

28
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:42,734
I…

29
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:44,403
Get out of the way!

30
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,987
What was that?

31
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:49,866
Na-bi!

32
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,538
Get up, you jerk!

33
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,625
Stop, Jae-eon!

34
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:05,257
-You asshole. Move!
-Sir, wait!

35
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,050
-Move!
-Sir!

36
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:09,010
-Why did you do it?
-What are you doing?

37
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:10,637
Why did you do it?

38
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:12,889
Why? Why did you do it?

39
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,267
-Why did you do it?
-Police?

40
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,353
I'm at Hongseo University and a man is…

41
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:20,063
-Sol, stop him.
-Why did you do it?

42
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:21,732
-Come quickly!
-Are you okay?

43
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:23,692
Why?

44
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:27,112
Stop it, Jae-eon.

45
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:34,578
EPISODE 5: I KNOW NOTHING WILL CHANGE.
NEVERTHELESS,

46
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:39,791
We'll be off now.

47
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,169
What? I'm curious…

48
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,673
I mean, I'm worried about them.

49
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:49,217
Call me if anything happens.

50
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:51,720
Okay. You should go.

51
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:53,054
Bye.

52
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:56,183
-Be careful. Bye.
-Make sure to call if anything happens.

53
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,023
HONGSEO POLICE STATION

54
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:32,052
How dare you touch someone
who's already taken?

55
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:34,930
If you ever come near my sister again,

56
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,891
I'm going to kill you. You scumbag.

57
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,353
Miss.

58
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:43,563
Let me give you some advice.

59
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,900
You should meet a decent guy.

60
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:51,154
You'll ruin your life
if you date an asshole like him.

61
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:07,295
You had something to say.

62
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,465
-What is it?
-Let's talk later.

63
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:11,967
I'm going home.

64
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,553
Didn't you get hurt?
Let's go to the hospital.

65
00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:16,555
I'm fine. Just worry about yourself.

66
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,065
I wonder what they're talking about now.
I bet they're totally fighting.

67
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:30,860
I think I just made things worse
by reporting it.

68
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:33,321
No, you did the right thing.
And it's fine now.

69
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:36,032
Na-bi could have gotten hurt.

70
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:37,701
Right?

71
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:42,747
But Na-bi was trying to stop that man
from hitting Jae-eon.

72
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:44,541
It was so cool.

73
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:46,418
-She would have been so scared.
-Right.

74
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:49,796
Na-bi should have been angry at him,

75
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,257
but she took his side.

76
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,427
I guess it's because she likes him a lot.

77
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:04,436
I should go.

78
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:06,938
See you tomorrow.

79
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,275
I'll take you home.

80
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:14,654
You're acting a bit strange today.
Do you have something to say?

81
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:18,867
We didn't get to finish
what we were talking about.

82
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:22,245
It's fine.

83
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,289
This is how we always make up.

84
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:26,041
As if nothing happened.

85
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,253
I feel like
we shouldn't do that this time.

86
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:33,465
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about leaving

87
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:36,593
as an exchange student.

88
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:40,889
I was more upset by how you said
that was the extent of our relationship.

89
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:42,307
Hey! You're the one who--

90
00:06:46,394 --> 00:06:48,355
All right. I'm sorry about that too.

91
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:53,068
I'm sorry about
how I acted at the flea market too.

92
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:55,320
But why aren't you sorry for
not telling me about him?

93
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,280
Hey, that's unfair.

94
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:59,324
Ju-hyeok and I aren't dating.

95
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:01,284
Then what's your relationship with him?

96
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,062
Put this on your lip.

97
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:36,486
Thanks.

98
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:39,447
I didn't want you to see me like this.

99
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:42,283
You nursed me when I was sick.

100
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:45,203
So let's call it even now. I'm going home.

101
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,248
You're not going to see me anymore?

102
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,587
I want to stay friends with you.

103
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:55,922
"Friends"?

104
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:59,342
What do friends even mean to you?

105
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,470
-What do you mean?
-Why did you lie to me?

106
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,472
You said you weren't seeing anyone else.

107
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:07,225
-Is that so important?
-Hey.

108
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:10,395
What do you want from me?

109
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:12,439
Right.

110
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:16,818
You just want someone who's stupid
so you can--

111
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:18,903
-What's with you?
-What?

112
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:21,740
You always draw the line like this.

113
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:25,368
You just want to see me when you want,

114
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:27,162
but you're scared I'll get clingy?

115
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:28,830
Don't worry.

116
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:31,082
That's not going to happen.

117
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:33,835
It's not like that!

118
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:42,886
Then what are we?

119
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:48,308
Weren't you okay
with everything until now?

120
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,518
-Why are you suddenly--
-Right.

121
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:53,646
Sorry for acting so cool about it
until now.

122
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:58,026
Honestly, I haven't heard anything good
since I started seeing you.

123
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:00,945
I pretended not to notice even
when I knew you weren't sincere,

124
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:02,197
because…

125
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:05,700
Because…

126
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:08,203
<i>I like you.</i>

127
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:20,048
But I can't stand this anymore.
Let's end this.

128
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:22,383
What?

129
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:23,426
It's funny, right?

130
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,262
There's nothing to end anyway.

131
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:30,350
Yu Na-bi.

132
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:34,062
Thanks for giving me a reason
to decide to end things.

133
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,777
All right. Let's end this.

134
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:44,155
You're the one who gets to decide.

135
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:52,330
Gosh. You're really…

136
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:58,461
You're really a jerk until the end.

137
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,698
Jae-eon and Na-bi were having an affair,

138
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:11,451
and that woman caught them!

139
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:15,371
-No way! They got caught in the act?
-Yes.

140
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:19,459
So Jae-eon actually got hit by that woman?
That's what happened to his face?

141
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,544
-Yes.
-I heard it was a guy, though.

142
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:25,590
-Is Jae-eon…
-No way.

143
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:27,091
Are you sure about that?

144
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:30,762
I heard it was Na-bi who hit Jae-eon.

145
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:32,597
Someone saw them fighting at night.

146
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,474
Why would Na-bi hit him?

147
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:37,352
-Because she found out he was cheating!
-That's ridiculous.

148
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:41,439
Se-yeong. If Na-bi really hit Jae-eon
that hard, she should join the UFC.

149
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:44,817
Na-bi should have been happy
after leaving me.

150
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:47,695
-Jeez.
-You're so ridiculous.

151
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:50,239
What's that reaction?

152
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:51,658
It's just a hair dye.

153
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:53,743
-You're unbelievable.
-It's so pretty.

154
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:55,078
What should we do with you?

155
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:58,331
She's a total attention-seeker.

156
00:11:58,414 --> 00:11:59,248
Why? Looks good.

157
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:02,460
Is it that bad? Everyone at the hair shop
said I looked good.

158
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:04,629
It's pretty, but it's a shocking look.

159
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:07,090
The color's really pretty.
Did you bleach it first?

160
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:09,092
Yes. I almost lost all my hair.

161
00:12:12,303 --> 00:12:13,763
By the way, Bit-na.

162
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:17,517
Did you hear anything
about Na-bi and Jae-eon?

163
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,102
Hey, be quiet. Na-bi's coming.

164
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:23,731
-Sol's coming too.
-Hey!

165
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:25,942
You both aren't coming to the workshop?

166
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,820
Bit-na, you changed your hair.
It looks nice.

167
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,863
Thanks, but don't change the subject.

168
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:32,949
How can both of you not come?

169
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:35,243
I feel so betrayed right now!

170
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:37,370
You should come.

171
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:39,205
The professors aren't coming.

172
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:41,874
We can just hang out by ourselves.

173
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,294
-I'm not sure.
-You should both come.

174
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:47,505
Can't you ask Jae-eon to come, too?

175
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:49,549
Everyone will come if he comes.

176
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:51,759
Ask him yourself.
Don't ask her to do that.

177
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:53,970
But they're close…

178
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:57,181
But what happened to Jae-eon's face?

179
00:12:58,599 --> 00:12:59,684
What do you mean?

180
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:03,479
You know, right?
Who did he have a fight with?

181
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:09,694
Can you please stop asking me
about Jae-eon now?

182
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:12,989
I don't know much about him, either.

183
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:16,868
-Hey.
-Jeez, what are you doing?

184
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:18,536
Come on. Start working.

185
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:32,467
Hi.

186
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:38,347
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,977
He must have seen something
and misunderstood.

188
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,354
He suddenly went all crazy.

189
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:49,609
You must be really upset.

190
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:52,945
Tell your girlfriend I'm sorry too.

191
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:56,324
-My girlfriend?
-I heard you were with someone.

192
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:58,534
Wasn't she your girlfriend?

193
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:01,412
If anything happens, call me.

194
00:14:02,246 --> 00:14:05,291
Even if it's nothing special.

195
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,044
That won't happen.
It'll be the best for both of us.

196
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:10,046
Right.

197
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,398
Gyu-hyun?

198
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:35,738
Thank you.

199
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:44,872
How is it?

200
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:47,959
He's actually eating mint chocolate?

201
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:50,545
PINT SIZE
CHOOSE 3 FLAVORS

202
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:52,213
Chocolate and cashew nuts.

203
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:55,550
-Hi!
-Hi.

204
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,094
Hey, we're ordering ice cream.
Choose a flavor.

205
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:01,139
-I want…
-Sorry, you can't choose anymore.

206
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:03,724
I'm going to order mint chocolate
for the third one.

207
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:08,646
What? You both don't like mint chocolate?

208
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:10,898
-I hate it.
-Why would you eat toothpaste?

209
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:12,024
I know, right?

210
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:15,903
It's good.

211
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:06,871
This isn't that simple, you know.

212
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:08,873
Art isn't easy.

213
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:11,792
Making something doesn't mean
it will become an art piece.

214
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,377
Haven't I told you several times?

215
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:15,796
<i>I've never seen his face like that.</i>

216
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,298
<i>Did he feel hurt by my words?</i>

217
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:21,385
-And most of all, your inspiration…
-<i>No, there's no way.</i>

218
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:24,764
Na-bi. Are you listening to me?

219
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:25,806
What?

220
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:30,520
This is bad.

221
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:34,232
Will you even
be able to finish this on time?

222
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,275
Sorry, Professor.

223
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,829
That traitor.

224
00:16:57,838 --> 00:17:01,801
I was wondering why you were
in the studio for a change.

225
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:03,469
Did you get rejected, too?

226
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:05,179
Of course not, Professor.

227
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:07,848
I'm the one who rejects guys.
I'd never get rejected.

228
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,851
And I work at the studio often too.

229
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:12,770
-Is that so?
-Yes.

230
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:15,022
Then when can I see your work?

231
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:17,984
I promise to show mine to you
next time, Professor.

232
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,329
Sol.

233
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:32,873
Yun Sol.

234
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,876
You're losing focus these days too.

235
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,630
Did you decide to give up everything
since you're not leaving?

236
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:44,802
No. I'm sorry, Professor.

237
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:52,393
Sol didn't tell me again.

238
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,942
Everything's a mess.

239
00:18:00,484 --> 00:18:02,320
What has gotten into you all?

240
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:05,573
You should be putting everything
into your work right now.

241
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:09,118
I told you to get inspiration,

242
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:11,037
not be reckless!

243
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:16,959
"She's at it again."
That's what you're thinking, right?

244
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:19,587
I'm just barking like a dog, aren't I?

245
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:23,090
My goodness. Maybe I was
a dog in my previous life.

246
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:24,258
No, Professor.

247
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:25,926
-No, Professor.
-Sorry, Professor.

248
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:36,354
-Yun Sol. Here.
-What? Thanks.

249
00:18:36,437 --> 00:18:39,231
Don't take it too personally.
I loved your piece.

250
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:41,150
Right. Thanks.

251
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:45,780
By the way, did you really decide
not to leave as an exchange student?

252
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:55,164
Yes.

253
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,752
Why? Did something happen?

254
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,380
Just because.

255
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:05,049
I didn't want to leave.

256
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:10,179
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK TRIPE

257
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:28,155
You said your tongue gets numb.

258
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,099
But I can't stand this anymore.
Let's end this.

259
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,771
All right. Let's end this.

260
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,858
You're the one who gets to decide.

261
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:25,689
Move!

262
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,026
Na-bi!

263
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:23,414
PARK JAE-EON

264
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:30,129
<i>The number you have dialed is not
in the directory.</i>

265
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:32,756
<i>Please check the number and call again.</i>

266
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:17,319
ALARM

267
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:19,631
<i>I miss him.</i>

268
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:33,228
Na-bi's lost it after ending things
with Jae-eon.

269
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:35,939
She totally got busted by the professor.

270
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:37,858
She does seem strange these days.

271
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:40,736
She's working late,
but there's no progress.

272
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:43,697
I know, right? Why did she have
to get in a relationship?

273
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:47,576
Things would have been better
if it was an actual relationship.

274
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,077
That's the same thing.

275
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:51,163
Why would you do that to yourself?

276
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:54,166
One is bound to end up like that
when it's over.

277
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:57,920
You should be careful too.

278
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:00,339
Gosh.

279
00:26:01,215 --> 00:26:02,758
We're totally fine.

280
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:12,309
There's another victim of love over there.

281
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,023
Nam Gyu-hyun?

282
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:20,776
Did something happen?

283
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:23,654
I set him up on a blind date, remember?

284
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:26,740
I thought it was going well,
but my friend rejected him!

285
00:26:28,742 --> 00:26:31,912
Look at him. I feel so sorry.

286
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:35,457
So you're saying he's like that
because he got rejected by her?

287
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:36,834
Yes.

288
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:37,918
Hey!

289
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:42,172
Is your friend that attractive?
To be honest, she didn't look that pretty…

290
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:44,633
What? Have you seen her?

291
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:51,181
No. I'm just saying…

292
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:53,934
Gyu-hyun's pretty good-looking, you know.

293
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:55,811
That's right.

294
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:58,355
But I shouldn't set up
any more blind dates.

295
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:05,279
Darn it.

296
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:23,005
Why don't you leave your hair down?

297
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:27,134
Just for me.

298
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:16,892
I was thinking of returning
the necklace to you.

299
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:18,977
Just throw it away, then.

300
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:22,689
You say that so easily.

301
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:29,947
SEOL-A

302
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,043
Hey, Seol-a.

303
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:46,004
What?

304
00:28:48,924 --> 00:28:50,259
I'll be there right away.

305
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:07,901
The fee should be about 50,000 won each,

306
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:09,987
so let's go with the place we changed to.

307
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:13,615
Are you writing this down?

308
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:17,160
Yes. He's done.

309
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:19,538
Okay, that's it for today.

310
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:22,332
What should we get?

311
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,126
-Vodka?
-Yes!

312
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:25,919
Should we go for drinks?

313
00:29:26,003 --> 00:29:27,713
-Let's go!
-Yes!

314
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:29,256
Should we call the others?

315
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:32,175
Who? Remember last time
when you called so many people?

316
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:34,136
Gyu-hyun, aren't you coming?

317
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:35,387
No.

318
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,889
Oh, no. He must have really liked her.

319
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:40,183
Maybe I should talk to my friend.

320
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:46,148
VISITORS RESTRICTED
IN EMERGENCY ROOM

321
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:49,234
How do you feel? Are you okay?

322
00:29:51,194 --> 00:29:53,071
Yes. Thanks.

323
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:55,574
How much was it?

324
00:29:55,657 --> 00:29:56,700
It's fine.

325
00:29:57,242 --> 00:29:59,119
You have severe anemia.

326
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,580
Make sure to take your meds.

327
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,959
-It's so bothersome.
-You could faint on the streets.

328
00:30:08,003 --> 00:30:11,381
You put your hair down. It suits you.

329
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:13,216
Really?

330
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:15,677
I should keep it down, then.

331
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:19,681
Is something going on?

332
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,229
You changed your number
and your hairstyle.

333
00:30:26,313 --> 00:30:28,231
What's going on?

334
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:33,570
Just because.

335
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:35,989
I got sick of things.

336
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,908
What do you mean?

337
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:40,827
I'm sick of myself.

338
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:50,337
It will be a narrow but firm base.

339
00:30:52,172 --> 00:30:53,173
Right.

340
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:57,552
Hey.

341
00:31:06,812 --> 00:31:08,522
Is it really okay for you to be here?

342
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:10,357
Sure, just for a little while.

343
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:14,986
Is that what you're presenting tomorrow?

344
00:31:16,071 --> 00:31:17,823
Well, yes.

345
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:20,409
Can I see? I'm curious.

346
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:23,370
Sure.

347
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,915
It's nothing special.

348
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:31,420
I'm just going to explain
what kind of piece I'm making.

349
00:31:34,714 --> 00:31:37,884
But honestly, I don't know
if I can really make it like that.

350
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:41,888
-Gosh. This is so cool.
-This is so good.

351
00:31:48,854 --> 00:31:50,397
How do you come up with this?

352
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:52,482
You're awesome.

353
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:56,111
It's really nothing special.

354
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:58,488
There are so many people better than me.

355
00:31:59,739 --> 00:32:01,783
Is there a good or bad for art, too?

356
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:03,201
Of course.

357
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:06,705
It's similar to cooking skills.

358
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:08,874
You can have different tastes,

359
00:32:08,957 --> 00:32:12,752
but there's a clear line between
good food and bad food.

360
00:32:16,256 --> 00:32:18,300
I don't know much about art,

361
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:21,470
but I like yours.
I have a good feeling about it.

362
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:27,767
Really?

363
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:38,987
This is so good.

364
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,615
Can you explain how it tastes
in more detail?

365
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,122
The noodles taste similar
to what your grandpa made,

366
00:32:49,206 --> 00:32:53,627
but the soup
is a bit more savory and light.

367
00:32:57,047 --> 00:32:58,423
Anyway, I like this one more.

368
00:33:00,383 --> 00:33:01,927
That's a relief.

369
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,763
I want to brag about this to my grandpa.

370
00:33:04,846 --> 00:33:06,681
You shouldn't brag yet, though.

371
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:10,185
Oh, right.

372
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:12,771
Here.

373
00:33:12,854 --> 00:33:15,273
I just picked it up, thinking of you.

374
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:18,276
Good luck with your presentation.

375
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:21,488
What's this?

376
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:24,991
Is it lipstick?

377
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:28,662
A gift for me?

378
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:31,289
Yes.

379
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:45,887
How does it look?

380
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:48,598
It looks good on you.

381
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:52,727
Thanks.

382
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:56,565
I'll do my best on my presentation.

383
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,149
Do-hyeok.

384
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:01,111
Right. Enjoy your food.

385
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:09,119
We're here again.

386
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:10,829
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

387
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:12,414
Yes?

388
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,084
You're all smiles.
Do you like her that much?

389
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,919
What?

390
00:34:21,464 --> 00:34:23,049
Is it that obvious?

391
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:24,384
Yes. Totally.

392
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:26,803
She's going to find out soon.

393
00:34:28,054 --> 00:34:29,055
Here.

394
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:33,310
On the house.

395
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,146
-You shouldn't have.
-Go on, give it to her.

396
00:34:37,564 --> 00:34:39,399
But this heart's a bit…

397
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:41,818
Should I make a circle, then? Just go.

398
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:45,989
-Gosh…
-Come on. Don't be so shy.

399
00:34:55,624 --> 00:34:58,752
It's no problem.

400
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,151
YU SE-HUN

401
00:35:26,821 --> 00:35:29,824
<i>Hey, Gyu-hyun.
You know where Bit-na lives, right?</i>

402
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:31,868
<i>Text me her address.</i>

403
00:35:31,951 --> 00:35:33,370
Why?

404
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:35,455
She's totally wasted.

405
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:37,624
I'm going to send her home in a taxi.

406
00:35:37,707 --> 00:35:39,417
-<i>On the count of three.</i>
-What?

407
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:42,504
You can come pick her up
if you have a problem with that.

408
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:43,588
<i>So what will it be?</i>

409
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:45,548
-<i>Hey!</i>
-Where are you? I'll be there.

410
00:35:45,632 --> 00:35:48,426
<i>What? Really? Didn't you say
you weren't feeling well?</i>

411
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,345
I'm fine. Send me your location.

412
00:36:12,575 --> 00:36:14,994
What's happening?

413
00:36:19,582 --> 00:36:21,501
Who are you?

414
00:36:27,674 --> 00:36:28,800
Who is that?

415
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:36,391
Darn it.

416
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:43,106
Oh, my gosh.

417
00:36:43,189 --> 00:36:46,651
Gosh, you startled me!

418
00:36:50,113 --> 00:36:51,531
Let's go for another round.

419
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:52,741
-Yes!
-Yes!

420
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,033
After we send her home.

421
00:36:54,117 --> 00:36:56,911
No, we have to take her with us.
Bit-na, let's go.

422
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:59,038
-Send her home.
-Bit-na, what's with you?

423
00:36:59,122 --> 00:37:00,915
-Get up.
-Where should we go?

424
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,460
What? He took a taxi?

425
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:05,795
-Did you come like that?
-This far?

426
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:08,631
-Hey.
-It must have been expensive.

427
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:15,972
Go on. I'll take Bit-na home.

428
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:19,350
No! I can't let Bit-na go alone.
I'll come with you.

429
00:37:19,434 --> 00:37:21,436
Where are you going?
You're coming with me.

430
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:24,355
-Hey!
-Right. I should go with you.

431
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,316
-What are you looking at?
-Just go.

432
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:29,402
Hey, thanks for this.

433
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:31,404
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

434
00:37:31,488 --> 00:37:33,740
Take her back safely,

435
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:35,575
and send us a picture when you arrive.

436
00:37:35,658 --> 00:37:37,368
Go on.

437
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:38,912
Stop that.

438
00:37:47,295 --> 00:37:48,296
Hey, Bit-na.

439
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:50,924
Get up.

440
00:37:58,056 --> 00:37:59,641
Who are you?

441
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:01,100
It's me.

442
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:05,688
Get on my back.

443
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:15,031
What? Are you crying?

444
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:18,910
How can you do this to me, you jerk?

445
00:38:19,702 --> 00:38:23,373
Get lost! I don't want to touch
a traitor like you!

446
00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:25,708
What is it this time?

447
00:38:27,544 --> 00:38:29,921
What's the point of talking
to a drunk girl?

448
00:38:30,004 --> 00:38:31,881
Come on, get on my back.

449
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,177
-You jerk.
-Hey! Have you lost it?

450
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:38,471
You said you hated mint chocolate!

451
00:38:38,555 --> 00:38:40,390
You hate mint chocolate.

452
00:38:40,473 --> 00:38:43,393
-Did you like her that much?
-What?

453
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:45,478
You jerk.

454
00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:48,147
You said you wanted to date me
only a while ago.

455
00:38:49,023 --> 00:38:52,235
Too bad you got rejected when
you even ate mint chocolate for her.

456
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:53,945
It must be so agonizing.

457
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:56,030
Who says I got rejected?

458
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:59,450
Get lost. I'm not going to talk
to a guy who eats mint chocolate.

459
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:02,245
What about you? You were
being so friendly with Mr. An.

460
00:39:02,328 --> 00:39:03,454
What? No way.

461
00:39:03,538 --> 00:39:05,874
Then why did you ignore me
at the bar last time?

462
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:09,711
This is ridiculous. You were with
another guy back then too.

463
00:39:11,421 --> 00:39:12,839
Whatever.

464
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,759
Stop crying.

465
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:23,558
I didn't eat it because she asked to.

466
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:29,147
I tried it because I heard
it's good for stress and insomnia.

467
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,608
But it wasn't effective at all.

468
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:35,778
I can't even sleep these days
because of you.

469
00:39:35,862 --> 00:39:38,364
That's nonsense!
Why would that be my fault?

470
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:42,201
Well…

471
00:39:43,161 --> 00:39:46,664
I think of you every night.

472
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:51,294
What?

473
00:39:52,754 --> 00:39:55,423
Why are you hitting on me now?

474
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:02,180
Come here.

475
00:40:13,316 --> 00:40:14,817
Stop crying.

476
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:19,280
Let's go. It's late.

477
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:22,575
Let's go.

478
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:24,994
Come on.

479
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:36,172
There you go.

480
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:39,008
Get on my back.

481
00:40:46,975 --> 00:40:51,562
Hey. Stop seeing other girls
and just go out with me.

482
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:53,856
That's a lame line.

483
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,151
Give me a break.
I've never asked someone out before.

484
00:40:58,486 --> 00:41:00,863
You better not go back
on your word tomorrow.

485
00:41:00,947 --> 00:41:02,156
I can't be sure.

486
00:41:03,783 --> 00:41:07,203
And why did you dye your hair like that?

487
00:41:08,121 --> 00:41:09,288
You're already so pretty.

488
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:13,251
And stop drinking so much.

489
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:17,171
You know how dangerous it is
to get wasted like that at night?

490
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:19,340
-Jeez! Hey!
-What?

491
00:41:19,424 --> 00:41:23,094
Everything you say is so boring.

492
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:25,096
But why are you such a good kisser?

493
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:26,764
Right, I'm a good kisser.

494
00:41:28,433 --> 00:41:29,684
Let's go.

495
00:41:31,894 --> 00:41:32,937
Let's go!

496
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:38,628
I think it's too much to the left.

497
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:40,213
Move it more to the right.

498
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:41,631
-All right!
-Okay.

499
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:42,840
Just a little more.

500
00:42:44,675 --> 00:42:46,928
What? What is it?

501
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:48,638
It's unbelievable.

502
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:50,473
How could you have been living there?

503
00:42:50,556 --> 00:42:51,974
Hey!

504
00:42:52,058 --> 00:42:53,976
Is there something wrong?

505
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,896
No, it's okay. It's perfect now.

506
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:02,151
I'm only sleeping there until tonight.
So keep it a secret.

507
00:43:02,235 --> 00:43:03,402
What about after that?

508
00:43:06,405 --> 00:43:08,533
Just mind your own business.

509
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:09,617
You know--

510
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,870
No! I don't want to ask
my parents for help.

511
00:43:12,954 --> 00:43:14,205
You can stay at my house.

512
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:20,211
My roommate went to the military
a while ago.

513
00:43:21,921 --> 00:43:25,174
What are you on about?
Are you asking me to live with you?

514
00:43:25,925 --> 00:43:28,678
You and me? That's total nonsense.

515
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:30,263
Why? What about it?

516
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,849
Lots of people do that in other countries.

517
00:43:35,351 --> 00:43:37,436
Well, that's true, but…

518
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:40,273
Just think about it.

519
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:42,859
Just pay the rent
you paid for your old house.

520
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:48,739
Hey, raise the right side. The right side.

521
00:43:48,823 --> 00:43:50,158
My gosh.

522
00:43:51,576 --> 00:43:52,743
He's just too nice.

523
00:43:56,956 --> 00:43:58,416
Are you nervous?

524
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,877
Yes, more than I thought.

525
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,089
Look at me.

526
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:08,176
Do I look better with my hair up?

527
00:44:13,556 --> 00:44:15,600
-There isn't much difference.
-Right?

528
00:44:15,683 --> 00:44:17,185
They're both pretty.

529
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,062
Right. Did you get an assistant?

530
00:44:20,146 --> 00:44:24,317
The others seemed to be talking
about who they'll have as an assistant.

531
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:26,652
Not yet.

532
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:29,363
I should've done that too.

533
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:31,282
What if nobody volunteers?

534
00:44:31,365 --> 00:44:32,950
I'm sure there will be volunteers.

535
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:38,998
Oh, right. Sol was looking for you.

536
00:44:39,081 --> 00:44:40,499
Did you talk to her?

537
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:43,628
No. I don't want to talk to her.

538
00:44:44,337 --> 00:44:46,422
What is it? Did something happen?

539
00:44:48,174 --> 00:44:49,425
You knew, right?

540
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:52,887
You knew she decided not to leave
as an exchange student, right?

541
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,263
I didn't.

542
00:44:55,056 --> 00:44:57,183
I didn't know. Did she say she's staying?

543
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:58,267
You're so obvious.

544
00:45:00,728 --> 00:45:04,607
I'm trying to hold back until her
presentation's over, so I'm ignoring her.

545
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:06,692
But this is driving me crazy.

546
00:45:08,235 --> 00:45:11,072
Good thinking. Just yell at her
once her presentation's over.

547
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:13,324
She's so annoying!

548
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:16,369
If she's treating me like this,
she shouldn't call me her bestie!

549
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:20,498
She's making me feel
like I'm obsessing over her.

550
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:25,211
I'm going.

551
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,213
Good luck.

552
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:29,674
Thanks.

553
00:45:30,675 --> 00:45:33,344
-You're the best, Na-bi.
-Thanks.

554
00:45:57,952 --> 00:46:01,080
I have to do my best on the presentation
and get an assistant.

555
00:46:01,163 --> 00:46:03,332
I'm sure you'll do well,

556
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:05,751
but if you can't find one, I'll help you.

557
00:46:05,835 --> 00:46:07,670
<i>I'm good at taking orders.</i>

558
00:46:08,796 --> 00:46:11,841
Really? You promise, right?
You can't go back on your words.

559
00:46:12,633 --> 00:46:15,344
But what do I do if no one volunteers?

560
00:46:17,847 --> 00:46:19,223
I'm so worried.

561
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:21,809
Oh, my gosh.

562
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,398
Sorry, Do-hyeok. My friend is here.

563
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:28,816
I'll call you again later.

564
00:46:30,985 --> 00:46:32,445
What was that for?

565
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:35,031
-I was jealous.
-What?

566
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,575
You look better with your hair up.

567
00:46:46,876 --> 00:46:48,335
How long are you going to avoid me?

568
00:46:49,378 --> 00:46:50,337
When did I avoid you?

569
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:54,300
You're the one who ignored me
when we ran into each other.

570
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,470
At the stairs?

571
00:46:58,387 --> 00:46:59,889
Did that bother you?

572
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:02,349
I guess it worked.

573
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:06,771
What are you on about?

574
00:47:09,065 --> 00:47:10,524
Good luck on your presentation.

575
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:26,874
We will now begin the presentations
for the 12th Hongseo Gallery Exhibition.

576
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:28,334
A round of applause, please.

577
00:47:32,797 --> 00:47:35,174
There are nine presenters today.

578
00:47:35,257 --> 00:47:37,176
We will select the assistants

579
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:40,554
for each piece
after their presentations are over.

580
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:45,309
The assistants will help the presenters
with their pieces.

581
00:47:45,392 --> 00:47:48,604
They will be helping them through
the entire process, starting from

582
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:51,232
making the piece
up to preparing for the exhibition.

583
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:53,943
It differs by each piece,

584
00:47:54,026 --> 00:47:56,237
but we recommend having

585
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,698
around one to three assistants.

586
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:03,202
There is a limit to the number
of volunteers,

587
00:48:03,702 --> 00:48:07,248
so even if there are many for your piece,
it's best not to use them all.

588
00:48:08,165 --> 00:48:11,627
The theme of my piece
is "observation of objects."

589
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,547
What I want to express through my piece

590
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,924
is human desire.

591
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:23,639
Hello, I'm Yun Sol from
the Department of Sculpture.

592
00:48:23,722 --> 00:48:25,432
12TH HONGSEO GALLERY EXHIBITION
PRESENTATION BY YUN SOL

593
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:28,853
The main theme of my piece is "union."

594
00:48:29,436 --> 00:48:32,565
The main material I used
is railway sleepers.

595
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:35,693
The rigidity and the traces of endurance

596
00:48:35,776 --> 00:48:38,362
on abandoned sleepers
seemed very attractive.

597
00:48:38,863 --> 00:48:42,324
So I focused on emphasizing
the basic attributions of the material,

598
00:48:42,408 --> 00:48:44,410
such as the oil stains made over time.

599
00:48:44,994 --> 00:48:47,079
I wanted to make the materials

600
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:52,918
seem attractive.

601
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:55,337
Thank you.

602
00:48:58,048 --> 00:48:59,550
You're the best, Yun Sol!

603
00:48:59,633 --> 00:49:00,634
What?

604
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:04,180
Good job.

605
00:49:07,016 --> 00:49:10,436
Next, Yu Na-bi from
the Department of Sculpture.

606
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,820
Hello, I'm Yu Na-bi
from the Department of Sculpture.

607
00:49:19,904 --> 00:49:22,031
The theme of my piece is…

608
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,244
Well…

609
00:49:29,455 --> 00:49:32,458
The theme of my piece is <i>"yeoji."</i>

610
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:36,587
The Chinese characters
mean "left over" and "land."

611
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,090
Thus, an empty area of land.

612
00:49:40,591 --> 00:49:43,844
It means a possibility or hope
of something happening.

613
00:49:45,596 --> 00:49:48,891
Cho Seong-sik from Sculpture
with the piece titled "coexistence."

614
00:49:49,808 --> 00:49:52,269
Raise your hand if you want to be
an assistant.

615
00:49:52,353 --> 00:49:54,855
-I want to do it.
-Me too.

616
00:49:54,939 --> 00:49:56,232
Me too.

617
00:49:56,315 --> 00:49:59,985
Cho Seong-sik?
Do you accept them as your assistants?

618
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:01,403
-Yes.
-Come on out.

619
00:50:10,663 --> 00:50:14,667
Yu Na-bi from Sculpture
with the piece titled <i>"yeoji."</i>

620
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,503
Who would like to assist Yu Na-bi?
Raise your hands.

621
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:22,883
What?

622
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,812
What? No way.

623
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:41,318
Na-bi. Do you accept
Jae-eon as your assistant?

624
00:50:47,741 --> 00:50:48,993
Yes.

625
00:50:50,202 --> 00:50:52,288
-All right. If that's everyone--
-Me!

626
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:54,665
I'll volunteer as well.

627
00:50:55,374 --> 00:50:57,668
Do you accept Hwang Jin-su
as your assistant?

628
00:50:57,751 --> 00:50:58,752
Yes, I do.

629
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:04,591
All right. Come up.

630
00:51:22,067 --> 00:51:25,654
All right, then.
You should share your work schedules

631
00:51:25,738 --> 00:51:29,575
and related materials with your assistants

632
00:51:29,658 --> 00:51:31,035
before we finish up.

633
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:34,830
The report format
is uploaded on our school website.

634
00:51:34,913 --> 00:51:36,999
-Make sure to check that.
-Okay.

635
00:51:37,082 --> 00:51:39,668
-Good job.
-Thank you!

636
00:51:42,671 --> 00:51:43,672
You tied your hair.

637
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:47,843
Yes. It was a bit hot.

638
00:51:49,303 --> 00:51:51,180
Are you really going to do this?

639
00:51:52,306 --> 00:51:53,682
What do you mean?

640
00:51:53,766 --> 00:51:55,392
You really don't need to.

641
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:56,894
I thought it'd be fun.

642
00:51:58,062 --> 00:51:59,480
I like your ideas.

643
00:51:59,563 --> 00:52:03,108
And it seems interesting to work
with metal.

644
00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:10,115
To be honest, I haven't worked with
metal before. So I'm not that skilled.

645
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:13,160
I'll help you.
That's what assistants are for.

646
00:52:16,455 --> 00:52:18,165
You don't want to work with me?

647
00:52:18,832 --> 00:52:22,086
It's not like that, but…

648
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:23,420
But?

649
00:52:23,504 --> 00:52:27,216
<i>I feel embarrassed
for not being able to believe</i>

650
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:29,343
<i>-that he sincerely liked my piece.</i>
-Na-bi.

651
00:52:32,388 --> 00:52:34,223
I'm looking forward to working with you.

652
00:52:34,973 --> 00:52:37,601
-Thanks.
-I'm in an awesome team.

653
00:52:40,062 --> 00:52:41,688
Me too.

654
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:47,236
Me too.

655
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,996
Thanks for volunteering to assist me.

656
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:02,209
Here are the materials.

657
00:53:08,173 --> 00:53:10,509
Do you both have time this evening?

658
00:53:11,844 --> 00:53:13,512
Drinks to celebrate becoming a team?

659
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,348
I know a metalworking studio.

660
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:18,559
Want to check it out?

661
00:53:20,185 --> 00:53:21,186
Yes!

662
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:27,484
All right then.

663
00:53:55,596 --> 00:53:58,307
JAE-EON

664
00:54:13,822 --> 00:54:14,990
Come in.

665
00:54:22,414 --> 00:54:24,333
What? Why is there no one here?

666
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:26,502
The owner got off work.

667
00:54:27,252 --> 00:54:30,172
I'm using his studio when it's not open.

668
00:54:31,507 --> 00:54:32,883
I live upstairs.

669
00:54:34,092 --> 00:54:35,219
I see.

670
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:38,388
I didn't know you worked this hard.

671
00:54:39,932 --> 00:54:41,433
Aren't you overdoing it?

672
00:54:41,517 --> 00:54:42,976
I have a long way to go.

673
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:47,022
<i>I envy his passion.</i>

674
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,573
<i>I think I'll be about 30 minutes late.
Sorry.</i>

675
00:54:58,033 --> 00:54:59,660
Jin-su's going to be a bit late.

676
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:01,995
Sit down.

677
00:55:16,677 --> 00:55:18,804
-Do you want a drink?
-Sure.

678
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:36,405
It's been a while since we talked.

679
00:55:36,989 --> 00:55:38,532
It hasn't been that long.

680
00:55:46,206 --> 00:55:47,207
What?

681
00:55:50,669 --> 00:55:52,671
The day we went to the police station…

682
00:55:55,424 --> 00:55:56,675
I'm sorry.

683
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,678
I shouldn't have done that to you.

684
00:56:00,887 --> 00:56:02,514
What's with the sudden apology?

685
00:56:02,598 --> 00:56:05,851
You were right about me drawing the line.

686
00:56:08,687 --> 00:56:11,189
When people cross a certain line,

687
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:14,860
they feel like it's meaningless.

688
00:56:16,528 --> 00:56:17,738
But…

689
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:20,490
I want to change now.

690
00:56:24,411 --> 00:56:26,830
<i>I should stop reading too much
into his words now.</i>

691
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:30,500
Change how?
Are you thinking of dating now?

692
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,254
I'm not sure.

693
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:39,760
I'm thinking of changing bit by bit.

694
00:56:40,552 --> 00:56:42,054
Then who knows?

695
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:44,306
I might meet my soulmate.

696
00:56:47,768 --> 00:56:49,645
I'll be rooting for you, then.

697
00:56:51,355 --> 00:56:53,357
I hope you can be sincere this time.

698
00:57:29,977 --> 00:57:32,813
You can adjust the fire with this.

699
00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:43,031
Be careful. It's hot.

700
00:57:44,658 --> 00:57:46,952
Start from the middle and go to the edge.

701
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:56,753
Start here and straighten it out
little by little.

702
00:58:01,883 --> 00:58:03,260
It's not straightening out.

703
00:58:03,343 --> 00:58:04,594
Hit it harder.

704
00:58:15,022 --> 00:58:16,440
-It's flat, right?
-Cool.

705
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:23,238
-Yes, like that.
-It's getting flat.

706
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:25,157
Good. You're getting better.

707
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:36,752
Jin-su said he'd be 30 minutes late,
but he never came.

708
00:58:39,296 --> 00:58:41,882
How was it?
It wasn't that difficult, right?

709
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:44,217
Right.

710
00:58:44,926 --> 00:58:46,970
I think I can do it if I work hard.

711
00:58:47,054 --> 00:58:49,973
Call me whenever you want to work.
You'll make a masterpiece.

712
00:58:50,057 --> 00:58:51,433
Stop teasing me.

713
00:58:51,516 --> 00:58:54,102
I'm not teasing you. I like your pieces.

714
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,314
Especially this one.
I'm looking forward to it.

715
00:58:59,941 --> 00:59:02,360
I didn't know you liked it that much.

716
00:59:05,614 --> 00:59:06,865
I'll get going.

717
00:59:08,867 --> 00:59:10,035
Na-bi.

718
00:59:15,707 --> 00:59:17,375
I changed my number.

719
00:59:27,511 --> 00:59:28,637
Bye.

720
00:59:41,066 --> 00:59:42,609
MISSED CALLS
SEOL-A

721
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:08,093
<i>-Hey, Seol-a.</i>
-Hey.

722
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:09,427
Were you waiting for me?

723
01:00:11,555 --> 01:00:12,639
No.

724
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:17,185
I just called to say
I can't make it today.

725
01:00:17,769 --> 01:00:20,272
-That's a relief.
-Were you busy?

726
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:22,274
Yes, a bit. I was working.

727
01:00:23,525 --> 01:00:24,609
All right.

728
01:00:26,278 --> 01:00:27,654
Go back to work, then.

729
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:44,004
I like your pieces.

730
01:00:44,087 --> 01:00:47,674
Especially this one.
I'm looking forward to it.

731
01:02:39,703 --> 01:02:43,290
So is this crumbling down,

732
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:45,083
or being made?

733
01:02:46,751 --> 01:02:48,211
That's up to interpretation.

734
01:02:54,926 --> 01:02:56,428
It's good.

735
01:02:59,848 --> 01:03:02,058
Na-bi seems to have gained
her focus again.

736
01:03:02,642 --> 01:03:03,977
Thank you.

737
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:07,314
It's so cool. Just a few days ago,
there was nothing.

738
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:13,820
Bit-na. When are you
going to show me your piece?

739
01:03:16,781 --> 01:03:19,784
Focus on your work, okay?

740
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:22,287
Bit-na, let me see you work properly!

741
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:24,039
Where is she going?

742
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:26,541
This is great.

743
01:03:47,771 --> 01:03:50,190
Doesn't Jae-eon seem a bit different?

744
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:52,692
He seems a bit purer.

745
01:03:52,776 --> 01:03:55,320
Right. He seems different somehow.

746
01:03:55,403 --> 01:03:57,447
I heard he doesn't hang out with girls.

747
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:59,616
What happened to him?

748
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,869
Is he dating someone for real now?

749
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:06,623
How would we ever understand the life
of a handsome guy?

750
01:04:06,706 --> 01:04:08,666
-Good work.
-Good work.

751
01:04:12,212 --> 01:04:13,546
-Give me one too.
-Here.

752
01:04:14,297 --> 01:04:15,882
-Here you go.
-Have one.

753
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:19,135
-You try this.
-It's good.

754
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:33,066
-You want to make wings?
-Yes.

755
01:04:33,691 --> 01:04:37,362
But I don't know what kind of shape
I should make it into.

756
01:04:41,783 --> 01:04:43,952
I should print this one.

757
01:05:11,688 --> 01:05:13,815
FOR REFERENCE

758
01:05:13,898 --> 01:05:16,234
I wish I could see this in person.

759
01:05:16,317 --> 01:05:19,112
-You can.
-How?

760
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:21,322
This artist's having an exhibition.

761
01:05:21,406 --> 01:05:23,533
It opens next week. Do you want to go?

762
01:05:25,994 --> 01:05:27,245
Sure. Let's do that.

763
01:05:27,328 --> 01:05:28,788
Hey, Jin-su.

764
01:05:33,418 --> 01:05:34,961
He's sleeping again.

765
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:38,381
<i>Our relationship took a new turn,</i>

766
01:05:38,465 --> 01:05:42,802
<i>and I found peace in my mind
within that friendly relationship.</i>

767
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:47,974
Yes, I'm here.

768
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:49,767
Just because.

769
01:05:54,606 --> 01:05:56,441
I thought I should cut my hair.

770
01:05:56,524 --> 01:06:00,945
I didn't go to a hair shop in America,
so it got kind of messy.

771
01:06:02,363 --> 01:06:04,949
Really? Should I cut it short, then?

772
01:06:07,452 --> 01:06:09,913
I guess I'll do that. All right.

773
01:06:09,996 --> 01:06:11,247
I'll see you tomorrow.

774
01:06:18,213 --> 01:06:19,756
I'll get it for you…

775
01:06:28,598 --> 01:06:29,807
Thanks.

776
01:06:34,646 --> 01:06:37,065
Are you Yu Na-bi, by any chance?

777
01:06:37,649 --> 01:06:39,275
Do you know me?

778
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,487
Jae-eon said you were a friend
in the same department.

779
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:46,324
Right.

780
01:06:47,367 --> 01:06:48,993
Are you here to see Jae-eon?

781
01:06:49,827 --> 01:06:53,206
Yes. I just came
because I wanted to see him.

782
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:56,876
He's probably busy.
We have a lot of assignments.

783
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,169
Really?

784
01:06:59,337 --> 01:07:01,965
He said he'd come out.
I feel kind of sorry now.

785
01:07:08,805 --> 01:07:10,056
Hey, Jae-eon.

786
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:12,517
Oh, really?

787
01:07:13,977 --> 01:07:15,562
It's fine. Take your time.

788
01:07:17,272 --> 01:07:18,982
I don't smoke that much.

789
01:07:20,525 --> 01:07:22,110
All right.

790
01:07:26,823 --> 01:07:30,785
Excuse me,
but what's your relationship with Jae-eon?

791
01:07:31,578 --> 01:07:33,246
We used to date.

792
01:07:35,373 --> 01:07:36,499
I see.

793
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,005
And…

794
01:07:44,215 --> 01:07:46,092
we're seeing each other again.

795
01:07:53,516 --> 01:07:57,687
But are you really just friends with him?

796
01:08:05,612 --> 01:08:07,905
Yes. We're just friends.

797
01:08:09,365 --> 01:08:10,825
That's a relief.

798
01:08:10,908 --> 01:08:13,244
I thought maybe I said something
I shouldn't have.

799
01:08:24,756 --> 01:08:25,757
You should

800
01:08:27,216 --> 01:08:28,843
just keep your hair that way.

801
01:08:29,886 --> 01:08:30,720
What?

802
01:08:32,096 --> 01:08:36,059
Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.

803
01:09:33,116 --> 01:09:37,578
<i>A distance that's close enough
yet not too close to hurt each other.</i>

804
01:09:37,662 --> 01:09:40,456
<i>Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.</i>

805
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,583
-Na-bi is coming?
-You didn't know?

806
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:44,460
<i>She disappeared.</i>

807
01:09:44,544 --> 01:09:46,546
<i>That's what you hate the most.</i>

808
01:09:46,629 --> 01:09:48,339
<i>Getting clingy.</i>

809
01:09:48,423 --> 01:09:50,049
<i>Certainty about the relationship.</i>

810
01:09:50,133 --> 01:09:52,510
How does one get that certainty?

811
01:09:52,593 --> 01:09:54,679
<i>I didn't know you'd be coming along.</i>

812
01:09:54,762 --> 01:09:57,181
I've always wanted to come here.

813
01:09:57,265 --> 01:09:58,099
Cheers.

814
01:09:58,182 --> 01:10:00,852
<i>Then is it over with him now?</i>

815
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,687
<i>It must be someone you like.</i>

816
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,355
<i>No, just someone bothersome.</i>

817
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:07,692
<i>I know very well that a person
who doesn't know how to love someone</i>

818
01:10:07,775 --> 01:10:08,818
<i>can never be happy.</i>

819
01:10:09,485 --> 01:10:10,319
<i>You're coming here?</i>

820
01:10:10,403 --> 01:10:13,406
<i>Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.</i>

821
01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:17,618
