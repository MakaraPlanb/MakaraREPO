1
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,787
There it is.

2
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:22,916
By the way,

3
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,086
don't you think there's something
going on between Na-bi and Jae-eon?

4
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,673
Hey. Honestly, how could Na-bi date
a guy like Jae-eon?

5
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,591
Why? Na-bi's pretty.

6
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,344
That's not what I mean.
Jae-eon is the problem.

7
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,513
He's not sincere toward anyone.

8
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,516
That's why I ended things
after a few dates.

9
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,520
Really? You're the one who rejected him?

10
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:48,191
Yes. I got away from him,
but Na-bi didn't.

11
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,693
There are rumors about her.

12
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,862
What a way to end her school life.

13
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,363
I know, right?

14
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,824
-Did you get everything?
-Yes. Let's go.

15
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,839
<i>Are you working?
I'm arriving at school soon.</i>

16
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,262
Is there someone else you're seeing?

17
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,890
No.

18
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,225
Really?

19
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,326
Excuse me.

20
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,329
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

21
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,206
Yes.

22
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,959
So it's you.

23
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,672
You bastard!

24
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,175
Sir! What are you doing?

25
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,219
-Move!
-Why are you doing this?

26
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,849
To be honest,
I don't get why you're so upset.

27
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,684
You didn't need to ghost me like that.

28
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,734
I…

29
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,403
Get out of the way!

30
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,987
What was that?

31
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,866
Na-bi!

32
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,538
Get up, you jerk!

33
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,625
Stop, Jae-eon!

34
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,257
-You asshole. Move!
-Sir, wait!

35
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,050
-Move!
-Sir!

36
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,010
-Why did you do it?
-What are you doing?

37
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,637
Why did you do it?

38
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,889
Why? Why did you do it?

39
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,267
-Why did you do it?
-Police?

40
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,353
I'm at Hongseo University and a man is…

41
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,063
-Sol, stop him.
-Why did you do it?

42
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,732
-Come quickly!
-Are you okay?

43
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,692
Why?

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,112
Stop it, Jae-eon.

45
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:04,578
EPISODE 5: I KNOW NOTHING WILL CHANGE.
NEVERTHELESS,

46
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,791
We'll be off now.

47
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,169
What? I'm curious…

48
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,673
I mean, I'm worried about them.

49
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,217
Call me if anything happens.

50
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,720
Okay. You should go.

51
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,054
Bye.

52
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,183
-Be careful. Bye.
-Make sure to call if anything happens.

53
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,023
HONGSEO POLICE STATION

54
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:02,052
How dare you touch someone
who's already taken?

55
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,930
If you ever come near my sister again,

56
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,891
I'm going to kill you. You scumbag.

57
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,353
Miss.

58
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,563
Let me give you some advice.

59
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,900
You should meet a decent guy.

60
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,154
You'll ruin your life
if you date an asshole like him.

61
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,295
You had something to say.

62
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,465
-What is it?
-Let's talk later.

63
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,967
I'm going home.

64
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,553
Didn't you get hurt?
Let's go to the hospital.

65
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,555
I'm fine. Just worry about yourself.

66
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,065
I wonder what they're talking about now.
I bet they're totally fighting.

67
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,860
I think I just made things worse
by reporting it.

68
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,321
No, you did the right thing.
And it's fine now.

69
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,032
Na-bi could have gotten hurt.

70
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,701
Right?

71
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,747
But Na-bi was trying to stop that man
from hitting Jae-eon.

72
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,541
It was so cool.

73
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,418
-She would have been so scared.
-Right.

74
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,796
Na-bi should have been angry at him,

75
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,257
but she took his side.

76
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,427
I guess it's because she likes him a lot.

77
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,436
I should go.

78
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,938
See you tomorrow.

79
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,275
I'll take you home.

80
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,654
You're acting a bit strange today.
Do you have something to say?

81
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,867
We didn't get to finish
what we were talking about.

82
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,245
It's fine.

83
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,289
This is how we always make up.

84
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,041
As if nothing happened.

85
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,253
I feel like
we shouldn't do that this time.

86
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,465
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about leaving

87
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,593
as an exchange student.

88
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,889
I was more upset by how you said
that was the extent of our relationship.

89
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,307
Hey! You're the one who--

90
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,355
All right. I'm sorry about that too.

91
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,068
I'm sorry about
how I acted at the flea market too.

92
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,320
But why aren't you sorry for
not telling me about him?

93
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,280
Hey, that's unfair.

94
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,324
Ju-hyeok and I aren't dating.

95
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,284
Then what's your relationship with him?

96
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,062
Put this on your lip.

97
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,486
Thanks.

98
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,447
I didn't want you to see me like this.

99
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,283
You nursed me when I was sick.

100
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,203
So let's call it even now. I'm going home.

101
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,248
You're not going to see me anymore?

102
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,587
I want to stay friends with you.

103
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:25,922
"Friends"?

104
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,342
What do friends even mean to you?

105
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,470
-What do you mean?
-Why did you lie to me?

106
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,472
You said you weren't seeing anyone else.

107
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,225
-Is that so important?
-Hey.

108
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,395
What do you want from me?

109
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,439
Right.

110
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,818
You just want someone who's stupid
so you can--

111
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,903
-What's with you?
-What?

112
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,740
You always draw the line like this.

113
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,368
You just want to see me when you want,

114
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,162
but you're scared I'll get clingy?

115
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,830
Don't worry.

116
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,082
That's not going to happen.

117
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,835
It's not like that!

118
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,886
Then what are we?

119
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,308
Weren't you okay
with everything until now?

120
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,518
-Why are you suddenly--
-Right.

121
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,646
Sorry for acting so cool about it
until now.

122
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,026
Honestly, I haven't heard anything good
since I started seeing you.

123
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,945
I pretended not to notice even
when I knew you weren't sincere,

124
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,197
because…

125
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,700
Because…

126
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,203
<i>I like you.</i>

127
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,048
But I can't stand this anymore.
Let's end this.

128
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,383
What?

129
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,426
It's funny, right?

130
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,262
There's nothing to end anyway.

131
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,350
Yu Na-bi.

132
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,062
Thanks for giving me a reason
to decide to end things.

133
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,777
All right. Let's end this.

134
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,155
You're the one who gets to decide.

135
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,330
Gosh. You're really…

136
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,461
You're really a jerk until the end.

137
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,698
Jae-eon and Na-bi were having an affair,

138
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,451
and that woman caught them!

139
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,371
-No way! They got caught in the act?
-Yes.

140
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:49,459
So Jae-eon actually got hit by that woman?
That's what happened to his face?

141
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,544
-Yes.
-I heard it was a guy, though.

142
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,590
-Is Jae-eon…
-No way.

143
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,091
Are you sure about that?

144
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,762
I heard it was Na-bi who hit Jae-eon.

145
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,597
Someone saw them fighting at night.

146
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,474
Why would Na-bi hit him?

147
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,352
-Because she found out he was cheating!
-That's ridiculous.

148
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,439
Se-yeong. If Na-bi really hit Jae-eon
that hard, she should join the UFC.

149
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,817
Na-bi should have been happy
after leaving me.

150
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,695
-Jeez.
-You're so ridiculous.

151
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,239
What's that reaction?

152
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,658
It's just a hair dye.

153
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,743
-You're unbelievable.
-It's so pretty.

154
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,078
What should we do with you?

155
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,331
She's a total attention-seeker.

156
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,248
Why? Looks good.

157
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,460
Is it that bad? Everyone at the hair shop
said I looked good.

158
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,629
It's pretty, but it's a shocking look.

159
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,090
The color's really pretty.
Did you bleach it first?

160
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,092
Yes. I almost lost all my hair.

161
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,763
By the way, Bit-na.

162
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,517
Did you hear anything
about Na-bi and Jae-eon?

163
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,102
Hey, be quiet. Na-bi's coming.

164
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,731
-Sol's coming too.
-Hey!

165
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,942
You both aren't coming to the workshop?

166
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,820
Bit-na, you changed your hair.
It looks nice.

167
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,863
Thanks, but don't change the subject.

168
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,949
How can both of you not come?

169
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,243
I feel so betrayed right now!

170
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,370
You should come.

171
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,205
The professors aren't coming.

172
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,874
We can just hang out by ourselves.

173
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,294
-I'm not sure.
-You should both come.

174
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,505
Can't you ask Jae-eon to come, too?

175
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,549
Everyone will come if he comes.

176
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,759
Ask him yourself.
Don't ask her to do that.

177
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,970
But they're close…

178
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,181
But what happened to Jae-eon's face?

179
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,684
What do you mean?

180
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,479
You know, right?
Who did he have a fight with?

181
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,694
Can you please stop asking me
about Jae-eon now?

182
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,989
I don't know much about him, either.

183
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,868
-Hey.
-Jeez, what are you doing?

184
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,536
Come on. Start working.

185
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,467
Hi.

186
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,347
I'm so sorry.

187
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,977
He must have seen something
and misunderstood.

188
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,354
He suddenly went all crazy.

189
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,609
You must be really upset.

190
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,945
Tell your girlfriend I'm sorry too.

191
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,324
-My girlfriend?
-I heard you were with someone.

192
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,534
Wasn't she your girlfriend?

193
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,412
If anything happens, call me.

194
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,291
Even if it's nothing special.

195
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,044
That won't happen.
It'll be the best for both of us.

196
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,046
Right.

197
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,398
Gyu-hyun?

198
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,738
Thank you.

199
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,872
How is it?

200
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,959
He's actually eating mint chocolate?

201
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,545
PINT SIZE
CHOOSE 3 FLAVORS

202
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,213
Chocolate and cashew nuts.

203
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,550
-Hi!
-Hi.

204
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,094
Hey, we're ordering ice cream.
Choose a flavor.

205
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,139
-I want…
-Sorry, you can't choose anymore.

206
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,724
I'm going to order mint chocolate
for the third one.

207
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,646
What? You both don't like mint chocolate?

208
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,898
-I hate it.
-Why would you eat toothpaste?

209
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,024
I know, right?

210
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,903
It's good.

211
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,871
This isn't that simple, you know.

212
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,873
Art isn't easy.

213
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,792
Making something doesn't mean
it will become an art piece.

214
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,377
Haven't I told you several times?

215
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,796
<i>I've never seen his face like that.</i>

216
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,298
<i>Did he feel hurt by my words?</i>

217
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:51,385
-And most of all, your inspiration…
-<i>No, there's no way.</i>

218
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,764
Na-bi. Are you listening to me?

219
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,806
What?

220
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,520
This is bad.

221
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,232
Will you even
be able to finish this on time?

222
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,275
Sorry, Professor.

223
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,829
That traitor.

224
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,801
I was wondering why you were
in the studio for a change.

225
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,469
Did you get rejected, too?

226
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,179
Of course not, Professor.

227
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,848
I'm the one who rejects guys.
I'd never get rejected.

228
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,851
And I work at the studio often too.

229
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,770
-Is that so?
-Yes.

230
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,022
Then when can I see your work?

231
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,984
I promise to show mine to you
next time, Professor.

232
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,329
Sol.

233
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,873
Yun Sol.

234
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,876
You're losing focus these days too.

235
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,630
Did you decide to give up everything
since you're not leaving?

236
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,802
No. I'm sorry, Professor.

237
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,393
Sol didn't tell me again.

238
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,942
Everything's a mess.

239
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,320
What has gotten into you all?

240
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,573
You should be putting everything
into your work right now.

241
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,118
I told you to get inspiration,

242
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,037
not be reckless!

243
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,959
"She's at it again."
That's what you're thinking, right?

244
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,587
I'm just barking like a dog, aren't I?

245
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,090
My goodness. Maybe I was
a dog in my previous life.

246
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,258
No, Professor.

247
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,926
-No, Professor.
-Sorry, Professor.

248
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,354
-Yun Sol. Here.
-What? Thanks.

249
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,231
Don't take it too personally.
I loved your piece.

250
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,150
Right. Thanks.

251
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,780
By the way, did you really decide
not to leave as an exchange student?

252
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,164
Yes.

253
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,752
Why? Did something happen?

254
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,380
Just because.

255
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,049
I didn't want to leave.

256
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,179
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK TRIPE

257
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,155
You said your tongue gets numb.

258
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,099
But I can't stand this anymore.
Let's end this.

259
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,771
All right. Let's end this.

260
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,858
You're the one who gets to decide.

261
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,689
Move!

262
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,026
Na-bi!

263
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:53,414
PARK JAE-EON

264
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,129
<i>The number you have dialed is not
in the directory.</i>

265
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,756
<i>Please check the number and call again.</i>

266
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:47,319
ALARM

267
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,631
<i>I miss him.</i>

268
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,228
Na-bi's lost it after ending things
with Jae-eon.

269
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,939
She totally got busted by the professor.

270
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,858
She does seem strange these days.

271
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,736
She's working late,
but there's no progress.

272
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,697
I know, right? Why did she have
to get in a relationship?

273
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:17,576
Things would have been better
if it was an actual relationship.

274
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,077
That's the same thing.

275
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,163
Why would you do that to yourself?

276
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,166
One is bound to end up like that
when it's over.

277
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,920
You should be careful too.

278
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,339
Gosh.

279
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,758
We're totally fine.

280
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,309
There's another victim of love over there.

281
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,023
Nam Gyu-hyun?

282
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,776
Did something happen?

283
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,654
I set him up on a blind date, remember?

284
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,740
I thought it was going well,
but my friend rejected him!

285
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,912
Look at him. I feel so sorry.

286
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,457
So you're saying he's like that
because he got rejected by her?

287
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,834
Yes.

288
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:07,918
Hey!

289
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,172
Is your friend that attractive?
To be honest, she didn't look that pretty…

290
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,633
What? Have you seen her?

291
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:21,181
No. I'm just saying…

292
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,934
Gyu-hyun's pretty good-looking, you know.

293
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,811
That's right.

294
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,355
But I shouldn't set up
any more blind dates.

295
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,279
Darn it.

296
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,005
Why don't you leave your hair down?

297
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,134
Just for me.

298
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,892
I was thinking of returning
the necklace to you.

299
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,977
Just throw it away, then.

300
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,689
You say that so easily.

301
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,947
SEOL-A

302
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,043
Hey, Seol-a.

303
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,004
What?

304
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,259
I'll be there right away.

305
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,901
The fee should be about 50,000 won each,

306
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,987
so let's go with the place we changed to.

307
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,615
Are you writing this down?

308
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,160
Yes. He's done.

309
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,538
Okay, that's it for today.

310
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,332
What should we get?

311
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,126
-Vodka?
-Yes!

312
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,919
Should we go for drinks?

313
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,713
-Let's go!
-Yes!

314
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,256
Should we call the others?

315
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,175
Who? Remember last time
when you called so many people?

316
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,136
Gyu-hyun, aren't you coming?

317
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,387
No.

318
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,889
Oh, no. He must have really liked her.

319
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,183
Maybe I should talk to my friend.

320
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,148
VISITORS RESTRICTED
IN EMERGENCY ROOM

321
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,234
How do you feel? Are you okay?

322
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,071
Yes. Thanks.

323
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,574
How much was it?

324
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,700
It's fine.

325
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,119
You have severe anemia.

326
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,580
Make sure to take your meds.

327
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,959
-It's so bothersome.
-You could faint on the streets.

328
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,381
You put your hair down. It suits you.

329
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,216
Really?

330
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,677
I should keep it down, then.

331
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,681
Is something going on?

332
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,229
You changed your number
and your hairstyle.

333
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,231
What's going on?

334
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,570
Just because.

335
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,989
I got sick of things.

336
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,908
What do you mean?

337
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,827
I'm sick of myself.

338
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:20,337
It will be a narrow but firm base.

339
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,173
Right.

340
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,552
Hey.

341
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,522
Is it really okay for you to be here?

342
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,357
Sure, just for a little while.

343
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,986
Is that what you're presenting tomorrow?

344
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,823
Well, yes.

345
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,409
Can I see? I'm curious.

346
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,370
Sure.

347
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,915
It's nothing special.

348
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:01,420
I'm just going to explain
what kind of piece I'm making.

349
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,884
But honestly, I don't know
if I can really make it like that.

350
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,888
-Gosh. This is so cool.
-This is so good.

351
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,397
How do you come up with this?

352
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,482
You're awesome.

353
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,111
It's really nothing special.

354
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,488
There are so many people better than me.

355
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,783
Is there a good or bad for art, too?

356
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,201
Of course.

357
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,705
It's similar to cooking skills.

358
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,874
You can have different tastes,

359
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,752
but there's a clear line between
good food and bad food.

360
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,300
I don't know much about art,

361
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,470
but I like yours.
I have a good feeling about it.

362
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:57,767
Really?

363
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,987
This is so good.

364
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,615
Can you explain how it tastes
in more detail?

365
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,122
The noodles taste similar
to what your grandpa made,

366
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:23,627
but the soup
is a bit more savory and light.

367
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,423
Anyway, I like this one more.

368
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,927
That's a relief.

369
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,763
I want to brag about this to my grandpa.

370
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,681
You shouldn't brag yet, though.

371
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,185
Oh, right.

372
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,771
Here.

373
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,273
I just picked it up, thinking of you.

374
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,276
Good luck with your presentation.

375
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,488
What's this?

376
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,991
Is it lipstick?

377
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,662
A gift for me?

378
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,289
Yes.

379
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,887
How does it look?

380
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,598
It looks good on you.

381
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,727
Thanks.

382
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,565
I'll do my best on my presentation.

383
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,149
Do-hyeok.

384
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,111
Right. Enjoy your food.

385
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,119
We're here again.

386
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,829
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

387
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,414
Yes?

388
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,084
You're all smiles.
Do you like her that much?

389
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,919
What?

390
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,049
Is it that obvious?

391
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,384
Yes. Totally.

392
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,803
She's going to find out soon.

393
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,055
Here.

394
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,310
On the house.

395
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,146
-You shouldn't have.
-Go on, give it to her.

396
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,399
But this heart's a bit…

397
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,818
Should I make a circle, then? Just go.

398
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,989
-Gosh…
-Come on. Don't be so shy.

399
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,752
It's no problem.

400
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,151
YU SE-HUN

401
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,824
<i>Hey, Gyu-hyun.
You know where Bit-na lives, right?</i>

402
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,868
<i>Text me her address.</i>

403
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,370
Why?

404
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,455
She's totally wasted.

405
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,624
I'm going to send her home in a taxi.

406
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,417
-<i>On the count of three.</i>
-What?

407
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,504
You can come pick her up
if you have a problem with that.

408
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,588
<i>So what will it be?</i>

409
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,548
-<i>Hey!</i>
-Where are you? I'll be there.

410
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,426
<i>What? Really? Didn't you say
you weren't feeling well?</i>

411
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,345
I'm fine. Send me your location.

412
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,994
What's happening?

413
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,501
Who are you?

414
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:58,800
Who is that?

415
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,391
Darn it.

416
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,106
Oh, my gosh.

417
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,651
Gosh, you startled me!

418
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,531
Let's go for another round.

419
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,741
-Yes!
-Yes!

420
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,033
After we send her home.

421
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,911
No, we have to take her with us.
Bit-na, let's go.

422
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,038
-Send her home.
-Bit-na, what's with you?

423
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,915
-Get up.
-Where should we go?

424
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,460
What? He took a taxi?

425
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,795
-Did you come like that?
-This far?

426
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,631
-Hey.
-It must have been expensive.

427
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,972
Go on. I'll take Bit-na home.

428
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,350
No! I can't let Bit-na go alone.
I'll come with you.

429
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,436
Where are you going?
You're coming with me.

430
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,355
-Hey!
-Right. I should go with you.

431
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,316
-What are you looking at?
-Just go.

432
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,402
Hey, thanks for this.

433
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,404
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

434
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,740
Take her back safely,

435
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,575
and send us a picture when you arrive.

436
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,368
Go on.

437
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,912
Stop that.

438
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,296
Hey, Bit-na.

439
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,924
Get up.

440
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,641
Who are you?

441
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,100
It's me.

442
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:35,688
Get on my back.

443
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,031
What? Are you crying?

444
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,910
How can you do this to me, you jerk?

445
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,373
Get lost! I don't want to touch
a traitor like you!

446
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,708
What is it this time?

447
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,921
What's the point of talking
to a drunk girl?

448
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,881
Come on, get on my back.

449
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,177
-You jerk.
-Hey! Have you lost it?

450
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,471
You said you hated mint chocolate!

451
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,390
You hate mint chocolate.

452
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,393
-Did you like her that much?
-What?

453
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,478
You jerk.

454
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,147
You said you wanted to date me
only a while ago.

455
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,235
Too bad you got rejected when
you even ate mint chocolate for her.

456
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,945
It must be so agonizing.

457
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,030
Who says I got rejected?

458
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,450
Get lost. I'm not going to talk
to a guy who eats mint chocolate.

459
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,245
What about you? You were
being so friendly with Mr. An.

460
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,454
What? No way.

461
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,874
Then why did you ignore me
at the bar last time?

462
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,711
This is ridiculous. You were with
another guy back then too.

463
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,839
Whatever.

464
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,759
Stop crying.

465
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,558
I didn't eat it because she asked to.

466
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:59,147
I tried it because I heard
it's good for stress and insomnia.

467
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,608
But it wasn't effective at all.

468
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,778
I can't even sleep these days
because of you.

469
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,364
That's nonsense!
Why would that be my fault?

470
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,201
Well…

471
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,664
I think of you every night.

472
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,294
What?

473
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,423
Why are you hitting on me now?

474
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,180
Come here.

475
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,817
Stop crying.

476
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,280
Let's go. It's late.

477
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,575
Let's go.

478
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,994
Come on.

479
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,172
There you go.

480
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,008
Get on my back.

481
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:21,562
Hey. Stop seeing other girls
and just go out with me.

482
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:23,856
That's a lame line.

483
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,151
Give me a break.
I've never asked someone out before.

484
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,863
You better not go back
on your word tomorrow.

485
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,156
I can't be sure.

486
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:37,203
And why did you dye your hair like that?

487
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,288
You're already so pretty.

488
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,251
And stop drinking so much.

489
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:47,171
You know how dangerous it is
to get wasted like that at night?

490
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,340
-Jeez! Hey!
-What?

491
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:53,094
Everything you say is so boring.

492
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,096
But why are you such a good kisser?

493
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,764
Right, I'm a good kisser.

494
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,684
Let's go.

495
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,937
Let's go!

496
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,628
I think it's too much to the left.

497
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,213
Move it more to the right.

498
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,631
-All right!
-Okay.

499
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,840
Just a little more.

500
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,928
What? What is it?

501
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,638
It's unbelievable.

502
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,473
How could you have been living there?

503
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,974
Hey!

504
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,976
Is there something wrong?

505
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,896
No, it's okay. It's perfect now.

506
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,151
I'm only sleeping there until tonight.
So keep it a secret.

507
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:33,402
What about after that?

508
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,533
Just mind your own business.

509
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,617
You know--

510
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,870
No! I don't want to ask
my parents for help.

511
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,205
You can stay at my house.

512
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,211
My roommate went to the military
a while ago.

513
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,174
What are you on about?
Are you asking me to live with you?

514
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,678
You and me? That's total nonsense.

515
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,263
Why? What about it?

516
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,849
Lots of people do that in other countries.

517
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,436
Well, that's true, but…

518
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,273
Just think about it.

519
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,859
Just pay the rent
you paid for your old house.

520
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,739
Hey, raise the right side. The right side.

521
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,158
My gosh.

522
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,743
He's just too nice.

523
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,416
Are you nervous?

524
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:30,877
Yes, more than I thought.

525
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,089
Look at me.

526
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,176
Do I look better with my hair up?

527
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,600
-There isn't much difference.
-Right?

528
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,185
They're both pretty.

529
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,062
Right. Did you get an assistant?

530
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:54,317
The others seemed to be talking
about who they'll have as an assistant.

531
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,652
Not yet.

532
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,363
I should've done that too.

533
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,282
What if nobody volunteers?

534
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,950
I'm sure there will be volunteers.

535
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,998
Oh, right. Sol was looking for you.

536
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,499
Did you talk to her?

537
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,628
No. I don't want to talk to her.

538
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:16,422
What is it? Did something happen?

539
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,425
You knew, right?

540
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,887
You knew she decided not to leave
as an exchange student, right?

541
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,263
I didn't.

542
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,183
I didn't know. Did she say she's staying?

543
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,267
You're so obvious.

544
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,607
I'm trying to hold back until her
presentation's over, so I'm ignoring her.

545
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,692
But this is driving me crazy.

546
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,072
Good thinking. Just yell at her
once her presentation's over.

547
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,324
She's so annoying!

548
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,369
If she's treating me like this,
she shouldn't call me her bestie!

549
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:50,498
She's making me feel
like I'm obsessing over her.

550
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,211
I'm going.

551
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,213
Good luck.

552
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,674
Thanks.

553
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,344
-You're the best, Na-bi.
-Thanks.

554
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:31,080
I have to do my best on the presentation
and get an assistant.

555
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,332
I'm sure you'll do well,

556
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,751
but if you can't find one, I'll help you.

557
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,670
<i>I'm good at taking orders.</i>

558
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,841
Really? You promise, right?
You can't go back on your words.

559
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,344
But what do I do if no one volunteers?

560
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,223
I'm so worried.

561
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:51,809
Oh, my gosh.

562
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,398
Sorry, Do-hyeok. My friend is here.

563
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,816
I'll call you again later.

564
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,445
What was that for?

565
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,031
-I was jealous.
-What?

566
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,575
You look better with your hair up.

567
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,335
How long are you going to avoid me?

568
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,337
When did I avoid you?

569
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,300
You're the one who ignored me
when we ran into each other.

570
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,470
At the stairs?

571
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,889
Did that bother you?

572
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,349
I guess it worked.

573
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:36,771
What are you on about?

574
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,524
Good luck on your presentation.

575
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:56,874
We will now begin the presentations
for the 12th Hongseo Gallery Exhibition.

576
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,334
A round of applause, please.

577
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,174
There are nine presenters today.

578
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,176
We will select the assistants

579
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,554
for each piece
after their presentations are over.

580
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:15,309
The assistants will help the presenters
with their pieces.

581
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,604
They will be helping them through
the entire process, starting from

582
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,232
making the piece
up to preparing for the exhibition.

583
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,943
It differs by each piece,

584
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,237
but we recommend having

585
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,698
around one to three assistants.

586
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,202
There is a limit to the number
of volunteers,

587
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:37,248
so even if there are many for your piece,
it's best not to use them all.

588
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,627
The theme of my piece
is "observation of objects."

589
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,547
What I want to express through my piece

590
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,924
is human desire.

591
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,639
Hello, I'm Yun Sol from
the Department of Sculpture.

592
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,432
12TH HONGSEO GALLERY EXHIBITION
PRESENTATION BY YUN SOL

593
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:58,853
The main theme of my piece is "union."

594
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,565
The main material I used
is railway sleepers.

595
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,693
The rigidity and the traces of endurance

596
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,362
on abandoned sleepers
seemed very attractive.

597
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,324
So I focused on emphasizing
the basic attributions of the material,

598
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,410
such as the oil stains made over time.

599
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,079
I wanted to make the materials

600
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,918
seem attractive.

601
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,337
Thank you.

602
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,550
You're the best, Yun Sol!

603
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,634
What?

604
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,180
Good job.

605
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:40,436
Next, Yu Na-bi from
the Department of Sculpture.

606
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,820
Hello, I'm Yu Na-bi
from the Department of Sculpture.

607
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,031
The theme of my piece is…

608
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,244
Well…

609
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:02,458
The theme of my piece is <i>"yeoji."</i>

610
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,587
The Chinese characters
mean "left over" and "land."

611
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,090
Thus, an empty area of land.

612
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:13,844
It means a possibility or hope
of something happening.

613
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,891
Cho Seong-sik from Sculpture
with the piece titled "coexistence."

614
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,269
Raise your hand if you want to be
an assistant.

615
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,855
-I want to do it.
-Me too.

616
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,232
Me too.

617
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:29,985
Cho Seong-sik?
Do you accept them as your assistants?

618
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,403
-Yes.
-Come on out.

619
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:44,667
Yu Na-bi from Sculpture
with the piece titled <i>"yeoji."</i>

620
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,503
Who would like to assist Yu Na-bi?
Raise your hands.

621
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:52,883
What?

622
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,812
What? No way.

623
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:11,318
Na-bi. Do you accept
Jae-eon as your assistant?

624
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,993
Yes.

625
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,288
-All right. If that's everyone--
-Me!

626
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:24,665
I'll volunteer as well.

627
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,668
Do you accept Hwang Jin-su
as your assistant?

628
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,752
Yes, I do.

629
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,591
All right. Come up.

630
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,654
All right, then.
You should share your work schedules

631
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:59,575
and related materials with your assistants

632
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,035
before we finish up.

633
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:04,830
The report format
is uploaded on our school website.

634
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,999
-Make sure to check that.
-Okay.

635
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,668
-Good job.
-Thank you!

636
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,672
You tied your hair.

637
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,843
Yes. It was a bit hot.

638
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,180
Are you really going to do this?

639
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,682
What do you mean?

640
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,392
You really don't need to.

641
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:26,894
I thought it'd be fun.

642
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,480
I like your ideas.

643
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:33,108
And it seems interesting to work
with metal.

644
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:40,115
To be honest, I haven't worked with
metal before. So I'm not that skilled.

645
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,160
I'll help you.
That's what assistants are for.

646
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,165
You don't want to work with me?

647
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,086
It's not like that, but…

648
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,420
But?

649
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:57,216
<i>I feel embarrassed
for not being able to believe</i>

650
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,343
<i>-that he sincerely liked my piece.</i>
-Na-bi.

651
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,223
I'm looking forward to working with you.

652
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,601
-Thanks.
-I'm in an awesome team.

653
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,688
Me too.

654
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,236
Me too.

655
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,996
Thanks for volunteering to assist me.

656
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,209
Here are the materials.

657
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,509
Do you both have time this evening?

658
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,512
Drinks to celebrate becoming a team?

659
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,348
I know a metalworking studio.

660
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,559
Want to check it out?

661
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,186
Yes!

662
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,484
All right then.

663
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:28,307
JAE-EON

664
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,990
Come in.

665
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,333
What? Why is there no one here?

666
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:56,502
The owner got off work.

667
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,172
I'm using his studio when it's not open.

668
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,883
I live upstairs.

669
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,219
I see.

670
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,388
I didn't know you worked this hard.

671
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,433
Aren't you overdoing it?

672
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:12,976
I have a long way to go.

673
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,022
<i>I envy his passion.</i>

674
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,573
<i>I think I'll be about 30 minutes late.
Sorry.</i>

675
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,660
Jin-su's going to be a bit late.

676
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,995
Sit down.

677
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,804
-Do you want a drink?
-Sure.

678
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,405
It's been a while since we talked.

679
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,532
It hasn't been that long.

680
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,207
What?

681
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,671
The day we went to the police station…

682
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,675
I'm sorry.

683
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,678
I shouldn't have done that to you.

684
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,514
What's with the sudden apology?

685
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,851
You were right about me drawing the line.

686
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:41,189
When people cross a certain line,

687
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,860
they feel like it's meaningless.

688
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,738
But…

689
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,490
I want to change now.

690
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,830
<i>I should stop reading too much
into his words now.</i>

691
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,500
Change how?
Are you thinking of dating now?

692
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,254
I'm not sure.

693
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,760
I'm thinking of changing bit by bit.

694
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,054
Then who knows?

695
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,306
I might meet my soulmate.

696
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,645
I'll be rooting for you, then.

697
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,357
I hope you can be sincere this time.

698
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,813
You can adjust the fire with this.

699
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,031
Be careful. It's hot.

700
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,952
Start from the middle and go to the edge.

701
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,753
Start here and straighten it out
little by little.

702
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,260
It's not straightening out.

703
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,594
Hit it harder.

704
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,440
-It's flat, right?
-Cool.

705
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,238
-Yes, like that.
-It's getting flat.

706
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,157
Good. You're getting better.

707
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,752
Jin-su said he'd be 30 minutes late,
but he never came.

708
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,882
How was it?
It wasn't that difficult, right?

709
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,217
Right.

710
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,970
I think I can do it if I work hard.

711
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,973
Call me whenever you want to work.
You'll make a masterpiece.

712
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,433
Stop teasing me.

713
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,102
I'm not teasing you. I like your pieces.

714
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,314
Especially this one.
I'm looking forward to it.

715
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,360
I didn't know you liked it that much.

716
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:36,865
I'll get going.

717
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,035
Na-bi.

718
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,375
I changed my number.

719
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:58,637
Bye.

720
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:12,609
MISSED CALLS
SEOL-A

721
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,093
<i>-Hey, Seol-a.</i>
-Hey.

722
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,427
Were you waiting for me?

723
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,639
No.

724
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:47,185
I just called to say
I can't make it today.

725
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,272
-That's a relief.
-Were you busy?

726
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,274
Yes, a bit. I was working.

727
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:54,609
All right.

728
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,654
Go back to work, then.

729
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,004
I like your pieces.

730
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,674
Especially this one.
I'm looking forward to it.

731
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:13,290
So is this crumbling down,

732
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,083
or being made?

733
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,211
That's up to interpretation.

734
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:26,428
It's good.

735
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,058
Na-bi seems to have gained
her focus again.

736
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,977
Thank you.

737
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,314
It's so cool. Just a few days ago,
there was nothing.

738
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:43,820
Bit-na. When are you
going to show me your piece?

739
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,784
Focus on your work, okay?

740
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,287
Bit-na, let me see you work properly!

741
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,039
Where is she going?

742
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:56,541
This is great.

743
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:20,190
Doesn't Jae-eon seem a bit different?

744
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,692
He seems a bit purer.

745
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:25,320
Right. He seems different somehow.

746
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,447
I heard he doesn't hang out with girls.

747
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,616
What happened to him?

748
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,869
Is he dating someone for real now?

749
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:36,623
How would we ever understand the life
of a handsome guy?

750
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,666
-Good work.
-Good work.

751
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,546
-Give me one too.
-Here.

752
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,882
-Here you go.
-Have one.

753
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,135
-You try this.
-It's good.

754
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,066
-You want to make wings?
-Yes.

755
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:07,362
But I don't know what kind of shape
I should make it into.

756
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:13,952
I should print this one.

757
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,815
FOR REFERENCE

758
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:46,234
I wish I could see this in person.

759
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:49,112
-You can.
-How?

760
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,322
This artist's having an exhibition.

761
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:53,533
It opens next week. Do you want to go?

762
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,245
Sure. Let's do that.

763
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,788
Hey, Jin-su.

764
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,961
He's sleeping again.

765
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,381
<i>Our relationship took a new turn,</i>

766
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:12,802
<i>and I found peace in my mind
within that friendly relationship.</i>

767
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,974
Yes, I'm here.

768
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,767
Just because.

769
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:26,441
I thought I should cut my hair.

770
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:30,945
I didn't go to a hair shop in America,
so it got kind of messy.

771
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,949
Really? Should I cut it short, then?

772
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:39,913
I guess I'll do that. All right.

773
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,247
I'll see you tomorrow.

774
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:49,756
I'll get it for you…

775
01:06:58,598 --> 01:06:59,807
Thanks.

776
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:07,065
Are you Yu Na-bi, by any chance?

777
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,275
Do you know me?

778
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,487
Jae-eon said you were a friend
in the same department.

779
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:16,324
Right.

780
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,993
Are you here to see Jae-eon?

781
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:23,206
Yes. I just came
because I wanted to see him.

782
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:26,876
He's probably busy.
We have a lot of assignments.

783
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,169
Really?

784
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,965
He said he'd come out.
I feel kind of sorry now.

785
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,056
Hey, Jae-eon.

786
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:42,517
Oh, really?

787
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:45,562
It's fine. Take your time.

788
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,982
I don't smoke that much.

789
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,110
All right.

790
01:07:56,823 --> 01:08:00,785
Excuse me,
but what's your relationship with Jae-eon?

791
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,246
We used to date.

792
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:06,499
I see.

793
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,005
And…

794
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,092
we're seeing each other again.

795
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:27,687
But are you really just friends with him?

796
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,905
Yes. We're just friends.

797
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,825
That's a relief.

798
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,244
I thought maybe I said something
I shouldn't have.

799
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:55,757
You should

800
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,843
just keep your hair that way.

801
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:00,720
What?

802
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:06,059
Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.

803
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:07,578
<i>A distance that's close enough
yet not too close to hurt each other.</i>

804
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:10,456
<i>Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.</i>

805
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,583
-Na-bi is coming?
-You didn't know?

806
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,460
<i>She disappeared.</i>

807
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,546
<i>That's what you hate the most.</i>

808
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,339
<i>Getting clingy.</i>

809
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,049
<i>Certainty about the relationship.</i>

810
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:22,510
How does one get that certainty?

811
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,679
<i>I didn't know you'd be coming along.</i>

812
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,181
I've always wanted to come here.

813
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,099
Cheers.

814
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,852
<i>Then is it over with him now?</i>

815
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,687
<i>It must be someone you like.</i>

816
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,355
<i>No, just someone bothersome.</i>

817
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:37,692
<i>I know very well that a person
who doesn't know how to love someone</i>

818
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:38,818
<i>can never be happy.</i>

819
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:40,319
<i>You're coming here?</i>

820
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:43,406
<i>Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.</i>

821
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:47,618
