1
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:49,787
There it is.

2
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:53,916
By the way,

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,086
don't you think there's something
going on between Na-bi and Jae-eon?

4
00:00:57,169 --> 00:01:00,673
Hey. Honestly, how could Na-bi date
a guy like Jae-eon?

5
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,591
Why? Na-bi's pretty.

6
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:05,344
That's not what I mean.
Jae-eon is the problem.

7
00:01:05,928 --> 00:01:07,513
He's not sincere toward anyone.

8
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:10,516
That's why I ended things
after a few dates.

9
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:14,520
Really? You're the one who rejected him?

10
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:19,191
Yes. I got away from him,
but Na-bi didn't.

11
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:20,693
There are rumors about her.

12
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:22,862
What a way to end her school life.

13
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:24,363
I know, right?

14
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:26,824
-Did you get everything?
-Yes. Let's go.

15
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:41,839
<i>Are you working?
I'm arriving at school soon.</i>

16
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:48,262
Is there someone else you're seeing?

17
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:50,890
No.

18
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:53,225
Really?

19
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,326
Excuse me.

20
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:13,329
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

21
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:15,206
Yes.

22
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,959
So it's you.

23
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,672
You bastard!

24
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:26,175
Sir! What are you doing?

25
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:28,219
-Move!
-Why are you doing this?

26
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:33,849
To be honest,
I don't get why you're so upset.

27
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,684
You didn't need to ghost me like that.

28
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:43,734
I…

29
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:45,403
Get out of the way!

30
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,987
What was that?

31
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:50,866
Na-bi!

32
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:55,538
Get up, you jerk!

33
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,625
Stop, Jae-eon!

34
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,257
-You asshole. Move!
-Sir, wait!

35
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,050
-Move!
-Sir!

36
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:10,010
-Why did you do it?
-What are you doing?

37
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:11,637
Why did you do it?

38
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:13,889
Why? Why did you do it?

39
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:16,267
-Why did you do it?
-Police?

40
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,353
I'm at Hongseo University and a man is…

41
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:21,063
-Sol, stop him.
-Why did you do it?

42
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:22,732
-Come quickly!
-Are you okay?

43
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:24,692
Why?

44
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,112
Stop it, Jae-eon.

45
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:35,578
EPISODE 5: I KNOW NOTHING WILL CHANGE.
NEVERTHELESS,

46
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:40,791
We'll be off now.

47
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,169
What? I'm curious…

48
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,673
I mean, I'm worried about them.

49
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:50,217
Call me if anything happens.

50
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:52,720
Okay. You should go.

51
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:54,054
Bye.

52
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:57,183
-Be careful. Bye.
-Make sure to call if anything happens.

53
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,023
HONGSEO POLICE STATION

54
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:33,052
How dare you touch someone
who's already taken?

55
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:35,930
If you ever come near my sister again,

56
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:38,891
I'm going to kill you. You scumbag.

57
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,353
Miss.

58
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:44,563
Let me give you some advice.

59
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:47,900
You should meet a decent guy.

60
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:52,154
You'll ruin your life
if you date an asshole like him.

61
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:08,295
You had something to say.

62
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:11,465
-What is it?
-Let's talk later.

63
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:12,967
I'm going home.

64
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,553
Didn't you get hurt?
Let's go to the hospital.

65
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:17,555
I'm fine. Just worry about yourself.

66
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,065
I wonder what they're talking about now.
I bet they're totally fighting.

67
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:31,860
I think I just made things worse
by reporting it.

68
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:34,321
No, you did the right thing.
And it's fine now.

69
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:37,032
Na-bi could have gotten hurt.

70
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,701
Right?

71
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:43,747
But Na-bi was trying to stop that man
from hitting Jae-eon.

72
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:45,541
It was so cool.

73
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:47,418
-She would have been so scared.
-Right.

74
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:50,796
Na-bi should have been angry at him,

75
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,257
but she took his side.

76
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,427
I guess it's because she likes him a lot.

77
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:05,436
I should go.

78
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:07,938
See you tomorrow.

79
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,275
I'll take you home.

80
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:15,654
You're acting a bit strange today.
Do you have something to say?

81
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:19,867
We didn't get to finish
what we were talking about.

82
00:06:21,368 --> 00:06:23,245
It's fine.

83
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,289
This is how we always make up.

84
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:27,041
As if nothing happened.

85
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,253
I feel like
we shouldn't do that this time.

86
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,465
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about leaving

87
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:37,593
as an exchange student.

88
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:41,889
I was more upset by how you said
that was the extent of our relationship.

89
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:43,307
Hey! You're the one who--

90
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:49,355
All right. I'm sorry about that too.

91
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:54,068
I'm sorry about
how I acted at the flea market too.

92
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:56,320
But why aren't you sorry for
not telling me about him?

93
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:58,280
Hey, that's unfair.

94
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,324
Ju-hyeok and I aren't dating.

95
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:02,284
Then what's your relationship with him?

96
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:30,062
Put this on your lip.

97
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:37,486
Thanks.

98
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:40,447
I didn't want you to see me like this.

99
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:43,283
You nursed me when I was sick.

100
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:46,203
So let's call it even now. I'm going home.

101
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,248
You're not going to see me anymore?

102
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:55,587
I want to stay friends with you.

103
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:56,922
"Friends"?

104
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:00,342
What do friends even mean to you?

105
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:03,470
-What do you mean?
-Why did you lie to me?

106
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:05,472
You said you weren't seeing anyone else.

107
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:08,225
-Is that so important?
-Hey.

108
00:08:09,226 --> 00:08:11,395
What do you want from me?

109
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:13,439
Right.

110
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:17,818
You just want someone who's stupid
so you can--

111
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:19,903
-What's with you?
-What?

112
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:22,740
You always draw the line like this.

113
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:26,368
You just want to see me when you want,

114
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:28,162
but you're scared I'll get clingy?

115
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,830
Don't worry.

116
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:32,082
That's not going to happen.

117
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:34,835
It's not like that!

118
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,886
Then what are we?

119
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,308
Weren't you okay
with everything until now?

120
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,518
-Why are you suddenly--
-Right.

121
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:54,646
Sorry for acting so cool about it
until now.

122
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:59,026
Honestly, I haven't heard anything good
since I started seeing you.

123
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:01,945
I pretended not to notice even
when I knew you weren't sincere,

124
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:03,197
because…

125
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:06,700
Because…

126
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:09,203
<i>I like you.</i>

127
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:21,048
But I can't stand this anymore.
Let's end this.

128
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:23,383
What?

129
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:24,426
It's funny, right?

130
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,262
There's nothing to end anyway.

131
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:31,350
Yu Na-bi.

132
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:35,062
Thanks for giving me a reason
to decide to end things.

133
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:41,777
All right. Let's end this.

134
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:45,155
You're the one who gets to decide.

135
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:53,330
Gosh. You're really…

136
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:59,461
You're really a jerk until the end.

137
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,698
Jae-eon and Na-bi were having an affair,

138
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:12,451
and that woman caught them!

139
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:16,371
-No way! They got caught in the act?
-Yes.

140
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:20,459
So Jae-eon actually got hit by that woman?
That's what happened to his face?

141
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,544
-Yes.
-I heard it was a guy, though.

142
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:26,590
-Is Jae-eon…
-No way.

143
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:28,091
Are you sure about that?

144
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:31,762
I heard it was Na-bi who hit Jae-eon.

145
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:33,597
Someone saw them fighting at night.

146
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,474
Why would Na-bi hit him?

147
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:38,352
-Because she found out he was cheating!
-That's ridiculous.

148
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:42,439
Se-yeong. If Na-bi really hit Jae-eon
that hard, she should join the UFC.

149
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,817
Na-bi should have been happy
after leaving me.

150
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:48,695
-Jeez.
-You're so ridiculous.

151
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:51,239
What's that reaction?

152
00:11:51,323 --> 00:11:52,658
It's just a hair dye.

153
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,743
-You're unbelievable.
-It's so pretty.

154
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:56,078
What should we do with you?

155
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:59,331
She's a total attention-seeker.

156
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:00,248
Why? Looks good.

157
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:03,460
Is it that bad? Everyone at the hair shop
said I looked good.

158
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:05,629
It's pretty, but it's a shocking look.

159
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:08,090
The color's really pretty.
Did you bleach it first?

160
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:10,092
Yes. I almost lost all my hair.

161
00:12:13,303 --> 00:12:14,763
By the way, Bit-na.

162
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:18,517
Did you hear anything
about Na-bi and Jae-eon?

163
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,102
Hey, be quiet. Na-bi's coming.

164
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:24,731
-Sol's coming too.
-Hey!

165
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:26,942
You both aren't coming to the workshop?

166
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:29,820
Bit-na, you changed your hair.
It looks nice.

167
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:31,863
Thanks, but don't change the subject.

168
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:33,949
How can both of you not come?

169
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:36,243
I feel so betrayed right now!

170
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:38,370
You should come.

171
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,205
The professors aren't coming.

172
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,874
We can just hang out by ourselves.

173
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,294
-I'm not sure.
-You should both come.

174
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:48,505
Can't you ask Jae-eon to come, too?

175
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:50,549
Everyone will come if he comes.

176
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:52,759
Ask him yourself.
Don't ask her to do that.

177
00:12:53,343 --> 00:12:54,970
But they're close…

178
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:58,181
But what happened to Jae-eon's face?

179
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,684
What do you mean?

180
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:04,479
You know, right?
Who did he have a fight with?

181
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:10,694
Can you please stop asking me
about Jae-eon now?

182
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:13,989
I don't know much about him, either.

183
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:17,868
-Hey.
-Jeez, what are you doing?

184
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,536
Come on. Start working.

185
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:33,467
Hi.

186
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:39,347
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:43,977
He must have seen something
and misunderstood.

188
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,354
He suddenly went all crazy.

189
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:50,609
You must be really upset.

190
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:53,945
Tell your girlfriend I'm sorry too.

191
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:57,324
-My girlfriend?
-I heard you were with someone.

192
00:13:57,908 --> 00:13:59,534
Wasn't she your girlfriend?

193
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:02,412
If anything happens, call me.

194
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:06,291
Even if it's nothing special.

195
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,044
That won't happen.
It'll be the best for both of us.

196
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:11,046
Right.

197
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,398
Gyu-hyun?

198
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:36,738
Thank you.

199
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:45,872
How is it?

200
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:48,959
He's actually eating mint chocolate?

201
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:51,545
PINT SIZE
CHOOSE 3 FLAVORS

202
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:53,213
Chocolate and cashew nuts.

203
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,550
-Hi!
-Hi.

204
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:59,094
Hey, we're ordering ice cream.
Choose a flavor.

205
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:02,139
-I want…
-Sorry, you can't choose anymore.

206
00:15:02,222 --> 00:15:04,724
I'm going to order mint chocolate
for the third one.

207
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:09,646
What? You both don't like mint chocolate?

208
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:11,898
-I hate it.
-Why would you eat toothpaste?

209
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:13,024
I know, right?

210
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:16,903
It's good.

211
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:07,871
This isn't that simple, you know.

212
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:09,873
Art isn't easy.

213
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:12,792
Making something doesn't mean
it will become an art piece.

214
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:14,377
Haven't I told you several times?

215
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:16,796
<i>I've never seen his face like that.</i>

216
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,298
<i>Did he feel hurt by my words?</i>

217
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:22,385
-And most of all, your inspiration…
-<i>No, there's no way.</i>

218
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:25,764
Na-bi. Are you listening to me?

219
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:26,806
What?

220
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:31,520
This is bad.

221
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:35,232
Will you even
be able to finish this on time?

222
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,275
Sorry, Professor.

223
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,829
That traitor.

224
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:02,801
I was wondering why you were
in the studio for a change.

225
00:17:02,884 --> 00:17:04,469
Did you get rejected, too?

226
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:06,179
Of course not, Professor.

227
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:08,848
I'm the one who rejects guys.
I'd never get rejected.

228
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:11,851
And I work at the studio often too.

229
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,770
-Is that so?
-Yes.

230
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:16,022
Then when can I see your work?

231
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:18,984
I promise to show mine to you
next time, Professor.

232
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,329
Sol.

233
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:33,873
Yun Sol.

234
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,876
You're losing focus these days too.

235
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,630
Did you decide to give up everything
since you're not leaving?

236
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:45,802
No. I'm sorry, Professor.

237
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:53,393
Sol didn't tell me again.

238
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,942
Everything's a mess.

239
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:03,320
What has gotten into you all?

240
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,573
You should be putting everything
into your work right now.

241
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:10,118
I told you to get inspiration,

242
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,037
not be reckless!

243
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:17,959
"She's at it again."
That's what you're thinking, right?

244
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,587
I'm just barking like a dog, aren't I?

245
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:24,090
My goodness. Maybe I was
a dog in my previous life.

246
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:25,258
No, Professor.

247
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:26,926
-No, Professor.
-Sorry, Professor.

248
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:37,354
-Yun Sol. Here.
-What? Thanks.

249
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:40,231
Don't take it too personally.
I loved your piece.

250
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:42,150
Right. Thanks.

251
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:46,780
By the way, did you really decide
not to leave as an exchange student?

252
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:56,164
Yes.

253
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,752
Why? Did something happen?

254
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,380
Just because.

255
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:06,049
I didn't want to leave.

256
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:11,179
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK TRIPE

257
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:29,155
You said your tongue gets numb.

258
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:56,099
But I can't stand this anymore.
Let's end this.

259
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,771
All right. Let's end this.

260
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:04,858
You're the one who gets to decide.

261
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:26,689
Move!

262
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,026
Na-bi!

263
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:24,414
PARK JAE-EON

264
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:31,129
<i>The number you have dialed is not
in the directory.</i>

265
00:22:31,212 --> 00:22:33,756
<i>Please check the number and call again.</i>

266
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:18,319
ALARM

267
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,631
<i>I miss him.</i>

268
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:34,228
Na-bi's lost it after ending things
with Jae-eon.

269
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:36,939
She totally got busted by the professor.

270
00:25:37,023 --> 00:25:38,858
She does seem strange these days.

271
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:41,736
She's working late,
but there's no progress.

272
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:44,697
I know, right? Why did she have
to get in a relationship?

273
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:48,576
Things would have been better
if it was an actual relationship.

274
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,077
That's the same thing.

275
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:52,163
Why would you do that to yourself?

276
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:55,166
One is bound to end up like that
when it's over.

277
00:25:57,543 --> 00:25:58,920
You should be careful too.

278
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:01,339
Gosh.

279
00:26:02,215 --> 00:26:03,758
We're totally fine.

280
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:13,309
There's another victim of love over there.

281
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:19,023
Nam Gyu-hyun?

282
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:21,776
Did something happen?

283
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:24,654
I set him up on a blind date, remember?

284
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:27,740
I thought it was going well,
but my friend rejected him!

285
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:32,912
Look at him. I feel so sorry.

286
00:26:32,995 --> 00:26:36,457
So you're saying he's like that
because he got rejected by her?

287
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,834
Yes.

288
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:38,918
Hey!

289
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:43,172
Is your friend that attractive?
To be honest, she didn't look that pretty…

290
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:45,633
What? Have you seen her?

291
00:26:48,135 --> 00:26:52,181
No. I'm just saying…

292
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:54,934
Gyu-hyun's pretty good-looking, you know.

293
00:26:55,017 --> 00:26:56,811
That's right.

294
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:59,355
But I shouldn't set up
any more blind dates.

295
00:27:04,527 --> 00:27:06,279
Darn it.

296
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:24,005
Why don't you leave your hair down?

297
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,134
Just for me.

298
00:28:13,596 --> 00:28:17,892
I was thinking of returning
the necklace to you.

299
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:19,977
Just throw it away, then.

300
00:28:21,812 --> 00:28:23,689
You say that so easily.

301
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:30,947
SEOL-A

302
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,043
Hey, Seol-a.

303
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:47,004
What?

304
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:51,259
I'll be there right away.

305
00:29:06,607 --> 00:29:08,901
The fee should be about 50,000 won each,

306
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:10,987
so let's go with the place we changed to.

307
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:14,615
Are you writing this down?

308
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:18,160
Yes. He's done.

309
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:20,538
Okay, that's it for today.

310
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:23,332
What should we get?

311
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,126
-Vodka?
-Yes!

312
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:26,919
Should we go for drinks?

313
00:29:27,003 --> 00:29:28,713
-Let's go!
-Yes!

314
00:29:28,796 --> 00:29:30,256
Should we call the others?

315
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:33,175
Who? Remember last time
when you called so many people?

316
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:35,136
Gyu-hyun, aren't you coming?

317
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:36,387
No.

318
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,889
Oh, no. He must have really liked her.

319
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:41,183
Maybe I should talk to my friend.

320
00:29:43,894 --> 00:29:47,148
VISITORS RESTRICTED
IN EMERGENCY ROOM

321
00:29:48,232 --> 00:29:50,234
How do you feel? Are you okay?

322
00:29:52,194 --> 00:29:54,071
Yes. Thanks.

323
00:29:55,156 --> 00:29:56,574
How much was it?

324
00:29:56,657 --> 00:29:57,700
It's fine.

325
00:29:58,242 --> 00:30:00,119
You have severe anemia.

326
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:02,580
Make sure to take your meds.

327
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,959
-It's so bothersome.
-You could faint on the streets.

328
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:12,381
You put your hair down. It suits you.

329
00:30:13,132 --> 00:30:14,216
Really?

330
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:16,677
I should keep it down, then.

331
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:20,681
Is something going on?

332
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,229
You changed your number
and your hairstyle.

333
00:30:27,313 --> 00:30:29,231
What's going on?

334
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:34,570
Just because.

335
00:30:35,571 --> 00:30:36,989
I got sick of things.

336
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,908
What do you mean?

337
00:30:40,368 --> 00:30:41,827
I'm sick of myself.

338
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:51,337
It will be a narrow but firm base.

339
00:30:53,172 --> 00:30:54,173
Right.

340
00:30:57,468 --> 00:30:58,552
Hey.

341
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:09,522
Is it really okay for you to be here?

342
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:11,357
Sure, just for a little while.

343
00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:15,986
Is that what you're presenting tomorrow?

344
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:18,823
Well, yes.

345
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:21,409
Can I see? I'm curious.

346
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:24,370
Sure.

347
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,915
It's nothing special.

348
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:32,420
I'm just going to explain
what kind of piece I'm making.

349
00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:38,884
But honestly, I don't know
if I can really make it like that.

350
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:42,888
-Gosh. This is so cool.
-This is so good.

351
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:51,397
How do you come up with this?

352
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:53,482
You're awesome.

353
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:57,111
It's really nothing special.

354
00:31:57,194 --> 00:31:59,488
There are so many people better than me.

355
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:02,783
Is there a good or bad for art, too?

356
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,201
Of course.

357
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:07,705
It's similar to cooking skills.

358
00:32:07,788 --> 00:32:09,874
You can have different tastes,

359
00:32:09,957 --> 00:32:13,752
but there's a clear line between
good food and bad food.

360
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:19,300
I don't know much about art,

361
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:22,470
but I like yours.
I have a good feeling about it.

362
00:32:27,725 --> 00:32:28,767
Really?

363
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:39,987
This is so good.

364
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,615
Can you explain how it tastes
in more detail?

365
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,122
The noodles taste similar
to what your grandpa made,

366
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:54,627
but the soup
is a bit more savory and light.

367
00:32:58,047 --> 00:32:59,423
Anyway, I like this one more.

368
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:02,927
That's a relief.

369
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,763
I want to brag about this to my grandpa.

370
00:33:05,846 --> 00:33:07,681
You shouldn't brag yet, though.

371
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:11,185
Oh, right.

372
00:33:12,728 --> 00:33:13,771
Here.

373
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:16,273
I just picked it up, thinking of you.

374
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:19,276
Good luck with your presentation.

375
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:22,488
What's this?

376
00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:25,991
Is it lipstick?

377
00:33:28,452 --> 00:33:29,662
A gift for me?

378
00:33:31,247 --> 00:33:32,289
Yes.

379
00:33:45,886 --> 00:33:46,887
How does it look?

380
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:49,598
It looks good on you.

381
00:33:52,893 --> 00:33:53,727
Thanks.

382
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:57,565
I'll do my best on my presentation.

383
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,149
Do-hyeok.

384
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:02,111
Right. Enjoy your food.

385
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:10,119
We're here again.

386
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:11,829
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

387
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:13,414
Yes?

388
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,084
You're all smiles.
Do you like her that much?

389
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,919
What?

390
00:34:22,464 --> 00:34:24,049
Is it that obvious?

391
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:25,384
Yes. Totally.

392
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:27,803
She's going to find out soon.

393
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:30,055
Here.

394
00:34:33,183 --> 00:34:34,310
On the house.

395
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,146
-You shouldn't have.
-Go on, give it to her.

396
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:40,399
But this heart's a bit…

397
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:42,818
Should I make a circle, then? Just go.

398
00:34:43,986 --> 00:34:46,989
-Gosh…
-Come on. Don't be so shy.

399
00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:59,752
It's no problem.

400
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,151
YU SE-HUN

401
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:30,824
<i>Hey, Gyu-hyun.
You know where Bit-na lives, right?</i>

402
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:32,868
<i>Text me her address.</i>

403
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:34,370
Why?

404
00:35:34,453 --> 00:35:36,455
She's totally wasted.

405
00:35:36,538 --> 00:35:38,624
I'm going to send her home in a taxi.

406
00:35:38,707 --> 00:35:40,417
-<i>On the count of three.</i>
-What?

407
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:43,504
You can come pick her up
if you have a problem with that.

408
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:44,588
<i>So what will it be?</i>

409
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:46,548
-<i>Hey!</i>
-Where are you? I'll be there.

410
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:49,426
<i>What? Really? Didn't you say
you weren't feeling well?</i>

411
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,345
I'm fine. Send me your location.

412
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:15,994
What's happening?

413
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:22,501
Who are you?

414
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:29,800
Who is that?

415
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:37,391
Darn it.

416
00:36:42,646 --> 00:36:44,106
Oh, my gosh.

417
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:47,651
Gosh, you startled me!

418
00:36:51,113 --> 00:36:52,531
Let's go for another round.

419
00:36:52,614 --> 00:36:53,741
-Yes!
-Yes!

420
00:36:53,824 --> 00:36:55,033
After we send her home.

421
00:36:55,117 --> 00:36:57,911
No, we have to take her with us.
Bit-na, let's go.

422
00:36:57,995 --> 00:37:00,038
-Send her home.
-Bit-na, what's with you?

423
00:37:00,122 --> 00:37:01,915
-Get up.
-Where should we go?

424
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,460
What? He took a taxi?

425
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:06,795
-Did you come like that?
-This far?

426
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:09,631
-Hey.
-It must have been expensive.

427
00:37:14,553 --> 00:37:16,972
Go on. I'll take Bit-na home.

428
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:20,350
No! I can't let Bit-na go alone.
I'll come with you.

429
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:22,436
Where are you going?
You're coming with me.

430
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:25,355
-Hey!
-Right. I should go with you.

431
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:27,316
-What are you looking at?
-Just go.

432
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:30,402
Hey, thanks for this.

433
00:37:30,486 --> 00:37:32,404
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

434
00:37:32,488 --> 00:37:34,740
Take her back safely,

435
00:37:34,823 --> 00:37:36,575
and send us a picture when you arrive.

436
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,368
Go on.

437
00:37:38,452 --> 00:37:39,912
Stop that.

438
00:37:48,295 --> 00:37:49,296
Hey, Bit-na.

439
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:51,924
Get up.

440
00:37:59,056 --> 00:38:00,641
Who are you?

441
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:02,100
It's me.

442
00:38:05,604 --> 00:38:06,688
Get on my back.

443
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:16,031
What? Are you crying?

444
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:19,910
How can you do this to me, you jerk?

445
00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:24,373
Get lost! I don't want to touch
a traitor like you!

446
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:26,708
What is it this time?

447
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:30,921
What's the point of talking
to a drunk girl?

448
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:32,881
Come on, get on my back.

449
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,177
-You jerk.
-Hey! Have you lost it?

450
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:39,471
You said you hated mint chocolate!

451
00:38:39,555 --> 00:38:41,390
You hate mint chocolate.

452
00:38:41,473 --> 00:38:44,393
-Did you like her that much?
-What?

453
00:38:44,476 --> 00:38:46,478
You jerk.

454
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:49,147
You said you wanted to date me
only a while ago.

455
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:53,235
Too bad you got rejected when
you even ate mint chocolate for her.

456
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:54,945
It must be so agonizing.

457
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:57,030
Who says I got rejected?

458
00:38:57,114 --> 00:39:00,450
Get lost. I'm not going to talk
to a guy who eats mint chocolate.

459
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:03,245
What about you? You were
being so friendly with Mr. An.

460
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:04,454
What? No way.

461
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:06,874
Then why did you ignore me
at the bar last time?

462
00:39:06,957 --> 00:39:10,711
This is ridiculous. You were with
another guy back then too.

463
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:13,839
Whatever.

464
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,759
Stop crying.

465
00:39:22,764 --> 00:39:24,558
I didn't eat it because she asked to.

466
00:39:26,184 --> 00:39:30,147
I tried it because I heard
it's good for stress and insomnia.

467
00:39:30,981 --> 00:39:32,608
But it wasn't effective at all.

468
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:36,778
I can't even sleep these days
because of you.

469
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:39,364
That's nonsense!
Why would that be my fault?

470
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:43,201
Well…

471
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:47,664
I think of you every night.

472
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:52,294
What?

473
00:39:53,754 --> 00:39:56,423
Why are you hitting on me now?

474
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:03,180
Come here.

475
00:40:14,316 --> 00:40:15,817
Stop crying.

476
00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:20,280
Let's go. It's late.

477
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:23,575
Let's go.

478
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:25,994
Come on.

479
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:37,172
There you go.

480
00:40:38,882 --> 00:40:40,008
Get on my back.

481
00:40:47,975 --> 00:40:52,562
Hey. Stop seeing other girls
and just go out with me.

482
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:54,856
That's a lame line.

483
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,151
Give me a break.
I've never asked someone out before.

484
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:01,863
You better not go back
on your word tomorrow.

485
00:41:01,947 --> 00:41:03,156
I can't be sure.

486
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:08,203
And why did you dye your hair like that?

487
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:10,288
You're already so pretty.

488
00:41:11,456 --> 00:41:14,251
And stop drinking so much.

489
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:18,171
You know how dangerous it is
to get wasted like that at night?

490
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,340
-Jeez! Hey!
-What?

491
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:24,094
Everything you say is so boring.

492
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:26,096
But why are you such a good kisser?

493
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:27,764
Right, I'm a good kisser.

494
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:30,684
Let's go.

495
00:41:32,894 --> 00:41:33,937
Let's go!

496
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:39,628
I think it's too much to the left.

497
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:41,213
Move it more to the right.

498
00:42:41,296 --> 00:42:42,631
-All right!
-Okay.

499
00:42:42,714 --> 00:42:43,840
Just a little more.

500
00:42:45,675 --> 00:42:47,928
What? What is it?

501
00:42:48,011 --> 00:42:49,638
It's unbelievable.

502
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:51,473
How could you have been living there?

503
00:42:51,556 --> 00:42:52,974
Hey!

504
00:42:53,058 --> 00:42:54,976
Is there something wrong?

505
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,896
No, it's okay. It's perfect now.

506
00:43:00,023 --> 00:43:03,151
I'm only sleeping there until tonight.
So keep it a secret.

507
00:43:03,235 --> 00:43:04,402
What about after that?

508
00:43:07,405 --> 00:43:09,533
Just mind your own business.

509
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:10,617
You know--

510
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,870
No! I don't want to ask
my parents for help.

511
00:43:13,954 --> 00:43:15,205
You can stay at my house.

512
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:21,211
My roommate went to the military
a while ago.

513
00:43:22,921 --> 00:43:26,174
What are you on about?
Are you asking me to live with you?

514
00:43:26,925 --> 00:43:29,678
You and me? That's total nonsense.

515
00:43:29,761 --> 00:43:31,263
Why? What about it?

516
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,849
Lots of people do that in other countries.

517
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:38,436
Well, that's true, but…

518
00:43:40,021 --> 00:43:41,273
Just think about it.

519
00:43:41,356 --> 00:43:43,859
Just pay the rent
you paid for your old house.

520
00:43:45,902 --> 00:43:49,739
Hey, raise the right side. The right side.

521
00:43:49,823 --> 00:43:51,158
My gosh.

522
00:43:52,576 --> 00:43:53,743
He's just too nice.

523
00:43:57,956 --> 00:43:59,416
Are you nervous?

524
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:01,877
Yes, more than I thought.

525
00:44:04,921 --> 00:44:06,089
Look at me.

526
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:09,176
Do I look better with my hair up?

527
00:44:14,556 --> 00:44:16,600
-There isn't much difference.
-Right?

528
00:44:16,683 --> 00:44:18,185
They're both pretty.

529
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,062
Right. Did you get an assistant?

530
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:25,317
The others seemed to be talking
about who they'll have as an assistant.

531
00:44:26,776 --> 00:44:27,652
Not yet.

532
00:44:28,445 --> 00:44:30,363
I should've done that too.

533
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:32,282
What if nobody volunteers?

534
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:33,950
I'm sure there will be volunteers.

535
00:44:37,037 --> 00:44:39,998
Oh, right. Sol was looking for you.

536
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:41,499
Did you talk to her?

537
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:44,628
No. I don't want to talk to her.

538
00:44:45,337 --> 00:44:47,422
What is it? Did something happen?

539
00:44:49,174 --> 00:44:50,425
You knew, right?

540
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:53,887
You knew she decided not to leave
as an exchange student, right?

541
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,263
I didn't.

542
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:58,183
I didn't know. Did she say she's staying?

543
00:44:58,266 --> 00:44:59,267
You're so obvious.

544
00:45:01,728 --> 00:45:05,607
I'm trying to hold back until her
presentation's over, so I'm ignoring her.

545
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,692
But this is driving me crazy.

546
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:12,072
Good thinking. Just yell at her
once her presentation's over.

547
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:14,324
She's so annoying!

548
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:17,369
If she's treating me like this,
she shouldn't call me her bestie!

549
00:45:17,452 --> 00:45:21,498
She's making me feel
like I'm obsessing over her.

550
00:45:25,168 --> 00:45:26,211
I'm going.

551
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,213
Good luck.

552
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:30,674
Thanks.

553
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:34,344
-You're the best, Na-bi.
-Thanks.

554
00:45:58,952 --> 00:46:02,080
I have to do my best on the presentation
and get an assistant.

555
00:46:02,163 --> 00:46:04,332
I'm sure you'll do well,

556
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:06,751
but if you can't find one, I'll help you.

557
00:46:06,835 --> 00:46:08,670
<i>I'm good at taking orders.</i>

558
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:12,841
Really? You promise, right?
You can't go back on your words.

559
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:16,344
But what do I do if no one volunteers?

560
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:20,223
I'm so worried.

561
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:22,809
Oh, my gosh.

562
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,398
Sorry, Do-hyeok. My friend is here.

563
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:29,816
I'll call you again later.

564
00:46:31,985 --> 00:46:33,445
What was that for?

565
00:46:33,528 --> 00:46:36,031
-I was jealous.
-What?

566
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,575
You look better with your hair up.

567
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:49,335
How long are you going to avoid me?

568
00:46:50,378 --> 00:46:51,337
When did I avoid you?

569
00:46:52,547 --> 00:46:55,300
You're the one who ignored me
when we ran into each other.

570
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,470
At the stairs?

571
00:46:59,387 --> 00:47:00,889
Did that bother you?

572
00:47:01,931 --> 00:47:03,349
I guess it worked.

573
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:07,771
What are you on about?

574
00:47:10,065 --> 00:47:11,524
Good luck on your presentation.

575
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:27,874
We will now begin the presentations
for the 12th Hongseo Gallery Exhibition.

576
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:29,334
A round of applause, please.

577
00:47:33,797 --> 00:47:36,174
There are nine presenters today.

578
00:47:36,257 --> 00:47:38,176
We will select the assistants

579
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:41,554
for each piece
after their presentations are over.

580
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:46,309
The assistants will help the presenters
with their pieces.

581
00:47:46,392 --> 00:47:49,604
They will be helping them through
the entire process, starting from

582
00:47:49,687 --> 00:47:52,232
making the piece
up to preparing for the exhibition.

583
00:47:52,315 --> 00:47:54,943
It differs by each piece,

584
00:47:55,026 --> 00:47:57,237
but we recommend having

585
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,698
around one to three assistants.

586
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:04,202
There is a limit to the number
of volunteers,

587
00:48:04,702 --> 00:48:08,248
so even if there are many for your piece,
it's best not to use them all.

588
00:48:09,165 --> 00:48:12,627
The theme of my piece
is "observation of objects."

589
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,547
What I want to express through my piece

590
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,924
is human desire.

591
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:24,639
Hello, I'm Yun Sol from
the Department of Sculpture.

592
00:48:24,722 --> 00:48:26,432
12TH HONGSEO GALLERY EXHIBITION
PRESENTATION BY YUN SOL

593
00:48:26,516 --> 00:48:29,853
The main theme of my piece is "union."

594
00:48:30,436 --> 00:48:33,565
The main material I used
is railway sleepers.

595
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:36,693
The rigidity and the traces of endurance

596
00:48:36,776 --> 00:48:39,362
on abandoned sleepers
seemed very attractive.

597
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:43,324
So I focused on emphasizing
the basic attributions of the material,

598
00:48:43,408 --> 00:48:45,410
such as the oil stains made over time.

599
00:48:45,994 --> 00:48:48,079
I wanted to make the materials

600
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:53,918
seem attractive.

601
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:56,337
Thank you.

602
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:00,550
You're the best, Yun Sol!

603
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:01,634
What?

604
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:05,180
Good job.

605
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:11,436
Next, Yu Na-bi from
the Department of Sculpture.

606
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:20,820
Hello, I'm Yu Na-bi
from the Department of Sculpture.

607
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:23,031
The theme of my piece is…

608
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,244
Well…

609
00:49:30,455 --> 00:49:33,458
The theme of my piece is <i>"yeoji."</i>

610
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:37,587
The Chinese characters
mean "left over" and "land."

611
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:41,090
Thus, an empty area of land.

612
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:44,844
It means a possibility or hope
of something happening.

613
00:49:46,596 --> 00:49:49,891
Cho Seong-sik from Sculpture
with the piece titled "coexistence."

614
00:49:50,808 --> 00:49:53,269
Raise your hand if you want to be
an assistant.

615
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:55,855
-I want to do it.
-Me too.

616
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:57,232
Me too.

617
00:49:57,315 --> 00:50:00,985
Cho Seong-sik?
Do you accept them as your assistants?

618
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:02,403
-Yes.
-Come on out.

619
00:50:11,663 --> 00:50:15,667
Yu Na-bi from Sculpture
with the piece titled <i>"yeoji."</i>

620
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,503
Who would like to assist Yu Na-bi?
Raise your hands.

621
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:23,883
What?

622
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,812
What? No way.

623
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:42,318
Na-bi. Do you accept
Jae-eon as your assistant?

624
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:49,993
Yes.

625
00:50:51,202 --> 00:50:53,288
-All right. If that's everyone--
-Me!

626
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:55,665
I'll volunteer as well.

627
00:50:56,374 --> 00:50:58,668
Do you accept Hwang Jin-su
as your assistant?

628
00:50:58,751 --> 00:50:59,752
Yes, I do.

629
00:51:04,132 --> 00:51:05,591
All right. Come up.

630
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:26,654
All right, then.
You should share your work schedules

631
00:51:26,738 --> 00:51:30,575
and related materials with your assistants

632
00:51:30,658 --> 00:51:32,035
before we finish up.

633
00:51:32,702 --> 00:51:35,830
The report format
is uploaded on our school website.

634
00:51:35,913 --> 00:51:37,999
-Make sure to check that.
-Okay.

635
00:51:38,082 --> 00:51:40,668
-Good job.
-Thank you!

636
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:44,672
You tied your hair.

637
00:51:45,548 --> 00:51:48,843
Yes. It was a bit hot.

638
00:51:50,303 --> 00:51:52,180
Are you really going to do this?

639
00:51:53,306 --> 00:51:54,682
What do you mean?

640
00:51:54,766 --> 00:51:56,392
You really don't need to.

641
00:51:56,476 --> 00:51:57,894
I thought it'd be fun.

642
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:00,480
I like your ideas.

643
00:52:00,563 --> 00:52:04,108
And it seems interesting to work
with metal.

644
00:52:06,652 --> 00:52:11,115
To be honest, I haven't worked with
metal before. So I'm not that skilled.

645
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:14,160
I'll help you.
That's what assistants are for.

646
00:52:17,455 --> 00:52:19,165
You don't want to work with me?

647
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:23,086
It's not like that, but…

648
00:52:23,169 --> 00:52:24,420
But?

649
00:52:24,504 --> 00:52:28,216
<i>I feel embarrassed
for not being able to believe</i>

650
00:52:28,299 --> 00:52:30,343
<i>-that he sincerely liked my piece.</i>
-Na-bi.

651
00:52:33,388 --> 00:52:35,223
I'm looking forward to working with you.

652
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:38,601
-Thanks.
-I'm in an awesome team.

653
00:52:41,062 --> 00:52:42,688
Me too.

654
00:52:47,068 --> 00:52:48,236
Me too.

655
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,996
Thanks for volunteering to assist me.

656
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,209
Here are the materials.

657
00:53:09,173 --> 00:53:11,509
Do you both have time this evening?

658
00:53:12,844 --> 00:53:14,512
Drinks to celebrate becoming a team?

659
00:53:15,555 --> 00:53:17,348
I know a metalworking studio.

660
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:19,559
Want to check it out?

661
00:53:21,185 --> 00:53:22,186
Yes!

662
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,484
All right then.

663
00:53:56,596 --> 00:53:59,307
JAE-EON

664
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:15,990
Come in.

665
00:54:23,414 --> 00:54:25,333
What? Why is there no one here?

666
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:27,502
The owner got off work.

667
00:54:28,252 --> 00:54:31,172
I'm using his studio when it's not open.

668
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:33,883
I live upstairs.

669
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:36,219
I see.

670
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,388
I didn't know you worked this hard.

671
00:54:40,932 --> 00:54:42,433
Aren't you overdoing it?

672
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:43,976
I have a long way to go.

673
00:54:45,561 --> 00:54:48,022
<i>I envy his passion.</i>

674
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,573
<i>I think I'll be about 30 minutes late.
Sorry.</i>

675
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:00,660
Jin-su's going to be a bit late.

676
00:55:01,661 --> 00:55:02,995
Sit down.

677
00:55:17,677 --> 00:55:19,804
-Do you want a drink?
-Sure.

678
00:55:35,444 --> 00:55:37,405
It's been a while since we talked.

679
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:39,532
It hasn't been that long.

680
00:55:47,206 --> 00:55:48,207
What?

681
00:55:51,669 --> 00:55:53,671
The day we went to the police station…

682
00:55:56,424 --> 00:55:57,675
I'm sorry.

683
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,678
I shouldn't have done that to you.

684
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:03,514
What's with the sudden apology?

685
00:56:03,598 --> 00:56:06,851
You were right about me drawing the line.

686
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:12,189
When people cross a certain line,

687
00:56:13,649 --> 00:56:15,860
they feel like it's meaningless.

688
00:56:17,528 --> 00:56:18,738
But…

689
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:21,490
I want to change now.

690
00:56:25,411 --> 00:56:27,830
<i>I should stop reading too much
into his words now.</i>

691
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:31,500
Change how?
Are you thinking of dating now?

692
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,254
I'm not sure.

693
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:40,760
I'm thinking of changing bit by bit.

694
00:56:41,552 --> 00:56:43,054
Then who knows?

695
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:45,306
I might meet my soulmate.

696
00:56:48,768 --> 00:56:50,645
I'll be rooting for you, then.

697
00:56:52,355 --> 00:56:54,357
I hope you can be sincere this time.

698
00:57:30,977 --> 00:57:33,813
You can adjust the fire with this.

699
00:57:42,154 --> 00:57:44,031
Be careful. It's hot.

700
00:57:45,658 --> 00:57:47,952
Start from the middle and go to the edge.

701
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,753
Start here and straighten it out
little by little.

702
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:04,260
It's not straightening out.

703
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:05,594
Hit it harder.

704
00:58:16,022 --> 00:58:17,440
-It's flat, right?
-Cool.

705
00:58:21,944 --> 00:58:24,238
-Yes, like that.
-It's getting flat.

706
00:58:24,321 --> 00:58:26,157
Good. You're getting better.

707
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:37,752
Jin-su said he'd be 30 minutes late,
but he never came.

708
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:42,882
How was it?
It wasn't that difficult, right?

709
00:58:44,133 --> 00:58:45,217
Right.

710
00:58:45,926 --> 00:58:47,970
I think I can do it if I work hard.

711
00:58:48,054 --> 00:58:50,973
Call me whenever you want to work.
You'll make a masterpiece.

712
00:58:51,057 --> 00:58:52,433
Stop teasing me.

713
00:58:52,516 --> 00:58:55,102
I'm not teasing you. I like your pieces.

714
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,314
Especially this one.
I'm looking forward to it.

715
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:03,360
I didn't know you liked it that much.

716
00:59:06,614 --> 00:59:07,865
I'll get going.

717
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:11,035
Na-bi.

718
00:59:16,707 --> 00:59:18,375
I changed my number.

719
00:59:28,511 --> 00:59:29,637
Bye.

720
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:43,609
MISSED CALLS
SEOL-A

721
01:00:07,383 --> 01:00:09,093
<i>-Hey, Seol-a.</i>
-Hey.

722
01:00:09,176 --> 01:00:10,427
Were you waiting for me?

723
01:00:12,555 --> 01:00:13,639
No.

724
01:00:14,515 --> 01:00:18,185
I just called to say
I can't make it today.

725
01:00:18,769 --> 01:00:21,272
-That's a relief.
-Were you busy?

726
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:23,274
Yes, a bit. I was working.

727
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:25,609
All right.

728
01:00:27,278 --> 01:00:28,654
Go back to work, then.

729
01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:45,004
I like your pieces.

730
01:00:45,087 --> 01:00:48,674
Especially this one.
I'm looking forward to it.

731
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:44,290
So is this crumbling down,

732
01:02:44,373 --> 01:02:46,083
or being made?

733
01:02:47,751 --> 01:02:49,211
That's up to interpretation.

734
01:02:55,926 --> 01:02:57,428
It's good.

735
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:03,058
Na-bi seems to have gained
her focus again.

736
01:03:03,642 --> 01:03:04,977
Thank you.

737
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:08,314
It's so cool. Just a few days ago,
there was nothing.

738
01:03:10,399 --> 01:03:14,820
Bit-na. When are you
going to show me your piece?

739
01:03:17,781 --> 01:03:20,784
Focus on your work, okay?

740
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:23,287
Bit-na, let me see you work properly!

741
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,039
Where is she going?

742
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:27,541
This is great.

743
01:03:48,771 --> 01:03:51,190
Doesn't Jae-eon seem a bit different?

744
01:03:52,191 --> 01:03:53,692
He seems a bit purer.

745
01:03:53,776 --> 01:03:56,320
Right. He seems different somehow.

746
01:03:56,403 --> 01:03:58,447
I heard he doesn't hang out with girls.

747
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,616
What happened to him?

748
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,869
Is he dating someone for real now?

749
01:04:03,952 --> 01:04:07,623
How would we ever understand the life
of a handsome guy?

750
01:04:07,706 --> 01:04:09,666
-Good work.
-Good work.

751
01:04:13,212 --> 01:04:14,546
-Give me one too.
-Here.

752
01:04:15,297 --> 01:04:16,882
-Here you go.
-Have one.

753
01:04:18,133 --> 01:04:20,135
-You try this.
-It's good.

754
01:04:32,314 --> 01:04:34,066
-You want to make wings?
-Yes.

755
01:04:34,691 --> 01:04:38,362
But I don't know what kind of shape
I should make it into.

756
01:04:42,783 --> 01:04:44,952
I should print this one.

757
01:05:12,688 --> 01:05:14,815
FOR REFERENCE

758
01:05:14,898 --> 01:05:17,234
I wish I could see this in person.

759
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:20,112
-You can.
-How?

760
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:22,322
This artist's having an exhibition.

761
01:05:22,406 --> 01:05:24,533
It opens next week. Do you want to go?

762
01:05:26,994 --> 01:05:28,245
Sure. Let's do that.

763
01:05:28,328 --> 01:05:29,788
Hey, Jin-su.

764
01:05:34,418 --> 01:05:35,961
He's sleeping again.

765
01:05:36,545 --> 01:05:39,381
<i>Our relationship took a new turn,</i>

766
01:05:39,465 --> 01:05:43,802
<i>and I found peace in my mind
within that friendly relationship.</i>

767
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:48,974
Yes, I'm here.

768
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:50,767
Just because.

769
01:05:55,606 --> 01:05:57,441
I thought I should cut my hair.

770
01:05:57,524 --> 01:06:01,945
I didn't go to a hair shop in America,
so it got kind of messy.

771
01:06:03,363 --> 01:06:05,949
Really? Should I cut it short, then?

772
01:06:08,452 --> 01:06:10,913
I guess I'll do that. All right.

773
01:06:10,996 --> 01:06:12,247
I'll see you tomorrow.

774
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:20,756
I'll get it for you…

775
01:06:29,598 --> 01:06:30,807
Thanks.

776
01:06:35,646 --> 01:06:38,065
Are you Yu Na-bi, by any chance?

777
01:06:38,649 --> 01:06:40,275
Do you know me?

778
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:43,487
Jae-eon said you were a friend
in the same department.

779
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:47,324
Right.

780
01:06:48,367 --> 01:06:49,993
Are you here to see Jae-eon?

781
01:06:50,827 --> 01:06:54,206
Yes. I just came
because I wanted to see him.

782
01:06:54,831 --> 01:06:57,876
He's probably busy.
We have a lot of assignments.

783
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,169
Really?

784
01:07:00,337 --> 01:07:02,965
He said he'd come out.
I feel kind of sorry now.

785
01:07:09,805 --> 01:07:11,056
Hey, Jae-eon.

786
01:07:12,349 --> 01:07:13,517
Oh, really?

787
01:07:14,977 --> 01:07:16,562
It's fine. Take your time.

788
01:07:18,272 --> 01:07:19,982
I don't smoke that much.

789
01:07:21,525 --> 01:07:23,110
All right.

790
01:07:27,823 --> 01:07:31,785
Excuse me,
but what's your relationship with Jae-eon?

791
01:07:32,578 --> 01:07:34,246
We used to date.

792
01:07:36,373 --> 01:07:37,499
I see.

793
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,005
And…

794
01:07:45,215 --> 01:07:47,092
we're seeing each other again.

795
01:07:54,516 --> 01:07:58,687
But are you really just friends with him?

796
01:08:06,612 --> 01:08:08,905
Yes. We're just friends.

797
01:08:10,365 --> 01:08:11,825
That's a relief.

798
01:08:11,908 --> 01:08:14,244
I thought maybe I said something
I shouldn't have.

799
01:08:25,756 --> 01:08:26,757
You should

800
01:08:28,216 --> 01:08:29,843
just keep your hair that way.

801
01:08:30,886 --> 01:08:31,720
What?

802
01:08:33,096 --> 01:08:37,059
Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.

803
01:09:34,116 --> 01:09:38,578
<i>A distance that's close enough
yet not too close to hurt each other.</i>

804
01:09:38,662 --> 01:09:41,456
<i>Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.</i>

805
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,583
-Na-bi is coming?
-You didn't know?

806
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:45,460
<i>She disappeared.</i>

807
01:09:45,544 --> 01:09:47,546
<i>That's what you hate the most.</i>

808
01:09:47,629 --> 01:09:49,339
<i>Getting clingy.</i>

809
01:09:49,423 --> 01:09:51,049
<i>Certainty about the relationship.</i>

810
01:09:51,133 --> 01:09:53,510
How does one get that certainty?

811
01:09:53,593 --> 01:09:55,679
<i>I didn't know you'd be coming along.</i>

812
01:09:55,762 --> 01:09:58,181
I've always wanted to come here.

813
01:09:58,265 --> 01:09:59,099
Cheers.

814
01:09:59,182 --> 01:10:01,852
<i>Then is it over with him now?</i>

815
01:10:01,935 --> 01:10:03,687
<i>It must be someone you like.</i>

816
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,355
<i>No, just someone bothersome.</i>

817
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:08,692
<i>I know very well that a person
who doesn't know how to love someone</i>

818
01:10:08,775 --> 01:10:09,818
<i>can never be happy.</i>

819
01:10:10,485 --> 01:10:11,319
<i>You're coming here?</i>

820
01:10:11,403 --> 01:10:14,406
<i>Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.</i>

821
01:10:14,489 --> 01:10:18,618
