1
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:38,787
There it is.

2
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:42,916
By the way,

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,086
don't you think there's something
going on between Na-bi and Jae-eon?

4
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:49,673
Hey. Honestly, how could Na-bi date
a guy like Jae-eon?

5
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:51,591
Why? Na-bi's pretty.

6
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:54,344
That's not what I mean.
Jae-eon is the problem.

7
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:56,513
He's not sincere toward anyone.

8
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:59,516
That's why I ended things
after a few dates.

9
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:03,520
Really? You're the one who rejected him?

10
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:08,191
Yes. I got away from him,
but Na-bi didn't.

11
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:09,693
There are rumors about her.

12
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:11,862
What a way to end her school life.

13
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:13,363
I know, right?

14
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:15,824
-Did you get everything?
-Yes. Let's go.

15
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:30,839
<i>Are you working?
I'm arriving at school soon.</i>

16
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:37,262
Is there someone else you're seeing?

17
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:39,890
No.

18
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,225
Really?

19
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,326
Excuse me.

20
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:02,329
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

21
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:04,206
Yes.

22
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,959
So it's you.

23
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,672
You bastard!

24
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:15,175
Sir! What are you doing?

25
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:17,219
-Move!
-Why are you doing this?

26
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:22,849
To be honest,
I don't get why you're so upset.

27
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,684
You didn't need to ghost me like that.

28
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:32,734
I…

29
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,403
Get out of the way!

30
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,987
What was that?

31
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:39,866
Na-bi!

32
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:44,538
Get up, you jerk!

33
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,625
Stop, Jae-eon!

34
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,257
-You asshole. Move!
-Sir, wait!

35
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,050
-Move!
-Sir!

36
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:59,010
-Why did you do it?
-What are you doing?

37
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:00,637
Why did you do it?

38
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:02,889
Why? Why did you do it?

39
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:05,267
-Why did you do it?
-Police?

40
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,353
I'm at Hongseo University and a man is…

41
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:10,063
-Sol, stop him.
-Why did you do it?

42
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:11,732
-Come quickly!
-Are you okay?

43
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:13,692
Why?

44
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,112
Stop it, Jae-eon.

45
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:24,578
EPISODE 5: I KNOW NOTHING WILL CHANGE.
NEVERTHELESS,

46
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,791
We'll be off now.

47
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,169
What? I'm curious…

48
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,673
I mean, I'm worried about them.

49
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:39,217
Call me if anything happens.

50
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:41,720
Okay. You should go.

51
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:43,054
Bye.

52
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:46,183
-Be careful. Bye.
-Make sure to call if anything happens.

53
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,023
HONGSEO POLICE STATION

54
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:22,052
How dare you touch someone
who's already taken?

55
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,930
If you ever come near my sister again,

56
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:27,891
I'm going to kill you. You scumbag.

57
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,353
Miss.

58
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:33,563
Let me give you some advice.

59
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:36,900
You should meet a decent guy.

60
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:41,154
You'll ruin your life
if you date an asshole like him.

61
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:57,295
You had something to say.

62
00:04:58,046 --> 00:05:00,465
-What is it?
-Let's talk later.

63
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:01,967
I'm going home.

64
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,553
Didn't you get hurt?
Let's go to the hospital.

65
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:06,555
I'm fine. Just worry about yourself.

66
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,065
I wonder what they're talking about now.
I bet they're totally fighting.

67
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:20,860
I think I just made things worse
by reporting it.

68
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:23,321
No, you did the right thing.
And it's fine now.

69
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:26,032
Na-bi could have gotten hurt.

70
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:27,701
Right?

71
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:32,747
But Na-bi was trying to stop that man
from hitting Jae-eon.

72
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:34,541
It was so cool.

73
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:36,418
-She would have been so scared.
-Right.

74
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:39,796
Na-bi should have been angry at him,

75
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,257
but she took his side.

76
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,427
I guess it's because she likes him a lot.

77
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:54,436
I should go.

78
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:56,938
See you tomorrow.

79
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,275
I'll take you home.

80
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:04,654
You're acting a bit strange today.
Do you have something to say?

81
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:08,867
We didn't get to finish
what we were talking about.

82
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:12,245
It's fine.

83
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,289
This is how we always make up.

84
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,041
As if nothing happened.

85
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,253
I feel like
we shouldn't do that this time.

86
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:23,465
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about leaving

87
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:26,593
as an exchange student.

88
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:30,889
I was more upset by how you said
that was the extent of our relationship.

89
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,307
Hey! You're the one who--

90
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:38,355
All right. I'm sorry about that too.

91
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:43,068
I'm sorry about
how I acted at the flea market too.

92
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:45,320
But why aren't you sorry for
not telling me about him?

93
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:47,280
Hey, that's unfair.

94
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:49,324
Ju-hyeok and I aren't dating.

95
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:51,284
Then what's your relationship with him?

96
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:19,062
Put this on your lip.

97
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:26,486
Thanks.

98
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,447
I didn't want you to see me like this.

99
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:32,283
You nursed me when I was sick.

100
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:35,203
So let's call it even now. I'm going home.

101
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:38,248
You're not going to see me anymore?

102
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,587
I want to stay friends with you.

103
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:45,922
"Friends"?

104
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:49,342
What do friends even mean to you?

105
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:52,470
-What do you mean?
-Why did you lie to me?

106
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,472
You said you weren't seeing anyone else.

107
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:57,225
-Is that so important?
-Hey.

108
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,395
What do you want from me?

109
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:02,439
Right.

110
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:06,818
You just want someone who's stupid
so you can--

111
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,903
-What's with you?
-What?

112
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:11,740
You always draw the line like this.

113
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:15,368
You just want to see me when you want,

114
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,162
but you're scared I'll get clingy?

115
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:18,830
Don't worry.

116
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:21,082
That's not going to happen.

117
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,835
It's not like that!

118
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,886
Then what are we?

119
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:38,308
Weren't you okay
with everything until now?

120
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,518
-Why are you suddenly--
-Right.

121
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:43,646
Sorry for acting so cool about it
until now.

122
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:48,026
Honestly, I haven't heard anything good
since I started seeing you.

123
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:50,945
I pretended not to notice even
when I knew you weren't sincere,

124
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,197
because…

125
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:55,700
Because…

126
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:58,203
<i>I like you.</i>

127
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:10,048
But I can't stand this anymore.
Let's end this.

128
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:12,383
What?

129
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,426
It's funny, right?

130
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,262
There's nothing to end anyway.

131
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:20,350
Yu Na-bi.

132
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:24,062
Thanks for giving me a reason
to decide to end things.

133
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:30,777
All right. Let's end this.

134
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:34,155
You're the one who gets to decide.

135
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,330
Gosh. You're really…

136
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:48,461
You're really a jerk until the end.

137
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,698
Jae-eon and Na-bi were having an affair,

138
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:01,451
and that woman caught them!

139
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:05,371
-No way! They got caught in the act?
-Yes.

140
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:09,459
So Jae-eon actually got hit by that woman?
That's what happened to his face?

141
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:11,544
-Yes.
-I heard it was a guy, though.

142
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:15,590
-Is Jae-eon…
-No way.

143
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:17,091
Are you sure about that?

144
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:20,762
I heard it was Na-bi who hit Jae-eon.

145
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,597
Someone saw them fighting at night.

146
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,474
Why would Na-bi hit him?

147
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:27,352
-Because she found out he was cheating!
-That's ridiculous.

148
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:31,439
Se-yeong. If Na-bi really hit Jae-eon
that hard, she should join the UFC.

149
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:34,817
Na-bi should have been happy
after leaving me.

150
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,695
-Jeez.
-You're so ridiculous.

151
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:40,239
What's that reaction?

152
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:41,658
It's just a hair dye.

153
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:43,743
-You're unbelievable.
-It's so pretty.

154
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:45,078
What should we do with you?

155
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:48,331
She's a total attention-seeker.

156
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:49,248
Why? Looks good.

157
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:52,460
Is it that bad? Everyone at the hair shop
said I looked good.

158
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,629
It's pretty, but it's a shocking look.

159
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:57,090
The color's really pretty.
Did you bleach it first?

160
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:59,092
Yes. I almost lost all my hair.

161
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:03,763
By the way, Bit-na.

162
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:07,517
Did you hear anything
about Na-bi and Jae-eon?

163
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,102
Hey, be quiet. Na-bi's coming.

164
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:13,731
-Sol's coming too.
-Hey!

165
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:15,942
You both aren't coming to the workshop?

166
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:18,820
Bit-na, you changed your hair.
It looks nice.

167
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,863
Thanks, but don't change the subject.

168
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,949
How can both of you not come?

169
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:25,243
I feel so betrayed right now!

170
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:27,370
You should come.

171
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,205
The professors aren't coming.

172
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:31,874
We can just hang out by ourselves.

173
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,294
-I'm not sure.
-You should both come.

174
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,505
Can't you ask Jae-eon to come, too?

175
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:39,549
Everyone will come if he comes.

176
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:41,759
Ask him yourself.
Don't ask her to do that.

177
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:43,970
But they're close…

178
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:47,181
But what happened to Jae-eon's face?

179
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:49,684
What do you mean?

180
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:53,479
You know, right?
Who did he have a fight with?

181
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:59,694
Can you please stop asking me
about Jae-eon now?

182
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,989
I don't know much about him, either.

183
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:06,868
-Hey.
-Jeez, what are you doing?

184
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,536
Come on. Start working.

185
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:22,467
Hi.

186
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:28,347
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:32,977
He must have seen something
and misunderstood.

188
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,354
He suddenly went all crazy.

189
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:39,609
You must be really upset.

190
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:42,945
Tell your girlfriend I'm sorry too.

191
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:46,324
-My girlfriend?
-I heard you were with someone.

192
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:48,534
Wasn't she your girlfriend?

193
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:51,412
If anything happens, call me.

194
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:55,291
Even if it's nothing special.

195
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,044
That won't happen.
It'll be the best for both of us.

196
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:00,046
Right.

197
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,398
Gyu-hyun?

198
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:25,738
Thank you.

199
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:34,872
How is it?

200
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:37,959
He's actually eating mint chocolate?

201
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:40,545
PINT SIZE
CHOOSE 3 FLAVORS

202
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:42,213
Chocolate and cashew nuts.

203
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:45,550
-Hi!
-Hi.

204
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:48,094
Hey, we're ordering ice cream.
Choose a flavor.

205
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:51,139
-I want…
-Sorry, you can't choose anymore.

206
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,724
I'm going to order mint chocolate
for the third one.

207
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:58,646
What? You both don't like mint chocolate?

208
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:00,898
-I hate it.
-Why would you eat toothpaste?

209
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:02,024
I know, right?

210
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:05,903
It's good.

211
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:56,871
This isn't that simple, you know.

212
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:58,873
Art isn't easy.

213
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:01,792
Making something doesn't mean
it will become an art piece.

214
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:03,377
Haven't I told you several times?

215
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,796
<i>I've never seen his face like that.</i>

216
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,298
<i>Did he feel hurt by my words?</i>

217
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:11,385
-And most of all, your inspiration…
-<i>No, there's no way.</i>

218
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:14,764
Na-bi. Are you listening to me?

219
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,806
What?

220
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:20,520
This is bad.

221
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:24,232
Will you even
be able to finish this on time?

222
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:26,275
Sorry, Professor.

223
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,829
That traitor.

224
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:51,801
I was wondering why you were
in the studio for a change.

225
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:53,469
Did you get rejected, too?

226
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:55,179
Of course not, Professor.

227
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,848
I'm the one who rejects guys.
I'd never get rejected.

228
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:00,851
And I work at the studio often too.

229
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:02,770
-Is that so?
-Yes.

230
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:05,022
Then when can I see your work?

231
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:07,984
I promise to show mine to you
next time, Professor.

232
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,329
Sol.

233
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:22,873
Yun Sol.

234
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,876
You're losing focus these days too.

235
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,630
Did you decide to give up everything
since you're not leaving?

236
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:34,802
No. I'm sorry, Professor.

237
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:42,393
Sol didn't tell me again.

238
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,942
Everything's a mess.

239
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:52,320
What has gotten into you all?

240
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:55,573
You should be putting everything
into your work right now.

241
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:59,118
I told you to get inspiration,

242
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,037
not be reckless!

243
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,959
"She's at it again."
That's what you're thinking, right?

244
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:09,587
I'm just barking like a dog, aren't I?

245
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:13,090
My goodness. Maybe I was
a dog in my previous life.

246
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:14,258
No, Professor.

247
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:15,926
-No, Professor.
-Sorry, Professor.

248
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:26,354
-Yun Sol. Here.
-What? Thanks.

249
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:29,231
Don't take it too personally.
I loved your piece.

250
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:31,150
Right. Thanks.

251
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:35,780
By the way, did you really decide
not to leave as an exchange student?

252
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:45,164
Yes.

253
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,752
Why? Did something happen?

254
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,380
Just because.

255
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:55,049
I didn't want to leave.

256
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:00,179
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK TRIPE

257
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,155
You said your tongue gets numb.

258
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:45,099
But I can't stand this anymore.
Let's end this.

259
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,771
All right. Let's end this.

260
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,858
You're the one who gets to decide.

261
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:15,689
Move!

262
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,026
Na-bi!

263
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:13,414
PARK JAE-EON

264
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:20,129
<i>The number you have dialed is not
in the directory.</i>

265
00:22:20,212 --> 00:22:22,756
<i>Please check the number and call again.</i>

266
00:24:04,358 --> 00:24:07,319
ALARM

267
00:25:08,213 --> 00:25:09,631
<i>I miss him.</i>

268
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:23,228
Na-bi's lost it after ending things
with Jae-eon.

269
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:25,939
She totally got busted by the professor.

270
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:27,858
She does seem strange these days.

271
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:30,736
She's working late,
but there's no progress.

272
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:33,697
I know, right? Why did she have
to get in a relationship?

273
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:37,576
Things would have been better
if it was an actual relationship.

274
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:39,077
That's the same thing.

275
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:41,163
Why would you do that to yourself?

276
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:44,166
One is bound to end up like that
when it's over.

277
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:47,920
You should be careful too.

278
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:50,339
Gosh.

279
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:52,758
We're totally fine.

280
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:02,309
There's another victim of love over there.

281
00:26:06,688 --> 00:26:08,023
Nam Gyu-hyun?

282
00:26:09,358 --> 00:26:10,776
Did something happen?

283
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:13,654
I set him up on a blind date, remember?

284
00:26:13,737 --> 00:26:16,740
I thought it was going well,
but my friend rejected him!

285
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:21,912
Look at him. I feel so sorry.

286
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:25,457
So you're saying he's like that
because he got rejected by her?

287
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,834
Yes.

288
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:27,918
Hey!

289
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:32,172
Is your friend that attractive?
To be honest, she didn't look that pretty…

290
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:34,633
What? Have you seen her?

291
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:41,181
No. I'm just saying…

292
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,934
Gyu-hyun's pretty good-looking, you know.

293
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:45,811
That's right.

294
00:26:45,894 --> 00:26:48,355
But I shouldn't set up
any more blind dates.

295
00:26:53,527 --> 00:26:55,279
Darn it.

296
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:13,005
Why don't you leave your hair down?

297
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:17,134
Just for me.

298
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:06,892
I was thinking of returning
the necklace to you.

299
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:08,977
Just throw it away, then.

300
00:28:10,812 --> 00:28:12,689
You say that so easily.

301
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:19,947
SEOL-A

302
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,043
Hey, Seol-a.

303
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:36,004
What?

304
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:40,259
I'll be there right away.

305
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:57,901
The fee should be about 50,000 won each,

306
00:28:57,985 --> 00:28:59,987
so let's go with the place we changed to.

307
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:03,615
Are you writing this down?

308
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:07,160
Yes. He's done.

309
00:29:08,203 --> 00:29:09,538
Okay, that's it for today.

310
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:12,332
What should we get?

311
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:14,126
-Vodka?
-Yes!

312
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:15,919
Should we go for drinks?

313
00:29:16,003 --> 00:29:17,713
-Let's go!
-Yes!

314
00:29:17,796 --> 00:29:19,256
Should we call the others?

315
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:22,175
Who? Remember last time
when you called so many people?

316
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:24,136
Gyu-hyun, aren't you coming?

317
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:25,387
No.

318
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,889
Oh, no. He must have really liked her.

319
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,183
Maybe I should talk to my friend.

320
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:36,148
VISITORS RESTRICTED
IN EMERGENCY ROOM

321
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:39,234
How do you feel? Are you okay?

322
00:29:41,194 --> 00:29:43,071
Yes. Thanks.

323
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:45,574
How much was it?

324
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:46,700
It's fine.

325
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:49,119
You have severe anemia.

326
00:29:49,911 --> 00:29:51,580
Make sure to take your meds.

327
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,959
-It's so bothersome.
-You could faint on the streets.

328
00:29:58,003 --> 00:30:01,381
You put your hair down. It suits you.

329
00:30:02,132 --> 00:30:03,216
Really?

330
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:05,677
I should keep it down, then.

331
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:09,681
Is something going on?

332
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,229
You changed your number
and your hairstyle.

333
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,231
What's going on?

334
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:23,570
Just because.

335
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:25,989
I got sick of things.

336
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,908
What do you mean?

337
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:30,827
I'm sick of myself.

338
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:40,337
It will be a narrow but firm base.

339
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:43,173
Right.

340
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:47,552
Hey.

341
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:58,522
Is it really okay for you to be here?

342
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:00,357
Sure, just for a little while.

343
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:04,986
Is that what you're presenting tomorrow?

344
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:07,823
Well, yes.

345
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:10,409
Can I see? I'm curious.

346
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:13,370
Sure.

347
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,915
It's nothing special.

348
00:31:16,998 --> 00:31:21,420
I'm just going to explain
what kind of piece I'm making.

349
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:27,884
But honestly, I don't know
if I can really make it like that.

350
00:31:28,802 --> 00:31:31,888
-Gosh. This is so cool.
-This is so good.

351
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:40,397
How do you come up with this?

352
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:42,482
You're awesome.

353
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:46,111
It's really nothing special.

354
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:48,488
There are so many people better than me.

355
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:51,783
Is there a good or bad for art, too?

356
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,201
Of course.

357
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:56,705
It's similar to cooking skills.

358
00:31:56,788 --> 00:31:58,874
You can have different tastes,

359
00:31:58,957 --> 00:32:02,752
but there's a clear line between
good food and bad food.

360
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:08,300
I don't know much about art,

361
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:11,470
but I like yours.
I have a good feeling about it.

362
00:32:16,725 --> 00:32:17,767
Really?

363
00:32:27,652 --> 00:32:28,987
This is so good.

364
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,615
Can you explain how it tastes
in more detail?

365
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,122
The noodles taste similar
to what your grandpa made,

366
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:43,627
but the soup
is a bit more savory and light.

367
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:48,423
Anyway, I like this one more.

368
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:51,927
That's a relief.

369
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,763
I want to brag about this to my grandpa.

370
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:56,681
You shouldn't brag yet, though.

371
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:00,185
Oh, right.

372
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:02,771
Here.

373
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:05,273
I just picked it up, thinking of you.

374
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:08,276
Good luck with your presentation.

375
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,488
What's this?

376
00:33:13,448 --> 00:33:14,991
Is it lipstick?

377
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:18,662
A gift for me?

378
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:21,289
Yes.

379
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:35,887
How does it look?

380
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:38,598
It looks good on you.

381
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:42,727
Thanks.

382
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:46,565
I'll do my best on my presentation.

383
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,149
Do-hyeok.

384
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:51,111
Right. Enjoy your food.

385
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:59,119
We're here again.

386
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:00,829
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

387
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:02,414
Yes?

388
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,084
You're all smiles.
Do you like her that much?

389
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,919
What?

390
00:34:11,464 --> 00:34:13,049
Is it that obvious?

391
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,384
Yes. Totally.

392
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:16,803
She's going to find out soon.

393
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,055
Here.

394
00:34:22,183 --> 00:34:23,310
On the house.

395
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,146
-You shouldn't have.
-Go on, give it to her.

396
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:29,399
But this heart's a bit…

397
00:34:29,482 --> 00:34:31,818
Should I make a circle, then? Just go.

398
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:35,989
-Gosh…
-Come on. Don't be so shy.

399
00:34:45,624 --> 00:34:48,752
It's no problem.

400
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,151
YU SE-HUN

401
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:19,824
<i>Hey, Gyu-hyun.
You know where Bit-na lives, right?</i>

402
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:21,868
<i>Text me her address.</i>

403
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:23,370
Why?

404
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:25,455
She's totally wasted.

405
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:27,624
I'm going to send her home in a taxi.

406
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:29,417
-<i>On the count of three.</i>
-What?

407
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:32,504
You can come pick her up
if you have a problem with that.

408
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:33,588
<i>So what will it be?</i>

409
00:35:33,672 --> 00:35:35,548
-<i>Hey!</i>
-Where are you? I'll be there.

410
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:38,426
<i>What? Really? Didn't you say
you weren't feeling well?</i>

411
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,345
I'm fine. Send me your location.

412
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:04,994
What's happening?

413
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:11,501
Who are you?

414
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:18,800
Who is that?

415
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:26,391
Darn it.

416
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:33,106
Oh, my gosh.

417
00:36:33,189 --> 00:36:36,651
Gosh, you startled me!

418
00:36:40,113 --> 00:36:41,531
Let's go for another round.

419
00:36:41,614 --> 00:36:42,741
-Yes!
-Yes!

420
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:44,033
After we send her home.

421
00:36:44,117 --> 00:36:46,911
No, we have to take her with us.
Bit-na, let's go.

422
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:49,038
-Send her home.
-Bit-na, what's with you?

423
00:36:49,122 --> 00:36:50,915
-Get up.
-Where should we go?

424
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:53,460
What? He took a taxi?

425
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:55,795
-Did you come like that?
-This far?

426
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:58,631
-Hey.
-It must have been expensive.

427
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:05,972
Go on. I'll take Bit-na home.

428
00:37:06,055 --> 00:37:09,350
No! I can't let Bit-na go alone.
I'll come with you.

429
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:11,436
Where are you going?
You're coming with me.

430
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:14,355
-Hey!
-Right. I should go with you.

431
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,316
-What are you looking at?
-Just go.

432
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:19,402
Hey, thanks for this.

433
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:21,404
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

434
00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:23,740
Take her back safely,

435
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:25,575
and send us a picture when you arrive.

436
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:27,368
Go on.

437
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:28,912
Stop that.

438
00:37:37,295 --> 00:37:38,296
Hey, Bit-na.

439
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,924
Get up.

440
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:49,641
Who are you?

441
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:51,100
It's me.

442
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:55,688
Get on my back.

443
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:05,031
What? Are you crying?

444
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:08,910
How can you do this to me, you jerk?

445
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:13,373
Get lost! I don't want to touch
a traitor like you!

446
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:15,708
What is it this time?

447
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:19,921
What's the point of talking
to a drunk girl?

448
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:21,881
Come on, get on my back.

449
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,177
-You jerk.
-Hey! Have you lost it?

450
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:28,471
You said you hated mint chocolate!

451
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:30,390
You hate mint chocolate.

452
00:38:30,473 --> 00:38:33,393
-Did you like her that much?
-What?

453
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:35,478
You jerk.

454
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:38,147
You said you wanted to date me
only a while ago.

455
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:42,235
Too bad you got rejected when
you even ate mint chocolate for her.

456
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:43,945
It must be so agonizing.

457
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:46,030
Who says I got rejected?

458
00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:49,450
Get lost. I'm not going to talk
to a guy who eats mint chocolate.

459
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:52,245
What about you? You were
being so friendly with Mr. An.

460
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:53,454
What? No way.

461
00:38:53,538 --> 00:38:55,874
Then why did you ignore me
at the bar last time?

462
00:38:55,957 --> 00:38:59,711
This is ridiculous. You were with
another guy back then too.

463
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:02,839
Whatever.

464
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,759
Stop crying.

465
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:13,558
I didn't eat it because she asked to.

466
00:39:15,184 --> 00:39:19,147
I tried it because I heard
it's good for stress and insomnia.

467
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:21,608
But it wasn't effective at all.

468
00:39:22,942 --> 00:39:25,778
I can't even sleep these days
because of you.

469
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:28,364
That's nonsense!
Why would that be my fault?

470
00:39:31,075 --> 00:39:32,201
Well…

471
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:36,664
I think of you every night.

472
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:41,294
What?

473
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:45,423
Why are you hitting on me now?

474
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:52,180
Come here.

475
00:40:03,316 --> 00:40:04,817
Stop crying.

476
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:09,280
Let's go. It's late.

477
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:12,575
Let's go.

478
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:14,994
Come on.

479
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,172
There you go.

480
00:40:27,882 --> 00:40:29,008
Get on my back.

481
00:40:36,975 --> 00:40:41,562
Hey. Stop seeing other girls
and just go out with me.

482
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:43,856
That's a lame line.

483
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,151
Give me a break.
I've never asked someone out before.

484
00:40:48,486 --> 00:40:50,863
You better not go back
on your word tomorrow.

485
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:52,156
I can't be sure.

486
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:57,203
And why did you dye your hair like that?

487
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:59,288
You're already so pretty.

488
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:03,251
And stop drinking so much.

489
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:07,171
You know how dangerous it is
to get wasted like that at night?

490
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:09,340
-Jeez! Hey!
-What?

491
00:41:09,424 --> 00:41:13,094
Everything you say is so boring.

492
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:15,096
But why are you such a good kisser?

493
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:16,764
Right, I'm a good kisser.

494
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:19,684
Let's go.

495
00:41:21,894 --> 00:41:22,937
Let's go!

496
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:28,628
I think it's too much to the left.

497
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:30,213
Move it more to the right.

498
00:42:30,296 --> 00:42:31,631
-All right!
-Okay.

499
00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:32,840
Just a little more.

500
00:42:34,675 --> 00:42:36,928
What? What is it?

501
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:38,638
It's unbelievable.

502
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:40,473
How could you have been living there?

503
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:41,974
Hey!

504
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:43,976
Is there something wrong?

505
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,896
No, it's okay. It's perfect now.

506
00:42:49,023 --> 00:42:52,151
I'm only sleeping there until tonight.
So keep it a secret.

507
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:53,402
What about after that?

508
00:42:56,405 --> 00:42:58,533
Just mind your own business.

509
00:42:58,616 --> 00:42:59,617
You know--

510
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,870
No! I don't want to ask
my parents for help.

511
00:43:02,954 --> 00:43:04,205
You can stay at my house.

512
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:10,211
My roommate went to the military
a while ago.

513
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:15,174
What are you on about?
Are you asking me to live with you?

514
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:18,678
You and me? That's total nonsense.

515
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:20,263
Why? What about it?

516
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,849
Lots of people do that in other countries.

517
00:43:25,351 --> 00:43:27,436
Well, that's true, but…

518
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:30,273
Just think about it.

519
00:43:30,356 --> 00:43:32,859
Just pay the rent
you paid for your old house.

520
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:38,739
Hey, raise the right side. The right side.

521
00:43:38,823 --> 00:43:40,158
My gosh.

522
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:42,743
He's just too nice.

523
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:48,416
Are you nervous?

524
00:43:49,584 --> 00:43:50,877
Yes, more than I thought.

525
00:43:53,921 --> 00:43:55,089
Look at me.

526
00:43:56,549 --> 00:43:58,176
Do I look better with my hair up?

527
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:05,600
-There isn't much difference.
-Right?

528
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:07,185
They're both pretty.

529
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,062
Right. Did you get an assistant?

530
00:44:10,146 --> 00:44:14,317
The others seemed to be talking
about who they'll have as an assistant.

531
00:44:15,776 --> 00:44:16,652
Not yet.

532
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:19,363
I should've done that too.

533
00:44:19,447 --> 00:44:21,282
What if nobody volunteers?

534
00:44:21,365 --> 00:44:22,950
I'm sure there will be volunteers.

535
00:44:26,037 --> 00:44:28,998
Oh, right. Sol was looking for you.

536
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:30,499
Did you talk to her?

537
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:33,628
No. I don't want to talk to her.

538
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:36,422
What is it? Did something happen?

539
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:39,425
You knew, right?

540
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:42,887
You knew she decided not to leave
as an exchange student, right?

541
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,263
I didn't.

542
00:44:45,056 --> 00:44:47,183
I didn't know. Did she say she's staying?

543
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:48,267
You're so obvious.

544
00:44:50,728 --> 00:44:54,607
I'm trying to hold back until her
presentation's over, so I'm ignoring her.

545
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,692
But this is driving me crazy.

546
00:44:58,235 --> 00:45:01,072
Good thinking. Just yell at her
once her presentation's over.

547
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:03,324
She's so annoying!

548
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:06,369
If she's treating me like this,
she shouldn't call me her bestie!

549
00:45:06,452 --> 00:45:10,498
She's making me feel
like I'm obsessing over her.

550
00:45:14,168 --> 00:45:15,211
I'm going.

551
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,213
Good luck.

552
00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:19,674
Thanks.

553
00:45:20,675 --> 00:45:23,344
-You're the best, Na-bi.
-Thanks.

554
00:45:47,952 --> 00:45:51,080
I have to do my best on the presentation
and get an assistant.

555
00:45:51,163 --> 00:45:53,332
I'm sure you'll do well,

556
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,751
but if you can't find one, I'll help you.

557
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:57,670
<i>I'm good at taking orders.</i>

558
00:45:58,796 --> 00:46:01,841
Really? You promise, right?
You can't go back on your words.

559
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:05,344
But what do I do if no one volunteers?

560
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:09,223
I'm so worried.

561
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:11,809
Oh, my gosh.

562
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,398
Sorry, Do-hyeok. My friend is here.

563
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:18,816
I'll call you again later.

564
00:46:20,985 --> 00:46:22,445
What was that for?

565
00:46:22,528 --> 00:46:25,031
-I was jealous.
-What?

566
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,575
You look better with your hair up.

567
00:46:36,876 --> 00:46:38,335
How long are you going to avoid me?

568
00:46:39,378 --> 00:46:40,337
When did I avoid you?

569
00:46:41,547 --> 00:46:44,300
You're the one who ignored me
when we ran into each other.

570
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,470
At the stairs?

571
00:46:48,387 --> 00:46:49,889
Did that bother you?

572
00:46:50,931 --> 00:46:52,349
I guess it worked.

573
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:56,771
What are you on about?

574
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:00,524
Good luck on your presentation.

575
00:47:12,411 --> 00:47:16,874
We will now begin the presentations
for the 12th Hongseo Gallery Exhibition.

576
00:47:16,957 --> 00:47:18,334
A round of applause, please.

577
00:47:22,797 --> 00:47:25,174
There are nine presenters today.

578
00:47:25,257 --> 00:47:27,176
We will select the assistants

579
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:30,554
for each piece
after their presentations are over.

580
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:35,309
The assistants will help the presenters
with their pieces.

581
00:47:35,392 --> 00:47:38,604
They will be helping them through
the entire process, starting from

582
00:47:38,687 --> 00:47:41,232
making the piece
up to preparing for the exhibition.

583
00:47:41,315 --> 00:47:43,943
It differs by each piece,

584
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:46,237
but we recommend having

585
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,698
around one to three assistants.

586
00:47:50,658 --> 00:47:53,202
There is a limit to the number
of volunteers,

587
00:47:53,702 --> 00:47:57,248
so even if there are many for your piece,
it's best not to use them all.

588
00:47:58,165 --> 00:48:01,627
The theme of my piece
is "observation of objects."

589
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,547
What I want to express through my piece

590
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,924
is human desire.

591
00:48:11,011 --> 00:48:13,639
Hello, I'm Yun Sol from
the Department of Sculpture.

592
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:15,432
12TH HONGSEO GALLERY EXHIBITION
PRESENTATION BY YUN SOL

593
00:48:15,516 --> 00:48:18,853
The main theme of my piece is "union."

594
00:48:19,436 --> 00:48:22,565
The main material I used
is railway sleepers.

595
00:48:22,648 --> 00:48:25,693
The rigidity and the traces of endurance

596
00:48:25,776 --> 00:48:28,362
on abandoned sleepers
seemed very attractive.

597
00:48:28,863 --> 00:48:32,324
So I focused on emphasizing
the basic attributions of the material,

598
00:48:32,408 --> 00:48:34,410
such as the oil stains made over time.

599
00:48:34,994 --> 00:48:37,079
I wanted to make the materials

600
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:42,918
seem attractive.

601
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:45,337
Thank you.

602
00:48:48,048 --> 00:48:49,550
You're the best, Yun Sol!

603
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:50,634
What?

604
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:54,180
Good job.

605
00:48:57,016 --> 00:49:00,436
Next, Yu Na-bi from
the Department of Sculpture.

606
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,820
Hello, I'm Yu Na-bi
from the Department of Sculpture.

607
00:49:09,904 --> 00:49:12,031
The theme of my piece is…

608
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,244
Well…

609
00:49:19,455 --> 00:49:22,458
The theme of my piece is <i>"yeoji."</i>

610
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:26,587
The Chinese characters
mean "left over" and "land."

611
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,090
Thus, an empty area of land.

612
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:33,844
It means a possibility or hope
of something happening.

613
00:49:35,596 --> 00:49:38,891
Cho Seong-sik from Sculpture
with the piece titled "coexistence."

614
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:42,269
Raise your hand if you want to be
an assistant.

615
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:44,855
-I want to do it.
-Me too.

616
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:46,232
Me too.

617
00:49:46,315 --> 00:49:49,985
Cho Seong-sik?
Do you accept them as your assistants?

618
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:51,403
-Yes.
-Come on out.

619
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:04,667
Yu Na-bi from Sculpture
with the piece titled <i>"yeoji."</i>

620
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,503
Who would like to assist Yu Na-bi?
Raise your hands.

621
00:50:11,674 --> 00:50:12,883
What?

622
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,812
What? No way.

623
00:50:26,981 --> 00:50:31,318
Na-bi. Do you accept
Jae-eon as your assistant?

624
00:50:37,741 --> 00:50:38,993
Yes.

625
00:50:40,202 --> 00:50:42,288
-All right. If that's everyone--
-Me!

626
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:44,665
I'll volunteer as well.

627
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:47,668
Do you accept Hwang Jin-su
as your assistant?

628
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:48,752
Yes, I do.

629
00:50:53,132 --> 00:50:54,591
All right. Come up.

630
00:51:12,067 --> 00:51:15,654
All right, then.
You should share your work schedules

631
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:19,575
and related materials with your assistants

632
00:51:19,658 --> 00:51:21,035
before we finish up.

633
00:51:21,702 --> 00:51:24,830
The report format
is uploaded on our school website.

634
00:51:24,913 --> 00:51:26,999
-Make sure to check that.
-Okay.

635
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:29,668
-Good job.
-Thank you!

636
00:51:32,671 --> 00:51:33,672
You tied your hair.

637
00:51:34,548 --> 00:51:37,843
Yes. It was a bit hot.

638
00:51:39,303 --> 00:51:41,180
Are you really going to do this?

639
00:51:42,306 --> 00:51:43,682
What do you mean?

640
00:51:43,766 --> 00:51:45,392
You really don't need to.

641
00:51:45,476 --> 00:51:46,894
I thought it'd be fun.

642
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:49,480
I like your ideas.

643
00:51:49,563 --> 00:51:53,108
And it seems interesting to work
with metal.

644
00:51:55,652 --> 00:52:00,115
To be honest, I haven't worked with
metal before. So I'm not that skilled.

645
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:03,160
I'll help you.
That's what assistants are for.

646
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:08,165
You don't want to work with me?

647
00:52:08,832 --> 00:52:12,086
It's not like that, but…

648
00:52:12,169 --> 00:52:13,420
But?

649
00:52:13,504 --> 00:52:17,216
<i>I feel embarrassed
for not being able to believe</i>

650
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:19,343
<i>-that he sincerely liked my piece.</i>
-Na-bi.

651
00:52:22,388 --> 00:52:24,223
I'm looking forward to working with you.

652
00:52:24,973 --> 00:52:27,601
-Thanks.
-I'm in an awesome team.

653
00:52:30,062 --> 00:52:31,688
Me too.

654
00:52:36,068 --> 00:52:37,236
Me too.

655
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,996
Thanks for volunteering to assist me.

656
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:52,209
Here are the materials.

657
00:52:58,173 --> 00:53:00,509
Do you both have time this evening?

658
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:03,512
Drinks to celebrate becoming a team?

659
00:53:04,555 --> 00:53:06,348
I know a metalworking studio.

660
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,559
Want to check it out?

661
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:11,186
Yes!

662
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:17,484
All right then.

663
00:53:45,596 --> 00:53:48,307
JAE-EON

664
00:54:03,822 --> 00:54:04,990
Come in.

665
00:54:12,414 --> 00:54:14,333
What? Why is there no one here?

666
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:16,502
The owner got off work.

667
00:54:17,252 --> 00:54:20,172
I'm using his studio when it's not open.

668
00:54:21,507 --> 00:54:22,883
I live upstairs.

669
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:25,219
I see.

670
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,388
I didn't know you worked this hard.

671
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:31,433
Aren't you overdoing it?

672
00:54:31,517 --> 00:54:32,976
I have a long way to go.

673
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:37,022
<i>I envy his passion.</i>

674
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,573
<i>I think I'll be about 30 minutes late.
Sorry.</i>

675
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:49,660
Jin-su's going to be a bit late.

676
00:54:50,661 --> 00:54:51,995
Sit down.

677
00:55:06,677 --> 00:55:08,804
-Do you want a drink?
-Sure.

678
00:55:24,444 --> 00:55:26,405
It's been a while since we talked.

679
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:28,532
It hasn't been that long.

680
00:55:36,206 --> 00:55:37,207
What?

681
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:42,671
The day we went to the police station…

682
00:55:45,424 --> 00:55:46,675
I'm sorry.

683
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,678
I shouldn't have done that to you.

684
00:55:50,887 --> 00:55:52,514
What's with the sudden apology?

685
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:55,851
You were right about me drawing the line.

686
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:01,189
When people cross a certain line,

687
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:04,860
they feel like it's meaningless.

688
00:56:06,528 --> 00:56:07,738
But…

689
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:10,490
I want to change now.

690
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:16,830
<i>I should stop reading too much
into his words now.</i>

691
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:20,500
Change how?
Are you thinking of dating now?

692
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,254
I'm not sure.

693
00:56:26,131 --> 00:56:29,760
I'm thinking of changing bit by bit.

694
00:56:30,552 --> 00:56:32,054
Then who knows?

695
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:34,306
I might meet my soulmate.

696
00:56:37,768 --> 00:56:39,645
I'll be rooting for you, then.

697
00:56:41,355 --> 00:56:43,357
I hope you can be sincere this time.

698
00:57:19,977 --> 00:57:22,813
You can adjust the fire with this.

699
00:57:31,154 --> 00:57:33,031
Be careful. It's hot.

700
00:57:34,658 --> 00:57:36,952
Start from the middle and go to the edge.

701
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:46,753
Start here and straighten it out
little by little.

702
00:57:51,883 --> 00:57:53,260
It's not straightening out.

703
00:57:53,343 --> 00:57:54,594
Hit it harder.

704
00:58:05,022 --> 00:58:06,440
-It's flat, right?
-Cool.

705
00:58:10,944 --> 00:58:13,238
-Yes, like that.
-It's getting flat.

706
00:58:13,321 --> 00:58:15,157
Good. You're getting better.

707
00:58:23,206 --> 00:58:26,752
Jin-su said he'd be 30 minutes late,
but he never came.

708
00:58:29,296 --> 00:58:31,882
How was it?
It wasn't that difficult, right?

709
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:34,217
Right.

710
00:58:34,926 --> 00:58:36,970
I think I can do it if I work hard.

711
00:58:37,054 --> 00:58:39,973
Call me whenever you want to work.
You'll make a masterpiece.

712
00:58:40,057 --> 00:58:41,433
Stop teasing me.

713
00:58:41,516 --> 00:58:44,102
I'm not teasing you. I like your pieces.

714
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:47,314
Especially this one.
I'm looking forward to it.

715
00:58:49,941 --> 00:58:52,360
I didn't know you liked it that much.

716
00:58:55,614 --> 00:58:56,865
I'll get going.

717
00:58:58,867 --> 00:59:00,035
Na-bi.

718
00:59:05,707 --> 00:59:07,375
I changed my number.

719
00:59:17,511 --> 00:59:18,637
Bye.

720
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:32,609
MISSED CALLS
SEOL-A

721
00:59:56,383 --> 00:59:58,093
<i>-Hey, Seol-a.</i>
-Hey.

722
00:59:58,176 --> 00:59:59,427
Were you waiting for me?

723
01:00:01,555 --> 01:00:02,639
No.

724
01:00:03,515 --> 01:00:07,185
I just called to say
I can't make it today.

725
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:10,272
-That's a relief.
-Were you busy?

726
01:00:10,355 --> 01:00:12,274
Yes, a bit. I was working.

727
01:00:13,525 --> 01:00:14,609
All right.

728
01:00:16,278 --> 01:00:17,654
Go back to work, then.

729
01:00:32,252 --> 01:00:34,004
I like your pieces.

730
01:00:34,087 --> 01:00:37,674
Especially this one.
I'm looking forward to it.

731
01:02:29,703 --> 01:02:33,290
So is this crumbling down,

732
01:02:33,373 --> 01:02:35,083
or being made?

733
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:38,211
That's up to interpretation.

734
01:02:44,926 --> 01:02:46,428
It's good.

735
01:02:49,848 --> 01:02:52,058
Na-bi seems to have gained
her focus again.

736
01:02:52,642 --> 01:02:53,977
Thank you.

737
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,314
It's so cool. Just a few days ago,
there was nothing.

738
01:02:59,399 --> 01:03:03,820
Bit-na. When are you
going to show me your piece?

739
01:03:06,781 --> 01:03:09,784
Focus on your work, okay?

740
01:03:09,868 --> 01:03:12,287
Bit-na, let me see you work properly!

741
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,039
Where is she going?

742
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,541
This is great.

743
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:40,190
Doesn't Jae-eon seem a bit different?

744
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:42,692
He seems a bit purer.

745
01:03:42,776 --> 01:03:45,320
Right. He seems different somehow.

746
01:03:45,403 --> 01:03:47,447
I heard he doesn't hang out with girls.

747
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,616
What happened to him?

748
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:52,869
Is he dating someone for real now?

749
01:03:52,952 --> 01:03:56,623
How would we ever understand the life
of a handsome guy?

750
01:03:56,706 --> 01:03:58,666
-Good work.
-Good work.

751
01:04:02,212 --> 01:04:03,546
-Give me one too.
-Here.

752
01:04:04,297 --> 01:04:05,882
-Here you go.
-Have one.

753
01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:09,135
-You try this.
-It's good.

754
01:04:21,314 --> 01:04:23,066
-You want to make wings?
-Yes.

755
01:04:23,691 --> 01:04:27,362
But I don't know what kind of shape
I should make it into.

756
01:04:31,783 --> 01:04:33,952
I should print this one.

757
01:05:01,688 --> 01:05:03,815
FOR REFERENCE

758
01:05:03,898 --> 01:05:06,234
I wish I could see this in person.

759
01:05:06,317 --> 01:05:09,112
-You can.
-How?

760
01:05:09,195 --> 01:05:11,322
This artist's having an exhibition.

761
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:13,533
It opens next week. Do you want to go?

762
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:17,245
Sure. Let's do that.

763
01:05:17,328 --> 01:05:18,788
Hey, Jin-su.

764
01:05:23,418 --> 01:05:24,961
He's sleeping again.

765
01:05:25,545 --> 01:05:28,381
<i>Our relationship took a new turn,</i>

766
01:05:28,465 --> 01:05:32,802
<i>and I found peace in my mind
within that friendly relationship.</i>

767
01:05:36,181 --> 01:05:37,974
Yes, I'm here.

768
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:39,767
Just because.

769
01:05:44,606 --> 01:05:46,441
I thought I should cut my hair.

770
01:05:46,524 --> 01:05:50,945
I didn't go to a hair shop in America,
so it got kind of messy.

771
01:05:52,363 --> 01:05:54,949
Really? Should I cut it short, then?

772
01:05:57,452 --> 01:05:59,913
I guess I'll do that. All right.

773
01:05:59,996 --> 01:06:01,247
I'll see you tomorrow.

774
01:06:08,213 --> 01:06:09,756
I'll get it for you…

775
01:06:18,598 --> 01:06:19,807
Thanks.

776
01:06:24,646 --> 01:06:27,065
Are you Yu Na-bi, by any chance?

777
01:06:27,649 --> 01:06:29,275
Do you know me?

778
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:32,487
Jae-eon said you were a friend
in the same department.

779
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:36,324
Right.

780
01:06:37,367 --> 01:06:38,993
Are you here to see Jae-eon?

781
01:06:39,827 --> 01:06:43,206
Yes. I just came
because I wanted to see him.

782
01:06:43,831 --> 01:06:46,876
He's probably busy.
We have a lot of assignments.

783
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,169
Really?

784
01:06:49,337 --> 01:06:51,965
He said he'd come out.
I feel kind of sorry now.

785
01:06:58,805 --> 01:07:00,056
Hey, Jae-eon.

786
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:02,517
Oh, really?

787
01:07:03,977 --> 01:07:05,562
It's fine. Take your time.

788
01:07:07,272 --> 01:07:08,982
I don't smoke that much.

789
01:07:10,525 --> 01:07:12,110
All right.

790
01:07:16,823 --> 01:07:20,785
Excuse me,
but what's your relationship with Jae-eon?

791
01:07:21,578 --> 01:07:23,246
We used to date.

792
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:26,499
I see.

793
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,005
And…

794
01:07:34,215 --> 01:07:36,092
we're seeing each other again.

795
01:07:43,516 --> 01:07:47,687
But are you really just friends with him?

796
01:07:55,612 --> 01:07:57,905
Yes. We're just friends.

797
01:07:59,365 --> 01:08:00,825
That's a relief.

798
01:08:00,908 --> 01:08:03,244
I thought maybe I said something
I shouldn't have.

799
01:08:14,756 --> 01:08:15,757
You should

800
01:08:17,216 --> 01:08:18,843
just keep your hair that way.

801
01:08:19,886 --> 01:08:20,720
What?

802
01:08:22,096 --> 01:08:26,059
Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.

803
01:09:23,116 --> 01:09:27,578
<i>A distance that's close enough
yet not too close to hurt each other.</i>

804
01:09:27,662 --> 01:09:30,456
<i>Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.</i>

805
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,583
-Na-bi is coming?
-You didn't know?

806
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:34,460
<i>She disappeared.</i>

807
01:09:34,544 --> 01:09:36,546
<i>That's what you hate the most.</i>

808
01:09:36,629 --> 01:09:38,339
<i>Getting clingy.</i>

809
01:09:38,423 --> 01:09:40,049
<i>Certainty about the relationship.</i>

810
01:09:40,133 --> 01:09:42,510
How does one get that certainty?

811
01:09:42,593 --> 01:09:44,679
<i>I didn't know you'd be coming along.</i>

812
01:09:44,762 --> 01:09:47,181
I've always wanted to come here.

813
01:09:47,265 --> 01:09:48,099
Cheers.

814
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:50,852
<i>Then is it over with him now?</i>

815
01:09:50,935 --> 01:09:52,687
<i>It must be someone you like.</i>

816
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,355
<i>No, just someone bothersome.</i>

817
01:09:54,439 --> 01:09:57,692
<i>I know very well that a person
who doesn't know how to love someone</i>

818
01:09:57,775 --> 01:09:58,818
<i>can never be happy.</i>

819
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:00,319
<i>You're coming here?</i>

820
01:10:00,403 --> 01:10:03,406
<i>Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.</i>

821
01:10:03,489 --> 01:10:07,618
