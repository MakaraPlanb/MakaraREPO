00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,730
The developer will also participate this time.

183
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,600
See this. Good night.

184
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,200
Dating App "Big Data Love",
On-the-spot announcement
President Kim Seo Joon said,
"I'll personally try to use Big Data".

185
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,390
But isn't that a bit non-humanistic approach?

186
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,430
If we're not suitable for each other,
then we'll just send ourselves back.

187
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,730
What's more non-humanistic is that figure of yours.

188
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,510
Okay, here.

189
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,590
Challenge yourself again.

190
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,620
How to forget the man who left you?

191
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,630
- Meet with other men to forget him!
- ...Forget him!

192
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,440
Sir, please give us another glass.

193
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,470
Oh, you're here.

194
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,270
What's this?

195
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,630
[ Also known as Valentine's Day, or Pepero Day in South Korea ]

196
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,750
11.11.

197
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,630
Is it 11.11 today?

198
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,710
Right.

199
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,670
What is this?

200
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,820
- Is this a chick?
- A stuffed toy chick.

201
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,030
You're saying it looks like me?

202
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,700
What's this?

203
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,730
My gift this Valentines day.

204
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,240
I love you.

205
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,990
Thank you so much.

206
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,350
The reporters always call and ask...

207
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,130
...why you didn't start using Big Data Love.

208
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,790
We're getting late. Let's hurry.

209
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,110
Hurry up and open it.

210
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,310
I dreamed of a pig today.
[ Dreaming of a pig in Korea is a sign of getting rich. ]

211
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,110
I'm very nervous.

212
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Really?

213
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,550
It must be for real. You're ideal man is like a pig.

214
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,530
My man is as cute as a pig, you know.

215
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,570
Hey, see this.

216
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
He's fit enough.

217
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,730
What about yours?

218
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,990
Amazing.

219
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,710
This is ridiculous.

220
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,770
Can you buy my dream about the pig for 2,000 won?

221
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,660
Okay?

222
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,270
- Oh, I'm also in front of the lighthouse.
- On the lighthouse front.

223
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,400
What would you like to drink?

224
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,910
There's no need to ask each other for things like this.

225
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,200
You want lemon tea, right?

226
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,620
Me?

227
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,020
I want to drink coffee.

228
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,390
We'll order two cups of coffee.

229
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,870
Coming later.

230
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,800
Do you like watching horror movies?

231
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,600
Horror?

232
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,040
Well, yes.

233
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,190
I like to eat rice than noodles.

234
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,930
Of course, I like to eat rice.

235
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,860
Compared to buy then eat,
I prefer to make and eat it.

236
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,110
Wow! Then you must like indie bands.

237
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,550
So you mean, independent bands.

238
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,370
Please wait a minute.

239
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,730
AN BIT NA
Gopchang, Grade 3.2, Horror
Basketball, Carbohydrates
On progress, Coffee, Taking pictures

240
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,730
KIM SEO JOON
Gopchang, Grade 3.2, Horror
Basketball, Carbohydrates
On progress, Coffee, Taking pictures

241
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,240
Basketball, horror, gopchang... Did I like these!?

242
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,990
Hey, what's with this data?

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,140
Hey, I don't drink coffee.

244
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,800
I don't even touch internal organs,
how can I like gopchang?

245
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,070
What are you talking about?

246
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,510
How could that happen?

247
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,470
Pardon me.

248
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,870
Is it someone you know?

249
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,950
Well, it's my friend who came out with me.

250
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,470
How should I say this?

251
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,880
Here in Big Data Love, many become
successful after the parties met each other.

252
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,590
It seems that people have trust in Big Data.

253
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,440
Since it's science.

254
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,400
Everyone believes in science.

255
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,550
In order to love someone,
shouldn't you felt something first?

256
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,280
It can be said it's the world of AI.

257
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,170
I have to accept the change regarding love.

258
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,040
No way. But still...

259
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,200
You and I are just similar, aren't we?

260
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,110
Why do you think so?

261
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,370
It's nothing.

262
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,390
Anyways, after meeting each other,

263
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,880
we don't need to feel discomfort,
push-and-pull each other,

264
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,400
and guess what to do next.

265
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,170
Have trust with Big Data.

266
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,460
Shall we eat something?

267
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,730
Then, how about gopchang?

268
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,670
I'm on the process of searching the data error.

269
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,910
Don't let her notice you.
You have to settle it down.

270
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,310
The fatty part...

271
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,150
Okay.

272
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,590
Let me just grill those.

273
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,270
It's okay.

274
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,190
I grill better...

275
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,420
Please just leave it to me.

276
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,390
Goodness. Is it the first time you've eaten gopchang?

277
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,430
Women who eat gopchang...

278
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,550
...grill it gently like this.

279
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,110
That way, its insides will be fully cooked.

280
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,440
That's how fats are cooked.

281
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,870
That's what it means.

282
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,350
Try it.

283
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,110
Let's eat.

284
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,730
You won't eat?

285
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,220
What do you think when you see this grilled intestines?

286
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,110
It was really cooked well.

287
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,280
This is what I think.

288
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,550
Don't munch the intestines casually.

289
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,130
Even once, it has been meaningful to someone.

290
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,000
Do you know the difference between
large intestines, small intestines and abdomen?

291
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,070
They're obviously different.

292
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,150
Large intestines are large.
Small intestines are small.

293
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,540
Cattle belly is the fourth abdominal part of cattle.

294
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,220
Now, about pigs.

295
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,400
About pigs...

296
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,620
Before the 60 cm long intestine
down towards the anus...

297
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,080
...are their stomachs.

298
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,270
And according to Big Data's analysis,

299
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,310
after knowing and eating those innards,
the taste will be 1.8 times the original.

300
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,950
You're really a proficient data analyst.

301
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,130
Please eat a lot.

302
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,870
So, you were able to grilled
that smelly gopchang by yourself?

303
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,110
She's totally different from me.
There must be something wrong.

304
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,370
I'm hanging up.

305
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,080
She's totally different from me.
There must be something wrong.

306
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,370
I'm hanging up.

307
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,480
You have changed your phone number.

308
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,770
I'm afraid you will not call me,
so I didn't changed mine.

309
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,950
Have you known? That I broke up with him.

310
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,750
I don't want to know.

311
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,000
So you already knew it.

312
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,330
You won't let me ride in?

313
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,040
Tell me to take in there.

314
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,680
If you let me take the elevator,

315
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll go in.

316
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,880
Why did you come back?

317
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,000
Just.

318
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,680
You changed a lot all this time.

319
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,750
You have a bright future ahead.

320
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,000
You also appeared on TV Twitch show.

321
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,170
After you left like that, I made an app.

322
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,530
After two people meet and fell in love,

323
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,150
all that will remain is just pain.

324
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,260
So what?

325
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,170
Did you made a lot of money for me?

326
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,600
Don't you think your current chief is concerned about this?

327
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,370
You definitely think that I'm a bad person
who just values love with conditions.

328
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,170
If you lose us in the app you've made,

329
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,510
you won't be able to match 20% of it.

330
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,220
Want to try it with me?

331
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,420
No.

332
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,240
Let's do it.

333
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,600
I don't want to.

334
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,770
Even if I'm more oblivious than the AI,

335
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,840
I also know that we're not suitable for each other.

336
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,080
But still I come here.

337
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Sometimes.

338
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,350
Where did you go as soon as you met?

339
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,910
We went to bed.

340
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,110
What did you say?

341
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,790
What do you worry about so much?
Anyway, the data says that we are the most suitable.

342
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,070
Big Data...

343
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,190
It is big.

344
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,270
That's still a bit...

345
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,150
Try to ask yourself. Is that data like God?

346
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,860
Did you stop growing during the 20th century?

347
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,790
What?

348
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,790
20th-century girls uses the 20th-century romance.

349
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,630
I'm going to fall in love in the 21st century,

350
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,590
so no need to worry.

351
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,220
Hey, where will you go?

352
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,130
How could I know? We even just met once.

353
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,510
Well, though my nose is quite lofty.

354
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,950
You should just sleep first.

355
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,620
Hey.

356
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,970
Honey.

357
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,150
What are you doing?

358
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,830
Yes, I'm coming.

00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,950
I don't know if something went wrong.

541
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,130
It's a coincidence when we turn our heads.

542
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,510
That you even smiled while looking at me.

543
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,930
We even laugh at the same story.

544
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,970
We even like the same restaurant.

545
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,240
Is this a coincidence or just a delusion?

546
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,460
Now, I can't even help myself.

547
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,000
Why are you so irresistibly lovely?

548
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,460
If anyone just meets you for once...

549
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,600
A while ago...

550
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,910
...that's you. If you just know all of these...

551
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:23,600
I will tell you all by then.

552
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,080
I'm grateful to you.

553
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,680
If you know everything...

554
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,640
You've just accepted it naturally.

555
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,240
Of course, it's just fine.

556
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,000
I mean...

557
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,930
That was just a mistake, isn't it?

558
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:40,280
Somehow, I know it just by first glance.

559
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,130
When I see you become a different person sometimes.

560
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,200
Do you know what I feel or you're just pretending not to?

561
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,370
I feel so curious about that.

562
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:58,170
Why are you so irresistibly lovely?

563
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,750
If anyone just meets you for once,

564
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,110
my heart keeps beating.

565
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,730
You expected that it will rain?

566
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,350
I just secretly smile.

567
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,970
Alex, will it rain today?

568
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:12,510
Is it a day that can't be stopped?

569
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,800
There's 67% chance of rainfall,
so please bring an umbrella with you.

570
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:17,640
If it's a secret that no one could feel,

571
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,280
There may be a thunderstorm today.

572
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,440
Amazing.

573
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,150
maybe, the only one I could go to...

574
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,660
I still haven't raised a child, you know.

575
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,350
Is it rain showering now?

576
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:27,080
...is you. If you just know all this...

577
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,170
I will tell you all by then.

578
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,680
If you know everything.

579
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,370
I don't know why I'm like this.

580
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:43,220
I'm not usually this kind of person.

581
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,370
I made you stopped thinking for a while.

582
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:53,440
So will you still accept my feelings towards you?

583
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,080
Why are you so irresistibly lovely?

584
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,680
If anyone just meets you for once...

585
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,860
...that's you. If you just know all of this...

586
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,310
I will tell you by then.

587
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,730
Shall we take a walk together?

588
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:20,770
That I love you.

589
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,830
Okay.

590
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,080
What kind of relationship do you want to have?

591
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,060
Big Data Love?

592
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,330
The love that I desired to have...

593
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,570
...is where the world is only black and white.

594
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,510
I can only see one person who's in color
and wants to talk about love.

595
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,480
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

596
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,750
It would be painful to fall in love with me at first sight.

597
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,460
Isn't that what love is all about?

598
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,530
Hurt others and being hurt by them.

599
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:04,170
Grow with new flesh, training our love muscles,
and slowly be matured.

600
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,970
That's how a true love goes.

601
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,680
So you're talking about love muscles.

602
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,640
What is the most important thing for you?

603
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,270
For instance, you may have some conditions,

604
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,150
or you may applied at Big Data in order
to find someone who doesn't talk about it.

605
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,420
You have a point from there.

606
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,640
A man who eats on time.

607
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,660
Oh? You laughed.

608
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,970
It's the first I've saw you like that.

609
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,310
I thought your teeth were hard to see,
they even look good.

610
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,770
I'm hungry.

611
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,420
I'm... hungry too.

612
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,640
We look good with each other.

613
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,440
That's amazing.

614
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,190
- Thanks for the food.
- We have enjoyed it.

615
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,350
- You can go now.
- Be careful on your way.

616
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,640
I have to eat three meals a day.

617
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,350
Do you even eat your meals?

618
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,880
No, I eat every meal...

619
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,860
I haven't seen you laughing for a long time.

620
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,860
Your employee from your company?

621
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,910
Well, I am...

622
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,170
It seems that the other staff
members haven't come out yet.

623
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,240
Let Seo Joon be invited with you to eat some delicious foods.

624
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,130
After all, he has a lot of work.

625
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,660
Just be silent.

626
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,000
You see...

627
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,130
I almost forgot that I have another appointment to attend.

628
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,110
In that case,

629
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,950
I'll just see you in your office.

630
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,460
It's not what you think, Bit Na.

631
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,350
I mean, this person is...

632
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,220
So, you're Bit Na.

633
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,510
I'll take him first. Is that fine with you?

634
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,660
What the heck are you doing?

635
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,040
Try to think of it. Why am I like this?

636
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,510
You're looking down on me, aren't you?

637
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,710
You found it good to be with
a woman who's suitable with you?

638
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,670
You're the one who left me.

639
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,900
That's why, I came back again.

640
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,240
Why did you have to came back?

641
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,480
It's not because you like me freely
but because you have a condition.

642
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,280
How could you...

643
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,280
...see me that way?

644
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,930
You couldn't really understand me?

645
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,460
Hey, what happened?

646
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,400
He has a woman,

647
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,200
A woman?

648
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,000
What?

649
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,020
He hid it from you while you're dating?

650
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,220
Isn't he crazy?

651
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,640
Gosh! That jerk!

652
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,710
Let's post something online.

653
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,060
Let's say Big Data is just fake.

654
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,680
I mean,

655
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,820
No matter it's ordinary love or Big Data love,
why is it so difficult?

656
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,510
Should I just give up?

657
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,460
Forget that.

658
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,970
Meet with him first and let him apologize to you.

659
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:48,110
It's not too late to make a decision.

660
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,770
Do you have beer?

661
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,130
Let's have a drink together.

662
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,680
[ Yang Seol Ah ]

663
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,420
[ Are you sure you're going to delete the contact number? ]
[ Cancel / Delete ]

664
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,640
[ Have you went to sleep now? ]

665
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,110
[ I'm sorry for what happened today. ]

666
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,880
[ Actually, today, I... ]

667
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,950
[ Actually, today, I... ]

668
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,880
I finally found out the source of the bug.

669
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,730
It will return to normal tomorrow.

670
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:12,880
Are you not happy?

671
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,730
That you won't be able to have fake love again.

672
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,370
If it returns to normal,

673
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,970
what will now be our matching success rate be?

674
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,800
"Our"?

675
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,530
What happened?

676
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,110
The atmosphere is unusual.

677
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,460
Let's just talk about our next plan.

678
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,770
It's time for us to return to the battle.

679
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,730
You must show to her how different you are.

680
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,840
And then,

681
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,600
let's try to determine the current matching success rate.

682
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,630
After determining it,

683
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,710
is there anything else you can do?

684
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,930
You can only just apply for return.

685
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,420
What will be the actual matching
rate between you and An Bit Na?

686
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,420
[ 23%, No match ]

687
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,480
What happened?

688
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,240
The love that I desired to have...

689
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:24,170
...is where the world is only black and white.

690
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:27,170
I can only see one person who's in color
and wants to talk about love.

691
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,110
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

692
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,930
I almost forgot that I have another appointment to attend.

693
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,950
In that case,

694
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,880
I'll just see you in your office.

695
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,550
What are you going to do?

696
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,950
No more for this.

697
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,840
Right? Isn't it?

698
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,440
I won't apply for a return.

699
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,230
What? You want to continue your fake relationship?

700
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,110
No.

701
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,660
I want to enter into a real one.

702
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,400
What?

703
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,930
You're the president who made the Big Data.

704
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,040
You want to fell in love for a woman
who doesn't match with you.

705
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,510
Does that make sense?

706
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,420
I will surely succeed with this matter,

707
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,950
so I'm leaving my current position to you.

708
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,660
Hey, President Kim!

709
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,040
This is too...

710
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,570
Didn't you said that we'll be happy when
we fall in love with someone we like?

711
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:39,800
But what's this?

712
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,840
He's a bad jerk.

713
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,260
Why haven't he contacted you yet?

714
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,950
Is it because he feel sorry for you?

715
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,110
He must be.

716
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,020
I told you to just contact him.

717
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,750
Glad for you.

718
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,330
It just happened in one day, all of it.

719
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,750
Then, what are you going to do now?

720
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,480
Let me say this.

721
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,640
I met him a week ago.

722
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,660
I feel like it's been a year.

723
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,400
Don't you find it ambiguous if I've
been with that jerk for one year?

724
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,620
Hey.

725
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,370
That guy has only one thing that
he could die for throughout his life.

726
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:28,770
I don't have to worry about it this time.

727
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,420
I feel relieved.

728
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,880
Frankly speaking, I'm happy.

729
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,280
But,

730
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,350
after a week,

731
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,390
I haven't find him with more curiosity at all.

732
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,150
Anyways, both of us were exactly the same.

733
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,440
What's that?

734
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,260
My gift.

735
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,020
Ah, this one.

736
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,370
I have received the gift,

737
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,370
but I didn't felt emotional.

738
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,440
Because both us know what we wanted to.

739
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,880
A love without push-and-pull.

740
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,440
Like that we won't run out of drinks.

741
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,480
During the former era,

742
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,200
is that how it feels to be in fixedly
being in love with someone?

743
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:22,040
Instead of my mother, Big Data must help me
choose the person I'll be in love with.

744
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,600
So, is Big Data Love on the wrong?

745
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,970
No.

746
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,620
Where can I find a suitable man for me other than there?

747
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,800
I like it. I really like it.

748
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:34,950
That's nice to know.

749
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,640
I'm envious of you.

750
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,220
Hello.

751
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,420
Yes, it's me.

752
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,440
She's my ex-girlfriend.

753
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:50,060
It's snowing outside my windows.

754
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:50,060
[ 눈오네 (It's Snowing) by Moon and Baduk ]

755
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,880
You weren't back in a relationship now?

756
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:53,640
We are not from the same world.

757
00:50:54,040 --> 00:51:01,640
The longings that I've been hiding...

758
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,770
I can't satisfy her desires.

759
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,000
Although I had a hard time for a while,

760
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,880
it has been already in the past.

761
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:10,220
...just became snow.

762
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,510
I'm sorry...

763
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,240
...for what happened that day.

764
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:18,880
I can't hide and get down and see the changes of the season.

765
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,260
I've been contemplating yesterday
whether to call you or not.

766
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:28,040
With my scattered longings,

767
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,000
I don't even know for myself.

768
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,470
Whether I'm just curious to know how high
the matching rate Big Data can give me.

769
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,440
Or is it still because my heart's shaken
inside that I wanted to contact you.

770
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:36,640
I want to put your hand...

771
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,620
So what about now?

772
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,310
Which one is it?

773
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,880
...towards my weary shoulder.

774
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,570
I'll think about it while riding with a bicycle.

775
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,480
The snowflakes have come down.

776
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,550
You can't ride with the bicycle?

777
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,570
As expected...

778
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,040
My body doesn't coordinate
when I try to learn something.

779
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,840
When did you learned this?

780
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,350
Starting from that day.

781
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:13,510
And it still continues to snow.

782
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,950
Shall we ride with a bicycle?

783
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,910
Just the two of us?

784
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,460
How long shall it take to learn riding a bicycle?

785
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,510
You can just do it just for a day.

786
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,170
My longings which suppressed...

787
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,930
How about after three days?

788
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,280
Since I said that I wanted to ride a bicycle,
did you learn it? Within 3 days?

789
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,550
For 3 days.

790
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:32,310
...have just became snowy white.

791
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,770
In that case,

792
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,330
I have a good idea.

793
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:41,930
I can't stand it. It keeps piling up.

794
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,590
1, 2. 1,2.

795
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,200
1, 2. 1, 2.

796
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:52,950
I can't sleep as I'm yearning from you.

797
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,150
You've said it before.

798
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,440
Getting hurt, then grow new flesh.

799
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,150
Training love muscles, then get slowly matured.

800
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,800
That's how true love goes.

801
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:59,730
I'm in front of your house all night.

802
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,750
I keep thinking of what you said.

803
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,750
I learned that my love muscles wasn't trained at all.

804
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:05,220
Wanting to make a snowman,

805
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,600
Did I said those?

806
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,280
Did you have fun?

807
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,200
Yes.

808
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:18,420
with my longing that never melts.

809
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,630
1, 2.

810
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:27,350
On your first footstep tomorrow morning,

811
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:32,400
I wanted you to leave a footprint from there.

812
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:44,950
The snowflakes have come down.

813
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,000
Bit Na.

814
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,020
You see...

815
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,530
I found the one who shook my eyes in the
black-and-white world and see its colors.

816
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,660
She's the one who rides the bicycle in front of me.

817
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,350
Though I don't know if Big Data
can calculate what my heart feels,

818
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,000
But...

819
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,020
I like you...

820
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,310
Let's go for a ride later.

821
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:54,460
Yes. That's good.

822
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,820
Time flies.

823
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,150
I'm going in.

824
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,240
Bit Na.

825
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,460
I... have broken up with her.

826
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,970
You said you'll come back
to me after I've done that.

827
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,080
When did I?

828
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,480
No way.

829
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,310
You're still angry with me?

830
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,910
You, being an old-fashioned woman,
is already in the past.

831
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,040
Excuse me.

832
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,420
Bit Na, who's this person...?

833
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,310
You must be looking down at me.

834
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,970
Just go on your way, as we'll go on our own too.

835
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:04,040
You see...

836
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,970
Let me talk with him first.

837
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,330
Go ahead.

838
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:29,840
That bastard...

839
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:31,710
Who's that?

840
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,750
Why are you curious?

841
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,130
You said you're infatuated with me?
But what you're doing is unfair.

842
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:39,510
What?

843
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:40,280
It's nothing.

844
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,530
I totally suck.

845
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:45,260
Bit Na.

846
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,860
It's my fault.

847
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,660
I must be crazy.

848
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,220
I just left and cheated you.

849
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,440
You're even like a devoted wife for me.

850
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,200
But she didn't even bother to cook for me.

851
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,460
Hey!

852
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,730
Do you find me a funny one?

853
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,310
You're such a dumb guy.

854
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,730
You have no right to hinder with my life.

855
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,040
Why you're like this!?

856
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,840
Stay away from me, you jerk!

857
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,260
Hey.

858
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,750
Jerks like you are such a waste to be cheated.

859
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,860
You're totally rubbish.

860
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:30,840
Bit Na...

861
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,730
You.

862
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,820
Dare to follow us or you'll be dead.

863
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,820
He must find me an easy woman.

864
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,240
I thought that he really liked me.

865
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,550
But,

866
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:05,460
when I knew he wasn't sincere,
it was already late.

867
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,330
There was a time when it was hard to end.

868
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,260
How about the present times?

869
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,040
Of course, I have let go of him.

870
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,480
Though I can't erase my memories with him.

871
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:21,730
That is...

872
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,200
Why you couldn't?

873
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,910
When the man had left you,
there's only one answer.

874
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,910
Just delete that person and empty out your trash bin.

875
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,200
That he'll not able to return anymore.

876
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,170
Isn't that simple?

877
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:43,260
You want to start again with that man?

878
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,800
What?

879
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:52,370
Are persons like computers?

880
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,660
Memories are not something I can control.
It takes time to erase those.

881
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:02,400
We've been saying unnecessary things.

882
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,820
I've shown a lot of things that you shouldn't see.

883
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,910
Bit Na.

884
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:51,070
Why are you all doing this to me?

885
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,600
Yes. This is me.

886
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,130
Can you come out for a second?

887
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,060
I'm sorry...

888
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,220
...that I just left you like that yesterday.

889
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,950
I was childish, right?

890
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:37,930
That I've just said ridiculous things.

891
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,800
Why...

892
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,060
...have I done that?

893
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:56,710
We have received some seldom thoughts of a woman.

894
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,150
"To the one that's right for me."

895
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,770
"To the one who sincerely loves me..."

896
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:04,000
"You're somewhere out there, right?"

897
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,570
