There's a robbery and it's done by three persons!

185
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,770
- I said, it's done by three persons!
- You come here!

186
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,440
Give me money!

187
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,310
Hey, give me beer.

188
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,620
Hey. Take this and go back.

189
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,200
Hello.

190
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,530
You've worked hard.

191
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,510
Damn it!

192
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,710
I am asking them to catch the burglars...

193
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,550
But I almost got caught from that gambling.

194
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,200
Gosh. But, Han Cheol, this punk.

195
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,080
He's not even answering me.

196
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,570
Huh?

197
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,260
Hyung, please help me.

198
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,820
Where are you?

199
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,620
Seoul City, Sangwoon-gu, Nakwon-dong,
Nakwon Apartment, Room 505.

200
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,680
You feel tired, right?

201
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,640
Goodness.

202
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,800
The hill is getting steep.

203
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,640
Get in. I'll take you there.

204
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,080
You're going to Nakwon Apartment, right?

205
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,640
I live there on Room 201.

206
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,020
How did you know that I'm going there?

207
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,860
Did President Geum send you?

208
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,840
Goodness. What you're saying is unreasonable.

209
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,200
Well, you just look normal to me.

210
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,800
So I asked myself what made you come here.

211
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,110
Do you think I don't know that?

212
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,770
Of course, you know.

213
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,310
We are neighbors.

214
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,130
The air here and up there
may not be convenient for you.

215
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,660
There's no haze here.

216
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,350
There's a key on the post.

217
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,950
Damn it.

218
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,260
You startled me.

219
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,220
Are you looking for someone?

220
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,310
Be careful going up.

221
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,200
Newcomers don't know that I'm totally not blind.

222
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,730
But they'll just making a fuss.

223
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,530
I just have a poor eyesight.

224
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,530
It's not really that dark.

225
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,680
Even if you just stay still,
I can see everything.

226
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,930
You're Room 505 tenant's brother?

227
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,970
Gosh. What's wrong with you?

228
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,820
You surprised me.

229
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
So it's you. It's you.

230
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,640
Foolish ones can't see themselves well.

231
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,550
You'll forever suffer while living.

232
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,170
He looks pitiful.

233
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,460
He's pitiful.

234
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,640
- Hurry up.
- You'll forever live in hell.

235
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,820
You need to open your eyes and ears!

236
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,680
Even you have eyes and ears,
you can't still see nor hear well.

237
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,220
He looks pitiful.

238
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,000
She's from Room 303.
She's not on her sound mind.

239
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,420
She has a late-stage cancer.

240
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,750
She has a mental stupor too.

241
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,020
It's been worse recently.

242
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,280
If she don't have money,
she just rather die.

243
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,620
No wonder she has an inconsistent personality.

244
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,710
Is it because the air feels hazy?

245
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,150
Anyways, we're on Room 505.

246
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,370
I haven't seen him these days.

247
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,820
So I though he went on a trip.

248
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
You must be close with your brother...

249
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,970
Just ask me if you're curious
about something, Room 505.

250
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,970
I'll help you right away.

251
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,460
Na Yeon, it's been a long time.

252
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,530
Gosh.

253
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,060
You're so pretty from the morning.

254
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,930
Have you eaten your breakfast?

255
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,170
She's totally rude.

256
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,750
What's this?

257
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,440
They're already spoiled.

258
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,130
Why that old man didn't leave yet?

259
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,910
Is he asking for a tip or what?

260
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,330
What the heck are you...

261
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,970
There's no one.

262
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,420
Your call cannot be connected...

263
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,150
Where are you?

264
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,750
Why won't you come here?

265
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,150
Goodness!

266
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,800
[ President Geum ]

267
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,240
What? Where?

268
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,460
There.

269
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,240
Ah, so it's here.

270
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,020
There has been leaks since last night,

271
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,220
so I tried to fix it.

272
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,330
I shall just call the maintenance, right?

273
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,770
No need for that.

274
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,240
You'll have to pay lots of money
and it's just a waste.

275
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,350
Obviously, we can just repair it by ourselves.

276
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,420
This can be easily handled.

277
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,620
We need to look the place underneath.

278
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,620
I'm not the one who made this.

279
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,800
This is just easy.

280
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,460
I'll fix it right away for you.

281
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,840
Then, I'll start from here.

282
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,880
All right, let's see.

283
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,130
Goodness!

284
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,260
Are you okay?

285
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
Yes, I am.

286
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,370
This should be roughly repaired right away...

287
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,710
You're going right now after leaving that behind?

288
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,660
Yes, you're right.

289
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,570
If you have time, call a professional to finish this...

290
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,020
Call a professional to repair it?

291
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,240
Indeed.

292
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,170
Well, yes.

293
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,640
I'm just joking.

294
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,640
Thank you for helping me.

295
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,330
There's nothing I can do if I'm alone.

296
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,370
Are you moving here?

297
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,170
On what room?

298
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,930
No. I'm not moving here.

299
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,020
Someone called me.

300
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,600
It's my brother.

301
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,640
You see.

302
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,640
Do you know my brother?

303
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,080
You don't know it.

304
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,680
Who cares about their neighbor tenant these days?

305
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,110
You can come and go then say hello.

306
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,020
Have you met your brother?

307
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,730
Not yet.

308
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,330
Well, my brother called me here.

309
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,150
I don't even know where he is
and I haven't seen him.

310
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,530
Oh?

311
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,860
There's tape stuck in the door.

312
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,860
Has someone living there?

313
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,620
No.

314
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,880
Someone died over there.

315
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,370
Someone died?

316
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,440
Oh my.

317
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,370
You must be surprised.

318
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,170
Goodness.

319
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,930
I thought it's real.

320
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,440
I'm serious.

321
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,600
Want to drink coffee?

322
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,220
I just have instant coffee, though.

323
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,530
Instant coffee?

324
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,640
The husband had abused his wife,

325
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,350
so the wife had killed him.

326
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,750
But,

327
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,240
are you living like this?

328
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,930
You're not afraid?

329
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,020
I am.

330
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,570
That's why, I stick tape over there as I'm afraid.

331
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,220
I had a tough time sticking the tape.

332
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,220
My hair keeps getting stuck on it.

333
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
It shouldn't be like that.

334
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,260
What's usually done first?

335
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
What you should have done
is to move out right away.

336
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,330
I really like this place.

337
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,170
The sunlight and the wind breeze.

338
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,930
Besides, it's not a boisterous area.

339
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,860
More than that,

340
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,020
the most important for me is capitalism.

341
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,060
Capitalism?

342
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,530
You believe in that?

343
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,770
It's cheap here.

344
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,440
Cheap?

345
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,170
The rent.

346
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,200
The rent?

347
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,240
It's really cheap.

348
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,220
So it's really cheap.

349
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,910
It's strange, right?

350
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,220
That I live in this place.

351
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,240
Not at all. Who will think that way?

352
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,400
Not at all.

353
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,750
It's really important to save money.

354
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,570
I don't know about others,
but I totally understand your disposition.

355
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,170
Really?

356
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,110
Thank goodness.

357
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,950
That's what I mean.

358
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,020
You see, other apartments have expensive rent fees.

359
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,970
I can save and buy trash bags
for 20,000 won per month.

360
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,510
It's justifiable that you'll pay the rent and tape.

361
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,200
Pardon?

362
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,510
It's nothing.

363
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,620
Your house is nice, huh?

364
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,110
It's cheap.

365
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,370
The tape sticks well.

366
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,680

00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,660
Where is the corpse?

552
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,440
What?

553
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,640
I mean, I'm just curious, you know.

554
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,310
My brother has disappeared.

555
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,710
Or else, I'll just ask you to find him.

556
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,600
Want to know my brother's age?

557
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,330
He's 7 years old. 37!

558
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,200
The watch got transferred to someone now.

559
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,020
He's wearing the watch.

560
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,170
Does anyone need to kill each other
just for that counterfeit watch?

561
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,910
Well, they didn't know that it's not fake.

562
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,510
I mean, but still,

563
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,680
will they get killed if they wear that watch?

564
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,710
If it's not about that...

565
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,020
Right.

566
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,660
This is it.

567
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,040
The numbers?

568
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,510
That jotter must be important
if one's tries to kill someone.

569
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:22,600
The numbers?

570
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,860
Goodness. Where was it hidden?

571
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,370
I've found it.

572
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,750
What's this?

573
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,800
Is it fine to leave it like this?

574
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,620
What are you doing?

575
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,950
What are you doing?

576
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,880
You see...

577
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,000
Don't misunderstand something.

578
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,710
You see... Where are you going?

579
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,400
What to do?

580
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,710
You see, wait a second...

581
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,350
Damn it! Hey! Hey!

582
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,510
Excuse me...

583
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,480
Excuse me...

584
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:31,330
Let's see.

585
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,110
Excuse me...

586
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,420
You're here, right?

587
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,970
Do you see me as a murderer?

588
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,750
You have seen me wrong.

589
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,680
Huh?

590
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,680
You shouldn't be like that.

591
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,620
I even helped you fix your kitchen sink.

592
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,060
You shouldn't be like that to me.

593
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,600
Okay?

594
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,350
- Where are you going...?
- Let go of me!

595
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,130
Please shut up!

596
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:05,080
I said, just be quiet!

597
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,530
Not good.

598
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,530
We won't be able to get out from here.

599
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,130
I need to contact someone.

600
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,280
Goodness.

601
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,820
What's with this place?
Why are the lights turned off?

602
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,420
You really didn't kill him?

603
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,510
I've told you many times that I didn't do it.

604
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,750
I'm not like that.

605
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,800
I really saw it.

606
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,550
I've also seen it,

607
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,310
but I'm not. It's not me!

608
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,820
You're not a murderer even if you did it?

609
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,860
Yes. I mean...
This is seriously making me crazy!

610
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,400
Where should I start first?

611
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,220
From the start.

612
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:58,950
Fine.

613
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,220
Let me tell you... Goodness!

614
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,970
It's the first time I've been
framed up as a murderer.

615
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,660
Listen well, okay?

616
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,950
I'm not that type of person who say things twice.

617
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,530
You want me to believe that?

618
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,770
You may find it strange, in your perspective.

619
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,370
Don't you think this place is strange?

620
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:25,620
You're even the first one who lives in this apartment.

621
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,510
It's really strange.

622
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:28,860
Isn't it?

623
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,860
I said so.

624
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,570
This place is totally strange.

625
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,280
Those thieves that came at your house...

626
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,600
They were three of them, right?

627
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,620
Why suddenly talk that here?

628
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,460
We're talking more important...

629
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,420
I saw it.

630
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:42,130
That night.

631
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,370
What did you see?

632
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,730
There were three persons?

633
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:54,970
Why?

634
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,280
What else?

635
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,220
Those three persons who came into my room...

636
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,860
No way. That doesn't make sense.

637
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,480
Why will those persons...?

638
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,400
It's not you.

639
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,400
If it's not me?

640
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,750
What if they were after your younger brother?

641
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,170
That makes more sensible, right?

642
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,550
Your brother had disappeared.

643
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,860
And we've been madly looking for him.

644
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,620
I haven't seen him these days.

645
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,550
I just heard about you.

646
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,020
Have you met your brother?

647
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,020
Get in. Let me take you there.

648
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,750
Then, from the beginning...

649
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,660
Don't you think it's weird
that he's asking for your help?

650
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,750
They've killed my brother...

651
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,750
...and called me here?

652
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:51,640
I'm not sure.

653
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,110
I may be mistaken about it.

654
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,130
Just disregard that...

655
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:55,860
No.

656
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,130
From the way I see it,

657
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,220
that person...

658
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,370
...has no way to know my contact number.

659
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,480
What could they get from someone like me?

660
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,130
But no matter how I think of it,

661
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,730
why need to send me those fake messages?

662
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,370
Why need to go that far?

663
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:18,880
And do it?

664
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,730
What's with those bastards!?

665
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,750
Are there really monsters who hunts people?

666
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,550
Everyone has their own shortcomings.

667
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,240
They got lonely because they got hurt.

668
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,970
They got hurt as they feel lonely.

669
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,660
They are lonely people who lack everything.

670
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,330
If there's no one...

671
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,620
...who can help to improve themselves,

672
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,480
they'll just get stuck and get crazy.

673
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,950
If they are just disregarded, they'll go mad.

674
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,640
What are you saying all of a sudden?

675
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,040
I have liked him.

676
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,370
Everyone here have liked your brother too.

677
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,170
Probably, we may find the root of all these things.

678
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,710
We need to get out from here.

679
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:24,770
There used to be a vent around here.

680
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,170
A vent? Where is that?

681
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:30,730
There.

682
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,620
These figures seem to be phone numbers.

683
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,620
What are these Chinese characters?

684
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,130
We'll know it for once.

685
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,530
Hello?

686
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:07,950
Who the heck are you?

687
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,330
How did you know this contact number?

688
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,620
What did he said?

689
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,910
I don't know. I think he's a Chinese.

690
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,880
It's already late today.

691
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,970
Let's try again tomorrow morning.

692
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,600
Then, we'll decide whether to call the police.

693
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,480
Na Yeon, you can go back.

694
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,950
You have a tough time because of me.

695
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,600
Your brother must be fortunate.

696
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,460
If I were on his shoes,
I'll definitely ran away from here.

697
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,860
I want your brother to get out from here.

698
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:51,330
What's good of having a brother?

699
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,730
He has been following me since his childhood.

700
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,440
He was dependent on me.

701
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,860
But what can I do?

702
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,150
People are really selfish.

703
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,880
Time had already passed,

704
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,620
so I need to forget it.

705
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,350
In an easy way.

706
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:14,020
Am I trash?

707
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:15,600
Yes.

708
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,660
What?

709
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,880
You must definitely find your brother.

710
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,240
He may be hiding somewhere.

711
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,260
He will just be fine, right?

712
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,460
I hope so.

713
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,370
You're not afraid?

714
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:33,820
Me?

715
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,730
I mean.

716
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,530
There are people dying here.

717
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,060
Even the rent is cheap here...

718
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,420
I'm just fine now.

719
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,080
How is his wife now?

720
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,750
How about the wife of the dead husband?

721
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,310
How is she now?

722
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:00,750
She's dead.

723
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,370
She fell from the rooftop.

724
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,130
So that's how it is.

725
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,260
Goodness.

726
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,150
There's nothing normal here.

727
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:17,060
The people who are living here were lonely.

728
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,110
Where is that notebook?

729
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:54,550
The watch...

730
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,640
Is it you? Is it you who killed him?

731
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,240
I said, where is that notebook!?

732
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,550
Where is it!?

733
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,370
Why did you do this to me?

734
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:12,530
Why did you do this to me?

735
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:13,750

- Don't move.

That person had sent us some flowers.

760
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,220
It's pretty.

761
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,260
Goodness. That's a waste. Please!

762
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,240

You want me to believe that?

765
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,860
Why did you let my brother
grow up those flowers?

Why have you grown up those flowers?

00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,280
I was looking for some hope.

- I don't know!
- Han Soo.

It makes sense.

You said it to me before.

That he was likened by all the tenants here.

829
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,680
It's not because they have liked him,

830
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,040
but because they just need him.

831
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,260
So they're desperately looking for it?

832
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,310

01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,400
Why didn't he?

838
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,860
He didn't contact me,
so towards his fiancé too.

878
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,550

Goodness. It feels good.

882
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,950
Don't you think it's weird that he's asking for your help?

883
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,080
It is.

884
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,420
There are people dying here.

885
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:41,570
I'm just fine now.

886

Someone died over there.

887
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:46,550

Where do you think your brother is now?

889
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,080
You must definitely find your brother.

890
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,370
The husband had abused his wife,

891
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,750
so the wife had killed him.

892
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,060
Everyone has their own shortcomings.

893
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:23,460

...who can help to improve themselves,

897
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:35,770
they'll just get stuck and get crazy.

898

It's not me. I'm not the one who did it.

I'm sorry, Han Cheol.

906
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:12,910
I said I don't want it,
but Na Yeon insisted and gave it to me.

907
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:13,970
I mean,

908
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:17,110

909

He came to me.

917
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,750
I said stop this!

918
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,660
Honey, I was wrong.
