Goodness. He'll have a tough time.

193

Why don't you eat?

194

Just eat comfortably.

195
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,140
Can I really eat comfortably?

196

You want to eat in discomfort?

197
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,020
Just eat.

198
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,350
No need to feel embarrassed.

This is Unni's food. Just eat all of these.

You're both blood-related,

No way.

371
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,760
Why?

372
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,640
What's the problem?

373
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,220
Is there a law stipulating that you can't
wear skirt if you're not attractive?

374
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,640
I mean, not that.

375
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,340
Not a skirt,

376
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,300
but can't you just wear ordinary clothes?

377
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,360
Come closer to me.

378
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,460
Listen well.

379
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,240
Did you hold back your poop in the comfort room before?

380
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,220
Pardon?

381
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,420
You see,

382
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,460
if the male and female comfort room
are not shown clearly,

383
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,640
it will create a fuss and cause
both sides to be offended.

384
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,340
People stared at us with their strange eyes,

385
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,060
saying that we are scary.

386
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,580
Goodness!

387
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,380
I find it annoying to wore like this too.

388
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,000
You should look at the mirror before blaming others.

389
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,900
Hey, you punk!

390
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,250
If I just get married, you'll surely faint out!

391
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,240
Did you just sigh?

392
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,920
Not at all.

393
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,580
You clearly did it.

394
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,300
No.

395
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,440
Where's that injured leg of yours?

396
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,260
Let me stomp over that!

397
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,320
And see how precious your legs are.

398
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,460
He's a lunatic.

399
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,100
Please!

400
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,260
Gosh. You startled me!

401
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,040
Goodness. That startled me!

402
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,080
Hey!

403
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,540
Come over here.

404
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,060
You don't know how to knock?

405
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,140
How come you still haven't fixed the comfort room?

406
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,800
You...

407
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,200
You'll really leave after having 5 million won?

408
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,220
Yes.

409
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,640
What are you going to do with it?

410
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,920
I'll pay it for the house's security deposit where we live.

411
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,610
What a load of crap.

412
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,060
He had gave birth to a filial son.

413
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,130
He really did.

414
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,820
Then,

415
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,980
why you haven't got any contact from my Dad?

416
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,440
Have a seat.

417
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,600
Your Dad...

418
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,180
...drove me out when I was 17 years old,

419
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,360
and when my mother's house
was burned, I disappeared.

420
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,460
I stayed in bed for a long time back then.

421
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,900
Goodness. Reminiscing those days that I've suffered,

422
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,240
do you think he will contact me?

423
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,120
He can't even be compared to the outsiders.

424
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,960
But,

425
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,280
do you look like your father?

426
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,980
What?

427
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,160
What did you say, punk!?

428
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,180
I can't really talk properly with him!

429
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,680
Oh my!

430
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,660
Didn't you pay all your mother's surgery fees?

431
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,060
If you have no money, you can come back.

432
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,240
I don't want to.

433
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,420
I'm going to get married right away.

434
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,330
That's up to you.

435
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,860
You guys.

436
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,170
When there are no customers,

437
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,370
you should clean up the tables.

438
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,180
Thank you.

439
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,470
Hey you,

440
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,980
I told you to take some yoga sessions,
but where did you use it?

441
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,900
You've spend it all?

442
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,850
How can you come to work every day?

443
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,920
What's the point?

444
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,940
My fans are looking for me.
How can I not come?

445
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,100
Here.

446
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,840
Forget it.

447
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,810
All right.

448
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,940
You guys.

449
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,280
Know that he's a kitchen slave,

450
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,960
so never let him get out to the hall.

451
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,410
He is not a gay, so don't bother with him.

452
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,800
Huh?

453
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,760
Or he may be.

454
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,810
I even hate those persons like him.

455
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,280
I guess he looks like that.

456
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,430
Just wash the dishes for two hours.

457
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,020
I'll give you your pay.

458
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,280
But you must not come out to the hall.

459
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,380
Even breathing near there, or else I'll fire you.

460
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,120
If I can't contact you after long,

461
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,040
you have to get out of my house.

462
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,500
2 hours, my foot!

463
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,880
Hey, you're mocking the glasses over there.

464
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,070
I'll deduct it from your salary.

465
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,560
Abolish is "pyeji-hada".

I haven't thought of apples become like this.

468

I peeled those well.

Oh, you did well.

What the heck is this?

473

Recently, we are recruiting security team for the civilians.

My apologies.

Well, you see, Miss.

477
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:55,560
I found out that you've joined a security team before.

478
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,760
Sir, you've worked hard.

479
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,340
No way.

480
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,100
But you see,

481
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,660
there are children and teenagers among 1,200 residents.

482
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,780
There are many women from those, you know that?

483
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,170
Those persons often complains
that it's inconvenient for them,

484
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,720
and they can't personally say anything to you.

485
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,780
But it you could be a bit decent,
I will be grateful for that.

486
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,280
Yes. I undestood.

I don't want you to settle it with talks.

489
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,260
I didn't really want to say this to you.

491

what about the children here?

Don't butt in.

Promiscuous?

497
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,940
Is it fine to talk nonsense in someone else's house?

Why are you too much interested?

I'll shake your heart.

553
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:34,580
More and more, fall in love.

554
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,440
Let's take a photo.

555
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,370
I'm taking now.

556
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,540
One, two, three.

557
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,650
In front of you, I bboom bboom.

558
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,610
I'll give you bboom bboom, bboom bboom, ow!
(Yeah, bboom bboom)

559
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,360
I've been well, Dad.

560
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,220
Uncle gave me work and I was able to save money.

561
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,740
Hurry and come pick me up.

562
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,860
Hey!

563
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,560
This kid, seriously.

564
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,960
How can you come in wearing a school uniform?

565
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,520
I'll be here for an hour before the business opens.

566
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,640
Not even at the comfort room.

567
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,400
You'll come back right away?

568
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,300
Have you eaten?

569
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,020
I'll go back later.

570
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,300
Hello.

571
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,860
We're going to open at 7:00 p.m.

572
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,160
Oh?

573
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,980
Where is the owner named Oh Doo Il here?

574
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,900
Oh Sung Il entrusted him to you.

575
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,220
We heard that his son, Oh Joon Ho, is working here.

576
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,380
If the authorities found out
that a minor works at a bar,

577
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,320
your business permit will be revoked, know that?

578
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,680
What are they?

579
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,080
Hyung.

580
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,780
Who?

581
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,900
Me?

582
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,380
Of course, we should this his younger brother well.

583
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,200
Hang on.

584
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,900
Noona.

585
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,880
It's making me confused.

586
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,040
They are really harsh.

587
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,640
You see it here, right?

588
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,900
That young boy was working on his uncle's place.

589
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:38,860
Hyung.

590
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,020
I can tell the police and be rewarded,

591
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,520
but I just overlooked it and came here.

592
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,520
Oh Sung Il...

593
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,040
...has used more people's money than what I imagined.

594
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:57,380
At this time, the family must help
pay what its member has owed.

595
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,120
Hyung.

596
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,780
Please lend me the phone.

597
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,740
Hyung!

598
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,860
How dare you come and make mess? Damn you!

599
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,440
Na Bi, you step on it.,

600
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,020
No way. Don't step over it!

601
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,780
I've just changed my mobile phone!

602
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,570
If I'm afraid of you guys,

603
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,980
do you think I will be able to step over this?

604
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,680
Hyung, I don't want to do anything nor hit you,

605
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,320
but why are you just fooling around with us!?

606
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,060
If you're like this at Audrey's bar,
your tongue will surely get cut off.

607
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,840
If you have seen me when I was still a man,

608
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,340
I would have already flipped you over, bastards.

609
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,360
Then, let's settle it man to man.

610
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,020
The more I see this, it's getting worse.

611
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,960
You're not even that pleasant!

612
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,360
Then, don't look at me and get out!

613
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,200
You just came in and said those shit.

614
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,160
Why? Want me to poke out your eyeballs?

615
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,320
You're waiting for that?

616
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,240
Get lost, you bastards!

617
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,500
Goodness! This Noona, seriously!

618
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,660
Talking won't work with her!

619
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,960
Joon Ho.

620
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,120
Are you okay, Joon Ho!?

621
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,760
Why come here and ask for Dad's money?

622
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,090
They are not related to that!

623
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,400
What's with him?

624
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,100
Who are you?

625
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,880
Oh, so you're his son, Joon Ho.

626
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,720
You guys are one family, so why it doesn't matter?

627
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,800
What's wrong with you?

628
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,200
How dare you talk like that in front of elders?

629
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,360
That gaze in your eyes. You're being arrogant.

630
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,420
Shall I teach you a lesson?

631
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,920
Joon Ho is important to us.

632
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,160
Just have a fight with me.

633
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,960
I'm a woman who has a
third-degree belt in taekwondo, bastards!

634
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
Get off!

635
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,180
You must be crazy!

636
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,530
Have a taste of my kick!

637
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,430
Get off, you brat!

638
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,960
Gosh, it hurts.

639
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,820
What will you do if your face got wounded?

640
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,500
Oh Sung Il, that person!

641
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,120
He's not a big help for my life.

642
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,700
I'm really sorry.

643
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,460
Why would you?

644
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,140
I just wanted to apologize.

645
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,890
The more one has nothing like you,

646
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,620
the less you can apologize at your own will.

647
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,340
And besides,

648
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,260
what if they all hurt your head totally, huh?

649
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,940
No one will believe in you.

650
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,720
And you.

651
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,380
I said that if you come out of the hall, you'll get fired.

652
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,640
You're not even a black knight, so why got beaten?

653
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,900
Why did you come out?

654
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,420
Don't come to work tomorrow.

655
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,360
I will find other job for you.

656
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,360
Yes.

657
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,630
Oh my gosh.

658
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,340
It became like this.

659
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,160
Shall I let my cheekbones get removed?

660
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,360
Oh my!

661
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,900
Why are you laughing, you little kid?

662
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,660
You're annoying me.

663
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,400
She is full of love too just like Audrey Hepburn.

664
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,180
When I open the bar,

665
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,000
if I wear these lovely and bright clothes, it will be great.

666
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,820
Don't come to work tomorrow.

667
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,840
I will find other job for you.

668
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,360
Have you eaten?

669
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,570
Yes.

670
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,020
Oh my, what to do?

671
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,480
He has a great vision.

672
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,180
That's beautiful. Let me take a picture.

673
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,660
One, two, three.

674
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,250
You're really going to get married.

675
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,120
Did he got hooked with you?

676
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,200
It's me who got hooked from him.

677
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,460
Oh my.

678
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,000
You're terrific. You're really amazing.

679
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,530
One, two, three.

680
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,620
Take a photo of us.

681
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,500
Okay.

682
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,980
One, two, three.

683
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:43,980
Hang on.

684
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,940
Why didn't Joon Ho went out with us?

685
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,000
He must be afraid that a fascinating
woman will get married.

686
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,200
[ Oh Joon Ho ]

687
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,380
Oh my.

688
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,300
Hey.

689
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,820
He's ignoring my calls.

690
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,800
Just leave him. Let him have fun too.

691
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,260
It's even awkward for a
17-year-old boy to stay here.

692
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,220
Unni, be in the front.

693
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:16,960
Really?

694
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,160
- Let's take a picture together.
- What to do? It's too bright.

695
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,900
Okay. I'll do it now.

696
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,920
One, two, three.

697
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,080
One more.

698
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,240
Hello.

699
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,920
There are rooms here where cards are played?

700
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,920
What?

701
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,860
Last time, he prepared himself
to play with go-stop here.

702
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,080
But I can't find him anymore.

703
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,100
When are they going to open?

704
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:41,920
What are you?

705
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,120
I just need to look for my Dad.

706
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,280
He's Oh Sung Il.

707
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,320
Excuse me!

708
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,260
What's wrong?

709
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,380
I'm not here to play cards.
I just need to find my Dad.

710
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,280
He's not here.

711
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,180
If you just roam around here,

712
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,540
I'll report you to the police.

713
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,240
This is making me crazy.

714
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,380
Goodness.

715
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,840
Shall we try hitting his head lightly?

716
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,100
Why?

717
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,800
Are you ready to get harmed?

718
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,920
It doesn't even matter if we're alone.

719
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,520
I specially want to see you.

720
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:03,610
Hey.

721
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,860
I heard you deliberately want to get beaten to be compensated.

722
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,960
What shit are you talking about?

723
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,420
Joon Ho, please stop hitting me.

724
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,580
Please forgive me once.

725
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,960
Don't hit me. It's my fault, Joon Ho.

726
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,830
Have you gone nuts?

727
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,120
What are you doing?

728
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,880
To seek for justice.

729
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,160
What are you doing?

730
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,920
Joon Ho! Don't do this!

731
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,140
Joon Ho.

732
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,520
Joon Ho.

733
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,340

He won't answer.

742

I told you we can't find him.

743

We don't know where he wandered around.

Gosh. What should I do?

For the meantime, Joon Ho,
if your guardian won't come,

757
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,520
you have to wait here.

758

Nice to meet you.

physical violence last time.

782

Do you think I will be grateful for this?

783
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,880
I said I didn't fight with them.

You threatened them that you'll hurt yourself?

785

That's why, you deliberately provoke
others and take their money?

790
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,020
So by hurting your body,
you'll take other people's money?

791
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,660
Why?

792
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,120
Is your dream to be a bad guy?

793
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,700
Do you think I have to rely on others forever?

794
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,280
Do you even understand my existence?

795
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,760
There's no one on my side.
