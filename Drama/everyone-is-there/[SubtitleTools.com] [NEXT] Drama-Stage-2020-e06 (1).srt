00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,750
When I saw my wife for the first time,

2
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,770
she was like Kim Hee Sun.

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,500
She was charmingly pure and alluring.

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,220
Not only she has dark and long hair,

5
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,080
but she has a fair skin too.

6
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,680
Honestly, I'm a fan of Kim Hee Sun.

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,360
But she's more beautiful than her.

8
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,830
Excuse me...

9
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,120
Are you Choi So Hae?

10
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,340
Goodness.

11
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,400
It's so bright.

12
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,580
It was already ten years ago.

13
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,950
Everyone goes through a burnout period,

14
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,150
and actually, that's because of problems they faced.

15
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,640
The problems they faced?

16
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,830
Jin Mook.

17
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,310
Did your wife changed compared from ten years ago?

18
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,460
No.

19
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,530
You said she's not much different from ten years ago,

20
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,260
but Jin Mook, you must have felt tired of it now.

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,310
If that's the case, whose problem is that?

22
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,070
Is it because your eyeglasses were too familiar to her?

23
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,840
Or is it because your wife hasn't changed at all?

24
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,970
Then, what should I do?

25
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,560
You need to exert effort.

26
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,200
But how?

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,050
Talking about one's own matter could be difficult,

29
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,060
especially between those modern
people who lack communication.

30
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,220
My role is to only listen to someone.

31

Not to judge you.

32
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,730

Indeed.

you just have fun playing games.

150

Playing games all the time is not that fun.

151
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,930
I'm just saying playing too much of those is not good.

152
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,620
Honestly, there are many advantages in playing games.

153
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,340
A moderate amount of playing
games improves brain activity.

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,420
You can also move your fingers.

155
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,110
It also improves your creativity,

156
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,510
it stimulates your nerve cells.

157
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,170
I mean...

The first beautiful woman in our country.

180
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,730
I heard that on bars,

181
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,020
they used her name as the stage name.

182
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,530
How did you know that?

...has Kim Hee Sun too.

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,600
if that's the case,

188
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,010
would it just be fine?

189
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,730
What?

190
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,770
I mean,

191
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,860
they have always been very nice to guests,

192
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,240
so they won't really attempt to cheat.

193
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,170
At best, they just want to get some air.

194
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,930
You wench, seriously!

195
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,770
Why!?

196
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,150
I cheated!

197
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,900
Hey, why are you like that?

198
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,660
Have you ever seen someone like this from the start?

199
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,530
It all starts from cheating,

200
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,570
then one eventually disappears
and left his or her children.

201
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,710
It's like that.

202
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,450
Pull yourself together, wench!

203
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,060
If not because of Hwan Hee,
I should have already divorced with him.

204
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,600
Having a marriage life without trust...

205
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,040
...is just meaningless like an empty shell.

206
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,250
Then...

207
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,640
I only have two options.

208
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,000
Whether secretly prepare for another marriage after divorce,

209
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,150
or else,

210
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,730
I'm going to cheat on him.

211
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,200
Both will just make your family get shattered.

212
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,310
Not at all.

213
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,980
I'll cheat in order to protect my family.

214
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,170
Those are my only two options.

215
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,840
Jin Mook,

216
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,310
Talking about one's own matter could be difficult,

217
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,640
especially between those modern
people who lack communication.

218
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,660
My role is to only listen to someone.

219
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,440
It's just fine,

220
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,620
so feel free to speak.

221
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,130
My wife...

222
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,640
...has another man.

223
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,420
My wife...

224
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,280
...has another man.

225
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,800
Every day with you...

226
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,850
It's your birthday, for me.

227
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,680
You could have just bought some meat.

228
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,620
She was quite embarrassed about it.

229
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,570
It was good from the start.

230
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,420
But why?

231
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,310
Wow! Almost all are side dishes.

232
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,770
Let's eat dishes with vegetables together
so we can maintain our health.

233
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,270
What are you doing?

234
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,130
She suddenly started to lose her temper.

235
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,940
What did I said?

236
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,540
What do you call a person who's lying?

237
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,670
A bad person.

238
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,600
Did you really just wanted to play games on my phone?

239
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,250
Mom told me not to say it.

240
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,500
Your wife is addicted on playing games?

241
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,220
Not that.

242
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,510
When I was dating her,

243
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,200
if I mention a character of the game,

244
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,700
her expression suddenly changes.

245
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,240
Anyways,

246
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,930
my brain gets drained out...

247
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,930
...trying to look for a desirable reason.

248
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,130
Dad, please help me in my English homework.

249
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,200
Well...

250
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,010
Just ask your Mom for help.

251
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,980
She said she has headache
and told me to go to you.

252
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,330
My head is in more pain than her.

253
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
Just go and ask your Mom for help.

254
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,000
Got it?

255
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,750
Do something else first.

256
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,620
The only reason to let time pass by...

257
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,710
...is that I, who dominates everyone's eyes,
am called by the world.

258
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,050
It's a man's intuition.

259
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,940
It has always been accurate.

260
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,970
She's cheating on me, right?

261
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,290
Right.

262
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,510
It's exactly the same as my wife did.

263
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,260
Have you unlocked your wife's phone screen?

264
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,800
No.

265
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,710
Then, after you head home now,

266
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,020
don't do other things.

267
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,200
Try decoding your wife's phone password.

268
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,750
If you have unlocked the screen,

269
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,910
then you'll be certain.

270
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,940
That will be certain.

271
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,820
But what if her phone's screen is locked?

272
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,700
You have to unlock it.

273
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,370
No matter what, you must have to get proof.

274
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,550
Let's try it until the end.

275
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,850
First of all...

276
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,200
0000.

277
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,960
0000.

278
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,460
0000?

279
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,320
[ Lee Dong Sung ]
I have fun today. I'll see you next time.

280
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,510
Hey, keep your heads up. Okay?

281
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,290
The start goes right now.

282
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,960
I'm not craving for it now.

283
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,080
Look at you.

284
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,230
You have to hold on with the alcohol's power.

285
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,500
You can't do anything without this.

286
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,250
I hold on with this too.

287
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,380
You must definitely drink. It's all right.

288
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,700
How can I drink at this situation?

289
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,810
Auntie.

290
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,310
Please give us a bottle of soju.

291
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,220
Coming.

292
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,170
But,

293
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,270
you see, there's something I'm curious about.

294
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,130
women can tolerate men's cheating,

295
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,130
so men must definitely endure women's cheating too.

296
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,880
My Grandpa was also like that.

297
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,180
My Grandma did it.

298
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,660
An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.

299
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,640
So you mean...

300
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,090
You're going to cheat on her too?

301
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,880
You?

302
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,200
What are you doing?

303
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,080
You're already awake?

304
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,710
You're making me confused.

305
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,460
Huh?

306
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,520
Shall I send you to the kindergarten today?

307
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,610
Wait a second. You have to write XX here.

308
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,200
What else can I do in this situation?

309
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,460
I still need to exert more effort.
For goodness sake.

310
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,880
There are some things that cannot be achieved, punk.

311
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,930
What are you talking about?

312
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,080
There are three things that
you can't restrain yourself from doing it.

313
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
You can't do it, no matter what.

314
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,040
First,

315
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,170
holding back your shit.

316
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,260
Second, watching porn.

317
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,460
Third,

318
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,600
restore the broken relationship
between a husband and wife.

319
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,060
You can never cope up from those.

320
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,530
Then, what do you want me to do?

321
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,350
You want me...

322
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,170
...to get a divorce?

323
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,910
You have to take a strong medicine.

324
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,260
A strong medicine?

325
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,080
What do you mean?

326
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,240
You startled me.

327
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,150
You're late.

328
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,080
Why not take a seat?

329
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,750
It's just.

330
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,910
What did you do?

331
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,040
I watched a movie.

332
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,020
I wanted to ask whom she have met with,

333
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,950
but I couldn't dare to say it.

334
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,730
My pride could get hurt.

335
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,010
Starting next month,

336
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,510
let's use our own money for the expenses.

337
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,110
What?

338
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,880
I said to use our own money.

339
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,680
I mean, what are you talking about?

340
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,550
I said that I'll manage our finances from now on.

341
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,680
As you wish.

342
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,900
Even if you want to have a divorce.

343
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,110
Divorce?

344
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,580
If not because of Hwan Hee,
I should have already divorced with her.

345
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,370
Having a marriage life without trust...

346
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,330
...is just meaningless like an empty shell.

347
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,660
Then, what are you going to do?

348
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,170
I only have two options.

349
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,330
Whether I'll manage our finances,

350
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,020
or just let those to be wasted.

351
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,460
Both will just make your family get shattered.

352
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,400
Not at all.

353
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,970
If I were in charge of the finances,

354
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,530
it's most likely that I'll be able to protect my family.

355
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,930
I have to have money in order to cheat.

356
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,050
Those are my only two options.

357
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,950
I became hesitant.

358
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,910
Thinking that I really wanted to cheat...

359
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,710
...so I have to protect my family...

360
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,930
...is just making me worried that it will hurt me.

361
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll feel shameless to see my daughter Hwan Hee.

362
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,000
It's not an easy matter, indeed.

363
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,800
Someone within the family is cheating.

364
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,260
I realized I want to bury it in my heart,

365
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,690
but I felt getting so angry again.

366
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,640
I kept picturing out my husband and Kim Hee Sun...

367
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,580
...having a good time together.

368
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,530
But still,

369
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,220
you want to protect your family.

370
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,740
But,

371
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,550
this person just keep adding fuel to the fire.

372
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,820
Just go and ask your Mom for help.

373
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,930
Do something else first.

374
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,530
The only reason to let time pass by...

375
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,860
...is that I, who dominates everyone's eyes,
am called by the world.

376
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
In the end,

377
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,680
I followed my friend on a meet-up.

378
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,180
She is my friend, Chae So Hee.

379
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,400
She is a single mom for almost a year.

380
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,640
That's why, she came here
to be in a relationship with someone.

381
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,800
Say hello to them.

382
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,040
Nice to meet you all.

383
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,600
Welcome.

384
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,550
Oh, Hwan Hee.

385
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,860
I guess I'll go home late.

386
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,020
Just ask your Dad to buy delicious foods for you.

387
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,280
Okay. I got it.

388
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,150
I'm sorry.

389
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,930
Your phone is very old.

390
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,760
I didn't expect to see it from someone right now.

391
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,260
Nice to meet you.

392
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,910
Pardon?

393
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,250
He was a pretty good-looking man.

394
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,530
We had nice conversations.

395
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,040
He majored in Western arts.

396
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,770
I felt that he has a profound insight too.

397
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,770
And...

398
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,150
And what?

399
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,200
He attentively listened to what I have said.

400
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,310
I like paintings with many eaves.

401
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,000
Have you been to Karat?

402
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,840
No.

403
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,290
The scenery there is like this.

404
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,280
Please wait a minute.

405
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,710
I just coincidentally gave you this.

406
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,680
You don't really have to do this.

407
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,440
Goodness.

408
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,080
I don't know what to say. It's weird.

409
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,550
You should really want to see her.

410
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,820
I really want to.

411
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,420
I have fun today.

412
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,580
Well, So Hee.

413
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,420
You see...

414
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,770
She will return to Korea next month,

415
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,240
want to see her together with me?

416
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,350
Pardon?

417
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,200
Her name is Hwan Hee, right?

418
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,570
It would be great if she joins with us.

419
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,370
Both of you have daughter.
You're both related in many aspects.

420
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,810
You liked the same book too.

421
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,170
Do you feel discomfort somewhere?

422
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,640
My heart trembled.

423
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,950
I mean, but you know what,

424
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,530
when I thought of Hwan Hee,
I suddenly woke up from my senses.

425
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,660
I wanted to protect my family,

426
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,110
not the one who'll broke it.

427
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,820
so I hoped that my husband could unlock it as soon as possible,

428
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,260
with my phone's password, 0000.

429
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,530
I hoped that he will pull himself together...

430
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,080
...and that he will change.

431
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,120
So, did he changed?

432
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,240
I guess so.

433
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,260
He started doing things that
he never done for the family before.

434
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,510
Even if you knew that he's cheating,

435
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,660
he has already made plans ahead.

436
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,480
He seems to be cheating on me.

437
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,970
He never mentioned about that matter?

438
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:19,860
Yes.

439
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,000
You're not even angry about it?

440
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,860
Yes.

441
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,400
You must totally became indifferent.

442
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,620
You think so?

443
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,400
Yes.

444
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,170
[ You damn bastard ]

445
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,570
Do you think he'll get better and change himself?

446
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,910
If he wants to become better,

447
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,110
he must be totally honest with me.

448
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,950
My husband really likes her.

449
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,110
He must have totally fell in love with Kim Hee Sun.

450
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,950
But he felt sorry towards me.

451
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,860
That's why, he did the household chores.

452
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,420
Yes, sir.

453
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,170
At the pub on the intersection?

454
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,680
I'll go there right away.

455
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
Yes. Okay, sir.

456
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,400
My boss said that he was near on our place.

457
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,710
Hwan Hee, I'll go out for a moment.

458
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,320
Okay, Dad.

459
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,820
It's all because of her.

460
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,400
Kim Hee Sun.

461
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,660
You're so mean.

462
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,860
Kim Hee Sun.

463
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,040
I heard of a young woman's voice.

464
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,260
My intuition tells me.

465
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,420
That it was her daughter.

466
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,530
Kim Hee Sun could be a single mother.

467
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,370
Or she could be divorced.

468
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,350
No.

469
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,220
It's a woman's intuition.

470
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,310
That bad woman must have a daughter.

471
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,400
Oh, I beg your pardon.

472
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,820
I'm certain.

473
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,530
It must be that bad woman's daughter.

474
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,020
That couldn't be the case.

475
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,500
I mean, how could you just conclude it
based on your intuition?

476
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,820
The more you start thinking pessimistically,

477
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,340
you'll be able to do do nothing.

478
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,130
Well, I was just...

479
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,240
Just have a positive thinking.

480
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,910
For Hwan Hee's sake.

481
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,150
Honestly speaking,

482
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,650
there are no men who don't cheat
on their wife these days.

483
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,570
Just be more understanding.

484
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,040
You'll feel more at ease.

485
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,460
You're a bit strange.

486
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,020
Was it obvious?

487
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,350
I mean...

488
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,480
To tell you the truth,

489
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,510
I have reconciled with Chul Min's father.

490
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,480
You startled me.

491
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,460
You're late today.

492
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,330
That day, I felt something different.

493
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,290
What did you do?

494
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,810
Looks that he would like to ask
about the man I've met before.

495
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,810
I watched a movie.

496
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,040
I felt that I was right.

497
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,880
Let's tell the truth...

498
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,090
...and ask for the truth.

499
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,680
But...

500
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,200
Starting next month,
let's use our own money for the expenses.

501
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,220
What?

502
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,000
I said to use our own money.

503
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,840
What are you talking about?

504
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,660
I said that I'll manage our finances from now on.

505
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,600
I was dumbfounded.

506
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,860
Unsatisfied from cheating on me,

507
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,660
so he wanted me to use our own money.

508
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,620
As you wish.

509
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,480
Even if you want to have a divorce.

510
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,570
Divorce?

511
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,460
I have doubted him.

512
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,400
Use this.

513
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,110
No. Let me pay for it.

514
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,620
No way.

515
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,550
It's me who asked first to watch a movie.

516
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,240
Please just use this.

517
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,950
Dear customer, your credit card is over the limit.

518
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,780
I see.

519
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,810
Please use this.

520
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,680
This card has been deactivated.

521
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,730
Oh, you can just use this.

522
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,550
Compared to my tough life after getting married,

523
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,770
I'm in favor of living comfortably.

524
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,280
What is she saying!?

525
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,620
You have to live well.

526
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,150
Get up.

527
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,660
Just tell it right away.

528
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,520
Get up!

529
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,280
Speak out.

530
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,410
What are you doing?

531
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,340
Didn't I told you?

532
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,080
I said that I'll manage our finances from now on.

533
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,250
I said it too.

534
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,450
That I'll divorce you.

535
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,000
So what?

536
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,240
What?

537
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,140
So what do you want to say?

538
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,860
Let's divorce.

539
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,730
Fine. Let's do that.

540
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,130
I have tried my best to not to go beyond that,

541
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,680
but in the end, that's what happened.

542
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,650
A person's effort could be at its limits.

543
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,680
Thank you for all this time.

544
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,060
Then, when are you going to do it?

545
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,330
He said that we'll go to the court next Monday.

546
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,840
It's...

547
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,530
...really over now.

548
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,160
Want me to prescribe you medicine?

549
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,350
It's okay.

550
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,840
I can manage myself.

551
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,720
So Hee.

552
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,140
For the last time,

553
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,900
how about talking with him sincerely?

554
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Your husband must be in a situation.

555
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,340
Maybe,

556
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,350
there could be...

557
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,080
...a thick wall that's between us.

558
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,000
It could have started long...

559
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,960
...before this happened.

560
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,570
Dear Kim Hee Sun Unni...

561
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,740
Aunt?

562
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,020
No, it's Unni.

563
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,040
Hello.

564
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:57,280
I'm Kim Hwan Hee, a 7 year-old girl living in Paju.

565
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,080
There's something I would like to say to you,

566
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,440
so I am writing this letter.

567
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,930
My father's name is Kim Jin Mook.

568
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:12,280
Because of a woman, my parents got in a quarrel often.

569
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,020
It's all because of her.

570
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,690
Kim Hee Sun.

571
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,730
You're so mean.

572
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,220
My mom had badmouthed you.

573
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,570
[ Greek and Roman Mythology ]

574
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:39,150
Because of Zeus's adultery, Hera was totally vexed,

575
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:43,750
to the point of her being called the goddess of jealousy.

576
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,820
The fight between my parents has evolved into a battle.

577
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,440
And also...

578
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,220
Say it.

579
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,410
What are you doing?

580
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,150
I said that I'll manage our finances from now on.

581
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,780
I said it too. That I'll divorce you.

582
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,170
So what do you want to say?

583
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,180
Let's divorce.

584
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,300
Fine. Let's do that.

585
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,780
Divorce, huh.

586
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:13,550
The saddest moment in my life
is when my parents have divorced.

587
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,020
Why do you find it the saddest moment?

588
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,980
Between my mother and father,

589
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,010
I have to choose one of them.

590
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,080
I can't sleep well day by day.

591
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,340
I'm a fan of yours.

592
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,370
Please break up with my Dad.

593
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,400
Thank you.

594
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,760
By the way.

595
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,000
And besides, you are really beautiful.

596
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,530
Why?

597
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,560
You're anticipating a letter from someone?

598
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,370
Yes.

599
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:08,860
Really?

600
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,730
Which room number do you live?

601
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,370
I live in Room 503.

602
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,720
Wait a second.

603
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,170
Goodness. What to do?

604
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,860
There's nothing for Room 503.

605
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,280
Have a good day.

606
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,620
Okay.

607
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,700
Mom.

608
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,020
You're up?

609
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,930
Yes.

610
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,520
Hwan Hee.

611
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,760
I'll leave you first to your Grandma
early tomorrow morning.

612
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:18,100
Can you stay with her just for few days?

613
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,550
Why?

614
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,680
Me and your dad has something to do.

615
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,040
What is that?

616
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,130
I'm really sorry.

617
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,370
I'm sorry.

618
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,820
Yes, mother.

619
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,930
You can just come here right away.

620
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,640
Okay.

621
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,930
They are almost here.

622
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,440
Hwan Hee, are you ready?

623
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,600
That's why,

624
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,570
because of Kim Hee Sun,
your parents are going to have a divorce,

625
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,980
thus, you're looking for her.

626
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,110
Yes.

627
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,040
They'll really have a divorce because of her?

628
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,350
Yes.

629
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:47,170
So Uncle, can you please keep this a secret?

630
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:55,200
How do you know where Kim Hee Sun usually goes?

631
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,660
[ Kim Hee Sun ]

632
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:15,820
[ Taxi fare, 58,000 won ]

633
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,200
We're here.

634
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,350
When I searched online,

635
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:31,930
I found out that the taxi fare from
Paju to Gangnam is 58,000 won,

636
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:37,400
but I just exactly have 57,800 won right now.

637
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,260
What can I do?

638
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,020
Pardon?

639
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,320
You don't have to pay me.

640
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,400
Uncle, you have to make money too.

641
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,980
It's not good to hear that
our economy is in a bad state.

642
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,200
But instead,

643
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,040
be sure to stop your parents from having a divorce.

644
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:57,420
Promise me.

645
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,000
All right.

646
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,150
Thank you so much.

647
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,180
Okay.

648
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,400
Where are you going?

649
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:37,180
I want to meet Kim Hee Sun.

650
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:38,930
You made an appointment with her?

651
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,000
No.

652
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,170
You came here without it and alone?

653
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,040
Yes.

654
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:47,770
I thought there's something
going on with my dad and her.

655
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,060
Wait a second.

656
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,840
Yes. There's someone who's looking for Kim Hee Sun.

657
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,130
Yes.

658
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:03,260
I see. She's just a kid.

659
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,330
Okay.

660
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,420
What to do?

661
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,610
She's not in the office right now.

662
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,860
When will she be here?

663
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,880
I'm not sure.

664
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,280
She may be at her home.

665
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:16,660
Her home?

666
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,080
Any place you know where she probably goes?

667
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,570
No.

668
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,660
I tried contacting her, but there's no answer.

669
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,960
Have you tried contacting Ji Hyo's family?

670
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,080
Yes, but they said they haven't met her.

671
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,620
By chance, did you find something strange with your child?

672
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:33,020
Why a young child like her fled out?

673
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,660
There's nothing really serious.

674
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,400

Yes.

00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:54,950
Yes.

680
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,310
But where is Seongbuk-dong?

681
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,680
Why?

682
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,330
Want to eat some dumplings?

683
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:56,040
Well, not at all.

684
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,380
But which way shall I go to Seongbuk-dong?

685
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:03,750
Seongbuk-dong?

686
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,040

689
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,080

694
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,680

But,

702
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,850
did she really looked for Kim Hee Sun, right?

703
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,480
Why ask if you know that?

704
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,820
You know it?

705
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,310
You keep calling her name every day,

706
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,530
even in actual.

707
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,910
What do you mean in actual?

708
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,970
You've cheated with her!

709
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,080
What?

710
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,170
Stop pretending.

00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:04,400

714
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,950
You just looked at the name,
not on the phone number, didn't you?

715
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,020
What?

716
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,800
It's your phone number.

717
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,280
I said it's yours.

718

You've been doing your best,

719
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,260
so I changed your contact name into Kim Hee Sun.

720
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,170
This is from a famous American psychiatrist
and psychologist named Wilton Erikson...

and when Kim Hee Sun's name popped up,

727
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,240
you will think about her and your wife at the same time.

728
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,600
Even if you don't call and
already got used to hearing it,

729
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,330
just when it comes up,

730
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,730

So are you cheating on me?

742
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,720
You've gone out with that jerk Lee Dong Sung!

743
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,220
How could I cheat on you?

744
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,130
I've been doing my best for my daughter.

745
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,170
Anyways, you have met with him.

746
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:19,200
Right. We have met.

747
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,110
But,

748
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,760
nothing happened.

749
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,580
How could I believe you?

750
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,750
Try to think of it.

751
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,220
if I have cheated on you,

752
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,110
do you think I'll save my phone password as 0000!?

753
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,570
It's really Kim Hee Sun.

754
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,440
Thank you so much.

755
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,570
I'm truly grateful. I don't know to repay you.

756
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,170
I'm truly grateful.

757
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,160
Hwan Hee has worried a lot.

758
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:58,280
That you two will have to have a divorce because of me.

759
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,560
There's really nothing on between the two of you?

760
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,400
That's right.

761
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,460
You're serious, aren't you?

762
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:54,460
There's really nothing going on with us.

763
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,720
I have promised to Hwan Hee.

764
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,260
Shall we have some wine?

765
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,420
Well, if you want to.

766
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,530
So you were not really in a relationship.
For goodness sake!

767
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,410
You were not in a relationship at all.

768
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:44,420
Thank you so much, Kim Hee Sun Unni.

769
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,860
[ Kim Hee Sun ]

770
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,930

771
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:58,880
