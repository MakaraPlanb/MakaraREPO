How could you say that towards me?

Yesterday, I watched it on a cable channel.

The amount of tears that people
can shed in their lifetime...

173

So what?

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,170
if it's 70 liters,

177
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,060
I guess it's just about this much.

it'll overflow the Han River?

you've used after taking out your shit.

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,440
I see.

189
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,880
Who's paying it?

190
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,440
It costs 32,500 won.

191
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,020
Please use this.

192
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,820
Yes.

193
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,040
Thank you.

194
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,710
It's really delicious.

195
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,820
It's just one person, but the expenses have tripled.

196
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,370
I can eat as much as I can.

197
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,000
It's been already a long time.

198
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Shouldn't you live for a new life?

199
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,420
I can't do that. I have to pay for rent then.

200
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,620
Recently, the real estate market is not good.

201
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,350
What?

202
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,600
Why? What's wrong?

203
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,730
It's nothing.

204
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,800
Hey!

205
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,510
Why? What's wrong!?

206
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,440
Come back here!

207
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,820
Tell me.

208
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,130
About what?

209
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,220
Why you still want to live there
even Yi Na is already gone?

210
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,710
Before I beat you up, just tell me.

211
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,110
You won't really beat me, right?

212
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,970
Right.

213
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,910
You know, dad.

214
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,510
Yes.

215
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,280
I do suffer from insomnia.

216
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,860
That's the true reason.

217
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,150
Okay.

218
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,510
Whether I get out and live alone,

219
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,640
or go back to my parent's house,

220
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,130
they will probably just ask me to get married again.

221
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,970
As what you know, I'm the eldest in the family.

222
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,110
I was married and there will be nothing left for them,

223
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,880
so they have became conservative too.

224
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,420
They still have special attachment from my marriage.

225
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,910
Pardon me. I don't really want to say this.

226
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,930
Of course.

227
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,080
You have to get married again.

228
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
You are already 29 years old now.

229
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,330
What?

230
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,110
You mean, I have to get married again?

231
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,130
I don't want to.

232
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:43,800
What!?

233
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,750
I mean, why are you flaring up?

234
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,550
What are you?!

235
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,730
Why won't you get married again?! Huh?

236
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,260
Is that what you should say at this moment!?

237
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,220
This stupid punk!

238
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,480
Of course, I can just call you uncle! Uncle!

239
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,150
Damn you!

240
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,170
Let's forget that. Tell me honestly.

241
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,620
What on earth is the reason
that you went back on our home?

242
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,770
"Our home"?

243
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,930
You're not even a conglomerate
family and it benefits me...

244
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:08,770
- Damn you!
- You startled me!

245
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,330
Damn you!

246
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,660
- Goodness!
- Dad!

247
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,770
I mean, dad. What's wrong with you?

248
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,680
You called him Uncle?

249
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,130
Anyways, we can just eat enough.

250
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,550
We'll be already full.

251
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,460
My senior.

252
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,620
Who are you?

253
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,550
I'm Chae Ri. Han Chae Ri.

254
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,150
I'm Han Chae Ri.

255
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,400
Ah. That Chae Ri...

256
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,150
Yes. So you really remembered me.

257
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,840
Right. Yes, Chae Ri.

258
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,150
Please have a lunch with me.

259
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,130
Lunch?

260
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,130
I'm going to with my colleagues...

261
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,600
Where did they go?

262
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,150
Hey.

263
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,170
Oh, hey.

264
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,240
Oh, no. There's no need.

265
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,150
Chae Ri, what's up?

266
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm just asking you to eat with me.

267
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,770
Right.

268
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,130
So why?

269
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,820
You don't want to eat?

270
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,910
That's not what I mean.

271
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,200
Just eat.

272
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,770
Let's just eat.

273
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,550
You know, I...

274
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,800
I have really liked you...

275
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,930
Sorry.

276
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,170
I'm really sorry.

277
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,570
What did you say?

278
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,600
That is...

279
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,860
I've already told you from the start.

280
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,710
Back when you were my tutor,

281
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,710
I confessed to you that you are my first love.

282
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,170
I told you how much I liked you and Yi Na too.

283
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,750
You see, Yi Na...

284
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,130
...had sent me a wedding invitation too.

285
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,510
She told me that in case you run away,

286
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,080
I must lead you back there.

287
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,620
Hey.

288
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,950
I think I remembered it.

289
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,220
You know what...

290
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,170
I have really liked Yi Na since then.

291
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,550
At that time, I decided to give up totally,

292
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,660
so I went there wishing for your best.

293
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,080
But...

294
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,420
I just left right away after
seeing your wedding ceremony.

295
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,220
I didn't know anything what happened later.

296
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,310
So, there's something that
made me distressed now.

297
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,550
What made you distressed?

298
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,530
Hey.

299
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,170
Still,

300
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,480
A man must have loyalty,

301
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,840
and being loyal is what a man is.

302
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,750
Hey. What are you saying all of a sudden?

303
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,710
Wipe your tears.

304
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,130
Can my love for you before...

305
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,950
...be still rekindled?

306
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,370
Not long ago,

307
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,310
I contacted Ji Hyeon.

308
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,930
She said that you couldn't still let her go.

309
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,910
I mean, you must had a hard time.

310
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,770
So I've been thinking a lot about it.

311
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,060
But I still like you until now.

312
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,130
Mother-in-law, your son is back.
I'm so hungry.

313
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,440
We called her here.

314
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,200
So just fix that expression of yours.

315
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,930
Calling her at this occasion is more uncomfortable.

316
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,170
No, it's not at all.

317
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,640
I really want to eat with you.

318
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,710
I asked Ji Hyeon if there is
a chance I can come here.

319
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,510
I came here sincerely.

320
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,310
Thank you for inviting me.

321
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,510
Right. Thank goodness.

322
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,710
I mean, we are grateful to you too.

323
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,460
We were able to see Jung Woo's girlfriend.

324
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,550
Dad.

325
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,260
Get up there.

326
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,400
It's not even 30 minutes yet since she came here.

327
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,170
Won't you get up there?

328
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,440
Won't you!?

329
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,510
Then, I'm leaving now.

330
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,040
I have enjoyed your food.

331
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,280
Right.

332
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,860
Goodness.

333
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,800
This punk still hold her hands when they get out.

334
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,750
Taxi.

335
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,840
How dare you come here on your own?

336
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,550
Get in.

337
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,110
Where's your house?

338
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,170
In Mokdong.

339
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,400
Sir,

340
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,770
please take her to Mokdong.
No need to give the fare change.

341
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,440
Okay.

342
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
That Ji Hyeon, seriously.

343
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,040
Gosh!

344
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,660
Let go of me first...

345
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,880
Why did you do it!?

346
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,280
I didn't.

347
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,400
Want to die?

348
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,060
A text message.

349
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,710
Not a phone call but a text message.

350
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,970
Did you tell mother-in-law about chae Ri or even plums?
[ Cherry, homonym with the name Chae Ri ]

351
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,910
Hey.

352
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,110
Yi Na's mother have called
more than once, you know.

353
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,130
Damn it!

354
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,640
Let go of me and we'll just talk!

355
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,530
Goodness!

356
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,080
Are you joking with me?

357
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,480
I just grabbed your back, you know.

358
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,750
Fine.

359
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,000
I told her about it. Why?

360
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,400
You're getting brave now.

361
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,910
How dare you messed up with
the feelings of a 21-year old woman?

362
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,950
You don't even know how to be grateful.

363
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,510
Are you trying to fraud me?

364
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,460
Messed up with her feelings?

365
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,510
You should have heard about it since you met.

366
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,730
Knowing all your past, she still likes you.

367
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,000
I even told Yi Na's mother such good news.

368
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,130
My mother-in-law?

369
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,330
Why should you told mother-in law how good is that?

370
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,060
Why?

371
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,220
Honestly,

372
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,330
you're not on your sound mind.

373
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,570
Everyone already knows
but they're just waiting for you.

374
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:06,910
Right.

375
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,680
You have been with Yi Na for a long time,

376
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,150
so I assumed that you're attached to their home.

377
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,880
Strictly speaking, that is it.

378
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,170
What's that?

379
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,350
A home that you can't be
separated with even for a day.

380
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,530
I'm talking about your father-in-law's family.

381
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,220
Your wife was gone, so does it make
sense you still linger with the past?

382
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,020
Hey, what you said right now is too much.

383
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,040
It's me.

384
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,000
I introduced the two of you.

385

Seriously.

386
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,880
I was sitting in the middle
during your wedding ceremony.

387
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,710
You really looked like a true couple
just like in the photo.

388
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,800
The three of us ate together.

389

So my young friend who had
make-up for the wedding...

392
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,220
...had passed away even before she can remove it.

393
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,330
Does this make sense?

394
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,280

but the other one...

397
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,150
...is not mentally normal throughout the year.

398
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,040
Didn't you feel ashamed
when you went to see her?

399
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,330
Don't judge me.

You're on your abnormal state right now.

403
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,680
You should start for a new relationship.

404
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,710
It's time for you to take out
Yi Na from your memory.

405
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,600
You're agitated now and mentally ill.

406
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,750
You may not have time to take care of me now.

407
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,460
But just for once.

00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,260

You can just buy one at the convenience store.

Oh, it feels refreshing.

412
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,310

You don't like Chae Ri or
don't want to get married?

Why? Why do you hate it?

416

If you find both good, then just get married.

417

Will I be able to fall asleep this way?

424

For me to be asleep,

425
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,260
I should have a bit of freedom.

426

There's no place I could go to recently.

It's because of me.

I can't go somewhere as
I can't sleep well, you know?

Well, during that time,

450
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,530
when Yi Na saw me danced,
she became hooked.

451
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,880
After that, when she's in a bad mood,
I let her danced with me.

to get married at this age.

My biggest goal right now is not
to get married nor have a boyfriend.

494
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,240
It's just that after I graduated,

I want to be professional with
annual salary of at least 40 million won.

independent which makes it powerful.

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,600
I can't still let go of Yi Na.

553
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,880
This can't be.

554
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,440
I said, please take it up!

555
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,400
Goodness!

556
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:00,080
No way.

557
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,970
Congratulations!

558
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,950
Thank you!

559
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:42,130
I'll count to three.

560
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:42,710
Okay.

561
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,400
1, 2, 3.

562
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,660
One more.

563
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,930
1, 2, 3.

564
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,170
It's over.

565
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,860
Let's go.

566
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,820
How nice.

567
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,510
Let's go.

568
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,860
Bye-bye.

569
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,820
Wait a minute.

570
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,040
Just for a bit.

571
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,420
Oh my.

572
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,000
I will miss you, Mom and Dad.

573
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:58,370
Enjoy your trip.

574
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,400
I got it.

575
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,370
I love you.

576
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,530
I love you all too.

577
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,730
I'll call you later, Dad. Okay?

578
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:04,480
Just go.

579
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,620
Don't cry.

580
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,480
We're leaving.

581
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:41,880
Just go now.

582
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,550
Oh, I heard you got married.

583
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:24,480
Congrats.

584
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,480
Oh, hello.

585
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,330
Otherwise, I'll re-send it to you.

586
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,200
Please send me a text message
of your e-mail address.

587
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:41,130
Hello there.

588
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:42,170
Hi!

589
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh.

590
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,310
Senior.

591
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,620
I sent it through e-mail.

592
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,060
Where did you go?

593
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,350
I went to my school.

594
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:11,860
Really? Have you eaten yet?

595
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,400
Goodness. I'm sick of it every time we meet.

596
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,350
Basically, you're like being possessed by cats.

597
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:23,640
Okay, cheers.

598
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:24,880
Hey.

599

Let's have a drink.

Come on, let's have a drink.

601
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,530
Cheers.

You're showing off here.

604

Damn you. You already own a clothing store?

00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:19,040
What's this?

607
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,530

01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:58,150
but a comedy in long-shot.
