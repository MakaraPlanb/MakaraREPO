president's office always wither?

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,480
I've been scolded before.

174
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,830
Is it due to poor condition
that they keep getting withered?

175
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,260
We obviously water those every day.

176

177

That's why, they wither.

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,790
This pest.

187
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,630
Why did it came here?

188
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,370
Oh my, where did it go?

189
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,900
Oh my, it's there.

190
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,500
You're dead meat today!

191
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,350
It's the first time in my life
that I felt sympathy for the flies.

192
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,900
You see,

193
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,550
this needs to be washed.

194
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,550
It's dirty because of the blood.

195
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,860
Goodness.

196
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,280
You see, President.

197
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,630
I have been concerned about
the company's future development.

198
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,520
What I mean is that it
doesn't take much longer...

199
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,880
...to get a good hold of the time.

200
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,500
Of course, I have to pick those up.

201
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
I'll pick up and deliver those right away.

202
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,830
- Next week...
- Goodness. Look at him.

203
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,390
He's not as good as a fly.

204
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,770
Please don't misunderstand it.

205
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,770
Sir, are you free on that day?

206
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,060
Our meeting ends here.

207
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,260
There's one last thing that I got concerned.

208
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,680
There were some people who didn't
greet the president after work.

209
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,100
Don't you know the basic etiquette?

210
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,770
You must greet even when you leave.

211
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,770
Don't be late in the morning.

212
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,210
Even if you're late for a minute or two,

213
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,150
it will still be accounted for.

214
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,460
When you're on field work,
you can go home after right away.

215
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,170
Submit the leave application in advance
for it to be properly approved.

216
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,900
It's not allowed, unless you submit the application.

217
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,210
This won't do.

218
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,080
I've heard about some people recently.

219
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,210
That they didn't feel happy...

220
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,790
...when the president say few words to them.

221
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,970
Don't you know the basic etiquette?

222
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,770
I mean, as seniors,

223
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,500
we instruct and explain everything
by saying just in few words.

224
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,100
If you're not happy because of it,

225
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,190
how will you able to improve yourselves!?

226
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,190
No!

227
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,210
No!

228
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,230
Not here!

229
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,860
Absolutely not here!

230
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,880
No! Absolutely no!

231
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,720
Don't do it here! No way!

232
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,030
Ms. Kim.

233
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,680
Why are you blocking your ears as someone's talking?

234
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,120
You don't want to listen to what I'm saying?

235
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
I mean, that's not it.

236
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,920
I think my ears will start to bleed.

237
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,190
So your ears bleed because you keep
hearing things you don't like?

238
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,880
No. That's not it, sir.

239
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,610
Why is it not?!

240
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,880
Are you just ignoring what everyone says!?

241
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,170
I mean, I didn't thought of you that way.

242
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,170
You're really something.

243
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,880
My apologies.

244
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,460
Make a written apology.

245
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,550
Pardon?

246
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,010
I said make a written apology.

247
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,010
I can't just overlook this.

248
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,750
Yes. I understood.

249
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,210
Goodness. This person.

250
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,750
You're even not willing to make one.

251
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,260
I was afraid to resign before,
so I made a written apology.

252
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,500
I was afraid to be sanctioned too.

253
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,610
I mean, are you a beggar?

254
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,520
Why is he like that? I didn't even said anything.

255
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,630
You're still young.

256
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,390
- You like to earn for nothing?
- I said I'll make one!

257
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,570
Darn it!

258
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,080
I'm doomed.

259
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,830
What's wrong with her?

260
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,790
You can't just go on your own
when I'm not yet finished talking!

261
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,990
[ Written apology ]

262
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,460
Gosh. What shall I write here?

263
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,010
To be honest,

264
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,500
haven't you keep screeching at me like
an oriole who's singing Ave Maria?

265
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,830
Or in any case...

266
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,320
If you don't like me,

267
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,060
then just fire me.

268
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,810
And give me my unemployment benefits!

269
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,900
I don't want to write even a character here!

270
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,590
You there.

271
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,970
Yes.

272
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,150
Did you really wipe the president's cup
in his office this morning?

273
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,970
Yes, Ma'am.

274
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,010
Why?

275
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,900
He said something again?

276
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,860
I mean, he said it's still dirty.

277
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,230
He thought it was not wiped at all.

278
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,590
Those coffee residues can't be wiped out.

279
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,430
Really?

280
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,410
Then, what shall we do?

281
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,350
Then, just tell him that
he'll wipe it off by himself.

282
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,790
You can tell it to him instead.

283
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,410
I'm not as intellectual as you.

284
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,860
Yes?

285
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,720
Oh my.

286
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,030
I have no choice but to shut up,

287
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,700
or else, someone's ear will bleed again.

288
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,190
I have to treat that person well.

289
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,230
Gosh. I'm exhausted.

290
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,120
Gosh. My head.

291
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,410
Darn it.

292
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,390
It's unusual that I'm experiencing this one.

293
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,720
Why should I do this here?

294
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:15,370
But still, when I'm with my boyfriend,
my ears won't start bleeding.

295
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,280
That's because...

296
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,120
...we don't even make any conversations.

297
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,860
Why did you date me?

298
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,790
What?

299
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,810
Have you even look at me when we met today?

300
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,830
If you eat while playing with that,
then just eat by yourself.

301
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,480
I see.

302
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
You're embarrassed to eat on your own?

303
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,260
Same goes with marriage too, right?

304
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,950
You're already an adult,
but a bit embarrassed to live alone.

305
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,010
Why won't you eat?

306
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,280
Oh, I'm just thinking of something.

307
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,460
There's no reason for us to break up,
so we continued dating,

308
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,280
but how many couples date
in order to get married?

309
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,230
I haven't decided whether to break up or not,

310
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,830
but how many brides and grooms
are ready to get married?

311
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,680
In front of them, who are happy for their future,

312
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,550
what's waiting ahead of me?

313
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,350
It's been 5 years, and they're still
jumping around as always.

314
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,880
Our landlady ’s grandson is too healthy, right?

315
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,170
Let's just sleep for a while.

316
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,230
I can do it.

317
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,520
It's worst to get up early in the Golden Week.

318
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,750
Your wedding is just few days later.

319
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,680
Yes.

320
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,350
What's wrong with your face?

321
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,230
Your ears have bled again?

322
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,060
That's one of it.

323
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,990
Tell me.

324
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,590
After being a mom, did you find
your baby's weep disturbing?

325
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,430
What do you mean?

326
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,120
Well,

327
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,950
If I become a mother, will I think
the baby's weep fine for me?

328
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,900
No.

329
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,060
I'm a mother,

330
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,500
but I totally can't bear hearing the baby's weep.

331
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,680
No matter how great my maternal love is,

332
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,430
he keeps crying here and there,

333
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,720
then takes out his dung.

334
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,410
I felt angry and frustrated as he's my child,

335
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,410
but even if he cries, I could just hug him.

336
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,010
Don't you find baby's dung stinky?

337
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,010
Since he's my child,

338
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,390
no matter how stinky and dirty it is,
I have to endure it.

339
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
If I'll have a kid,

340
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,170
I may not stand the baby's weep,
and may be dead from too much bleeding.

341
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,720
Is it that serious?

342
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,520
Would that be fine?

343
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,430
Gosh. I don't know anymore.

344
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,790
Does your ear often bleed?

345
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,750
Not that often.

346
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,920
More than that,

347
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,370
I'm really stressed that it keeps bleeding when I'm working.

348
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,680
All this time, I've been restraining myself from this.

349
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,860
Our society is like this.

350
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,520
What to do?

351
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,700
Well, I'll just have to tolerate it.

352
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,460
What's more ridiculous is...

353
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,250
...I'm afraid of being discovered
not to listen to what they said...

354
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,120
...and that makes me shiver.

355
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,500
The other party doesn't speak decently,

356
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,230
but instead just awfully says
unreasonable things towards me.

357
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,390
I mean, how mighty they are
that they could act like that?

358
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,550
Is it because of their job positions?

359
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,520
Age?

360
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,590
Then,

361
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,720
When I be promoted to that position later on,

362
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,080
will I treat my subordinates that way?

363
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,410

00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,670
Pardon me. I'll make it right away.

545
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,850
You can go.

546
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,280
[ I deserve to die. ]

547
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,710
I deserve to die.

548
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,710
Just kill me.

549
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,310
Ms. Kim.

550
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,400
Pardon?

551
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,220
I'm talking about this.

552
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,600
Why take vacation leave for two consecutive days?

553
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,820
I have to go for a honeymoon,

554
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,730
as my wedding ceremony
will be held this Saturday.

555
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,020
And I heard that I can only take three days off...

556
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,400
...when on leave for marriage purposes.

557
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,270
So what?

558
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,270
I have return home on Thursday night,

559
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,580
and only go to work at Friday morning.

560
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,560
Even still,

561
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,330
this won't do at the first place.

562
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,380
Everyone did it too, though.

563
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,250
Really?

564
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,330
This won't really do in the first place.

565
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:07,490
I mean, marriage is not really a grand thing,

566
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,200
Why have to do this?

567
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,710
You have even violated some regulations.

568
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,360
What's this?

569
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,980
He's telling me not to attend on it?

570
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,000
This won't really do in the first place, huh?

571
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,510
Since the higher-ups approve this,
I'll let it go this time.

572
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,600
What's so great about holding a wedding?

573
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,960
Why have to show it off, huh?

574
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,450
Is that for you to show off at that age?

575
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,180
Why talk about age here?

576
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,780
No. No way.

577
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,650
I need to get my grip.

578
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,290
Before...

579
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,160
- I'll recite a poem for a moment.
- ...a female staff here got married.

580
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,310
- Look up the sky until I die.
- She should have resigned.

581
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,310
Why talk about women here?

582
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,890
- No. No way.
- That woman now is seriously...

583
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,050
No way.

584
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,890
- When the leaves were blown by the wind, I feel sad.
- After she got married, she later become pregnant.

585
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,580
- Why pregnancy suddenly?
- By then,

586
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,070
she applied for maternity leave again.

587
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,820
I guess she just take it up for granted.

588
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,050
Her fellow colleagues' works will increase.

589
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,170
Why she don't know that?

590
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,850
I'm... doomed.

591
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,770
The vacation must be justifiable.

592
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,560
She definitely brought over
her friends to get her things.

593
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,310
Look at you. Again.

594
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,050
Goodness. Even if I want to talk,

595
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,200
I can't freely talk at all.

596
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,560
Even if I talk here...

597
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,130
I'd rather just be knocked out.

598
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,780
Yes. They are ready to be delivered tonight.

599
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,400
There will be two batches of goods
next Tuesday and Thursday, right?

600
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,930
Yes.

601
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,760
Then, we'll get the first batch next week,

602
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,580
as there are more deliveries
in the start of the month.

603
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,580
Then, let's try it this Saturday.

604
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,270
Let's do it that way.

605
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,780
I understood.

606
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,780
He still haven't realized it?

607
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,160
Probably, he didn't find
his name precious at all.

608
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,450
Goodness.

609
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,450
What I've done all night was just nothing.

610
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,250
Oh, Ms. Kim.

611
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,490
You see,

612
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,800
How long will it take to transport
the almond syrup goods through air?

613
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,220
First, you need to know if
the factory has inventory of those.

614
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,090
If there is, shall it take a week long?

615
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:15,730
Yes.

616
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,250
Can you look for other ways?

617
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,310
After I have inquired about the
approximate budget, I'll inform you.

618
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,690
Are you ready for your wedding ceremony?

619
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,270
Well, we're on the final process for it.

620
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,380
Whoa! Then, you'll be
a middle-aged woman soon?

621
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,930
Indeed.

622
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,780
That...

623
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,110
Do your bleeding ears have been already fine?

624
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,090
Not at all.

625
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,650
They're still not fine.

626
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,330
What did your groom said?

627
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,530
He must be too worried.

628
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,930
He said that it's my fault
and due to my weak mentality.

629
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,930
Isn't that a disorder?

630
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,760
It's not like you catch cold
due to mental illness, right?

631
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,360
That's what I mean.

632
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,020
Sir.

633
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,910
Yes?

634
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,270
Excuse me, about my business card...

635
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,890
Can you reprint those again?

636
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,380
Why? What's wrong?

637
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,470
It's just that I need more of those.

638
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,250
I'm asking you.

639
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,600
That can't be.

640
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,790
I'm asking you.

641
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,910
I already told you that it can't be.

642
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,600
I just printed two batches for you two days ago.

643
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,930
But you have already utilized all of those.

644
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,760
Does that make sense?

645
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,290
It's not that I used it all.

646
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,980
I have lost all of those.

647
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,800
If you lost them, it's your responsibility.

648
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,380
Anyways, right now, it can't be.

649
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,710
So, after time passes by, come here later.

650
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,420
Okay?

651
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,850
Darn it!

652
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,800
Sir, this is list after adding the other commodity.

653
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,000
They added caramel syrup?

654
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,450
There are two boxes left and they're not enough.

655
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,160
Yes.

656
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,970
I mean, Ma'am.

657
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,360
Darn it!

658
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,420
I want to feign ignorance.

659
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,730
Sir, your name is Hwan?

660
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,850
Gohwan?

661
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,650
What!?

662
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,690
I want to laugh like crazy at him.

663
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,580
Gohwan...?

664
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,850
I haven't done anything on those vigorously.

665
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,560
It has already withered, Ma'am.

666
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,270
Can we become adults too?

667
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,000
Shouldn't adults have fun like us?

668
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,000
Shall we play like adults?

669
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,330
Play like adults?

670
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,380
What's that?

671
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,870
Just like playing as a doctor or policeman.

672
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,760
Playing like them being adults.

673
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,980
Hey, we don't even know how an adult acts like.

674
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,780
It's not like we even have uniforms of those persons.

675
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,180
Then, what would it be?

676
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,180
My mom said it.

677
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,560
Adults can make their own decisions.

678
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,220
Decision?

679
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
We already decided what to do now.

680
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,690
Whether to wear a yellow or a blue shirt.

681
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,850
Whether to eat jjajjangmyeon or pork cutlets.

682
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,000
Idiot. I'm not referring to that one.

683
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,650
It's the decision you want.

684
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,650
The most important decision.

685
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,650
The one that's most important?

686
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,450
For instance,

687
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,890
whether I'll choose to save myself or not.

688
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,600
Whether I able to save myself or not?

689
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,130
[ Director's office ]

690
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,930
Sir.

691
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,220
Here's the air freight information you've asked before.

692
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,710
Oh, thank you.

693
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,200
Your marriage day is tomorrow?

694
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,510
Yes.

695
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,510
Don't get nervous. Just do well.

696
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,490
Well, there's really nothing to do.

697
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,150
After being make-upped,
I just have to sit and wait.

698
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,850
Wear my wedding dress.

699
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,710
And then enter the venue.

700
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,360
The photographer will make me laugh.

701
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,310
It's a special day for you
so you have to be happy.

702
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,670
Others will make you laugh.

703
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,960
I don't know about that.

704
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,620
You'll getting married for money?

705
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,890
Why you don't look happy?

706
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,690
Do I have to laugh all day?

707
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,800
It's not an amazing wedding ceremony.

708
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,490
Of course, it's an amazing one for you.

709
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,000
Ms. Kim.

710
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,330
Yes.

711
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,020
You're getting married tomorrow?

712
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,420
Yes.

713
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,330
No need to be too nervous.

714
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:01,020
Even if it's special, it will just be ordinary the day after.

715
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,200
Just think that you are in
a drama where you starred in.

716
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,560
Yes.

717
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:11,180
After you get married, when are you going to have a baby?

718
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,490
You're going to have one right after?

719
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,690
No. We have to make things slow.

720
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,490
While you're still young, you have to do it.

721
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,730
You even know that it's not too early.

722
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,490
Recently, I heard many persons were infertile.

723
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,490
It won't be possible to
have a baby at that time.

724
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:25,710
I see.

725
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:33,050
Darn it. Why issue for a quotation again?

726
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,490
Is this person mentally ill?

727
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,380
I mean, how could this person do this?

728
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,330
What did she said just now!?

729
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:53,020
It looks like she got annoyed with me.

730
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,020
I must be mistaken, right?

731
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,420
You want it to be true?

732
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:59,130

Eldest daughter: Kim Soo Hee

741
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:20,670
These two are standing in front
to be blessed for their marriage.

742
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,980
Well, everyone, it's like loving the country, right?

743
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,530
After you get married,
your dream child will be born.

744
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,850
Why he's talking about the country?

745
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,180
For the country's development...

746
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:37,590
Til the day when Mt. Baekdu's worn away...

747
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,380
- ...and the East Sea's water run dry
- Please keep that in mind.

748
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,450
We have to reflect from being extravagant
and doing unjustifiable things.

749
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,200
- Singing the national anthem won't do.
- We should be patriotic.

750
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,690
- I'm totally doomed if this wedding dress...
- We should help the country...

751
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,690
...drips with blood.

752
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,270
- Shall I recite numbers?
- The people must be educated...

753
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,560
- 4 times 11 equals 44.
- As a citizen of the country...

754
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,760
- 44 minus 12 equals 32.
- Don't be indolent in loving the country.

755
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,670
- 32 divided by four equals...
- Otherwise...

756
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,570
...28.

757
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,160

758
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,470

759
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,250

760
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,000
28.
[ If read in Korean, it's a curse word. ]

761
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,360
28!?

762
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,290
Hey, are you crazy!?

763
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,490
Even in your marriage life,
you can find your happiness.

764
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,200
As the saying goes, self-cultivation and family management.

765
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:54,090
The idea is to make the family become stabilized.

766
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,870
A family is also as important as
giving importance for our country.

767
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:03,250
There may be contradictions everywhere.

768
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:08,250
So if you have different opinions,

769
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,250
you need to communicate more...

770
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,420
...and solve the problems together.

771
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,380
Bride.

772
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,220
Bride.

773
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,450
Someone is talking right in front of you.

774
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,890
What's with that attitude of yours?

775
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,130
Bride.

776
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,670
You think my time is more than enough...

777
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,670
...just to witness your marriage?

778
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:22,200
What's going on?

779
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,330
I have no idea.

780
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,730
Is her ear bleeding?

781
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,690
What's wrong with you, huh?

782
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:52,580
- What is she doing!?
- Are you kidding with us?

783
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,230
I decided not to continue this marriage.

784
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,580
I...

785
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,710
...am going to save myself.

786
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,710
As I've eager to become...

787
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,450
...such an adult.

788
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,710
I'm totally doomed.

789
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:58,200
But, it somehow made me felt relieved.

790
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,160
Hey, do you know this?

791
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,870
What again?

792
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,910
I heard that grown-up sea squirts have no brains.

793
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,360
Geez. You're just lying.

794
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,780
I'm serious.

795
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,250
When they're young, they have to find for themselves,

796
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,510
so it exists on them.

797
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,130
When they grow up,

798
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,510
they have to settle for a place,
cram their brain first,

799
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,910
and wait for the food to flow towards them.

800
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,250
Do those grown-up sea squirts knew
that they don't have brains?

801
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,620
I don't know.

802
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,220
I'm not like them,
so how could I know?

803
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,730
It's a magpie.

804
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,200
Hey, wait for me!

805
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,650
Soo Hee.

806
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,780
Mom.

807
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,380
Mom, when I was young,
I read a book titled "The Hope of Flowers".

808
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:00,420
The book says that the larvae
crawled on the larval pillars.

809
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,070
we don't know what's inside,

810
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,420
but something interesting happens there.
Makes me feel creepy.

811
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,850
It will struggle itself and comes out later.

812
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,400
But I feel that way recently too.

813
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,160
I feel that I can't choose to abandon the pillar.

814
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,020
It looks like I'm in a post-apocalyptic state.

815
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,000
You...

816
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:26,780
But I decided to come out from the pillar,

817
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,960
and won't get trampled from now on.

818
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,510
You liked folding these stacks of paper.

819
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:51,510

You survived from that painful surgery,

831

but how could you die from a traffic accident?

832
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,960
You were already dead.

902
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:52,200
You didn't even come to my wedding, weren't you?

903
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,870
I sacrificed that day,

904
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,270
but still, I gave you wedding money.

905
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,110
I see.

906
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,110
Thank you for the 30,000 won.

907
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:01,380
When is the housewarming party planned?

908
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,490
No, we don't have that.

909
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:04,730
I mean, why?

910
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,290
Why won't you do it!?

911
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,050
Of course, you have to do it.

912
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,910
I'm going to have a divorce.

913
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,820
What?

914
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,050
Already!?

915
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,050
You shouldn't have big conflicts. Get along well.

916
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,200
You will often get into quarrels in the future.

917
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,200
Gosh. Men must have virtues.

918
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,020
Just try to endure it, okay?

919
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:30,850
I'm a very nice person,
so I can't endure it on my own.

920
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:31,820
I mean, why?

921
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:33,690
Oh my.

922
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:37,000
Did your mother-in-law nags you so much?

923
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,160
Goodness. Even still,

924
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,360
you should reflect on it more.

925
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,960
After all, it takes patience,
or else you can't resolve it.

926
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:51,760
It's not about my mother-in-law.

927
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:53,400
Me?

928
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,820
What's wrong with me?

929
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:57,420
You're talking about Manager Im?
She speaks like that.

930
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,160
Oh my, when did I do that?

931
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,050
This person is not even aware
of her own behavior.

932
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:05,980
You're even unclear of your actions too.

933
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,270
What did I do?

934
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:10,020
You keep talking about women every day.

935
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,780
What era do you think are we now?

936
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,180
When did I? Seriously!

937
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:16,760
Hey, Manager Im. I didn't thought
that you're not open-minded.

938
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,290
Try to go for a DNA test.

939
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,510
Your degree of being uneducated
is not only twice but quadruple!

940
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:22,450
What!?

941
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:25,360
The two of you are compatible to talk with each other.

942
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,580
Please continue having exceptional conversations.

943
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,420
You.

944
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,580
Are you joking?

945
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,890
It's just the same as before.

946
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:49,090
And also, what is this? Huh?

947
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,270
In addition,

948
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:51,530
If you refuse to accept it,

949
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:53,910
then it is understood that
I will write a resignation letter.

950
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:58,600
Hey you.

951
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,330
Have you gone nuts?

952
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,070
I already got a mental health check-up,

953
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:06,510
so I really don't know, Sir.

954
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,160
Just remove that additional part,

955
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,600
then submit it again.

956
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,930
Yes. I understood.

957
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,330
I am really an adult now.

958
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,060
