194
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,970
I guess she was knocked over at Seoul.

195

Darn it!

196
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,460
Did I stepped on shit? I can't get paid with this.

I carried you on my back,

205

so my back feels a bit painful.

206
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,750

207
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,480

You just left her like that?

210

214
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,950
For goodness sake! I was really scared.

215
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,640
You said to go so we set off right away.

216
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,040
But along the way, you keep saying something.

217
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,550
Was it the bag?

218
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,970
Yes, it was.

219
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,420
You kept saying that I should bring the bag.

220
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,330
Could it be in that bag,

221
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,750
there are money?

222
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,240
What on earth had really happened at that time?

223

The weather here is quite good.

Hey.

Did you kill a person?

Darn it!

230
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,060
I said I didn't.

231
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,370
That blood from yesterday...

232
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,600
You were almost the culprit.

233
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,400
Let's go and see that woman first.

234
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,080
Whether you got drunk,
stole a bag, and killed someone.

235
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,840
We'll find those out.

236

Pay me double.

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,510

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,770
There's no one.

240
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,880
The door is open and the inside looks clean.

241
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,000
It was really a fuss yesterday.

242
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,860
I didn't know what was going on.

243

I don't hear anything from the inside.

245
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,350
I said I'm right.

246
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,510
How long did she took bath last midnight?

247
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,600
I mean, there is suitable time for her to do that,

248
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,950
but the sound of water
didn't made me fell asleep last night.

249
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,660
The sound of the water flowing...

250
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,260
...must be on the upper floor or above than that.

251
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,260
I couldn't find who's liable for it.

252

I have no idea whatsoever.

253
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,000
When I first saw her, I felt that
she's not an ordinary woman.

254
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,170
She must have committed something and avoided us.

255
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,950
I have to let her know that
she must not shake up things here.

256
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,510
Then,

257
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,620

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,450
there are even cheap places around here,

272
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,450

370
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,850
If you will do it, I'll be surely grateful for that.

371
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,940
Okay, let's get going.

372
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,010
Forensic investigations have been advanced now,

373
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,010
but I didn't kill her.
The truth will definitely be revealed.

374
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,410
I didn't kill her.

375
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,270
The bag.

376
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,700
She has no family nor relatives.

377
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,180
I'll just mourn for her and pretend I never saw it.

378
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,920
The black box?

379
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,900
It's already broken anyways,

380
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,780
so it won't function.

381
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,140
I am sober.

382
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,900
I am absolutely sober.

383
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,340
This is just once in a lifetime.

384
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,900
I can only become successful at once.

385
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,960
I just saw someone came in.

386
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,340
Goodness. Why are you so into it?

387
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,120
Someone will definitely come out from there.

388
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,380
That woman doesn't live here,

389
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,380
she just only come here occasionally.

390
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,980
How long has it been empty here?

391
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,580
I said it's not possible as there were no sound at all.

392
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,030
Shall we try calling the police?

393
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,340
What will they do?

394
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,840
All right.

395
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,140
I think this will work.

396
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,030
What?

397
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,700
You see, it works.

398
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,940
Goodness.

399
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,940
If we'll go in, we may get reported for trespassing.

400
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,500
I have to see it clearly first before we'll decide.

401
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,810
Or else, I won't be able to sleep well.

402
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,820
But the sound could have came from above,

403
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,340
came from below,

404
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,540
went back down,

405
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,900
or they could be anywhere.

406
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,700
What are you saying?

407
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,020
It won't open...

408
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,060
It opened...

409
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,580
It got used up so it become different.

410
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,300
We'll just let the police come here.

411
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,040
Right.

412
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,760
Uncle.

413
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,030
Uncle!

414
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,270
Uncle!

415
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,610
How can you sleep at the moment?

416
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Did I really kill that woman?

417
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,500
Something came out?

418
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,120
What situation did I get into?

419
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,250
What did I do?

420
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,160
Did I really kill that woman?

421
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,980
Why does it matter? The place is even clean.

422
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,160
How was the body got hidden?

423
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,740
Why are they over there?

424
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,460
Excuse me!

425
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,360
I can't contact Mr. Kim.

426
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,050
He was on duty yesterday.

427
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,160
Well, yes.

428
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,230
After he got drunk, I couldn't contact him for a day or two.

429
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,410
But do these people know him?

430
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,320
I think these people are not from here.

431
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,300
They came from Seoul.

432
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,500
Why go all the way from here?

433
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,140
They were here to look for an apartment.

434
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,740
Apartment?

435
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,700
Why is that?

436
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,430
You're going to redevelop the area here?

437
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,480
Oh my goodness!

438
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,670
Seriously!?

439
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,880
- I've been waiting for it to happen.
- I mean...

440
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,670
How much is the value of this area?

441
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,650
Be quiet first!

442
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,500
Please.

443
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,850
No.

444
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,300
We just went here as the atmosphere here feels good.

445
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,740
What's good with it?

446
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,850
His hometown is around here.

447
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,140
You should have told us.

448
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,540
I think people come here to see the house's selling price.

449
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,810
Well then.

450
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,940
Excuse me.

451
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,100
By chance...

452
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,520
Are you the driver on that taxi,
with plate number 4922?

453
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,140
Yes, it is.

454
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,430
You shouldn't park it over there.

455
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,900
It has been blocking the way from the start.

456
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,100
Goodness. Why did you have to park it there?

457
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,640
Take it out, hurry!

458
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,320
Hurry up and go.

459
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
I'm really sorry. We'll take it out right away.

460
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,010
Excuse me.

461
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,670
Yes.

462
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,610
You haven't really seen Mr. Kim?

463
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,360
Well...

464
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,940
I don't even totally know who is Mr. Kim nor Mr. Park.

465
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,860
We have just arrived here last night.

466
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,470
You haven't seen him?

467
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,210
Who are you?

468
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,900
It seems that I killed them all.

469
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,270
I must have really killed them.

470
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,810
I killed them all.

471
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,430
I'll just drive.

472
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,230
I killed them all...

473
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,500
I killed them...

474
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,920
What are you doing?
For goodness sake.

475
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,050
I'll just surrender.

476
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,700
Move to the side first.

477
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,030
How could you not put it in when it's just light?

478
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,470
Please remember it.

479
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,980
Please remember it!

480
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,300
Please try to remember it!

481
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,700
Please!

482
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,780
Please remember it!

483
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,120
I'm alcoholically demented.

484
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,540
I can't remember what happened today, on the next day.

485
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,830
Where are you going!?

486
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,500
So you mean it's here, right?

487
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,830
You had drinks with someone?

488
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,830
When a woman was lying dead over there?

489
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,500
No way. You must have been mistaken.

490
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,160
That's not true.

491
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,010
I drank with someone here, for sure.

492
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,250
Man to man.

493
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,320
Who could that be?

494
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,940
Who was that?

495
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,650
Please come in.

496
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,540
So where's the bag?

497
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,450
The bag?

498
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,120
I don't know that too...

499
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,860
I mean, how could you only remember that one?

500
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,610
What's this?

501
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,540
Have the wild boars came here?

502
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
What's going on?

503
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,560
Goodness. You scared the hell out of me!

504
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,780
I'd like to say something about that person too.

505
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,720
Why? What's wrong?

506
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,410
Gosh. I couldn't sleep well last night.

507
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,920
All because of that person.

508
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,850
Go and help me
by telling her to keep her voice low.

509
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,810
No way.

510
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:54,860
I'll just be making a fuss.

511
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,830
Don't you know how is the world, these days?

512
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,830
If police do that kind of thing,

513
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,160
that will just mean bullying. That won't do.

514
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,030
Then, how can I live now?

515
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,140
Why you can't live?

516
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,380
I...

517
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,180
You have to hurry up or else we'll get caught.

518
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,360
The bag.

519
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,610
Just focus on the bag.

520
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,640
A big-sized black leather handbag.

521
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,760
Okay?

522
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,360
How did you know that?

523
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,870
That it was a big-sized black leather handbag?

524
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,280
Yes.

525
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,300
There's nothing special about that bag.

526
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,980
I mean, aren't all handbags' features like that?

527
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,560
But why can't you focus?

528
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,850
Our most important task now is that bag.

529
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,300
To find that bag.

530
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,960
That's just simple, isn't it?

531
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,010
Right?

532
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,080
How did I went here and put the money in the bag.

533
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,470
No.

534
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,620
Hey you.

535
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,900
A person was dead,

536
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,960
but you keep talking about it...

537
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,120
Just shut up!

538
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,100
The bag!

539
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,050
You said you put the money there?

540
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,980
Please focus on your task.

541
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,580
With that bag, my life will become easy.

542
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,030
If I have that, my life will change.

543
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,540
Have you become dumb?

544
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,660
You weren't able to calculate it?

545
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,450
I really need that money, you know.

546
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,920
You're a security guard?

547
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,250
Yes.

548
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,830
A resident below has complained that it was too noisy.

549
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,780
But who are you?

550
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,780
The one who lives here just lives alone.

551
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,830
Well...

552
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,010
I'm here to see my cousin.

553
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,010
