195

Darn it!

196
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,460
Did I stepped on shit? I can't get paid with this.

I carried you on my back,

206

You just left her like that?

For goodness sake! I was really scared.

215
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,640
You said to go so we set off right away.

216
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,040
But along the way, you keep saying something.

217
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,550
Was it the bag?

218
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,970
Yes, it was.

219
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,420
You kept saying that I should bring the bag.

220
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,330
Could it be in that bag,

221
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,750
there are money?

222
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,240
What on earth had really happened at that time?

223

Darn it!

230
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,060
I said I didn't.

231
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,370
That blood from yesterday...

232
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,600
You were almost the culprit.

233
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,400
Let's go and see that woman first.

234
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,080
Whether you got drunk,
stole a bag, and killed someone.

235

There's no one.

240
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,880
The door is open and the inside looks clean.

241
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,000
It was really a fuss yesterday.

242
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,860
I didn't know what was going on.

243

I said I'm right.

246
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,510
How long did she took bath last midnight?

247
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,600
I mean, there is suitable time for her to do that,

248
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,950
but the sound of water
didn't made me fell asleep last night.

The sound of the water flowing...

250
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,260
...must be on the upper floor or above than that.

251
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
I couldn't find who's liable for it.

252

I have no idea whatsoever.

253
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,000
When I first saw her, I felt that
she's not an ordinary woman.

254
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,170
She must have committed something and avoided us.

255
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,950
I have to let her know that
she must not shake up things here.

256

Then,

257
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,620

272
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,450

370
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,850
If you will do it, I'll be surely grateful for that.

371
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,940
Okay, let's get going.

372
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,010
Forensic investigations have been advanced now,

373
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,010
but I didn't kill her.
The truth will definitely be revealed.

374
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,410
I didn't kill her.

375
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,270
The bag.

376
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,700
She has no family nor relatives.

377
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,180
I'll just mourn for her and pretend I never saw it.

378
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,920
The black box?

379
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,900
It's already broken anyways,

380
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,780
so it won't function.

381
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,140
I am sober.

382
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,900
I am absolutely sober.

383
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,340
This is just once in a lifetime.

384
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,900
I can only become successful at once.

385
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,960
I just saw someone came in.

386
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,340
Goodness. Why are you so into it?

387
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,120
Someone will definitely come out from there.

388
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,380
That woman doesn't live here,

389
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,380
she just only come here occasionally.

390
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,980
How long has it been empty here?

391
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,580
I said it's not possible as there were no sound at all.

392
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,030
Shall we try calling the police?

393
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,340
What will they do?

394
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,840
All right.

395
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,140
I think this will work.

396
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,030
What?

397
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,700
You see, it works.

398
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,940
Goodness.

399
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,940
If we'll go in, we may get reported for trespassing.

400
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,500
I have to see it clearly first before we'll decide.

401
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,810
Or else, I won't be able to sleep well.

402
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,820
But the sound could have came from above,

403
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,340
came from below,

404
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,540
went back down,

405
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,900
or they could be anywhere.

406
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,700
What are you saying?

407
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,020
It won't open...

408
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,060
It opened...

409
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,580
It got used up so it become different.

410
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,300
We'll just let the police come here.

411
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,040
Right.

412
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,760
Uncle.

413
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,030
Uncle!

414
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,270
Uncle!

415
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,610
How can you sleep at the moment?

416
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Did I really kill that woman?

417
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,500
Something came out?

418
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,120
What situation did I get into?

419
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,250
What did I do?

420
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,160
Did I really kill that woman?

421
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,980
Why does it matter? The place is even clean.

422
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,160
How was the body got hidden?

423
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,740
Why are they over there?

424
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,460
Excuse me!

425
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,360
I can't contact Mr. Kim.

426
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,050
He was on duty yesterday.

427
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,160
Well, yes.

428
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,230
After he got drunk, I couldn't contact him for a day or two.

429
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,410
But do these people know him?

430
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,320
I think these people are not from here.

431
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,300
They came from Seoul.

432
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,500
Why go all the way from here?

433
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,140
They were here to look for an apartment.

434
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,740
Apartment?

435
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,700
Why is that?

436
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,430
You're going to redevelop the area here?

437
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,480
Oh my goodness!

438
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,670
Seriously!?

439
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,880
- I've been waiting for it to happen.
- I mean...

440
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,670
How much is the value of this area?

441
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,650
Be quiet first!

442
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,500
Please.

443
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,850
No.

444
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,300
We just went here as the atmosphere here feels good.

445
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,740
What's good with it?

446
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,850
His hometown is around here.

447
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,140
You should have told us.

448
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,540
I think people come here to see the house's selling price.

449
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,810
Well then.

450
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,940
Excuse me.

451
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,100
By chance...

452
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,520
Are you the driver on that taxi,
with plate number 4922?

453
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,140
Yes, it is.

454
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,430
You shouldn't park it over there.

455
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,900
It has been blocking the way from the start.

456
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,100
Goodness. Why did you have to park it there?

457
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,640
Take it out, hurry!

458
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,320
Hurry up and go.

459
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,320
I'm really sorry. We'll take it out right away.

460
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,010
Excuse me.

461
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,670
Yes.

462
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,610
You haven't really seen Mr. Kim?

463
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,360
Well...

464
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,940
I don't even totally know who is Mr. Kim nor Mr. Park.

465
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,860
We have just arrived here last night.

466
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,470
You haven't seen him?

467
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,210
Who are you?

468
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,900
It seems that I killed them all.

469
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,270
I must have really killed them.

470
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,810
I killed them all.

471
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,430
I'll just drive.

472
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,230
I killed them all...

473
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,500
I killed them...

474
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,920
What are you doing?
For goodness sake.

475
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,050
I'll just surrender.

476
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,700
Move to the side first.

477
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,030
How could you not put it in when it's just light?

478
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,470
Please remember it.

479
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,980
Please remember it!

480
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,300
Please try to remember it!

481
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,700
Please!

482
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,780
Please remember it!

483
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,120
I'm alcoholically demented.

484
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,540
I can't remember what happened today, on the next day.

485
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,830
Where are you going!?

486
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,500
So you mean it's here, right?

487
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,830
You had drinks with someone?

488
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,830
When a woman was lying dead over there?

489
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,500
No way. You must have been mistaken.

490
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,160
That's not true.

491
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,010
I drank with someone here, for sure.

492
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,250
Man to man.

493
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,320
Who could that be?

494
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,940
Who was that?

495
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,650
Please come in.

496
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,540
So where's the bag?

497
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,450
The bag?

498
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,120
I don't know that too...

499
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,860
I mean, how could you only remember that one?

500
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,610
What's this?

501
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,540
Have the wild boars came here?

502
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
What's going on?

503
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,560
Goodness. You scared the hell out of me!

504
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,780
I'd like to say something about that person too.

505
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,720
Why? What's wrong?

506
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,410
Gosh. I couldn't sleep well last night.

507
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,920
All because of that person.

508
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,850
Go and help me
by telling her to keep her voice low.

509
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,810
No way.

510
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,860
I'll just be making a fuss.

511
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,830
Don't you know how is the world, these days?

512
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,830
If police do that kind of thing,

513
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,160
that will just mean bullying. That won't do.

514
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,030
Then, how can I live now?

515
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,140
Why you can't live?

516
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,380
I...

517
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,180
You have to hurry up or else we'll get caught.

518
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,360
The bag.

519
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,610
Just focus on the bag.

520
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,640
A big-sized black leather handbag.

521
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,760
Okay?

522
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,360
How did you know that?

523
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,870
That it was a big-sized black leather handbag?

524
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,280
Yes.

525
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,300
There's nothing special about that bag.

526
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,980
I mean, aren't all handbags' features like that?

527
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,560
But why can't you focus?

528
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,850
Our most important task now is that bag.

529
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,300
To find that bag.

530
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,960
That's just simple, isn't it?

531
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,010
Right?

532
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,080
How did I went here and put the money in the bag.

533
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,470
No.

534
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,620
Hey you.

535
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,900
A person was dead,

536
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,960
but you keep talking about it...

537
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,120
Just shut up!

538
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,100
The bag!

539
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,050
You said you put the money there?

540
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,980
Please focus on your task.

541
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,580
With that bag, my life will become easy.

542
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,030
If I have that, my life will change.

543
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,540
Have you become dumb?

544
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,660
You weren't able to calculate it?

545
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,450
I really need that money, you know.

546
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,920
You're a security guard?

547
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,250
Yes.

548
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,830
A resident below has complained that it was too noisy.

549
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,780
But who are you?

550
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,780
The one who lives here just lives alone.

551
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,830
Well...

552
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,010
I'm here to see my cousin.

553
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,010
