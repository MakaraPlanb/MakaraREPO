HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,506
Dr. Ahn, Sang-u is here.

3
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:28,134
My goodness. Sang-u is here.

4
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:30,762
Sang-u, say hello to the doctor.

5
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,181
All right. There you go.

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,142
Sang-u, you came with a shark today.

7
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:40,897
Should I take a look
at what's inside the shark's mouth?

8
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:42,941
Oh, no.

9
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:46,611
Sang-u, why are you crying?

10
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:50,073
The doctor is going to ease
your stomachache.

11
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:52,617
He's trying to ease your stomachache.
Why are you crying?

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,701
Don't cry now.

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,663
If you keep crying,

14
00:00:56,746 --> 00:01:00,625
this scary doctor is going to scold you
and give you a shot.

15
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:02,752
Right, doctor?

16
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:06,089
Bad boy! Where's the syringe?

17
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:09,717
Nurse, where is the big syringe
Sang-u is going to get?

18
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,136
Sang-u, be quiet. Stop crying.

19
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:16,558
If you keep crying, the doctor
is going to bring a big syringe.

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,351
Stop.

21
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:29,696
Let's see. I have some snacks
for Sang-u right here.

22
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:32,740
Oh, my goodness. Who scared Sang-u?

23
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:35,660
Who scared my sweet boy, Sang-u?

24
00:01:35,743 --> 00:01:37,120
Was it the doctor?

25
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:40,164
It was the doctor, right?

26
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:42,292
I'll scold him for you.

27
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,002
There.

28
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:47,171
I scolded a bad doctor for you.

29
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:51,926
Doctor, why did you scare Sang-u?

30
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,345
He's such a nice boy.

31
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:58,391
Doctor, you won't scare Sang-u
anymore, right?

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,976
Right, doctor?

33
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,857
I am sorry, Sang-u.

34
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:08,818
I'll give you this snack
instead of a shot.

35
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:11,279
Eat this when you're all better.

36
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:12,864
-Yes.
-Professor Ahn.

37
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:15,867
Ji-su needs her PEG tube changed now.

38
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:19,495
-Excuse me for a second, Sang-u.
-Yes.

39
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:24,751
Hello.

40
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:29,088
I took a look at your ultrasound.

41
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:33,885
It will be difficult to treat
with antibiotics.

42
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,387
What does he have exactly?

43
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:38,890
He has infective endocarditis.

44
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:41,142
There's an infection in his endocardium.

45
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:44,312
If we treat it with antibiotics,
you may suffer from embolism.

46
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,482
I'm concerned an infected mass
might block your vessels.

47
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:50,193
You must get surgery as soon as possible.
Did you find him a bed?

48
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:51,986
Yes, he can get checked in after 6 p.m.

49
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,864
Check in today and let's book
the surgery as soon as we can.

50
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:57,116
-Is it serious?
-Yes.

51
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:01,663
If the infected mass is small,

52
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:03,831
antibiotics can be used to break it down.

53
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:07,001
From your ultrasound, the infected mass
is big and dangling.

54
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,753
We can't tell when it will fall off.

55
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,172
If it goes to the brain,
it causes a stroke.

56
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,007
If it goes to the heart,
it causes a heart attack.

57
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,967
You need to have surgery soon.

58
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:17,679
Do we have an opening for surgery
in two or three days?

59
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:20,556
No, we're full.
There's no opening this week.

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,726
We'll do it in the morning if we must.
Call Anesthesiology

61
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,521
and ask them to help me
with the surgery in two or three days.

62
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,022
Okay.

63
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:32,568
Doctor, my daughter
is getting married in three days.

64
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,071
Can we postpone the surgery
until next week?

65
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:36,698
No, we cannot.

66
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:39,450
It's only for a couple of days.

67
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,870
-Wouldn't that be okay?
-No.

68
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:44,914
Only if you want to end your life.

69
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,376
Dad, what are you talking about?
Don't be foolish.

70
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,545
My wedding isn't what's important now.

71
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:52,964
You can look at the wedding photos.

72
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:54,674
Ask her to take lots of photos.

73
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:58,010
Then I'll see you tomorrow
during my rounds.

74
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:02,223
Let me go over what you need to do.

75
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:06,602
First, head to the left
and have your blood sample drawn.

76
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:08,563
Why is that doctor so rude?

77
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,941
I am sorry. We are well aware of that.

78
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:14,986
Second, get an EKG from the room

79
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,780
right next to where you have
your blood sample drawn.

80
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:19,157
-And third...
-Well...

81
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,784
Aged 78. His name is Im Gi-yeong.

82
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,454
He underwent coiling a month ago
due to an SAH.

83
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:27,790
He showed symptoms of leg weakness
and dementia three days ago

84
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:29,292
so he was readmitted.

85
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,711
His CT scan revealed that
he has hydrocephalus.

86
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:36,466
It seems the IVH that was accompanied
by SAH is gone for now.

87
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:37,467
EVD...

88
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:41,387
That's not it. I'm sorry.

89
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:45,391
I think we should perform a VP shunt.

90
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:47,935
Shouldn't you have that memorized by now?

91
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:49,771
You're right.

92
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:52,732
-Are you sure he needs a VP shunt?
-Yes.

93
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:56,444
No.

94
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:00,281
-Is he wrong?
-Yes, I think so.

95
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:03,201
Really? I think he's right.

96
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,456
You have until my next round.

97
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:10,875
Prepare a summary of relevant papers
and surgical cases.

98
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:11,959
Okay.

99
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:13,586
-You, too.
-Okay.

100
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:21,761
Professor Chae, have you had lunch yet?

101
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:23,554
We got a new restaurant to deliver to us.

102
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:25,723
-Which one?
-A seafood stew restaurant.

103
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,475
That's too much for delivery food.

104
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:29,769
They also do a wonderful <i>haemulpajeon.</i>

105
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:31,854
Join us. We'll set it up in the office.

106
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:34,315
Go ahead without me.
I'll eat with the guys.

107
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:35,525
The guys?

108
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:36,567
GONGNYONG RIDGE

109
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:37,985
SONG-HWA: LUNCH?
SEOK-HYEONG: OKAY

110
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,446
GIVE ME A MINUTE

111
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,659
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT OF MY LIFE

112
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,515
Gyeo-ul, residents rarely get to see
a mesocaval shunt in person.

113
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:09,559
-What are you doing?
-I told you not to talk.

114
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:11,352
-Get out of here.
-Let's play fair.

115
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:12,770
-What are you doing?
-Don't do anything.

116
00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:14,730
-Should I start talking, too?
-Well...

117
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:16,399
I...

118
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,655
-I decided--
-It's seafood stew.

119
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:25,116
-I'm allergic to--
-Song-hwa wants seafood stew.

120
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,035
We're waiting for Gyeo-ul
so you come here and be quiet.

121
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:29,745
Gyeo-ul?

122
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:34,458
It's all right. There's no pressure.

123
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,294
Take your pick.

124
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:38,504
-Of course.
-We understand.

125
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:41,090
-We're all fine.
-We understand everything.

126
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:42,925
Then...

127
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:49,181
I choose HPD.

128
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:50,933
-Come on!
-My gosh.

129
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:54,312
Come on. A hemicolectomy
is a great choice, too.

130
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:56,480
-My gosh.
-Darn it.

131
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:58,608
The guardians must be here too.

132
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,111
-Goodness.
-I mean... Why is it you again?

133
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:03,237
I don't know.

134
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:06,365
Let's go. Song-hwa ordered
some big-eyed herring too.

135
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:07,325
And Jun-wan?

136
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:10,036
He's in PICU now.
I guess he won't be joining us.

137
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,997
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

138
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,543
What's Hui-dong's weight today?

139
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:18,961
It's three kilograms.

140
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:32,683
I can close him up now. Let's get ready.

141
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:36,270
Where's Jae-hak?

142
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:39,065
He went out to get
the med students earlier.

143
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:42,068
Right. I guess he's more suited to that.

144
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:43,277
Let's get started.

145
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,740
CS has a lot of emergency surgeries.
And our cases are the most dramatic.

146
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,576
Someone who was fine in the morning

147
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,161
could be dead by the afternoon in CS.

148
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:56,082
Do you know
who the best cardiothoracic surgeon is?

149
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:58,834
Ji Sung.

150
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:02,004
-Who?
-Ji Sung from <i>New Heart.</i>

151
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:03,756
I've watched medical dramas
since I was ten.

152
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:05,549
Not him.

153
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:07,510
Teacher Kim from <i>Dr. Romantic?</i>

154
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,347
Were your names Cheol and Mi-ae?

155
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,516
-We're Hong-do and Yun-bok.
-Hong-do and Yun-bok.

156
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,850
Guys, listen up.

157
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:17,937
Great doctors like them
don't exist at this hospital.

158
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:20,898
There's only Thanos here.

159
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:22,733
You'll meet him soon.

160
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:28,447
-Yes, sir.
<i>-Where are you now?</i>

161
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:30,408
I'm on my way.

162
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:44,005
-Will they perform the surgery here?
-Yes.

163
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:48,467
It's more dangerous to move the patient
to an OR with that many drips.

164
00:08:58,686 --> 00:08:59,979
Are you Gyeon-u and Jik-nyeo?

165
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:02,440
We're Hong-do and Yun-bok.

166
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,901
-Third year in med school?
-Yes.

167
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,196
-Pay attention.
-Okay.

168
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:11,073
Professor,

169
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:13,492
-is this surgery difficult?
-The baby will live, right?

170
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:16,370
Four days ago, he had a TGA,
transposition of the great arteries.

171
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:18,789
His heart swelling was too severe.
I couldn't close him up.

172
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:25,004
Seeing his heart today, I might
be able to close him. So, I'll do it now.

173
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,298
He will live, right?

174
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,258
I'm closing him up
because he's doing better.

175
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,344
Jae-hak, bring them in.

176
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:34,305
Pardon?

177
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,182
I see. Okay.

178
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:45,066
What do you think you're doing?
You'll contaminate him.

179
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:47,985
Do you have a death wish?

180
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:50,446
He means the guardians.

181
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:02,374
Sir, Chan-hyeong has a slight fever.

182
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:05,711
Since when?

183
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,589
When I checked at 8 a.m., it was 36°C.

184
00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:11,634
I checked again just now and it's
38.3°C. His nose is a little runny, too.

185
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:15,971
-Can we perform the surgery today?
-Let me see him.

186
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:29,652
His lung doesn't sound good, either.
We can't operate on him like this.

187
00:10:30,402 --> 00:10:32,863
Give me five minutes.
Remove the membrane for me.

188
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:35,449
Can I touch the baby?

189
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,909
-I disinfected my hands.
-Okay.

190
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,461
What's wrong with this baby?

191
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:50,422
Jae-hak, get Chan-hyeong's guardians now.

192
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:53,717
He has Tetralogy of Fallot.
It's a congenital heart defect.

193
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,178
He has a ventricular septal defect,
pulmonary stenosis,

194
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:58,931
right ventricular hypertrophy,
and overriding aorta, all together.

195
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:01,433
We were scheduled to operate
this afternoon.

196
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:04,103
His oxygen saturation
is a little low, though.

197
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,897
He's showing symptoms of pneumonia.

198
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,026
He needs this surgery as soon as possible.

199
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:13,154
They are here.

200
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,743
Flex.

201
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:23,943
Flex.

202
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:31,867
I have bad news.

203
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,578
We need to postpone the surgery
by a day or two.

204
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:37,331
He has a fever
and his lung doesn't sound good.

205
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:40,542
I plan to reschedule after taking
an X-ray of his lungs.

206
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,462
He's still finding it hard to breathe.

207
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:46,423
He might be in more pain
if we rush into surgery.

208
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:48,717
We'll do that, then.

209
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:53,263
If it's a mild case of pneumonia,
he'll recover in two to three days.

210
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,057
We'll observe him for a few days.

211
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:58,602
Do you have any questions?

212
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:00,479
No.

213
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,651
You'll reschedule the surgery
and let us know, right?

214
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:08,237
We know. You explained already.

215
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:10,531
Okay, then.

216
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:17,371
My gosh, they seem so composed.
Their son's life is at stake.

217
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,999
They are just immature.
Did you see how young his mother is?

218
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,167
She was born in 2000.

219
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:24,378
I like that she's calm.

220
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:28,090
Do you think it's possible
that she's not herself right now

221
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:31,093
because of the pressure she's under
and she needs to escape from reality?

222
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:32,553
She's still very young.

223
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,889
Maybe she's having trouble
coming to terms with her situation.

224
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:36,807
-Jae-hak.
-Yes?

225
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:39,893
Why do you talk so much?

226
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:43,564
Mind your own business.

227
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:45,983
Okay.

228
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:52,197
Let's get going.

229
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,077
Hey, little baby.

230
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,705
Don't be sick.

231
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:25,898
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

232
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:29,735
I feel dizzy.

233
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:40,078
-It's Ik-jun's favorite song.
-It's <i>my</i> favorite song.

234
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:42,956
-No, it's <i>my</i> song.
-If you lie down after eating,

235
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,291
you'll get reflux esophagitis.

236
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:47,002
Song-hwa. Did your eyes get worse?

237
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,296
We had the same eyesight
but now I can't see.

238
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:50,756
Try removing your contacts.

239
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,424
What's taking Jun-wan so long?

240
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:54,760
Guys, I haven't told you this yet,

241
00:13:54,843 --> 00:13:56,136
but I sing this song really well.

242
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,931
I kept quiet until now
because of the fuss you guys make.

243
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:01,683
Do you want to go to a karaoke?
Is that it?

244
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:04,353
What do you say?
Should we go tonight? Oh, good.

245
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:07,397
-Anything for me?
-Of course. Come, sit down.

246
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:11,109
-That was quick.
-Yes.

247
00:14:11,193 --> 00:14:13,946
It was a delayed sternal closure.
Do you have ketchup?

248
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:15,906
You have all sorts of stuff.

249
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,367
It came with the food.

250
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:24,498
Please, stop wiping the table.
You should see a shrink.

251
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,166
If I don't, there will be flies.

252
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,460
Put that down before I smack you.

253
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:31,547
Hey.

254
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:34,299
-Did you guys know?
-What?

255
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:35,259
What?

256
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,719
I can sing this song really well.

257
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:40,138
Isn't this "Aloha" by Cool?

258
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:42,641
I made a lot of girls cry with this song.

259
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:44,768
Right. In Hawaii.

260
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:47,437
-This is good.
-Hawaii?

261
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:49,147
-Don't.
-What about it?

262
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:50,065
-What?
-What?

263
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:54,903
-Something happened in Hawaii, right?
-You bet.

264
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:56,488
Hey, he...

265
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:59,157
He was in Hawaii for a month
after his medical board exam.

266
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,909
Stop moving about.

267
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:02,411
-Ouch.
-You're all over the place.

268
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,497
He's been famous for that
since high school.

269
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:07,583
He was friends with everyone
in ten different classes.

270
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,043
He was noisy, easily distracted
and moved about constantly.

271
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:12,754
I don't know how he always got
the top grades in school.

272
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:16,091
That's what kids today call
being "on fleek."

273
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:17,384
And he's "unfleek."

274
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,721
I'm trying to listen to the song.

275
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:22,389
You annoying prick.

276
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,809
Did you pick
Professor Lee's surgery again?

277
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:27,936
-Yes.
-Gyeo-ul.

278
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:30,939
Do you like Professor Lee?

279
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:32,524
Yes.

280
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,235
I like Professor Lee.

281
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:38,697
He has a kid.

282
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:41,241
So what?

283
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,911
Nothing.

284
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,044
Have we ever performed "Aloha"?

285
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:54,671
No, we have not.
We never performed a show.

286
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,381
At least, we had a conscience.

287
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:57,799
Hey, do you remember?

288
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:01,178
We practiced all night
to perform a show with this song.

289
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:04,473
But that jerk registered our band
as a comedy team.

290
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:07,476
And that jerk told us
on the day of the festival.

291
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:10,145
He said we weren't on the poster
because we were a secret weapon.

292
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:11,730
Gosh, that idiot.

293
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:14,149
He's lucky he's a doctor.
Otherwise, he'd be a fraud.

294
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:16,401
Our band was closer
to a comedy than a music show.

295
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:19,821
I saved you guys from getting
beaten up by the audience.

296
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:21,615
-Come on.
-But still,

297
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,367
we improved a lot in three to four years.

298
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,743
We did well given our situation.

299
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:26,995
Besides, you guys were scared.

300
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:29,956
When you found out about the show,
your hands shook for a week.

301
00:16:30,082 --> 00:16:32,668
-I thought he had hand tremors.
-Gosh.

302
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:35,003
I was worried he might not be able
to finish his internship

303
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,839
-with those shaky hands.
-Stop making stories up.

304
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:41,551
Did we suck that bad?
I thought we were pretty good.

305
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,680
Performing on stage
is a different matter altogether.

306
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:46,264
It was like <i>Gag Concert.</i>

307
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:49,434
Ik-jun got so mad while he tried
to teach you to play the bass guitar.

308
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:51,853
Damn it. I'm still angry about that.

309
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:54,606
Hey, I wasn't that bad.

310
00:16:55,107 --> 00:16:59,403
Besides...
He's good but he was a terrible teacher.

311
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:03,573
Even so, I like Ik-jun's voice.

312
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:04,700
There you go. Good one.

313
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,952
I'll sing for you guys today.

314
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:09,663
Let's go to karaoke after work.

315
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:12,791
If we had time to go to karaoke,
we wouldn't be here eating seafood stew.

316
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,710
I have VSD surgery.

317
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:16,461
I have a conference with the PED tonight.

318
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:17,838
I'm grocery shopping with Mom.

319
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:19,423
What about this weekend?

320
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,091
I'm golfing
with the director and chairman.

321
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,760
-A half-marathon. It's been a while.
-I'm going camping.

322
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,264
I'm getting my nails done with Mom.

323
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,515
Fine, we won't go.

324
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:32,352
You guys are ridiculous.

325
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,690
Do you think I've got nothing better
to do than go to karaoke with you?

326
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,900
I'm busy, too.

327
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:41,570
I need to watch a movie
and do some coloring with U-ju.

328
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:43,947
We need to eat loach soup, too.

329
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,033
I won't go. I'm not going! Gosh.

330
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:50,287
-He'll probably go, right?
-One hundred percent.

331
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:54,207
SU KARAOKE

332
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,002
-Guess where we are, U-ju.
-Is that a nightclub?

333
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:00,547
-Who taught you that word?
-Aunt did.

334
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,550
Aunt Terminator told me

335
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:07,554
that you lived at a place called
nightclub a long time ago.

336
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:09,431
Nightclub Rat.

337
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:13,852
That's true.

338
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:17,522
Your dad used to live in an apartment
named "Nightclub."

339
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:19,649
But this isn't that apartment.

340
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:23,487
This place is...
You know that I'm in a band, right?

341
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:26,740
Like in <i>Super Wings,</i>
I sing, dance, and put on shows.

342
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:28,074
I'm just like them.

343
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,578
And this is the first place
I ever performed.

344
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,582
You could say that I spent my youth here.

345
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:36,666
U-ju.

346
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:38,835
Suddenly...

347
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:42,130
I feel a bit overwhelmed.

348
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:49,137
Dad. Please buy me one more corn dog.

349
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,100
The corn dog...
Have you finished that already?

350
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,143
Yes.

351
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,772
Okay. Let's go before the stall closes.
All right.

352
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,608
-Is the corn dog that good?
-Yes.

353
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:04,903
Hey, U-ju.

354
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:07,614
You only say "please"
when you want something from me.

355
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:09,991
No, that's not true. That's news to me.

356
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:12,369
What? Where did you learn that?

357
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,454
-Mom.
-My gosh.

358
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:17,457
<i>I stayed up all night</i>

359
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:23,255
<i>Seeing you smile makes me happy</i>

360
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:26,800
<i>Even if you're just joking</i>

361
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:28,468
Hey.

362
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:31,388
Sorry. I was trying to reserve a song,
but I ended up canceling it.

363
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:33,723
-Liar.
-That's right. I lied.

364
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,811
Hey, wake up.

365
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:40,730
What's wrong with him?

366
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,275
He took three calming pills this morning.

367
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,110
Because of the show?

368
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:47,946
Seok-hyeong is a hermit and
a sociophobe, who lives in isolation.

369
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,323
-My gosh, what was the last one?
-A coward.

370
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:52,951
Yes. With that, he was known
as the Grand Slammer.

371
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:56,371
Hey, it's my turn!

372
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:59,124
I requested something.
Give me a second.

373
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,459
Listen. It should be me, Seok-hyeong,

374
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:04,296
Ik-jun, Jun-wan, then Song-hwa.
So it's my turn to sing.

375
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:06,882
Are you actually keeping count?
Are you some kind of a pervert?

376
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:08,341
Where's Ik-jun?

377
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,927
We're here because of him.

378
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:13,972
My goodness. What is this song?

379
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:14,890
"ALOHA" BY COOL

380
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,893
-Did you pick this song?
-No, I didn't.

381
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:19,686
Then, who did?

382
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:27,485
<i>A candle in the dark</i>

383
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:32,032
<i>A wineglass filled with our promise</i>

384
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:37,662
<i>I will always stay by your side</i>
<i>And protect you</i>

385
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:41,124
<i>After all, you believed in me</i>

386
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:46,379
<i>I'll ask only one thing from you</i>

387
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,926
<i>I'm dreaming</i>
<i>To be eternally happy with you</i>

388
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:56,348
<i>It doesn't have to be fancy</i>
<i>I don't need a perfect life</i>

389
00:20:56,431 --> 00:21:00,185
<i>The only thing I want is you</i>

390
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:01,561
<i>Don't worry</i>

391
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:02,687
<i>I believe</i>

392
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:03,939
<i>Always</i>

393
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:05,273
<i>I believe</i>

394
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:09,486
<i>I will always remember this moment</i>

395
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:10,862
<i>In my arms</i>

396
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:12,489
<i>-I believe</i>
-Sit down, guys.

397
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,366
Don't get too excited. Sit down.

398
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:19,371
<i>I will make sure</i>
<i>Your smile lights up forever</i>

399
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:21,414
<i>'Cause your love is so sweet</i>

400
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,875
<i>You are my everything</i>

401
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:27,629
<i>I am not saying this because I am happy</i>

402
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:30,590
<i>To spend our first night together</i>

403
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:33,301
<i>I will not change</i>

404
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:36,763
<i>I will only have eyes for you</i>

405
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:40,183
<i>You're light of my life</i>

406
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:42,727
<i>You're the one in my life</i>

407
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:46,731
<i>Even if I lose everything</i>

408
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:49,192
<i>I won't regret this</i>

409
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,237
<i>I will always love you</i>

410
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,325
<i>With my everlasting love for you</i>

411
00:21:57,742 --> 00:21:58,910
"From this moment on,

412
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:02,497
the most important person
in my life isn't me but you.

413
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:05,250
I cannot show my determination with words,

414
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,252
but I love only you.

415
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:09,504
-Like friends
-You said he was shy.

416
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:11,131
-or like couples,
-Too much medication.

417
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:15,093
until my last breath,
I will only love you."

418
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:19,514
<i>As we believe we are of one</i>

419
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:23,768
<i>And as we always trust one another</i>

420
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:27,105
-Stay on beat.
<i>-I hope we will comfort each other</i>

421
00:22:27,188 --> 00:22:29,441
<i>In misery and celebrate</i>

422
00:22:29,524 --> 00:22:33,611
<i>-Happiness together</i>
-Hey, slowly.

423
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:35,989
<i>-I promise you</i>
<i>-I believe</i>

424
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:38,533
<i>-When things get hard</i>
<i>-I believe</i>

425
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:42,620
<i>I'll be your protector</i>

426
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,165
<i>-When you smile in my arms</i>
<i>-I believe</i>

427
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,126

HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

444
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,399
<i>-At seven o'clock, let's meet up!</i>
<i>-Let's meet up!</i>

445
00:23:53,483 --> 00:23:54,901
<i>Hello, this is Lee Soo-geun.</i>

446
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:56,444
<i>Hey, Ji-won, say hello.</i>

447
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:58,613
<i>Hello. I'm Ji-won.</i>

448
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:01,950
<i>Ji-won, I looked at the calendar</i>
<i>for May today.</i>

449
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,827
<i>I noticed there are</i>
<i>so many holidays in May.</i>

450
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,329
<i>-There's a holiday for you, too.</i>
<i>-Children's Day!</i>

451
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:09,040
<i>That's right. There's Children's Day</i>
<i>and there's Parents' Day.</i>

452
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:11,251
<i>And Teachers' Day as well!</i>
<i>There are so many!</i>

453
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:13,002
<i>Are you trying to sell something?</i>

454
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:15,338
<i>We're discussing holidays.</i>
<i>You sound like a street peddler.</i>

455
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,424
<i>But there's one thing that disappoints me.</i>
<i>There's no holiday for myself.</i>

456
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,052
<i>Come on, Soo-geun.</i>
<i>You do whatever you want every day.</i>

457
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:22,679
<i>-What do you mean?</i>
<i>-Every single day.</i>

458
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:26,558
<i>What if you could do only the things</i>
<i>you want to do for one day?</i>

459
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:29,102
<i>How about we try to live today like that?</i>

460
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,146
<i>May is the perfect month for that.</i>

461
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:34,983
<i>Here's our first song.</i>
<i>It's a song by Cool. It's in English.</i>

462
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:37,318
<i>-Ji-won.</i>
<i>-"One Summer Drive".</i>

463
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:40,613
"One Summer Drive."

464
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:55,712
Over here!

465
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:00,592
One, two.

466
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:03,344
-Let's do this!
-Let's go!

467
00:25:06,431 --> 00:25:08,349
-Good luck.
-Let's complete the run!

468
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:15,398
<i>You have one minute before we start!</i>

469
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:21,863
<i>I try to get rid of your scent in the wind</i>

470
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,327
<i>Get going, it doesn't matter where</i>

471
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:29,245
Hello, sir. I'm here.

472
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:32,123
You can park your car in B-104.
It's empty now.

473
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:33,750
Okay. Thank you.

474
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:49,474
<i>Good luck with your records!</i>

475
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:55,104
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

476
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:27,637
Shouldn't we send him
to a mental hospital or something?

477
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:30,390
-You are right.
-Goodness.

478
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:34,686
HYEON-HO MIGHT HAVE SURGICAL BLEEDING.

RESIDENT YONG SEOK-MIN

YEONINSAN CAMPSITE, B-104

481
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:49,677
Look at that. Nice shot!

482
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,305
-Nice shot.
-He's good.

483
00:27:54,182 --> 00:27:56,809
Isn't it hard to handle VIP patients
on top of your regular patients?

484
00:27:56,893 --> 00:27:59,312
No, it's doable.
There are other doctors, too.

485
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:02,315
It's nice to see a young doctor like you.

486
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:03,900
I envy your friendship, too.

487
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,319
Jong-su, the tenth hole is too far.

488
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,945
Let's take the cart.

489
00:28:14,118 --> 00:28:15,745
He's my cousin.

490
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:18,539
-That's supposed to be a secret.
-Everyone knows.

491
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:21,000
-Everyone at the hospital knows.
-No.

492
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,127
Not everyone knows.

493
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:25,421
Hey, you know what?

494
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:30,301
People know even the things
you assume they have no idea about.

495
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:36,641
Hey, I'm tired too. Let's take the cart.

496
00:28:36,724 --> 00:28:39,018
-Let's just walk.
-Take the cart.

497
00:28:39,102 --> 00:28:40,728
Let's walk.

498
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,438
Are you upset?

499
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,410
How much did you prescribe?

500
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:57,245
What about the IO?

501
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:00,373
Okay. I'll be there soon.

502
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:05,086
Thank you.

503
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:09,340
<i>-You and me.</i>
<i>-A scamming phone call.</i>

504
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:15,054
<i>"Sir, I need you</i>
<i>to go to an ATM right now."</i>

505
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,557
Professor Yang.
What a surprise to see you here.

506
00:29:17,932 --> 00:29:19,684
I thought you weren't eating.

507
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:23,312
My schedule suddenly freed up.

508
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:24,564
I see.

509
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:28,151
-Professor Yang, why didn't you tell us?
-Yes?

510
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,027
About what?

511
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:32,280
You were in a comedy club during pre-med.

512
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:35,491
I was so surprised.
I didn't see it coming.

513
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:37,535
I thought you were a loner,
but you're pretty cool.

514
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,370
No, I wasn't. Who said that?

515
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:41,539
Dr. Jang told us.

516
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:44,292
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul who is
a third-year GS resident.

517
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:46,461
Hello.

518
00:29:46,544 --> 00:29:48,045
Dr. Jang. It's true, isn't it?

519
00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:52,091
You said those five professors who were
born in 1980 were in a comedy club.

520
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:54,635
-That's what I heard, too.
-From whom?

521
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,387
Professor Lee Ik-jun
of Hepatopancreatic Surgery.

522
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:57,346
I see.

523
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,893
Weren't you in the middle of your meal?

524
00:30:02,393 --> 00:30:04,103
Try some bread. It's really good.

525
00:30:04,687 --> 00:30:06,898
Okay. Dig in.

526
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:09,442
Professor Yang,
we'd love to have a meal with you.

527
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:11,319
I hear Dr. Jang buys them beef.

528
00:30:11,402 --> 00:30:14,572
Sure. Eat up.
I'll treat you to beef some other time.

529
00:30:14,655 --> 00:30:15,865
Right?

530
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,910
My gosh. I should get going.

531
00:30:18,993 --> 00:30:22,455
I just got a text message that they have
the result of the MRI I requested.

532
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:23,789
Bye, then.

533
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,333
-Okay.
-Okay.

534
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,251
-Bye.
-Bye.

535
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:28,920
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

536
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:29,837
Goodness. Bye.

537
00:30:32,256 --> 00:30:36,219
Tae-in, did you get any MRI requests
from ob-gyn today?

538
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,471
No, there's none.
I just checked before I came down here.

539
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:41,265
Gosh, what is with him?

540
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:43,351
How does he get along with other people?

541
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:46,771
Professor Yang is good
at what he does, though.

542
00:30:47,063 --> 00:30:50,024
He's not authoritative,
and he always does his work.

543
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:52,944
-I like him.
-Is that how things work in America?

544
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:56,113
I heard he did
his fellowship in the States.

545
00:30:56,364 --> 00:30:57,865
Is it the merit of individualism?

546
00:30:57,949 --> 00:31:00,034
Tell me how that's considered merit.

547
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:02,036
He's just a frustrating sloth.

548
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:04,872
I just wish he would talk at least.

549
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:06,624
I can never read what he's thinking.

550
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:13,130
Dr. Jang, who's that? Your boyfriend?

551
00:31:13,214 --> 00:31:15,174
-Even his photo makes you that happy?
-Yes, it does.

552
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:18,094
-Yes. It does make me happy.
-My gosh.

553
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:20,012
I'll get going now.

554
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:29,814
An ambulance brought her in
due to a severe stomachache.

555
00:31:29,897 --> 00:31:31,816
According to the X-ray scan,
it could be an ileus.

556
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:34,318
We called you because
she had a liver transplant before.

557
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,821
She released gas and had diarrhea
while waiting.

558
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:39,490
Good work. Can you bend your knees for me?

559
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:43,077
I'm sorry, doctor. It's the weekend.

560
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,080
Gyu-bin, you know I'm always on call.
Give me a second.

561
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:51,544
You had diarrhea and released gas, right?

562
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:55,131
Yes. But it doesn't hurt at all now.

563
00:31:55,423 --> 00:31:58,342
I thought I was going to die
in the ambulance.

564
00:31:58,426 --> 00:32:02,054
As soon as I saw your face,
the pain disappeared completely.

565
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:05,224
-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay. You're recovering.

566
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:09,353
But Gyu-bin, I'm really sorry
about the scar.

567
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:12,565
That's nothing. I'm just glad
to be back in school.

568
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:14,150
Goodness.

569
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:18,613
Can I take a scan quickly?

570
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:19,864
-Yes.
-Okay.

571
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:22,617
I knew it. See?

572
00:32:23,534 --> 00:32:26,537
I knew you would be here.
Is this the golf course?

573
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:28,080
Jeez. Take a look at this.

574
00:32:28,164 --> 00:32:30,958
What is it? I don't have much time.

575
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,420
I've had revision surgery. They're
closing up now, so I need to get back.

576
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,796
It won't take long.

577
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:38,591
This teenage patient had an LDLT.

578
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:40,760
It's not as visible with steroids,

579
00:32:41,218 --> 00:32:43,971
but the hypertrophy on the vertical scar
is a bit too noticeable.

580
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:46,390
Can you refer this case to a scar clinic?

581
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:47,683
Sure.

582
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,395
Send her to my department.
I'll take a look.

583
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:54,899
My gosh.

584
00:32:55,816 --> 00:32:58,611
Ik-sun also has biliary atresia.

585
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:01,489
She still has a big scar on her stomach
from Kasai's operation.

586
00:33:01,572 --> 00:33:03,074
Ik-sun's still alive?

587
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:05,743
What? Why would she be dead?

588
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:07,078
Wasn't that your dog's name?

589
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,789
-That's Micky.
-Micky is your sister.

590
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:11,749
-My sister is Ik-sun.
-That's your dog.

591
00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:12,958
My dog's name is Ik-sun.

592
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:14,960
No, my dog's name is Micky.
Micky is Ik-sun.

593
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:16,671
Damn it. You confused me.

594
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:19,340
My younger sister's name is Ik-sun.

595
00:33:19,423 --> 00:33:20,883
Hey, what is this?

596
00:33:25,262 --> 00:33:27,014
This is a recommendation letter
for priests.

597
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:28,057
Right?

598
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,934
-It's for real this time, right?
-Yes.

599
00:33:30,017 --> 00:33:31,727
I feel bad for Jeong-won's mother.

600
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:33,813
Same. That jerk.

601
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,982
-Is it Jeong-won?
-No, it's my wife.

602
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:38,526
Your wife? You have a wife?

603
00:33:40,277 --> 00:33:41,278
Yes, I have a wife.

604
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:43,531
The ambitious Ms. Yuk Hye-jeong?

605
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:45,408
She's so busy, I'll forget her face
pretty soon.

606
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:46,325
That's enough.

607
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:48,994
Hey, honey. It's been so long!

608
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:51,664
What time is it over there?

609
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:53,582
Okay.

610
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:56,127
Is your marathon course here?

611
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:59,088
-Tell me which hole this room counts as.
-Yes.

612
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:02,133
Okay.

613
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:03,801
-It's his wife.
-Okay.

614
00:34:04,385 --> 00:34:05,428
-Really?
-Okay. Sure.

615
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,346
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

616
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,765
She's coming back tomorrow.

617
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:11,642
She's coming straight to the hospital
because she misses me.

618
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:13,644
It's because it's Children's Day
in two days.

619
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:16,439
-Has it been a year since you saw her?
-A year and a half.

620
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:19,066
She should've been here
for her mom's anniversary at least.

621
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,819
Whatever! That's not my business.

622
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:23,487
Gosh, Yuk Hye-jeong.

623
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:26,115
She's my friend
and I was the one who set him up with her.

624
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:29,493
I have never seen anyone
who is as ambitious as she is.

625
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,912
I've never seen you
badmouth anyone either.

626
00:34:31,996 --> 00:34:34,165
Stop it. She's my wife.
And she's U-ju's mother.

627
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:36,083
The virgin and the bachelor
should shut it.

628
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:38,085
That's such an outdated term.
A "bachelor."

629
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:40,629
Hey, Jeong-won. What is this?

630
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:47,094
Are you really going to quit
to become a priest?

631
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:50,181
-Did you RSVP?
-Is that important right now?

632
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,308
Listen. If you...

633
00:34:53,517 --> 00:34:54,560
Hey, Gyeo-ul.

634
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:58,355
Of course.
I collected a lot of those. Yes.

635
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,441
-Okay. I got it.
-When is it?

636
00:35:00,524 --> 00:35:02,359
-Did you talk to the director?
-Okay.

637
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,195
I'll tell him next week.

638
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:07,239
I won't be leaving right away.

639
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:09,950
I'll stay until the end of the year
and resign then.

640
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,870
I'm going to go see Gyeo-ul.

641
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:14,997
Seriously. Wait.

642
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:19,585
Look over here. Look at the camera.

643
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:21,837
One, two, three.

644
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,381
-What was that?
-What are you doing?

645
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:27,885
Jeong-won will leave us soon.
We should leave lots of photos behind.

646
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:29,929
-Bye.
-What the...

647
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,392
Is he having an affair with Gyeo-ul?

648
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:57,039
Don't you have a photo of him alone?

649
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,251
Give me some time.
I'm waiting for the right time.

650
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,670
But Jeong-won catches on really fast.

651
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,840
Did you ask him about me?
What does he think of me?

652
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:08,217
-Not yet.
-Why not?

653
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:10,886
It'd be too obvious. Is that okay?

654
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,138
Yes. I don't mind.

655
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:15,558
So, please ask him what he thinks of me.

656
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,810
Why don't you tell him you like him then?

657
00:36:20,354 --> 00:36:21,188
That's too...

658
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:24,900
-I'm too shy to do that.
-Gosh.

659
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,528
-But you're not shy talking to me?
-No.

660
00:36:29,196 --> 00:36:32,783
Okay, fine. I'll be extra sneaky

661
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:34,910
and ask him what he thinks of you.

662
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:37,663
I'm doing this
because I think highly of your courage.

663
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,421
This is <i>yukjeon.</i> It's from Gwangju.

664
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:48,716
Oh, my. Are you serious? <i>Yukjeon?</i>

665
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,140
Why do you like Jeong-won so much?

666
00:36:57,474 --> 00:36:58,726
Everything.

667
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,644
Do you need water?

668
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:02,730
I'm fine.

669
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:05,232
Gyeo-ul.

670
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,986
I think you have this fantasy
about Jeong-won.

671
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:12,781
The way he treats people at the hospital

672
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:15,075
and the way he behaves around us
are very different.

673
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,870
What is he like?
I want to hear everything.

674
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:20,080
He's so sensitive.

675
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:23,459
He loses sleep for a month
if something goes wrong with his patient.

676
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:25,461
He's so humanitarian.

677
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:28,088
And he's extremely stubborn.

678
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:29,256
He is a man of principles.

679
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:31,675
And he's not rich. He's dirt poor.

680
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,344
He mooches off Jun-wan.

681
00:37:33,928 --> 00:37:35,346
Isn't that <i>noblesse oblige?</i>

682
00:37:35,846 --> 00:37:37,556
Are we playing a game of antonyms?

683
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:41,644
What else? Tell me everything.

684
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:45,230
Most importantly, he...

685
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:47,650
Gosh.

686
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:49,944
Dating...

687
00:37:50,027 --> 00:37:52,071
No. He's not interested in women.

688
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:55,574
I have never seen him with a girl, ever.

689
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,537
This is for your ears only.

690
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:03,457
Jeong-won is interested in something else.

691
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:05,459
Is he a sexual minority?

692
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:09,046
Jeez. Not like that. I mean
he wants to be a man of God.

693
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:10,839
Not pride. A priest.

694
00:38:11,382 --> 00:38:12,883
I doubt that.

695
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:15,219
I hope so, too.

696
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:20,265
I know that Professor Ahn
is a devout Catholic.

697
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:23,060
All his brothers are priests,
and his sisters are nuns.

698
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:26,355
But he's not a priest yet.

699
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:28,315
He just wants to be one.

700
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:32,027
Then I still have a chance.

701
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:34,238
Ik-jun, give me a cigarette.

702
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:46,583
Not with Gyeo-ul of all people.

703
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:51,964
You prick, you'd better come
to your senses before I beat you up.

704
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:54,842
What are you thinking? You're married.

705
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:00,723
What?

706
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,516
What do you think of Gyeo-ul?

707
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:06,562
-What?
-What do you think of her?

708
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:17,197
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

709
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,243
SURGERY STATUS, IN WAITING

710
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,094
Hey.

711
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:41,263
Dad just came down.

712
00:39:51,023 --> 00:39:53,776
Before we move you to the OR,
let me check a few things.

713
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:56,612
-What's your name?
-It's Jeong Su-beom.

714
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,822
Let me check your ID bracelet.

715
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:01,283
You are here today to be operated on
by Professor Kim Jun-wan

716
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:02,785
of Cardiothoracic Surgery?

717
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:03,994
Yes.

718
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:11,543
Dad. Be strong in there, okay?

719
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:14,004
Everything will be fine. Don't worry.

720
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:15,589
My sweetheart.

721
00:40:16,924 --> 00:40:18,884
I am sorry.

722
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:24,598
I can't come to your wedding
because I am sick.

723
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,060
I am so sorry, sweetie.

724
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:31,980
Why are you sorry? I am sorry, Dad.

725
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:35,984
How could I get married when you're sick?

726
00:40:37,194 --> 00:40:38,403
I'm sorry.

727
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:56,839
Hello.

728
00:40:58,215 --> 00:41:00,926
We're going to move
the patient into the OR now.

729
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:04,012
How have you been?

730
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:06,265
How are you feeling?

731
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,017
Let me explain about the surgery.

732
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:11,019
As I told you,
I'll remove the infected mass

733
00:41:11,103 --> 00:41:13,230
and mold the area
with the leftover tissue.

734
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:15,524
It will take about five hours.

735
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:18,026
But it could be longer
if there's a complication.

736
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,989
Doctor, you've done
this surgery many times, right?

737
00:41:22,072 --> 00:41:23,198
Yes.

738
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:26,201
Then, we don't have
to worry too much, right?

739
00:41:26,493 --> 00:41:29,329
This surgery isn't life-threatening
or anything, right?

740
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:30,789
I cannot guarantee that.

741
00:41:30,873 --> 00:41:33,333
There are a lot of variables
during surgery.

742
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:35,335
Oh, no.

743
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:36,837
However, I will do my best.

744
00:41:44,511 --> 00:41:45,762
Jeez.

745
00:41:47,347 --> 00:41:50,517
You should have just told them
that he's going to be fine.

746
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:53,896
The patient's daughter
is getting married today.

747
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:56,523
The whole family
must already feel bad for each other.

748
00:41:57,065 --> 00:41:59,109
You should have been nicer to them.

749
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,862
You could have just told them

750
00:42:02,404 --> 00:42:05,365
that the surgery will be successful,
so they have nothing to worry about.

751
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:07,451
Couldn't you just say that?

752
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:11,288
This surgery isn't that difficult for you.

753
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:15,667
What if the patient has
periannular abscess?

754
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,421
What if he has brain damage
from an embolism during surgery?

755
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:22,049
But the chance of that happening
is very low.

756
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:24,593
He has no feelings.

757
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,803
How do feelings help with surgery?

758
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:28,889
I'll be emotional if it helps,
but it doesn't.

759
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:30,432
It doesn't help at all.

760
00:42:31,433 --> 00:42:32,476
I'm sorry.

761
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:34,311
Never talk to the patients
like that again.

762
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:36,313
"It's a simple surgery. You will live.

763
00:42:36,396 --> 00:42:39,066
This surgery will go well.
Don't worry about anything."

764
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:42,694
Don't. Got it?

765
00:42:44,112 --> 00:42:45,072
Yes.

766
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:59,253
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

767
00:43:02,464 --> 00:43:05,467
One iced Americano
with three shots, please.

768
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,219
-Hello, Professor Kim.
-Hello.

769
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:10,347
You guys are here early.
A piece of chocolate cake, too.

770
00:43:11,473 --> 00:43:13,600
We've been here
since eight in the morning.

771
00:43:13,684 --> 00:43:16,603
Is that so? That's impressive.

772
00:43:17,104 --> 00:43:18,230
-Pay with this.
-What?

773
00:43:18,605 --> 00:43:20,190
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

774
00:43:22,776 --> 00:43:24,528
Dr. Do is good to you, right?

775
00:43:24,778 --> 00:43:26,321
Yes, he's really nice.

776
00:43:26,405 --> 00:43:28,448
Goodness. I'm glad to hear that.

777
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:31,326
Can I ask you
why you chose Cardiothoracic Surgery?

778
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:35,914
It's our assignment to do an interview.
We've asked another professor as well.

779
00:43:35,998 --> 00:43:36,832
Who?

780
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:40,335
We've just started,
so we've only interviewed one professor.

781
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:42,546
It's Professor Chae Song-hwa
of Neurosurgery.

782
00:43:43,213 --> 00:43:44,339
What did she say?

783
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:47,551
She chose Neurosurgery
because she wanted to study.

784
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:49,511
There is still a lot to study
in her field.

785
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,930
I know. No one knows it better than I do.

786
00:43:52,014 --> 00:43:53,348
What about you, sir?

787
00:43:55,267 --> 00:43:57,769
Me? I went to an Internet cafe

788
00:43:57,853 --> 00:44:00,355
and a cardiothoracic surgeon I sat next to
told me to choose CS.

789
00:44:03,275 --> 00:44:05,360
-Professor, please.
-I'm serious.

790
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:07,571
I was asked whether
I wanted to make money or teach.

791
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:09,573
I said I'd prefer to teach

792
00:44:09,656 --> 00:44:10,782
and he told me to choose CS.

793
00:44:11,491 --> 00:44:12,492
That's why I'm here.

794
00:44:13,368 --> 00:44:14,369
I see.

795
00:44:15,912 --> 00:44:18,081
May I have this chocolate cake?

796
00:44:18,165 --> 00:44:19,166
No, you may not.

797
00:44:22,169 --> 00:44:24,338
-Just get one more.
-Okay.

798
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,932
Irrigation is very important.
You know that, right?

799
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:38,393
-Yes.
-Why is it important?

800
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:43,648
Well...

801
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:46,068
Through the microscope,

802
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:48,987
you can see
that it's close to the optic nerve.

803
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,700
So, a bipolar cautery
can cause thermal injuries,

804
00:44:53,784 --> 00:44:56,828
which can result in loss of vision
after the surgery.

805
00:45:06,213 --> 00:45:09,716
Ms. Nam, we should operate
on Chan-hyeong tomorrow.

806
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:13,762
Yes. His lung sounds have improved,
and the X-rays look much better.

807
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:16,056
Yes. It will be hard for him
if we keep putting it off.

808
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:17,766
His guardians are here, right?

809
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,393
Yes, I'll go bring them in.

810
00:45:23,313 --> 00:45:25,440
Jae-hak, do you happen
to have a suit here?

811
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:27,526
Yes, I always keep one at the office.

812
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:28,985
Can I borrow it?

813
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:31,988
-They went home.
-What?

814
00:45:32,572 --> 00:45:35,409
They went home,
when their child is that sick?

815
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:36,910
How can that be possible?

816
00:45:36,993 --> 00:45:39,538
Chan-hyeong's mom went home for a bit.

817
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:42,332
Both of his grandmothers are here though.

818
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:44,042
They should be in the lounge.

819
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:47,003
Shall I go bring them in?

820
00:45:47,087 --> 00:45:48,296
Yes, please.

821
00:45:49,548 --> 00:45:51,508
We've been postponing the surgery
due to pneumonia,

822
00:45:51,591 --> 00:45:53,969
but the fever has gone down,
and so has the CRP.

823
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:55,470
I think now would be the best time.

824
00:45:55,762 --> 00:45:59,224
Is the operation dangerous, doctor?

825
00:45:59,307 --> 00:46:01,435
-Are you his grandmother?
-I'm his maternal grandmother.

826
00:46:01,518 --> 00:46:03,103
-This is his paternal grandmother.
-I see.

827
00:46:03,186 --> 00:46:06,314
For now, please be informed that
we will operate tomorrow afternoon.

828
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:09,651
When his parents are back,
I'll walk them through the details.

829
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:12,904
You can just tell us instead.

830
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:14,614
His mom is only 20.

831
00:46:14,698 --> 00:46:16,450
She's clueless because she's so young.

832
00:46:16,533 --> 00:46:18,243
The same goes for my son.

833
00:46:18,326 --> 00:46:20,495
That's right.
You can just tell us, doctor.

834
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:22,205
Then I'll speak to all of you later.

835
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:24,124
His mom is still his legal guardian.

836
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:25,167
I'll see you then.

837
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:32,924
You can talk
to the grandmothers, professor.

838
00:46:33,008 --> 00:46:36,636
I'll go over everything with his mom
and get the consent form signed.

839
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,305
Don't overlook a single detail.

840
00:46:38,388 --> 00:46:40,056
-Your suit is at the office?
-Yes.

841
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,391
-What color is it?
-Color?

842
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:43,602
Yes, what color is your suit?

843
00:46:44,394 --> 00:46:46,396
Are you worried that it might be silver?

844
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:18,261
Jun-wan, are you...

845
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:20,263
Oh, boy.

846
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:22,140
Don't say anything.

847
00:47:22,224 --> 00:47:23,225
Okay.

848
00:47:26,478 --> 00:47:28,647
Are you not going to have lunch?
I'm hungry.

849
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:30,065
How about braised hairtail fish?

850
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,236
I suddenly got a craving for it
for some reason.

851
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,404
I have to go out. I'm meeting someone.

852
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:37,989
What are you going to eat?

853
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:39,324
Steak.

854
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:41,243
Gosh, I don't like steak.

855
00:47:46,748 --> 00:47:49,918
Shall I eat out, too? It's been a while.

856
00:47:53,755 --> 00:47:55,131
Hello. This is Ahn Jeong-won.

857
00:47:56,091 --> 00:47:57,801
Okay, I'll be right there.

858
00:47:58,301 --> 00:47:59,594
Gosh.

859
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:02,055
Chi-hong, can you wrap this up for me?

860
00:48:02,138 --> 00:48:03,098
Sure.

861
00:48:11,273 --> 00:48:13,275
You have to insert the Hemovac first.

862
00:48:13,608 --> 00:48:14,568
Yes.

863
00:48:19,155 --> 00:48:20,991
Are you going to keep breaking it?

864
00:48:21,575 --> 00:48:23,577
Control your strength. Be gentle with it.

865
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:26,162
Okay. I'm sorry.

866
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,790
I'll stop talking.

867
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:30,417
You should focus. I'm sorry.

868
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:31,793
It's okay.

869
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:34,796
Mr. Yuk Hui-gwan.

870
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:37,173
-Congratulations. You can go home now.
-Thank you.

871
00:48:37,257 --> 00:48:39,301
Your surgical wound has been disinfected

872
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:40,885
and wrapped in waterproof bandage.

873
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:42,637
You can take a shower right away.

874
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:46,474
As for food, you can eat normally
but please try not to overeat.

875
00:48:46,558 --> 00:48:48,518
Mom, can you transform this?

876
00:48:48,602 --> 00:48:50,729
In a bit, Won-jun. Give me a minute.

877
00:48:51,313 --> 00:48:53,523
You have an appointment booked
in a week from now.

878
00:48:53,607 --> 00:48:55,233
The biopsy results will be available then.

879
00:48:55,317 --> 00:48:57,861
If you need the diagnosis
for your insurance, just let us know.

880
00:48:57,944 --> 00:48:59,654
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

881
00:48:59,738 --> 00:49:03,074
Hurry, Mom. I want this
transformed into the robot.

882
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:07,120
Is Dr. Lee Ik-jun doing rounds today
by any chance?

883
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:09,372
I haven't had a chance
to thank him properly.

884
00:49:09,456 --> 00:49:10,665
He did such an excellent job.

885
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,000
Won-jun!

886
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:15,337
-Hello, Dr. Lee.
-Yes, hello.

887
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,213
Give me that. I'll do it for you.

888
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:18,840
My gosh.

889
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:22,552
Mr. Yuk, you don't even
look like a patient without your IV drip.

890
00:49:22,636 --> 00:49:23,678
You're handsome.

891
00:49:23,762 --> 00:49:24,804
Gosh, I'm flattered.

892
00:49:24,888 --> 00:49:26,848
You remembered his name.

893
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,433
You must have a lot of patients.

894
00:49:28,516 --> 00:49:30,602
My wife's surname is also Yuk.

895
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:33,021
Other than her, you're the only one
I know with that surname.

896
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:36,983
Actually, there's my father-in-law,
brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and niece.

897
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:38,818
Gosh, there are so many.

898
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:40,695
You're going home today, right?

899
00:49:40,779 --> 00:49:44,282
Yes. Tomorrow is Children's Day,
so I'm happy I can be home for that.

900
00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:45,825
Yes, you're right.

901
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:47,327
I can't go anywhere far.

902
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,163
We're just going to eat
at a Chinese restaurant near our place.

903
00:49:50,246 --> 00:49:51,748
Won-jun loves <i>jajangmyeon.</i>

904
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:54,584
My kid loves <i>jajangmyeon</i> too. All kids do.

905
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:57,170
You had a simple
laparoscopic cholecystectomy,

906
00:49:57,253 --> 00:49:59,381
so don't worry about
post-surgical complications.

907
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:01,091
Don't overexert yourself

908
00:50:01,174 --> 00:50:03,134
but try to walk as much as you can.

909
00:50:03,218 --> 00:50:05,011
Exercise will help you, okay?

910
00:50:05,512 --> 00:50:07,764
All right. Here you go.

911
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:10,225
Wow, who are you?

912
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:11,393
Won-jun.

913
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:13,478
You silly goose, what do you think?

914
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:16,022
I'm the one who got rid of the ouchy
from your dad's tummy.

915
00:50:16,606 --> 00:50:18,692
Goodbye.
I'll see you at your next appointment.

916
00:50:18,775 --> 00:50:20,568
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

917
00:50:20,652 --> 00:50:21,903
Say goodbye properly.

918
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:24,280
-Thank you, Dr. Lee!
-My pleasure!

919
00:50:24,364 --> 00:50:26,783
Oh, my. Look at this.

920
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:28,243
-Hello.
-Hello.

921
00:50:31,705 --> 00:50:32,664
Hello.

922
00:50:34,374 --> 00:50:35,667
Did Song-hwa scold you again?

923
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,419
-Yes.
-No.

924
00:50:37,919 --> 00:50:39,170
I guess it was you then.

925
00:50:39,254 --> 00:50:41,464
It was Chi-hong this time.

926
00:50:41,548 --> 00:50:42,674
But he said no.

927
00:50:43,216 --> 00:50:45,635
He's a tough cookie
because he has a military background.

928
00:50:46,261 --> 00:50:49,472
It happened because
I couldn't answer her questions.

929
00:50:49,597 --> 00:50:51,099
Even I thought I sounded dumb.

930
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:53,810
You graduated
from the Korea Military Academy, right?

931
00:50:53,893 --> 00:50:56,479
-Yes.
-I know someone from...

932
00:50:56,563 --> 00:50:57,814
Hello?

933
00:50:58,398 --> 00:50:59,941
Yes, where are you?

934
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:02,610
Okay, I'll head over there now. All right.

935
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:06,990
Yes, Professor.

936
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:08,658
Right.

937
00:51:09,325 --> 00:51:10,660
Yes, I got it.

938
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,413
You know the emergency patient
from the traffic accident yesterday?

939
00:51:13,496 --> 00:51:14,789
-Yes.
-We haven't operated

940
00:51:14,873 --> 00:51:17,208
because of unstable vitals
and severe bleeding.

941
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:18,501
But it seems Professor Chae

942
00:51:18,585 --> 00:51:20,670
-will perform the surgery tonight.
-I see.

943
00:51:20,754 --> 00:51:22,964
-There will be a meeting later.
-Okay, great.

944
00:51:23,256 --> 00:51:25,717
-"Great"? Really?
-Yes.

945
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,510
She totally put you on the spot earlier.

946
00:51:27,677 --> 00:51:30,096
She was just asking questions.

947
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,307
I wanted to work on that case anyway.

948
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,810
I was hoping to be assigned
in assisting Professor Chae for the case.

949
00:51:35,935 --> 00:51:37,270
This is perfect.

950
00:51:37,604 --> 00:51:39,564
-Dr. Ahn.
-Yes.

951
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,900
Why don't you get a cranial CT scan?

952
00:51:43,777 --> 00:51:45,528
Sure, if there's an employee discount.

953
00:52:04,756 --> 00:52:06,508
Sounds good. We'll do that.

954
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,053
You should take a nap

955
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:11,429
and I'll see you guys tonight.

956
00:52:11,513 --> 00:52:12,514
Okay.

957
00:52:15,642 --> 00:52:18,770
She was going to do that
with the surgery anyway.

958
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:20,146
You know that's not what matters.

959
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,273
What matters to her
is whether we knew it or not.

960
00:52:28,488 --> 00:52:29,447
There are roses.

961
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:31,658
Is it already the season for roses?

962
00:52:33,076 --> 00:52:35,203
Dr. Yong, you're very observant.

963
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:36,746
My family has a flower shop.

964
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,706
Everyone knows what roses look like.

965
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:39,958
Not really. These days,

966
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:42,794
many people don't know
the names of plants and flowers.

967
00:52:49,008 --> 00:52:50,677
Are they fake flowers?

968
00:52:58,685 --> 00:53:01,062
That's just wrong.

969
00:53:05,024 --> 00:53:08,194
I'm just realizing that it's been
a long time since I saw real flowers.

970
00:53:08,862 --> 00:53:11,406
Professor Chae,
are you going camping again this weekend?

971
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:12,532
Yes, why do you ask?

972
00:53:12,615 --> 00:53:13,992
Can we join?

973
00:53:14,117 --> 00:53:16,452
You can come, right?
You're not working this weekend.

974
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,496
Can we join?

975
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,583
Yes, you can.
But do you guys really want to come?

976
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,750
Yes.

977
00:53:23,001 --> 00:53:25,461
You keep us on our toes,

978
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:27,463
but you don't make us uncomfortable.

979
00:53:27,714 --> 00:53:30,592
Gosh, Seok-min. My goodness.

980
00:53:31,384 --> 00:53:32,635
I just can't hate you.

981
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:34,137
You annoy me here and there,

982
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,722
but you don't make me uncomfortable.

983
00:53:37,432 --> 00:53:39,893
Okay, let's do it.
There, you can see real roses

984
00:53:39,976 --> 00:53:41,603
as well as butterflies.

985
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,520
I'm off.

986
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,111
Did you order?

987
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:51,821
The coffee here is very good.

988
00:53:52,322 --> 00:53:53,323
Do you want some cake?

989
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:56,326
Can we go somewhere quiet?

990
00:53:57,493 --> 00:54:00,038
-What?
-I have to talk to you about something.

991
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:06,461
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

992
00:54:10,506 --> 00:54:11,591
Ho-jun.

993
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:13,927
Go get changed.

994
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,930
I brought a T-shirt
and a pair of pants for you.

995
00:54:17,013 --> 00:54:18,640
The visiting hours will begin shortly.

996
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:20,391
I'll get changed after I see Dad.

997
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:23,853
Gosh, you still have 20 to 30 minutes.

998
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:27,774
Hey, I see some chairs over there.
Let's go sit down.

999
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:29,067
Okay.

1000
00:54:30,276 --> 00:54:31,694
She must be out of her mind.

1001
00:54:33,529 --> 00:54:37,116
I can't believe this.
Did she cancel her honeymoon?

1002
00:54:37,325 --> 00:54:39,410
Eun-bin! We're here.

1003
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:45,792
Hey, don't be like that.

1004
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,335
Everything went well.

1005
00:54:51,464 --> 00:54:53,257
Jin-hui is a good photographer.

1006
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:55,009
No, it's my camera.

1007
00:54:55,093 --> 00:54:57,220
Downloading all the photos
would be a nuisance,

1008
00:54:57,303 --> 00:54:59,097
so I told her to use my phone
to take photos.

1009
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:02,183
Oh, your uncle was there too.

1010
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,395
He said he wouldn't be able to make it.

1011
00:55:05,478 --> 00:55:07,939
Oh, who's this?

1012
00:55:09,065 --> 00:55:11,859
Isn't he the doctor
who performed your dad's surgery?

1013
00:55:11,943 --> 00:55:13,820
Eun-bin,
Dad's doctor came to your wedding?

1014
00:55:13,903 --> 00:55:15,029
Yes.

1015
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:15,947
When?

1016
00:55:16,698 --> 00:55:19,534
He was the first one
to stop by the bride's room.

1017
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:21,786
What's with that face though?

1018
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:24,497
He didn't even take a picture.
He just ate and left.

1019
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:25,915
Come on. Be grateful that he came.

1020
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:28,334
He asked me about the main course.
I told him it's <i>galbitang.</i>

1021
00:55:28,418 --> 00:55:31,379
Then he got excited
and rushed to the diner.

1022
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:33,381
He obviously came to my wedding
to have dinner.

1023
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:35,633
Come on. <i>Galbitang</i> is nothing.

1024
00:55:35,717 --> 00:55:38,761
I'd love to take him out
for a steak dinner.

1025
00:55:39,262 --> 00:55:41,389
He'd say no to that anyway.

1026
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:43,099
Doctors can't say yes to things like that.

1027
00:55:43,182 --> 00:55:45,226
I didn't think he'd be like this,

1028
00:55:45,393 --> 00:55:46,894
but he's actually very charming.

1029
00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:49,772
The ICU is open now. Come on in.

1030
00:55:49,856 --> 00:55:51,899
Oh, okay. Thank you.

1031
00:55:51,983 --> 00:55:53,234
Thank you.

1032
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,239
Hey, don't cry.

1033
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:00,533
Are you going to cry in front of Dad?

1034
00:56:03,286 --> 00:56:04,704
Seriously, don't cry.

1035
00:56:04,787 --> 00:56:06,956
Why are you crying? His surgery went well.

1036
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,125
Dad will be so sad to see you cry.

1037
00:56:11,794 --> 00:56:12,712
Stop crying.

1038
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:15,590
You will break Dad's heart.
You know that, right?

1039
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:16,883
Right.

1040
00:56:20,261 --> 00:56:21,095
Smile.

1041
00:56:25,475 --> 00:56:26,559
Give me a bigger smile.

1042
00:56:32,565 --> 00:56:33,566
Aren't you leaving?

1043
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:36,903
Hey. I have surgery tomorrow
as well as patient appointments,

1044
00:56:36,986 --> 00:56:39,113
-so I have a lot to do.
-Then reschedule the surgery.

1045
00:56:39,197 --> 00:56:41,074
I can't do that.

1046
00:56:41,157 --> 00:56:42,617
How many appointments?

1047
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,701
Twenty.

1048
00:56:43,785 --> 00:56:45,328
I have to go through their charts.

1049
00:56:45,995 --> 00:56:47,246
Why are you still here?

1050
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:49,123
Everyone did a good job with the surgery,

1051
00:56:49,207 --> 00:56:50,625
so I want to stop by the office.

1052
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:53,461
-Go check in on Ik-jun.
-Why?

1053
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:55,922
I think something's up,
but he won't tell me.

1054
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:58,049
-Really?
-I think it's a family matter,

1055
00:56:58,132 --> 00:57:00,009
so I didn't want to pry.

1056
00:57:00,593 --> 00:57:02,470
But that doesn't sound like him.

1057
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:05,056
Well, I'm sure he'll sort it out.

1058
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:06,057
Bye.

1059
00:57:14,607 --> 00:57:16,275
<i>What did you just say?</i>

1060
00:57:16,943 --> 00:57:18,611
I said I want a divorce.

1061
00:57:20,446 --> 00:57:23,241
I wouldn't call this a normal marriage.

1062
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:25,409
Let's just go back to being friends.

1063
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:29,789
We're like this because this was
what you wanted.

1064
00:57:31,207 --> 00:57:33,000
When you got transferred,

1065
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:36,087
I told you I'd follow you to Germany

1066
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:37,004
and you refused.

1067
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:38,589
You wanted me to keep working.

1068
00:57:38,673 --> 00:57:40,800
Also, you wanted to raise U-ju in Korea.

1069
00:57:40,883 --> 00:57:43,386
That's why we're living like this.
So were we...

1070
00:57:46,055 --> 00:57:47,431
Were we separated?

1071
00:57:47,515 --> 00:57:48,933
No, we weren't.

1072
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:52,019
I like that you have a career.

1073
00:57:53,396 --> 00:57:56,149
And I can totally look after U-ju
by myself.

1074
00:57:56,732 --> 00:58:00,611
I know that we've been living apart
for quite a while,

1075
00:58:00,695 --> 00:58:02,697
but we made that decision together.

1076
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,990
Why are you saying...

1077
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:06,367
What's going on?

1078
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:09,871
What's the real reason?

1079
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:12,039
There's no such thing.

1080
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,211
I just felt that it was meaningless

1081
00:58:17,336 --> 00:58:19,422
to maintain this kind of marriage.

1082
00:58:22,758 --> 00:58:23,968
Do you mistrust me?

1083
00:58:24,594 --> 00:58:25,428
No.

1084
00:58:27,096 --> 00:58:29,223
I'm going to have lunch
with U-ju tomorrow,

1085
00:58:29,307 --> 00:58:30,683
just the two of us.

1086
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:32,226
It's a special day, you know.

1087
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,395
You should work.

1088
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:36,314
I'll stay with him tomorrow.

1089
00:58:37,899 --> 00:58:41,068
And about what I said...

1090
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,364
I hope you take it seriously.

1091
00:59:08,763 --> 00:59:10,848
Dr. Ahn, do you want to go for coffee?

1092
00:59:11,724 --> 00:59:12,725
Sure.

1093
00:59:15,186 --> 00:59:17,813
How many questions did I ask you today?

1094
00:59:21,317 --> 00:59:22,360
I'm not sure.

1095
00:59:23,152 --> 00:59:25,238
There were many. So many.

1096
00:59:25,988 --> 00:59:26,822
I'm sorry.

1097
00:59:26,906 --> 00:59:28,449
No, it's okay.

1098
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:32,453
Chi-hong, do you know how many operations
I perform on a weekly basis?

1099
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:35,831
Jeez, I'm asking you a question again.

1100
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,334
I have a problem, don't I?

1101
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:40,086
I'm really sorry.

1102
00:59:40,169 --> 00:59:42,713
I think you do more than five a week,
on average.

1103
00:59:43,297 --> 00:59:44,757
That means, in a year...

1104
00:59:45,424 --> 00:59:48,427
I probably do about 250, roughly speaking.

1105
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:49,887
Right.

1106
00:59:50,596 --> 00:59:52,098
I want you to be on your toes.

1107
00:59:55,101 --> 00:59:57,311
When you're performing surgery
or treating patients.

1108
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:00,314
Both you and Seok-min

1109
01:00:00,606 --> 01:00:03,234
should stay alert and focused
at all times. That's why I do it.

1110
01:00:05,278 --> 01:00:06,320
Yes.

1111
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,365
You see, this job is hard.

1112
01:00:09,448 --> 01:00:10,700
But you get used to it quickly.

1113
01:00:11,784 --> 01:00:16,747
The thing is though, we should never get
too comfortable doing this.

1114
01:00:17,123 --> 01:00:18,207
That's why.

1115
01:00:20,334 --> 01:00:21,168
Right.

1116
01:00:22,044 --> 01:00:24,922
It's not because I don't like you,
so don't get me wrong.

1117
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,800
And you'd better not give up
halfway through.

1118
01:00:28,384 --> 01:00:29,468
Okay.

1119
01:00:29,552 --> 01:00:31,595
Just trust me and follow my lead.

1120
01:00:32,638 --> 01:00:35,725
-Do you understand, Captain Ahn?
-Yes, ma'am.

1121
01:00:47,486 --> 01:00:49,363
-Hey.
-Professor, Chan-hyeong is doing great.

1122
01:00:49,447 --> 01:00:50,948
I checked everything just now.

1123
01:00:51,032 --> 01:00:53,951
Really? There's no need for me to check?
All his ABGA and PaO2 results look good?

1124
01:00:54,035 --> 01:00:56,078
Yes. Everything looks good,

1125
01:00:56,162 --> 01:00:58,622
so just go home already.

1126
01:00:58,706 --> 01:00:59,623
All right.

1127
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,801
Dr. Do walked you through
the surgery procedure, right?

1128
01:01:10,885 --> 01:01:13,429
Chan-hyeong's condition has improved,
so we'll perform surgery...

1129
01:01:15,389 --> 01:01:16,265
Oh, my.

1130
01:01:17,308 --> 01:01:21,270
Doctor, please take good care
of Chan-hyeong.

1131
01:01:22,396 --> 01:01:25,483
My gosh, you've been staying
so strong until now.

1132
01:01:25,566 --> 01:01:28,319
Please save Chan-hyeong.

1133
01:01:29,487 --> 01:01:33,366
I wish it was me instead of him.

1134
01:01:39,038 --> 01:01:40,790
Don't cry.

1135
01:01:41,749 --> 01:01:44,001
You've been holding out so well.

1136
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:47,588
I've been barely keeping it together.

1137
01:01:50,883 --> 01:01:55,805
Both my mom and my mother-in-law
think that we're still kids.

1138
01:01:57,056 --> 01:01:59,725
Everyone says that we're immature.

1139
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:03,479
So I've been acting all tough on purpose.

1140
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:06,232
I wanted to cry, but I was afraid

1141
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,735
that they'd say we're too young
to deal with this.

1142
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:12,029
They would tell me to go home
if I burst into tears.

1143
01:02:12,113 --> 01:02:14,865
What if they wouldn't even let me
see Chan-hyeong?

1144
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:18,202
That's why I've been forcing myself
to act all tough.

1145
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,873
But I can't do it anymore.

1146
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:28,504
Doctor, Chan-hyeong will be okay, right?

1147
01:02:29,255 --> 01:02:30,881
We've performed this surgery many times.

1148
01:02:30,965 --> 01:02:32,633
We'll make sure he'll be okay.

1149
01:02:33,259 --> 01:02:36,262
Then, it will go well, right?

1150
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:43,269
Yes, we'll do our best.

1151
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,980
Thank you.

1152
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,320
By the way, why did you go home
in the morning?

1153
01:02:54,947 --> 01:02:58,200
Oh, Hui-dong's Mom...

1154
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:01,787
-is a shaman.
-Oh, I see.

1155
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:06,167
She said putting a crock lid upside down
and filling it with water

1156
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,711
could help Chan-hyeong recover soon.

1157
01:03:10,588 --> 01:03:14,175
I'm sorry. I heard that
doctors don't like such superstitions.

1158
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:15,926
Gosh, don't be sorry. It's okay.

1159
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:20,306
If it helps you worry less,
you should do it. By all means.

1160
01:03:22,224 --> 01:03:23,142
Then...

1161
01:03:29,356 --> 01:03:30,316
Just this.

1162
01:03:34,987 --> 01:03:36,405
I'm sorry.

1163
01:03:39,033 --> 01:03:40,034
Don't be.

1164
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,878
Uncles and Aunts.

1165
01:03:51,378 --> 01:03:53,464
Chan-hyeong is here.

1166
01:04:08,729 --> 01:04:10,356
His CRP levels have gone up a little.

1167
01:04:10,523 --> 01:04:12,233
Yes, but his CBC level

1168
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:14,151
and chest X-ray from this morning
look good.

1169
01:04:14,235 --> 01:04:15,444
All right.

1170
01:04:18,489 --> 01:04:19,740
Wakanda.

1171
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:23,285
You don't know what it is? <i>Black Panther.</i>

1172
01:04:27,456 --> 01:04:29,667
Don't say "Forever."
Just stay still like that.

1173
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:33,587
LEE CHAN-HYEONG

1174
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:36,590
Pump on, please.

1175
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,051
Turning the pump on.

1176
01:04:44,974 --> 01:04:47,977
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
SURGERY DURATION

1177
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,299
Is the color of the drainage okay?

1178
01:05:18,924 --> 01:05:19,967
What about the AC?

1179
01:05:21,468 --> 01:05:25,014
Okay. Call me when you have
the per-hour urine output.

1180
01:05:25,097 --> 01:05:26,015
All right.

1181
01:05:26,473 --> 01:05:29,476
Professor,
why didn't you answer your phone?

1182
01:05:31,312 --> 01:05:34,315
Professor,
why didn't you answer your phone?

1183
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:37,192
-I was on the phone.
-My gosh.

1184
01:05:37,651 --> 01:05:41,780
They said they couldn't get a hold of you.
That's why I'm here. The thing is...

1185
01:05:42,573 --> 01:05:43,949
It's about Mr. Yuk Hui-gwan.

1186
01:05:44,033 --> 01:05:45,492
What about him?

1187
01:05:45,576 --> 01:05:47,077
He was discharged yesterday.

1188
01:05:47,161 --> 01:05:49,580
They were going through the records

1189
01:05:49,663 --> 01:05:53,626
and found out that he is
the brain-dead organ donor.

1190
01:05:54,335 --> 01:05:55,753
He came in as a TA victim.

1191
01:05:55,836 --> 01:05:58,631
His GCS score was five, which indicated
a high probability of brain death.

1192
01:05:59,214 --> 01:06:00,841
His family has consented
to organ donation,

1193
01:06:00,924 --> 01:06:02,968
so they've already done an EEG.

1194
01:06:03,052 --> 01:06:05,429
The committee will meet soon
to confirm the diagnosis.

1195
01:06:05,512 --> 01:06:08,891
Initially, I was just notified
that it was a traffic accident victim.

1196
01:06:10,392 --> 01:06:12,603
They wanted us to let you know
as soon as possible

1197
01:06:12,686 --> 01:06:14,647
because he's your patient.

1198
01:06:15,773 --> 01:06:17,900
The organ is going to another patient
at our hospital,

1199
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,152
so we'll have to take care
of the procurement as well.

1200
01:06:21,904 --> 01:06:25,157
Gosh, I feel bad.

1201
01:06:29,828 --> 01:06:32,247
His tricuspid valve is very small,
so it's hard to see.

1202
01:06:32,998 --> 01:06:35,542
No, not that way.
Pull it toward the patient's head.

1203
01:06:36,043 --> 01:06:37,336
Yes.

1204
01:06:38,796 --> 01:06:41,423
Pull harder,
or we'll have to make a bigger incision.

1205
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:43,008
Okay, I'm sorry.

1206
01:06:45,678 --> 01:06:47,471
You see that monitor, right?

1207
01:06:47,554 --> 01:06:50,474
The line is flat now,
which means the heart rate is zero.

1208
01:06:50,557 --> 01:06:51,475
That means he's dead.

1209
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:53,227
No.

1210
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,480
It just means that Chan-hyeong's
current heart rate is zero.

1211
01:06:56,563 --> 01:06:59,525
His heart isn't beating at the moment.

1212
01:06:59,608 --> 01:07:01,985
They can't operate on him
while the heart is beating.

1213
01:07:02,069 --> 01:07:04,405
That's why the cardioplegia solution
is administered

1214
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:06,699
every 30 minutes to induce cardiac stasis
when performing

1215
01:07:06,782 --> 01:07:08,033
any cardiac surgery procedures.

1216
01:07:08,117 --> 01:07:10,452
And during cardiac stasis,
that machine over there

1217
01:07:10,536 --> 01:07:12,996
acts as the patient's heart and lungs.

1218
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,124
It supplies blood throughout the body

1219
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:17,626
while doctors are operating on the heart.

1220
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,294
All right. Let's go over it again.

1221
01:07:19,878 --> 01:07:23,173
Stop Chan-hyeong's heart,
which is replaced by the machine.

1222
01:07:23,257 --> 01:07:26,051
While the machine's working,
the doctors quickly fix the heart.

1223
01:07:26,135 --> 01:07:27,177
When everything's fixed,

1224
01:07:27,261 --> 01:07:30,097
they get rid of the tubes
that hook him up to the machine.

1225
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,683
You're telling me all this
so that you can remember the steps.

1226
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:34,518
You're doing it to memorize the steps.

1227
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:35,561
That's right.

1228
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:38,313
-You understand the procedure, right?
-Yes, totally.

1229
01:07:49,742 --> 01:07:50,743
Gwang-hyeon.

1230
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,412
The brain-dead TA patient, Yuk Hui-gwan.
Where is he?

1231
01:07:53,495 --> 01:07:56,081
Oh, they've finished
doing all the tests on him in the ICU.

1232
01:07:56,165 --> 01:07:58,333
The committee will meet soon
to finalize the diagnosis.

1233
01:07:58,417 --> 01:08:01,003
He's a TA victim, but I heard
the organs are in good condition.

1234
01:08:01,086 --> 01:08:04,673
They're probably negotiating
the time frame with the other hospital.

1235
01:08:06,258 --> 01:08:07,426
Why? Do you know that patient?

1236
01:08:07,509 --> 01:08:08,886
He was my patient.

1237
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,014
He was totally fine
when he was discharged yesterday.

1238
01:08:12,097 --> 01:08:14,016
Really? My goodness.

1239
01:08:14,516 --> 01:08:16,977
It must've been a very difficult decision.

1240
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:19,980
You should say a proper goodbye.

1241
01:08:20,647 --> 01:08:21,690
All right.

1242
01:08:22,274 --> 01:08:23,650
Have you seen his family?

1243
01:08:23,734 --> 01:08:25,569
No, I don't know that much.

1244
01:08:25,652 --> 01:08:26,862
Okay.

1245
01:08:27,654 --> 01:08:28,781
Hello.

1246
01:08:29,281 --> 01:08:30,449
Should I head home now?

1247
01:08:30,532 --> 01:08:31,909
<i>No, there's no need.</i>

1248
01:08:31,992 --> 01:08:34,369
<i>The emergency medicine worked like magic.</i>

1249
01:08:34,453 --> 01:08:36,371
<i>It's already looking much better.</i>

1250
01:08:36,455 --> 01:08:38,040
<i>-He's asleep now.</i>
-My goodness.

1251
01:08:38,123 --> 01:08:40,417
<i>If you come home now,</i>
<i>you'll just wake him up.</i>

1252
01:08:40,501 --> 01:08:42,044
<i>It won't be good.</i>

1253
01:08:42,211 --> 01:08:46,590
<i>I called to let you know that he's okay,</i>
<i>so don't worry.</i>

1254
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:49,468
<i>But I have to say, how could U-ju's mom</i>

1255
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:52,346
<i>not even know</i>
<i>about her son's peanut allergy?</i>

1256
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:53,388
<i>My goodness.</i>

1257
01:08:53,472 --> 01:08:55,015
Do you know which restaurant it was?

1258
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:56,558
I'll call them.

1259
01:08:56,642 --> 01:08:59,436
I should find out exactly what he ate.

1260
01:08:59,686 --> 01:09:00,938
Okay, hold on.

1261
01:09:06,235 --> 01:09:07,236
Yes.

1262
01:09:11,323 --> 01:09:14,117
-Okay, thank you.
-Mom.

1263
01:09:14,535 --> 01:09:17,287
How come Daddy isn't here yet?

1264
01:09:19,498 --> 01:09:23,210
Where's Daddy? Where did he go?

1265
01:09:24,753 --> 01:09:26,797
Mom!

1266
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:30,926
Mister!

1267
01:09:31,468 --> 01:09:34,012
Can you buy me <i>jajangmyeon?</i>

1268
01:09:34,096 --> 01:09:36,557
Sure, I'll buy you <i>jajangmyeon.</i>

1269
01:10:01,373 --> 01:10:03,208
ANESTHESIA DURATION

1270
01:10:05,002 --> 01:10:06,670
We'll stop the ventilation.

1271
01:10:06,753 --> 01:10:08,046
Stop the ventilation.

1272
01:10:09,631 --> 01:10:10,966
Anesthesiologist.

1273
01:10:11,049 --> 01:10:13,343
Position the patient's head down
and hook up the Ambu bag.

1274
01:10:14,011 --> 01:10:15,053
Is it all over now?

1275
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:17,472
They did everything they could in surgery.

1276
01:10:17,556 --> 01:10:19,683
Now, the question is whether
his heart will beat or not

1277
01:10:19,766 --> 01:10:22,144
without the machine.

1278
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:23,478
If it does, then it's a success.

1279
01:10:23,562 --> 01:10:25,397
His heart isn't beating though.

1280
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,690
Just wait.

1281
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:29,610
Now, the aorta.

1282
01:10:36,074 --> 01:10:38,368
Hey, don't look at that.

1283
01:10:38,452 --> 01:10:41,079
You should be looking
at the number on top in green.

1284
01:10:41,538 --> 01:10:45,083
His heart rate is zero at the moment.
That number needs to go up.

1285
01:10:49,588 --> 01:10:50,756
It's going up.

1286
01:11:20,369 --> 01:11:22,245
-Good job, guys.
-Thank you.

1287
01:11:22,329 --> 01:11:23,580
I'll finish up.

1288
01:11:23,664 --> 01:11:24,831
Of course, you should.

1289
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,588
Can these guys get the surgical gowns?

1290
01:11:40,013 --> 01:11:41,390
You hear his heartbeat, right?

1291
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:42,975
-Yes.
-Yes.

1292
01:11:43,058 --> 01:11:44,977
You should know better
as med school students.

1293
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,104
You're probably hearing
your own heartbeat.

1294
01:11:48,981 --> 01:11:50,732
I see.

1295
01:11:50,816 --> 01:11:53,735
I'll let you touch it once.
Be very careful though.

1296
01:11:54,569 --> 01:11:57,364
While touching it,
thank Chan-hyeong for staying alive.

1297
01:11:58,949 --> 01:11:59,950
Okay.

1298
01:12:09,334 --> 01:12:10,585
What's wrong?

1299
01:12:13,505 --> 01:12:14,673
It's very strong.

1300
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,011
The heartbeat feels very strong,
Professor.

1301
01:12:31,857 --> 01:12:34,151
YEAR 2003

1302
01:12:46,997 --> 01:12:48,498
Doesn't the heartbeat feel so strong?

1303
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:51,960
It's quite amazing, isn't it?

1304
01:12:54,755 --> 01:12:56,673
It's the size of a plum.

1305
01:12:58,467 --> 01:13:01,344
I didn't know it'd feel this strong.

1306
01:13:01,887 --> 01:13:03,972
This kid's heart stopped beating.

1307
01:13:04,473 --> 01:13:07,309
You made it beat again, Professor.

1308
01:13:11,188 --> 01:13:12,230
Professor.

1309
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:18,236
I'll choose Cardiothoracic Surgery.

1310
01:13:20,906 --> 01:13:24,618
Professor,
I'll choose Cardiothoracic Surgery.

1311
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:25,911
Me, too.

1312
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:29,331
I'll apply
to Cardiothoracic Surgery as well.

1313
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:34,419
Sure, good choice.

1314
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:35,587
Good work, guys.

1315
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:37,255
Well done, everyone.

1316
01:13:45,138 --> 01:13:47,516
Make them sign a pledge
before they change their mind.

1317
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:53,855
<i>Kim Chan-hyeong's guardian.</i>

1318
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:56,233
<i>Please come to the operating unit.</i>

1319
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:03,865
-Are you Kim Chan-hyeong's guardians?
-Yes.

1320
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:05,367
-Come in.
-Thank you.

1321
01:14:15,919 --> 01:14:19,339
Doctor, did Chan-hyeong's surgery go well?

1322
01:14:26,972 --> 01:14:30,225
Chan-hyeong's surgery went well.

1323
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:33,270
We patched up the ventricular hole.

1324
01:14:33,353 --> 01:14:35,480
As for the pulmonary trunk,
it took longer than expected

1325
01:14:35,564 --> 01:14:36,982
because we wanted to save the valve.

1326
01:14:37,065 --> 01:14:40,944
But that went well too,
so it's closed nicely now.

1327
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,739
His surgery went well,
so please don't worry.

1328
01:14:44,823 --> 01:14:47,409
We'll move him to the ICU
in about half an hour.

1329
01:14:47,492 --> 01:14:48,451
I'll see you then.

1330
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:53,790
His surgery went well,
so please don't worry.

1331
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:57,085
-My gosh.
-Thank you, Doctor!

1332
01:15:10,265 --> 01:15:11,141
<i>Hello?</i>

1333
01:15:11,391 --> 01:15:12,434
Yes, hello.

1334
01:15:12,517 --> 01:15:15,395
Well, my son had lunch
at your restaurant earlier today

1335
01:15:15,478 --> 01:15:17,480
and had an allergic reaction.

1336
01:15:17,564 --> 01:15:19,399
He's allergic to peanuts.
He probably ate some.

1337
01:15:19,482 --> 01:15:21,610
<i>Gosh, I'm sorry. Is he okay?</i>

1338
01:15:21,693 --> 01:15:23,028
Yes, he's okay now.

1339
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:25,071
But I'd like to find out
exactly what he ate.

1340
01:15:25,155 --> 01:15:26,031
He's five years old.

1341
01:15:26,114 --> 01:15:27,824
I think he ate there with his mom.

1342
01:15:27,908 --> 01:15:28,950
<i>I remember him.</i>

1343
01:15:29,034 --> 01:15:31,036
<i>I took their order.</i>

1344
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:32,454
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>

1345
01:15:32,787 --> 01:15:37,876
<i>Oh, right. Sir, the salad you took to go</i>
<i>to have for dinner.</i>

1346
01:15:37,959 --> 01:15:40,712
<i>It probably had peanut dressing.</i>

1347
01:15:41,129 --> 01:15:42,505
Did I get...

1348
01:15:44,883 --> 01:15:46,218
Right, I did.

1349
01:15:46,301 --> 01:15:48,887
<i>Yes, you did, sir.</i>

1350
01:15:49,387 --> 01:15:53,308
<i>I remember you because you and your wife</i>
<i>looked so lovely together.</i>

1351
01:15:53,391 --> 01:15:55,101
<i>Your kid was so cute too.</i>

1352
01:15:56,478 --> 01:16:01,191
<i>I'm pretty sure I asked you to let me know</i>
<i>if you had any food allergies.</i>

1353
01:16:01,816 --> 01:16:04,402
<i>I apologize. I guess</i>
<i>I didn't communicate that properly.</i>

1354
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:19,459
-Hello?
-<i>Professor.</i>

1355
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,544
<i>This is Ham Deok-ju,</i>
<i>a transplant coordinator.</i>

1356
01:16:21,628 --> 01:16:24,172
<i>The chairman is coming from the airport</i>
<i>due to a conference,</i>

1357
01:16:24,256 --> 01:16:27,175
<i>so the committee meeting</i>
<i>will be held after 10 p.m.</i>

1358
01:16:27,259 --> 01:16:28,093
Okay.

1359
01:16:28,176 --> 01:16:31,471
<i>We want to arrange a time for you</i>
<i>to see him as soon as the meeting is over.</i>

1360
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:34,224
<i>We've already let the other hospital know.</i>

1361
01:16:34,307 --> 01:16:36,351
<i>I'll call you when we're ready.</i>

1362
01:16:36,434 --> 01:16:37,435
Okay.

1363
01:16:42,148 --> 01:16:43,149
What's with him?

1364
01:16:45,735 --> 01:16:47,988
It's taking longer than we expected,

1365
01:16:48,363 --> 01:16:49,906
but it'll be over soon.

1366
01:16:51,157 --> 01:16:53,451
You should wait in the waiting area.

1367
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:55,161
Let's go.

1368
01:16:55,996 --> 01:17:00,292
FAMILY WAITING ROOM

1369
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:02,043
Thank you.

1370
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:07,549
So what's happening next?

1371
01:17:07,632 --> 01:17:09,050
If you'd like,

1372
01:17:09,384 --> 01:17:12,721
we'll arrange a time for you to see him
before the surgery begins.

1373
01:17:13,388 --> 01:17:15,307
Once he's in the OR,

1374
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:18,310
the doctors will check
the condition of his organs

1375
01:17:18,393 --> 01:17:20,353
and conduct biopsies.

1376
01:17:20,437 --> 01:17:22,480
If everything looks good,

1377
01:17:22,564 --> 01:17:25,567
they'll start preparing him right away
for organ donation.

1378
01:17:26,693 --> 01:17:29,321
This process is usually carried out
by fellows,

1379
01:17:29,404 --> 01:17:33,408
but Professor Lee Ik-jun
will oversee the entire process.

1380
01:17:34,075 --> 01:17:37,495
He's even concerned
about the surgical wound.

1381
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:41,207
Hello?

1382
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:43,335
Okay.

1383
01:17:45,337 --> 01:17:47,839
The committee meeting just ended.

1384
01:17:48,882 --> 01:17:51,134
I'll get ready, then.

1385
01:18:01,269 --> 01:18:03,271
Where are you?
You said you'd be here right away.

1386
01:18:03,355 --> 01:18:04,356
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

1387
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:05,648
Okay.

1388
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:08,026
Is he having a bad day or something?

1389
01:18:09,402 --> 01:18:11,237
Are you from
Kangwoon University Medical Center?

1390
01:18:11,321 --> 01:18:12,280
Yes.

1391
01:18:12,364 --> 01:18:14,491
I had to speak with his family,
so we're running behind.

1392
01:18:14,574 --> 01:18:16,034
I'm sorry. Do we have enough time?

1393
01:18:16,117 --> 01:18:18,370
The donor's vitals are good.

1394
01:18:18,995 --> 01:18:20,455
Yes, we're early.

1395
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:22,415
It's not that urgent, so it's fine.

1396
01:18:29,798 --> 01:18:30,924
We'll get started.

1397
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:32,050
-Okay.
-All right.

1398
01:18:44,562 --> 01:18:46,064
Is the patient stable?

1399
01:18:46,356 --> 01:18:47,732
Yes, everything looks good.

1400
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:03,581
Professor Lee, everything's ready.

1401
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:11,589
-Kangwoon University Medical Center?
-Yes, Professor.

1402
01:19:13,967 --> 01:19:16,845
Well, can I ask you a favor?

1403
01:19:17,762 --> 01:19:18,596
Sure.

1404
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,933
Could we postpone the heart removal
by just ten minutes?

1405
01:19:24,686 --> 01:19:27,730
Call the hospital
and find out if it's okay.

1406
01:19:27,814 --> 01:19:30,108
If it's urgent,
we can get started right away.

1407
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:34,696
Ten minutes should be okay.
We got here early.

1408
01:19:34,779 --> 01:19:38,199
Okay. It's 11:50 p.m. now,

1409
01:19:38,283 --> 01:19:40,994
-so we'll start in ten minutes.
-Okay.

1410
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:43,288
We'll begin at midnight
with a silent prayer.

1411
01:19:43,371 --> 01:19:45,039
-Got it.
-Wait.

1412
01:19:45,123 --> 01:19:48,293
Can't we just do it now?

1413
01:19:48,376 --> 01:19:50,837
We've pulled two all-nighters in a row.

1414
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,882
Today is Children's Day, you know.

1415
01:19:54,507 --> 01:19:55,341
Pardon?

1416
01:19:58,553 --> 01:20:00,430
It's because today is Children's Day.

1417
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:09,814
He has a five-year-old son named Won-jun.

1418
01:20:10,607 --> 01:20:13,193
Today's Children's Day,
so he was supposed to have...

1419
01:20:16,654 --> 01:20:18,364
<i>jajangmyeon</i> with his dad.

1420
01:20:19,449 --> 01:20:22,494
But Won-jun...

1421
01:20:23,661 --> 01:20:25,788
He'll never get to do that,
for the rest of his life.

1422
01:20:52,649 --> 01:20:53,691
Let's wait.

1423
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:55,985
Just ten minutes.

1424
01:20:56,486 --> 01:20:58,696
We'll begin in ten minutes, okay?

1425
01:20:59,405 --> 01:21:01,115
We can't have his son cry

1426
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:04,619
on every Children's Day
thinking about his late father.

1427
01:21:05,203 --> 01:21:07,330
Okay, no problem.

1428
01:21:07,622 --> 01:21:08,748
Sure, Professor.

1429
01:21:08,831 --> 01:21:10,708
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1430
01:21:33,773 --> 01:21:38,778
Your late husband decided
to donate his organs to help others.

1431
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:40,613
Thankfully,
his organs are in good condition,

1432
01:21:40,697 --> 01:21:44,867
so he'll be donating
his heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver.

1433
01:21:46,494 --> 01:21:50,665
The surgery began just now,
at 12:05 a.m. on May 6,

1434
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:56,045
which means he has expired.

1435
01:21:57,672 --> 01:21:58,840
Thank you.

1436
01:22:30,997 --> 01:22:33,291
I have to work the night shift anyway,
so I came to work.

1437
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:35,251
Yes, Mom.

1438
01:22:35,835 --> 01:22:37,420
You're feeling okay? Any health issues?

1439
01:22:38,212 --> 01:22:39,339
What about Dad?

1440
01:22:41,549 --> 01:22:43,009
All right.

1441
01:22:43,384 --> 01:22:45,678
I'll buy her food, coffee, and everything.
Don't worry.

1442
01:22:45,928 --> 01:22:49,349
But it's not like she's here to see me.
That girl...

1443
01:22:51,017 --> 01:22:52,935
Okay, bye.

1444
01:22:58,733 --> 01:22:59,984
<i>It's raining a lot.</i>

1445
01:23:01,819 --> 01:23:03,529
<i>We can't go camping in this weather.</i>

1446
01:23:05,031 --> 01:23:06,032
<i>I won't force you guys.</i>

1447
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:08,618
<i>You don't have to come.</i>
<i>Do whatever you want.</i>

1448
01:23:12,622 --> 01:23:14,082
<i>You'll go camping in this weather?</i>

1449
01:23:16,918 --> 01:23:18,753
<i>I love going camping on a rainy day.</i>

1450
01:23:18,836 --> 01:23:20,546
<i>Anyway, I'm totally fine with going alone,</i>

1451
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:21,714
<i>so do whatever you want.</i>

1452
01:23:23,675 --> 01:23:26,302
NEUROSURGERY TEAM CHAT ROOM

1453
01:23:26,386 --> 01:23:28,596
<i>But you'll be bored if you go alone.</i>

1454
01:23:31,933 --> 01:23:36,437
<i>I'll go somewhere really far</i>

1455
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:40,775
<i>I'll travel until the sun goes down</i>

1456
01:23:41,818 --> 01:23:44,612
<i>I'll start afresh</i>

1457
01:23:45,196 --> 01:23:48,241
<i>For myself</i>

1458
01:24:05,675 --> 01:24:06,968
Professor, you beat me.

1459
01:24:07,051 --> 01:24:09,011
Is Dr. Do in an emergency surgery?

1460
01:24:09,095 --> 01:24:11,013
Yes. It looked like
a tension pneumothorax,

1461
01:24:11,097 --> 01:24:12,348
so I called you right away.

1462
01:24:12,432 --> 01:24:13,558
Good. I was in the area.

1463
01:24:13,641 --> 01:24:15,768
But why was a soldier
transferred to a regular hospital?

1464
01:24:15,852 --> 01:24:18,312
They had an accident
across the street and has a broken rib.

1465
01:24:18,396 --> 01:24:19,647
No other external injuries.

1466
01:24:19,731 --> 01:24:21,733
-Where's the patient?
-Here.

1467
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,312

YEONINSAN CAMPGROUND

1469
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:20,291
I said it's fine. You don't have to come.

1470
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:23,711
Where are you?

1471
01:25:24,545 --> 01:25:27,465
Here? B-104.

1472
01:25:28,174 --> 01:25:30,176
<i>Where's 104?</i>

1473
01:25:30,259 --> 01:25:31,302
I'm here!

1474
01:25:31,636 --> 01:25:32,929
Over here.

1475
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:44,607
What's up? What are you doing here?

1476
01:25:46,025 --> 01:25:48,110
What do you mean? I promised to join you.

1477
01:25:48,194 --> 01:25:49,695
I never said I couldn't come.

1478
01:25:50,488 --> 01:25:51,823
Anyway, sit down.

1479
01:25:52,198 --> 01:25:53,783
-Have some coffee.
-Okay.

1480
01:26:03,084 --> 01:26:04,460
You're wearing those again.

1481
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,545
What?

1482
01:26:07,004 --> 01:26:08,548
The shoes I gave you.

1483
01:26:10,091 --> 01:26:11,092
What?

1484
01:26:14,053 --> 01:26:17,348
I got you those shoes, Professor.

1485

Hey, don't bring it up
