HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:12,697 --> 00:00:13,824
Hey, Parking Master!

3
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:20,038
Well... Can you park my bike for me?

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,082
Me? "Parking Master"?

5
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:25,335
Why did you turn around, then?
Come on. Take this.

6
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:27,254
Hey, get me some coffee!

7
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:29,422
I'll meet you in the lobby!

8
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,114
Hello, Professor. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:57,325
Don't be. I'm sorry for waking you up.

10
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,703
You have some time before the rounds.

11
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:01,580
-Get some more sleep.
-No, it's okay.

12
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:10,922
There you are.

13
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:12,841
Is this mine?

14
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:15,927
When did you get changed?

15
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:20,181
Hey, I can't come out to the lobby
dressed like that.

16
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:22,892
I also have to do my rounds,
so I went and took care of business

17
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,312
and got changed as fast as I could.

18
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:27,230
Is that so?

19
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,566
What you're thinking did not happen.

20
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:32,277
My anal sphincter is still strong.
Goodness.

21
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:33,778
What's this guy doing?

22
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:36,072
He's fast asleep.

23
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:38,533
Right, I'm exhausted every morning too.

24
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,619
Jeez, you scared me.

25
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:52,881
It's time you said goodbye to this world.

26
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:57,385
Leave everything you have behind

27
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:59,429
and come with me.

28
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:01,431
Now?

29
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,893
But I still have a lot to do.

30
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:07,687
Hey, wake up.

31
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:09,731
Dr. Yong, you're still alive.

32
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:11,608
-Hey, stop it.
-Seriously?

33
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,443
What the...

34
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:16,696
Dr. Yong, you must be really tired.

35
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,407
Have you taken a vacation yet?
You need some rest.

36
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:21,660
No, not yet.

37
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:25,455
-But I'm taking some time off next month.
-Good.

38
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:30,585
Professor Chae said we should all
take a vacation for a week,

39
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,130
so all the residents will take turns
and go on vacation.

40
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:37,634
If I could,
I'd love to take a week off as well.

41
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:41,846
If you had to take a year off
and not work, what would you do?

42
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:44,724
-Me?
-She'll probably want to study.

43
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:46,059
No.

44
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:50,438
I'd move to a place like Gangneung,
Sokcho, or Tongyeong.

45
00:02:50,522 --> 00:02:53,024
I'd love to live somewhere like that
just for a year.

46
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:57,904
I want to live in a place that's not
too big or too small just for a year.

47
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,197
I'll work at a hospital there.

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,533
The question was,
"What would you do if you didn't work?"

49
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,284
It'd be more boring
if I don't work at all.

50
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:07,163
No, it wouldn't be boring.
There are so many things you can do.

51
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:09,207
-Okay, you can play all you want.
-I will!

52
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:12,836
Anyway, I'd prefer to work
at a small hospital

53
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,129
over a big hospital like this,

54
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:16,339
so I can give each patient
undivided attention.

55
00:03:16,423 --> 00:03:20,385
There was an MBC documentary
called <i>Success Tale</i>.

56
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,761
Gosh, stop it.

57
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:24,514
If that show was still running,

58
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,641
they'd produce
a three-episode special feature on her.

59
00:03:27,392 --> 00:03:31,855
In my free time, I'll go hiking,
go to the beach, and do fun things.

60
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:35,108
Hospitals in small towns are even busier.
"Free time"? Gosh, I doubt it.

61
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:37,444
What about you, Professor Lee?
What would you do?

62
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:38,611
Me?

63
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:42,574
I've never thought about it.

64
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,909
Should I assume I have a kid?

65
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:46,536
No, let’s say you’re single.

66
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:49,664
Clubbing! I'd go clubbing, of course.

67
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:53,251
I'll go to a club and dance all night.

68
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:57,756
I'll make sure my feet don't touch
the ground for over a second at a time.

69
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,549
-Like this.
-What about during the day?

70
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:02,010
I'll go shopping.

71
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:06,848
You see, I'm a city guy.
I love Seoul so much.

72
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:10,060
Seeing the stars and the moon
in the countryside isn't my thing.

73
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:13,354
<i>The flashing neon signs in the city</i>

74
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:17,400
Those things... How should I put this?
They heal my mind.

75
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:19,152
Aren't you taking flower photos recently?

76
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:20,945
There are flowers at shopping malls.

77
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:24,115
The apartment complexes
are surrounded by flowers.

78
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:29,245
I'd go to the flower shop
by the food court at the department store

79
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:32,749
and take pictures
of the neatly arranged flowers there.

80
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:34,417
Let's go. It's time for our rounds.

81
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:37,003
Come on. I have to do my rounds too.

82
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:40,298
<i>The glamorous city</i>

83
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,508
Gosh, be quiet.

84
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,459
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

85
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:01,611
<i>I'll give you my answer
within the next 72 hours.</i>

86
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:09,494
<i>Is this some kind of a military
operation? You can take your time.</i>

87
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:15,959
<i>Then give me about a week.</i>

88
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:20,088
<i>All right. Don't skip meals.</i>

89
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,635
<i>Of course!
I eat two bowls of rice for every meal.</i>

90
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:29,055
I'm sorry, Mom.
The baby's condition suddenly worsened.

91
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:30,974
I have to go to the PICU now.

92
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:34,185
You can go and get
the health checkup done by yourself.

93
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:39,732
Mom, the gastroscopy
will be done last anyway.

94
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:42,694
I should be able to make it there by then.

95
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,782
Of course, I can get it done by myself.
Am I a kid?

96
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:50,994
But I was told to bring a guardian
for the conscious sedation endoscope.

97
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:53,037
Gosh, what a nuisance.

98
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:54,789
So people who are single
and have no friends

99
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:56,791
can't even get it done or what?

100
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:01,170
I know that too. That's why I left the car
and took a taxi here. Anyway...

101
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:03,464
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

102
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:06,134
Where do I go for a health checkup?

103
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,845
Go to B1 of the next building.

104
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:11,055
You can either go outside
and find that building

105
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,516
or just head down to B1 from here.
It's all connected.

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,602
My gosh, you're so kind.

107
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:17,478
-Thank you.
-No problem.

108
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,190
Whatever. I don't need you.

109
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:24,152
I'll figure out what to do with
this damn endoscopy, so just do your work.

110
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:25,320
I have to go.

111
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:31,743
Hey, Jun-wan. Are you seeing someone?

112
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:36,998
You are. Talk to you later.

113
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:42,170
That prick, is he a psychic?

114
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:52,096
This morning, his temperature went up
to 37.8°C, so we gave him a fever reducer.

115
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,556
The fever has gone down.

116
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,102
I saw the chest X-ray you took
this morning.

117
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:01,981
Your lungs are still tight.
That's probably why you had a fever.

118
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:04,359
It's not easy, but you have
to keep doing the ball exercise.

119
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:10,740
I feel so weak
because all I eat is porridge.

120
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:12,951
You'll get rice starting tomorrow.

121
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:15,370
We'll give him normal meals
starting tomorrow.

122
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:16,454
Okay.

123
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,539
Can I eat meat?

124
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,209
I have a huge craving for bulgogi.

125
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:23,586
Gosh, even now...

126
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:28,675
I feel like I can smell bulgogi right now.

127
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:32,595
The Seoul-style bulgogi, right?

128
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:34,806
With the sweet marinade.

129
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,976
With a ton of green onions.

130
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:41,229
Two tablespoons of minced garlic.

131
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:45,358
A little bit of corn syrup and plenty of
enoki and shiitake mushrooms, right?

132
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,819
I can smell...

133
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,911
Ma'am! You can't give him that.
He's supposed to be fasting now.

134
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:00,206
Gosh, please. My goodness.

135
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,501
Your surgery is tomorrow.
You really shouldn't be eating this, sir.

136
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:05,586
Gosh, Doctor.

137
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:10,717
It's major surgery
where his abdomen will be split open.

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,760
He can't go in for the surgery
on an empty stomach.

139
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,848
He needs to eat at least one proper meal

140
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:20,268
for the surgery to go well. Right, Doctor?

141
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:23,479
No. That's not how it works, ma'am. Gosh.

142
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,359
Sir, you can eat as much as you want
after the surgery.

143
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:31,654
If you eat this now,
you'll have to fast one more day.

144
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:33,614
Just restrain yourself for today,

145
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:37,076
and you can eat all sorts of yummy foods
until you turn 100. I promise, okay?

146
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:40,663
-Great. I'll put this in the fridge.
-Gosh, all right.

147
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:44,083
Thank goodness you caught that,
Professor Lee.

148
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,044
He's getting his surgery tomorrow.

149
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:49,297
Doctor, wait! Doctor.

150
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,717
Take this.

151
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:55,136
My grandson bought it.

152
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:59,682
My gosh, it's sweet and tasty.
It's so good.

153
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,228
Ma'am, we can't accept things like this.

154
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:05,813
This could get us in trouble.

155
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:09,192
Gosh, it's just coffee though.
You really can't accept it?

156
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:12,028
You see, I just...

157
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:15,448
I feel bad
for causing such a nuisance today.

158
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:18,993
That's very sweet of you.
The gesture is more than enough.

159
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:20,286
I'll take it.

160
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:22,121
Thank you.

161
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,292
My gosh, it looks delicious.

162
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:30,171
Ma'am, I'll accept it this time,
but don't give me anything from now on.

163
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:33,508
Sure thing. You won't get anything from me
from now on.

164
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,511
Enjoy the coffee.

165
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:38,471
-Thank you for this.
-My pleasure.

166
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,809
Ms. Song! Let's go to the VIP ward.

167
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:47,397
Ms. Song and I will go check up
on Mr. Go Yeong-min in the VIP ward.

168
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:49,440
Wait.

169
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:51,192
What?

170
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:56,823
You can come too.

171
00:09:58,658 --> 00:09:59,617
Let's go.

172
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:04,205
-Your kid dropped out of school?
-Yes.

173
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:06,499
The kid really can't stand school.

174
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,419
If the kid doesn't want to go,
you can't really do anything.

175
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:10,586
I mean, what can you do?

176
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,463
-Eighth grade, right?
-Yes.

177
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:13,631
Gosh.

178
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:16,843
I said, "You have
to at least finish middle school."

179
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,970
-But the kid wants to take the GED test.
-What?

180
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:21,848
The kid will work part-time
and buy a camera and a computer.

181
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:24,600
And the kid told me
to mind my own business.

182
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:28,646
Sometimes I feel like my kid is an alien.

183
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:32,775
Hello. My gosh.

184
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:36,904
I guess you came here
right after your shoot.

185
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:38,406
Yes, hello.

186
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:41,868
I was up all night because of the shoot.
I got here a few hours ago.

187
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:45,746
I didn't have a chance
to remove my makeup though.

188
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:48,916
Is your father asleep?

189
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:51,002
Yes, he just fell asleep.

190
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:54,005
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

191
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,798
My gosh.

192
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,927
Even for simple surgery,
the next day is always the hardest.

193
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:02,096
After today, it'll be much easier,

194
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,182
so please tell him to hang in there.

195
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,726
He actually watched TV with me
until he fell asleep.

196
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:09,145
He doesn't feel any pain or discomfort.
He feels great.

197
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:15,818
Well, I should buy you a meal sometime.

198
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:17,153
Sure.

199
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,697
Then how about lunch today?

200
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:22,241
Sounds good.

201
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:31,250
How are the total bilirubin
and LFT levels?

202
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,753
The total bilirubin level is 25,
and LFT is 700 over 400,

203
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:35,379
but it keeps going up.

204
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:39,300
-Still no word from the KONOS?
-No.

205
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,473
I don't think she can hold out
for more than a week.

206
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:49,727
Gosh.

207
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:52,605
Ji-a's mother is outside, right?

208
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:55,983
Yes, she is. But she's devastated.

209
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:01,989
I explained everything to her.
Often, and in detail.

210
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:05,409
Not like the last time. I wasn't blunt.

211
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:07,995
Thanks.

212
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:10,790
I'll tell her

213
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,709
that Ji-a might have a hard time.

214
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:55,084
You're a big eater now.

215
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:00,548
Back then,
I only ate one meal every two days.

216
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:02,842
-It must've been tough for you.
-Yes.

217
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,052
Sorry.

218
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:11,684
Well, is that why you broke up with me?

219
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:15,062
Me? I didn't say I want
to break up with you.

220
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:16,731
-Did I say it first?
-Yes.

221
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,651
You said you were stressed and tired.
You wanted a break.

222
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,361
Then you were off the grid.

223
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:27,033
I did. But when I called you
after a little while,

224
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,035
you ignored my calls.

225
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:32,121
-I called you about 30 times.
-No, you called 29 times.

226
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,166
Good for you. You have a good memory.

227
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,500
I totally made that up.

228
00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:41,881
-Hello, I'm a fan of yours.
-Oh...

229
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:45,468
-Hello, enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

230
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:52,808
Are you uncomfortable here?
We should've eaten out.

231
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:56,020
Yes, I said I'd take you
to a nice restaurant.

232
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:59,190
Gosh, don't you know about
the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act?

233
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:01,817
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hello, Professor Lee.

234
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,407
Aren't you...

235
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:11,285
Yes. She's the person who you think
she is, but she's eating right now.

236
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:12,495
Go away, guys.

237
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:14,664
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

238
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:17,166
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

239
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:25,049
Would you like anything else?
This <i>kongguksu</i> is good too.

240
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:28,719
My, look who's here. I'm a fan of yours.

241
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:32,223
Gosh, these pricks.
Can you please let her eat--

242
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:34,892
My gosh.

243
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,560
Hello, sir.

244
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:38,854
Is everything fine, my good sir?

245
00:14:39,563 --> 00:14:41,816
-He's the chairman of the hospital board.
-Oh, hello.

246
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,235
My gosh, you don't need to get up. Please.

247
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,570
You look much prettier in person.

248
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:48,489
My goodness.

249
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:50,615
Are you a doll?

250
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,534
Gosh, no.

251
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:54,995
What brings you by?

252
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,497
-Are you not feeling well?
-I'm fine.

253
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,540
I came for a checkup.

254
00:14:57,915 --> 00:15:00,626
-Is she your patient?
-Well...

255
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,838
I performed surgery
on her father yesterday.

256
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,799
Can I take a picture with you?

257
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:09,051
-Sure.
-Let's take a selfie together.

258
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:11,387
Sure, I can take it.

259
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:14,807
Hey, I want to be in the picture too.

260
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:17,017
All right.

261
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:19,353
Here we go.

262
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:27,862
Oh, I was recording a video.
Sorry about that.

263
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:31,866
-Shall I take a picture of all of you?
-No, it's okay. I got this.

264
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,910
All right, let's try it again.
Look at the camera.

265
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,917
-What are you doing?
-Here. Let's do this.

266
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,757
-Hey.
-This is...

267
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,468
Hey, you take it. Goodness.

268
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,094
-All right, then.
-Okay, guys.

269
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:57,641
I'll take it now. One, two, three.

270
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:03,814
You're too stubborn.

271
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:06,650
That was embarrassing,
in front of all those people.

272
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,736
What was I supposed to do?
I can't see very well.

273
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:11,155
Hand me your car keys.
I'll drive you home.

274
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,157
People become more stubborn as they age.

275
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,409
-No wonder youngsters don't like you.
-Come on now.

276
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:18,287
I'm still young at heart.

277
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,122
Age is nothing but a number.

278
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:23,542
You need to be youthful physically.
How you feel doesn't matter at all.

279
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:25,085
Jeez, give me that.

280
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:28,005
Maybe the battery is dead.

281
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,426
Are you sure it's on this floor?

282
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,261
I always park here...

283
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:47,983
I told you.
How you feel doesn't matter at all.

284
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,072
Let's move into a nursing home, Jong-su.

285
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:55,533
Do you know of a good one?
Frankly, I'd like that.

286
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,827
But first, let's find your car.
Give me that.

287
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:00,454
I took a taxi here today.

288
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:12,675
-Goodness.
-I took a taxi.

289
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:17,346
-Oh, dear.
-You think it's funny?

290
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:20,474
Yes, I have to laugh.

291
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:23,853
Goodness. You're too much.

292
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:27,231
Gosh. I get that you were
all over the place today, but how...

293
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,859
-Oh, boy.
-I took a taxi here.

294
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,079
MOM

295
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,924
<i>Hi, Son. Did you have lunch?</i>

296
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:56,635
No, not yet. I'm going to have lunch now.

297
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,306
What's with your voice, Mom?
Do you have a cold?

298
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:03,475
<i>They say even dogs don't catch a cold
in the middle of summer,</i>

299
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:06,604
<i>yet I caught a cold. Poor me.</i>

300
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,523
<i>I'm okay though. I took some medicine.</i>

301
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:11,609
<i>What is it? Did something happen?</i>

302
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,444
Oh... No.

303
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:16,530
I'll go to Aunt's place after work.

304
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:18,157
Yes.

305
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:21,493
I'll head over there now
and eat something.

306
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,078
I'll see you later.

307
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:31,337
When did you get here?

308
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:37,718
What's wrong?
Is your patient not doing well?

309
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:40,220
It's a six-month-old baby.

310
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:43,474
We performed the Kasai procedure
three months ago for her biliary atresia.

311
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:45,100
And?

312
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:48,354
Her condition seemed to be improving
after the surgery,

313
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,689
but her hepatocirrhosis
is quite serious now.

314
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:54,360
A liver transplant
would be the only solution.

315
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:57,988
But her mom's blood type isn't compatible,
and her dad has hepatitis B.

316
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,241
Have you registered her yet?

317
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:03,535
It won't be easy to find a donor
as she's a baby.

318
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:06,872
Yes, I already did.
But I haven't heard from them yet.

319
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:11,293
She's an infant, so a brain-dead donor
must be under the age of 40.

320
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:13,087
And the liver can't be too large.

321
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:15,923
It's honestly so difficult.

322
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:21,971
Her parents seem exhausted.

323
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:23,889
I think they've almost given up.

324
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,060
I can't give up though.

325
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,395
Oh, boy.

326
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:32,314
But you should try everything you can do.

327
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,734
Let's go.

328
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,780
-Let's go eat something.
-I don't have an appetite.

329
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:49,623
What? A hinoki bathtub?
Why do you need it?

330
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,836
Seong-beom who lives next door
got one for his mom?

331
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,296
What? Thirty million won?

332
00:19:56,964 --> 00:20:01,552
Mom, your son is not rich.
I live paycheck to paycheck.

333
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:03,178
Gosh, seriously!

334
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:06,348
I already spoke to my friend
who's an ENT doctor.

335
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,726
Come to the hospital next week.
I'll go with you.

336
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:12,688
You need to get good-quality hearing aids
that fit well.

337
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:16,525
Gosh, I chose a cheap one.

338
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:19,069
Yes, seriously. It was very cheap.

339
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:23,032
Okay.

340
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,034
Jeong-yeon changed what?

341
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:27,578
She changed her name? To what?

342
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:30,956
Mom.

343
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:33,959
If she's still only getting minor roles
after 15 years,

344
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:35,502
it means she doesn't have talent.

345
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:39,048
Tell her to quit and learn
a practical skill or prepare for an exam.

346
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:41,592
I'll talk to her.

347
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:43,761
Okay, I'll call her.

348
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:46,388
-Jeong-yeon changed her name?
-Yes.

349
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:48,932
She's Yeon-jeong now.

350
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:51,685
-That's a pretty name.
-Pretty, my ass.

351
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:54,605
What a joke.
It sounds like a Chinese restaurant.

352
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:55,522
My gosh.

353
00:20:56,106 --> 00:20:58,484
-She's so immature.
-You ordered eggs, right?

354
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:03,572
Your eggs are here. They're fresh and big.

355
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:05,991
You haven't eaten yet, right? I knew it.

356
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:07,785
Here, the lady at the cafeteria
gave me this.

357
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:09,745
-They're boiled eggs, right?
-Obviously.

358
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:13,332
Professor Chae, the flash drive. Hello.

359
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:15,501
-Yes, I'll take it.
-Here you go.

360
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:18,087
My brother, good to see you.

361
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,838
A younger sister's husband
is a brother-in-law.

362
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:21,548
Gosh, no.

363
00:21:21,632 --> 00:21:23,592
Brother-in-law, have a seat here.

364
00:21:23,842 --> 00:21:25,427
Are you busy? Sit down for a minute.

365
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:28,097
-I can't. I have to do something.
-Song-hwa.

366
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,100
Is he that busy?
Are you making him work like a dog?

367
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:34,436
Join us and have some food.

368
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:39,358
Yes, have a seat.
I have something to tell you.

369
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:40,359
Okay.

370
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:46,657
Well...

371
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:49,201
You know that you're the first, right?

372
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,162
-What do you mean?
-I'm talking about Ik-sun.

373
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:55,082
She's actually quite popular.

374
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,835
When you meet her,

375
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,962
you realize that she's funnier
than you thought.

376
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:03,048
Yes, you're right. She's really funny.

377
00:22:03,632 --> 00:22:04,758
I know that very well.

378
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:07,261
Especially, the pigeon...

379
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:09,388
Right, the pigeon.

380
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:12,766
You must've seen it many times.
I taught her that.

381
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:14,476
You see, I...

382
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,937
This is what I do. The pigeon...

383
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:20,190
It flies like this.

384
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:26,154
Then it comes back like this.

385
00:22:26,864 --> 00:22:28,282
I've been seeing that for 20 years.

386
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:30,492
-Gosh, I'm sick of it.
-I've seen his and his sister's.

387
00:22:30,576 --> 00:22:33,328
That's why she's had so many guys
confess their feelings to her.

388
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:35,581
I'm telling you. Ik-sun has had

389
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:38,584
countless guys chase her.

390
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:42,254
Yes, Ik-sun is popular
in the unit as well.

391
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:43,171
Right?

392
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:46,174
She's used to having guys
confess their feelings to her.

393
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:49,928
This is my first time seeing her
being so obvious about liking a guy.

394
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:52,014
Me?

395
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:55,225
Gosh, it's not me.
We don't have that kind of relationship.

396
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:58,478
Seriously, we're just close friends.
She's my best friend.

397
00:22:58,562 --> 00:23:01,064
-Really.
-That's how it begins, you know.

398
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:04,318
Soon, you guys will call each other
"babe" or "honey."

399
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,987
Professor Lee, we're really just friends.

400
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:08,488
You see, my sister...

401
00:23:10,866 --> 00:23:13,535
She's so used to receiving love.

402
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:16,079
She's never liked a guy first.

403
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:18,790
Even if she had a crush on someone,
she never showed it.

404
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:20,459
But I think

405
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,921
my sister likes you.

406
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:27,424
Dr. Ahn.

407
00:23:29,593 --> 00:23:30,802
I hope

408
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:34,640
you'll accept my sister's love.

409
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:44,483
Are you all right? That must've hurt.

410
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,072
-Why did you hit me? What the hell?
-Hey.

411
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:51,531
-Why--
-You prick.

412
00:23:51,615 --> 00:23:52,658
-Hey, guys.
-What? Why?

413
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:53,867
-I didn't do anything.
-Stop.

414
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:55,702
-Who do you think you are?
-How embarrassing.

415
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:58,038
-What's your problem?
-Guys, enough!

416
00:23:58,121 --> 00:23:59,957
Hey, what the hell?

417
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,708
I brought those eggs.

418
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,335
-How dare you smack my head--
-Seriously!

419
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:18,266
I thought
you guys were seven-year-old boys.

420
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:21,103
Why did you use his head to crack the egg?

421
00:24:21,186 --> 00:24:22,980
Because Ik-jun kept talking nonsense.

422
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:24,731
Why is that nonsense?

423
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:28,193
I've never seen a guy
who knows so much about his sister.

424
00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:30,862
He was talking about himself,
not his sister.

425
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:32,823
That's how he's always been.

426
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,701
Have you ever seen Ik-jun
fall for a girl first?

427
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:38,370
He married Hye-jeong
because she chased him for months.

428
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:41,498
He and his sister
are driving me nuts these days.

429
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,126
I'm leaving.

430
00:24:45,627 --> 00:24:46,795
You won't stay for coffee?

431
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,797
I have to go see Mr. Instinct.

432
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:52,217
I have a gift for him.

433
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:54,970
Bye.

434
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:02,310
Have you seen Mr. Instinct?

435
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:03,812
"Mr. Instinct"?

436
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:06,356
Dr. Do stepped out to get coffee.

437
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,858
-Should I call him?
-No, no need.

438
00:25:09,317 --> 00:25:11,194
He's never around
when I'm trying to be nice.

439
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:12,654
Why, Professor?

440
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:15,741
I was going to ask him
to take care of an ASD next week.

441
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:18,577
-Shall I call him?
-No, I can call him.

442
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:21,204
I was going to tell him nonchalantly
and surprise him.

443
00:25:21,747 --> 00:25:24,499
I heard he comes here often,
so I came to find him.

444
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:27,753
Too bad. I suppose this is his fate.

445
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:30,047
Take it easy, guys.

446
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:41,766
What brings you here?

447
00:25:47,321 --> 00:25:48,989
What brings you here?

448
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:51,408
Is this Dr. Bong's salon,
where I can find out

449
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:53,786
everything about the professors
from their first love

450
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:55,830
to their health problems?

451
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:58,082
That's correct.
About Professor Kim Jun-wan?

452
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,041
Correct.

453
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,877
I love Professor Kim very much.

454
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,838
I want to know more about him.
What should I do?

455
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,881
Gosh, I'm so curious.

456
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:10,427
Dr. Ahn, I'm really jealous.

457
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:13,013
Professor Chae is like Mother Teresa.

458
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:14,098
Yes, she's great.

459
00:26:15,057 --> 00:26:17,560
Dr. Ahn, you really don't look like
a military guy.

460
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,395
Are you sure
you're from the Military Academy?

461
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,480
Yes, I did pretty well in the military.

462
00:26:21,564 --> 00:26:22,982
Then why did you leave?

463
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:25,568
You got into Korea Military Academy
and became a captain.

464
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:26,735
Why did you quit?

465
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:29,238
Rumor has it
that it was because of a woman.

466
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,490
I heard he quit because
he lacks the aptitude for it.

467
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:34,785
There was a big accident in his unit.
He quit because of his PTSD.

468
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:37,204
-I'm sure a woman was involved.
-He lacks the aptitude.

469
00:26:37,288 --> 00:26:39,415
He obviously didn't follow
the MBTI test results.

470
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,542
It was because
of his post-traumatic stress disorder.

471
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,085
It can be very stressful.

472
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:47,256
Wouldn't it be more comfortable for you
to talk about this when I'm not around?

473
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,177
No, we never talk behind anyone's back.
We say it in front of them.

474
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:55,598
Dr. Ahn, you won't tell us anyway. Right?

475
00:26:57,892 --> 00:27:00,019
Forget it. It's not like we're curious.

476
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:02,229
-All right.
-Also, the past isn't important.

477
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:03,898
The future is what matters.

478
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,274
Professor.

479
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,485
What does Professor Kim Jun-wan
like the most?

480
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:12,156
I've been observing him
for half a year and...

481
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:13,699
And?

482
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,910
I think he likes everyone but me.

483
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:18,245
He doesn't open up easily.

484
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:21,874
He has no interest in other people.
He's a selfish guy.

485
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:26,045
Oh, there is this one thing.
Golf. He loves golf.

486
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:29,173
He'd even go golfing
with his parents' worst enemy.

487
00:27:51,612 --> 00:27:54,490
As for Jeong-won, he's from a rich family,

488
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,951
so he's dabbled in all sorts of things.

489
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:58,953
He has a different hobby for each season.

490
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:00,329
-In spring--
-He runs a marathon.

491
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:02,706
<i>That's right.
He runs a marathon in spring.</i>

492
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,458
<i>In summer, he goes surfing.</i>

493
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:08,921
In autumn, he goes hiking.
Then in winter, he goes skiing.

494
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,924
But he can't do any of that these days
because he's busy.

495
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:13,092
What about Professor Yang?

496
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:16,595
Seok-hyeong? Does he have a hobby?

497
00:28:17,638 --> 00:28:18,973
I think he's always home.

498
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:23,227
Rumor has it that he has a 300-inch TV.

499
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,812
Jeez.

500
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,564
Song-hwa's only hobby is going camping.

501
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:53,966
As for Ik-jun...

502
00:28:55,676 --> 00:28:56,802
That prick is...

503
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,221
He does everything.

504
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:04,560
He bikes, golfs,
and also likes video games.

505
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:07,313
He can play the guitar
as well as the bass guitar.

506
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:11,275
He even wrote a cheer song
for a baseball team. Also, he can cook.

507
00:29:12,276 --> 00:29:15,654
Anyway, he does everything.
And he's good at all of them.

508
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:18,657
-He can cook?
-He sure can.

509
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,785
You know
he's been a single father for a few years.

510
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:25,831
He's adamant about giving U-ju
only organic, home-cooked meals at home,

511
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:29,376
so he always cooks and eats
with his son on weekends.

512
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,903
Does it need more vinegar?

513
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,474
Hands up.

514
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,144
Are Ma-ne and her dad the only ones
coming this evening?

515
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,730
-It's Mo-ne.
-Right, Mo-ne.

516
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,401
Does Mo-ne not have a sister?

517
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:37,152
I'm sure she does. One called Ma-ne.

518
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:40,072
She has an older sister, Jang Ma-ne.
They're twins.

519
00:30:41,865 --> 00:30:42,908
See? I knew it.

520
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:45,953
Ma-ne and Mo-ne always go as a set.

521
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:47,788
Is Ma-ne not coming today?

522
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:51,625
I don't know. I like Mo-ne.

523
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:52,918
Here you go.

524
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:55,712
When it comes to love, you never know.

525
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:59,049
I made meatballs.

526
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:02,094
-I even made ketchup from scratch.
-I want <i>jajangmyeon</i>!

527
00:31:03,804 --> 00:31:05,055
Hey, come on.

528
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:18,444
What's your name?

529
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:20,737
"Brachyscome angustifolia."

530
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:23,699
It blooms all year round?

531
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:27,619
Your life must be exhausting.

532
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,380
"Geranium"?

533
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:40,507
I've heard of "plutonium"

534
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:44,595
and "uranium,"
but I've never heard of "geranium."

535
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:47,055
Anyway, nice to meet you.

536
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:49,850
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

537
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:53,770
Gosh, I'm sick of that place.

538
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:58,650
If I fall ill, I'll just quietly move
into a temple somewhere.

539
00:32:01,862 --> 00:32:04,031
Oh, another flower I've never seen before.

540
00:32:04,198 --> 00:32:06,658
Hold on. What is your name?

541
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:08,744
Jong-su, try taking a picture of me.

542
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:12,956
Come on.

543
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:26,386
-What does it say?
-What?

544
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:29,598
Oh, it found a name.

545
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,016
-Really?
-Yes.

546
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,393
The name is...

547
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,188
"Your Youth Is Gone."

548
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:37,439
What?

549
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:40,776
It says your youth is gone.

550
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,695
For real? Let me see.

551
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:45,739
Show me.

552
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,575
Come on. Show me!

553
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,285
Gosh, no need. What's there to see?

554
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:51,912
-Hey!
-Goodness.

555
00:32:51,995 --> 00:32:54,831
-Gosh, seriously.
-Ouch. Let's go inside.

556
00:32:54,915 --> 00:32:57,459
-It's cold. Come on!
-What are you talking about? It's summer.

557
00:32:57,543 --> 00:33:00,546
-Gosh, it's so cold.
-Hey, show me. Does it really say that?

558
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:01,672
Hey!

559
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,718
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

560
00:33:17,646 --> 00:33:20,983
You look good.
You're young, so you always look pretty.

561
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:24,528
Oh, you look a little tired today.

562
00:33:25,028 --> 00:33:27,864
-Menstrual cramps. I get it every month.
-Oh, no.

563
00:33:29,366 --> 00:33:32,077
-I have a question.
-Fire away.

564
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:35,789
Is that the only outfit you have?

565
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,791
Yes, this is my summer outfit.

566
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:45,048
What? What are you doing?

567
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,968
I can see my reflection on your face.

568
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:49,636
This is called dewy makeup.

569
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,971
It's too much.

570
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:56,893
My mom said fashion that others
don't recognize can't be called fashion.

571
00:33:56,977 --> 00:34:00,897
My mom said I should tell my friends
right away when they go the wrong way.

572
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,651
What the heck?

573
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:18,707
We'll begin the ASD closure
for patient Jeong Jin-ho.

574
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:23,170
Lead surgeon Do Jae-hak.
First assistant Kim Jun-wan.

575
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:25,881
Please begin, Dr. Do.

576
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:27,841
Okay.

577
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,824
Don't cut that part.

578
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:55,619
Be very precise,
or you'll damage other parts.

579
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:56,870
Got it.

580
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,801
Again, be precise.
Go down to the endocardium.

581
00:35:12,135 --> 00:35:15,222
If you only stitch up the outer layers
that are on sight, it'll bleed later.

582
00:35:15,305 --> 00:35:16,306
Understood, Doctor.

583
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,475
For that part, don't go too deep.

584
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:22,562
Don't fool your eyes. Look and be precise.

585
00:35:23,146 --> 00:35:24,398
Okay.

586
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:28,902
Dr. Do.

587
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:32,114
I got a call from the ICU,
so I can't finish this up.

588
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,075
Can I go?

589
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:37,244
Yes, get going. Thanks for your help.

590
00:35:37,994 --> 00:35:40,038
All right, thank you.

591
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:43,834
Professor.

592
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:49,715
Thank you for this opportunity.

593
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,134
I'll do better next time.

594
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,885
Okay, do better next time.

595
00:35:59,057 --> 00:35:59,975
Hey.

596
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:04,229
You actually did better than I thought.
What's gotten into you?

597
00:36:19,661 --> 00:36:21,121
-Hello.
-Hello.

598
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:22,622
Pass me my phone.

599
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,127
-Are you guys med students?
-Yes.

600
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,171
Where do you live?

601
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,381
I live pretty far.
It takes 50 minutes by subway.

602
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:33,717
My gosh, that must be tiring.

603
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:37,095
-All right, take it easy.
-Have a nice day, sir.

604
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:48,190
-Hello.
-Hello.

605
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,649
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul.

606
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:51,860
She's in the OR.

607
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,112
Oh, really? Thanks.

608
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,490
Med students, right?

609
00:36:56,573 --> 00:36:57,908
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

610
00:36:57,991 --> 00:36:59,326
What does your father do?

611
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,912
-He's a farmer.
-I see.

612
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:05,999
Have a good day, sir.

613
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:12,964
Professor.

614
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:16,551
Ji-a's hourly urine output
is less than 3cc.

615
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:19,012
-What about her vitals?
-Her BP is okay,

616
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:21,473
but her heart rate is around 150bpm.
She has tachycardia.

617
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:27,062
Professor, we're ready.

618
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,438
Okay, I'm coming.

619
00:37:29,189 --> 00:37:31,483
It's an imperforate anus surgery,
so I'll finish in two hours.

620
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:33,985
Give her more fluid
and keep me updated, please.

621
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:38,740
Call Professor Lee Ji-yeong
if she gets worse. I'll let her know.

622
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:40,116
Okay.

623
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,215
-Hello.
-Hi, who are you?

624
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:56,383
I'm a med student.

625
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:59,553
Why did you choose to go to med school?
It's a hard path.

626
00:37:59,636 --> 00:38:01,513
-Is there a doctor in your family?
-No.

627
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:04,933
-What does your father do?
-He's a farmer.

628
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,184
I see. Farming is great.

629
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,274
No, the surgery wasn't that hard.

630
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:17,487
It was for a condition called "ASD,"
an atrial septal defect.

631
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,324
I do it all the time.

632
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:24,077
Yes, I got it done in no time.

633
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:27,122
Why would I get yelled at?

634
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:34,504
Professor Kim doesn't lose his temper
for no reason.

635
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,757
Honey, I'll call you back.

636
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:41,428
-Where are you going?
-Not telling you. Was that your wife?

637
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:43,513
Yes, I bragged about my first surgery.

638
00:38:43,597 --> 00:38:45,348
I'm envious that you have a wife.

639
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:47,350
Professor, I signed a long-term lease.

640
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:49,853
No more monthly rent!
The deposit is 200 million won.

641
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,605
I'll invite you to our housewarming party.

642
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:54,399
Did you check everything thoroughly?
There are a lot of rental scams.

643
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:57,527
It's me who took the college entry exam
four times, and the bar exam six times.

644
00:38:58,278 --> 00:39:00,280
Long-term leases are rare these days,

645
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:02,657
so I was wondering if I should
just extend my monthly lease.

646
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:05,660
But it was one of my realtor's listings,
so I signed it right away.

647
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:08,246
In other words,
my realtor will be my landlord.

648
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,540
So everything was very easy.
I signed it immediately.

649
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:15,962
Hey, realtors can be scammers too.

650
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:19,841
I checked a certified copy of the register
as well as his ID.

651
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:21,760
-You should be careful.
-Of what?

652
00:39:22,385 --> 00:39:24,012
Professor Cheon Myeong-tae.

653
00:39:24,888 --> 00:39:27,682
I've heard bad rumors about him.
Stay away from him.

654
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:28,934
"Bad rumors"? Like what?

655
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:32,228
-It's kind of gross.
-Gosh, enough. I don't want to hear it.

656
00:39:32,312 --> 00:39:35,273
Be it cheating, gambling, or stealing.
I don't care what he does.

657
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:37,150
Get back to work.
Stop following me around.

658
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,695
-Oh, Professor.
-What? What now?

659
00:39:42,155 --> 00:39:43,406
You're seeing someone, right?

660
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:48,328
You're literally glued to your phone.

661
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:53,291
And if she takes this long
to get back to you,

662
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,919
it's safe to assume that she dumped you.

663
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,270
-Hello.
-Hello.

664
00:40:14,354 --> 00:40:17,899
Hi, guys. Are you two
the famous Hong-do and Yun-bok?

665
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:21,194
-Yes, I'm Jang Yun-bok.
-I'm Jang Hong-do.

666
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:24,280
We've met before. I gave you a lot of
sausages at the cafeteria that day.

667
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:26,741
No way. That was him?

668
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,368
The chatty cafeteria guy?

669
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:29,536
Be quiet.

670
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:30,745
Hey.

671
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:32,247
Yes?

672
00:40:33,957 --> 00:40:35,583
What songs do kids listen to these days?

673
00:40:36,543 --> 00:40:38,503
-Pardon?
-I'm talking about music.

674
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:41,381
Tell me the kind of songs
you listen to these days.

675
00:40:41,965 --> 00:40:43,258
IU's songs.

676
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:46,302
Well, I listen to...

677
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:49,139
Zoo's songs.

678
00:40:49,222 --> 00:40:50,223
Zoo?

679
00:40:51,974 --> 00:40:54,644
Zoo? Hold on. Are you talking
about the band that I like?

680
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:56,563
How do you know that band?

681
00:40:56,646 --> 00:40:58,940
She always listens to old songs.

682
00:40:59,024 --> 00:40:59,941
She's so lame.

683
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,901
No, she's not.
What's lame about old songs?

684
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:03,945
-You're lamer.
-No, they are lame.

685
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:05,405
He doesn't get romance.

686
00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:07,782
I can see that.
Hey, don't hang out with him.

687
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:09,659
You know nothing...

688
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:12,412
Yes, I'm on my way now. Okay.

689
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:15,123
I'm leaving for my rounds.

690
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,208
I'll buy you a nice meal
when I see you again. Okay?

691
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:19,335
Oh, right. Don't stay here.

692
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:20,545
Go to the cafe in the lobby.

693
00:41:20,628 --> 00:41:21,755
If you stay here,

694
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,382
whoever walks in will try to give you
advice and meddle. Okay?

695
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,342
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

696
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:27,677
Bye.

697
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:33,975
-Is he a comedian?
-No.

698
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,269
He's Dr. Romantic.

699
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,280
What's wrong with you? Are you all right?

700
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,783
What do you mean? I want Coke.

701
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:52,368
Your face is very swollen.

702
00:41:52,452 --> 00:41:53,620
You should...

703
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,413
Oh, this. I have menstrual cramps.

704
00:41:55,497 --> 00:41:56,831
I took some medicine.

705
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:58,833
I think the medication
caused the swelling.

706
00:42:00,502 --> 00:42:02,253
Hello, Professor Lee.

707
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:04,047
What happened?

708
00:42:05,298 --> 00:42:07,550
-Go to the ER now.
-What?

709
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:09,511
I'm all right. I'm just

710
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:12,180
feeling under the weather today.

711
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,473
No, you're not okay.

712
00:42:13,556 --> 00:42:15,850
It looks like an allergic reaction.
What did you have today?

713
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,602
Nothing really.

714
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,231
What?

715
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:23,650
-Hey.
-Oh, no.

716
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:26,194
We ran a blood test,

717
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:29,948
and you have
the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

718
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:31,950
To maintain a healthy pregnancy,

719
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:33,785
your blood has to flow well.

720
00:42:33,868 --> 00:42:36,079
But with this syndrome,

721
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:38,790
it's hard for your blood to circulate.

722
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:42,335
Forming a placenta and maintaining
your pregnancy can be difficult.

723
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:47,215
Then, is this similar to
having recurrent pregnancy loss?

724
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:48,800
Yes.

725
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,929
So, this is your third pregnancy.

726
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:55,014
And you had two previous miscarriages.

727
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:59,352
Let's see. You're seven weeks pregnant.

728
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:01,563
Yes.

729
00:43:04,357 --> 00:43:05,525
Here.

730
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:08,945
I'd like to prescribe some medication.

731
00:43:09,237 --> 00:43:12,031
You should get heparin shots.

732
00:43:12,115 --> 00:43:16,077
This shot will prevent
the blood from clotting.

733
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:18,830
You can easily get these shots.

734
00:43:18,913 --> 00:43:22,250
This is similar to the insulin shots
diabetes patients get.

735
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,252
And the needle is very thin,

736
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,421
so it won't hurt as much.

737
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:29,090
And our nurse will thoroughly explain

738
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:31,676
how to inject the shots
and take the medication.

739
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:35,096
Come back after two weeks,
and I'll check on your condition, then.

740
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:41,436
Professor,

741
00:43:42,437 --> 00:43:45,315
you must have seen a lot of mothers
with this kind of disease.

742
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:48,318
So you must think
this is nothing serious, right?

743
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,322
Why is miscarriage a disease?

744
00:43:58,077 --> 00:43:59,829
Miscarriage isn't a disease.

745
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:03,666
Of course, you did nothing wrong here.

746
00:44:05,585 --> 00:44:08,087
A lot of patients
that had miscarriages ask me

747
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:11,424
if they did something wrong
or if they must be careful in the future.

748
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:12,467
That's not true.

749
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:16,179
This can happen to anyone.

750
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:20,558
And besides, you know the cause this time.

751
00:44:20,642 --> 00:44:22,435
We can prepare for it
and help you get treated.

752
00:44:22,518 --> 00:44:24,771
Then you may be able to
have a healthy baby.

753
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:27,315
So make sure you get your heparin shots.

754
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,692
And take it easy for the time being.

755
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:32,111
Okay.

756
00:44:32,195 --> 00:44:33,863
Thank you.

757
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:39,118
-Are we done?
-Yes.

758
00:44:39,202 --> 00:44:40,078
We're done for today.

759
00:44:40,328 --> 00:44:41,329
Lunch?

760
00:44:41,454 --> 00:44:44,040
It's on me. Let's go!

761
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:45,583
Okay.

762
00:44:50,129 --> 00:44:51,881
Two pieces of chocolate cake,
to-go, please.

763
00:44:52,382 --> 00:44:55,301
-How many forks do you need?
-One. Both of them are for me.

764
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:58,805
<i>Cardiothoracic Surgery, Code Blue.</i>

765
00:44:58,888 --> 00:45:00,974
<i>To the hallway in front of Room 6210.</i>

766
00:45:01,057 --> 00:45:03,434
-Emergency for CS, right?
<i>-Cardiothoracic Surgery, Code Blue.</i>

767
00:45:03,518 --> 00:45:05,812
<i>To the hallway in front of Room 6210.</i>

768
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,501
-Is it Professor Park Jin-u's patient?
-Yes.

769
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:31,087
The patient had endocarditis,
so they performed an AVR.

770
00:45:31,587 --> 00:45:33,047
I'll check the rhythm.

771
00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:37,635
-His heart is beating.
-Mr. Lee Jong-hyeon.

772
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:40,013
Mr. Lee Jong-hyeon, are you all right?

773
00:45:46,436 --> 00:45:47,770
What a relief.

774
00:45:49,105 --> 00:45:50,565
-Bye.
-Bye.

775
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:53,234
Check if it's flowing right. Well done.

776
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,822
Professor Kim.

777
00:45:59,532 --> 00:46:00,533
Hello.

778
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,368
I'm Cheon Myeong-tae.

779
00:46:03,411 --> 00:46:04,912
Hi. I'm Kim Jun-wan.

780
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:07,707
So you're the big shot at CS.

781
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:09,542
I am?

782
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:12,628
You're in charge of the VIP Ward,
so I say you are.

783
00:46:14,464 --> 00:46:16,382
One's talent makes
all the difference to doctors.

784
00:46:20,303 --> 00:46:22,055
What are you doing this weekend?

785
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:24,349
Do you like golf?

786
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:29,437
Over there. There are two empty seats.

787
00:46:29,812 --> 00:46:31,731
Professor Yang, over there.

788
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:33,858
Go ahead. It's all right.

789
00:46:34,317 --> 00:46:36,194
Seon-jin, take the seat over there.

790
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:38,488
Professor Yang, let's sit here.

791
00:46:38,571 --> 00:46:39,572
Okay.

792
00:46:47,955 --> 00:46:50,124
I have a question.

793
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,752
-Can I?
-Yes.

794
00:46:55,797 --> 00:46:57,090
Well,

795
00:46:58,132 --> 00:47:00,468
you met a woman in a navy lace dress

796
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,554
at the outdoor garden last week.
Who is she?

797
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:06,933
You two

798
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:10,019
looked cozy together
when you were talking to each other.

799
00:47:10,103 --> 00:47:11,396
Who is she?

800
00:47:18,528 --> 00:47:19,362
Oh, her.

801
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:22,698
The mistress of Taegeon Apparel's
Chairman Yang Tae-yang.

802
00:47:22,782 --> 00:47:23,866
What?

803
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,202
She's the mistress
of Chairman Yang Tae-yang.

804
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:27,995
I see.

805
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,747
It was in the news, so you know, right?

806
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:31,999
I think the whole hospital knows.

807
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,169
I'm all right. I've been used to it
since I was in school.

808
00:47:43,052 --> 00:47:44,804
I see empty seats over there.
Jeong-won, look.

809
00:47:44,887 --> 00:47:45,721
Okay.

810
00:47:47,682 --> 00:47:51,227
Oh, right. Hey, do we have
band practice tomorrow?

811
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:55,064
Don't make any plans tomorrow night.
Okay, Jeong-won?

812
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:56,023
Okay.

813
00:47:58,818 --> 00:48:00,611
You finished.
You didn't pick at your food.

814
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:02,405
I was never picky with my food.

815
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:05,491
Don't be picky with people, you prick.

816
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:08,995
My resident is here.

817
00:48:12,206 --> 00:48:14,083
You're best friends with Dr. Jang, right?

818
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,335
Yes, I am. How do you know that?

819
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:18,337
I see you together all the time.

820
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:20,423
Right. Gyeo-ul is in the ER now.

821
00:48:20,506 --> 00:48:21,591
My gosh, why?

822
00:48:22,008 --> 00:48:24,010
It's gotten better after she got the shot.

823
00:48:24,093 --> 00:48:26,137
I think she had anaphylaxis from NSAIDs.

824
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,263
SUDDEN REACTION TO THE BODY

825
00:48:27,346 --> 00:48:29,932
Her face swelled 30 minutes
after taking the pill for cramps.

826
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:31,100
Then, she couldn't breathe.

827
00:48:31,184 --> 00:48:33,352
She passed out like a scene in the movie.

828
00:48:33,436 --> 00:48:35,897
-Oh, no. Please excuse me.
-Okay.

829
00:48:36,689 --> 00:48:38,316
She's much better now.

830
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,734
She's probably asleep.

831
00:48:41,194 --> 00:48:43,613
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

832
00:48:57,543 --> 00:48:58,878
Gosh. Are you okay?

833
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:01,130
Are you in pain? Should I call Hui-su?

834
00:49:01,214 --> 00:49:03,716
No. I'm not in pain anymore.

835
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,010
Did you sleep here?

836
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:07,637
Is it dawn now?

837
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:09,847
Yes, it's night.

838
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:13,267
But you've been getting
a lot of text messages.

839
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:15,144
A lot of professors came to check on you.

840
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:21,108
I should have chosen GS too.

841
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,569
They don't treat you like a resident.

842
00:49:23,653 --> 00:49:25,530
You're treated like a princess.

843
00:49:32,578 --> 00:49:33,955
<i>I heard you were sick.</i>

844
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,706
<i>Are you feeling better now?</i>

845
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,583
<i>Get a lot of rest and feel better.</i>

846
00:49:38,084 --> 00:49:39,544
He sent me a smiley face, right?

847
00:49:41,837 --> 00:49:43,506
Yes. A smiley face.

848
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:45,967
That's not a tilde. It's a smiley face.

849
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,095
Yes, it is. It's a smiley face.

850
00:49:49,178 --> 00:49:50,388
What about it?

851
00:49:53,182 --> 00:49:55,184
Could he have feelings for me?

852
00:49:55,268 --> 00:49:56,727
What?

853
00:49:56,811 --> 00:49:59,105
Professor Ahn likes me, right?

854
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,066
No.

855
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:03,901
Why not?

856
00:50:03,985 --> 00:50:05,695
If he likes you,

857
00:50:06,195 --> 00:50:07,822
he would have come here.

858
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:15,162
You like him, don't you?

859
00:50:18,207 --> 00:50:19,542
Dr. Jang,

860
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,878
you like Professor Ahn, right?

861
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:28,801
Yes.

862
00:50:38,477 --> 00:50:39,520
Yes, Song-hwa.

863
00:50:40,479 --> 00:50:42,773
Okay. Hold on.

864
00:50:43,524 --> 00:50:45,985
Jun-wan, Song-hwa needs to talk to us.
She wants to grab dinner.

865
00:50:46,068 --> 00:50:48,571
-You're free, right?
-Of course.

866
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:50,156
Yes, he can.

867
00:50:50,656 --> 00:50:53,200
Okay. We're on our way out, too.

868
00:50:53,826 --> 00:50:55,161
Okay. See you soon.

869
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,583
Something sounded off about her.
Did something happen?

870
00:51:02,918 --> 00:51:04,837
Why? How did she sound?

871
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,840
She acts as if everything is fine,

872
00:51:07,923 --> 00:51:10,259
but I think something is up with her.

873
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:15,806
Why are you telling us that now?

874
00:51:16,057 --> 00:51:17,600
When did you get tested?

875
00:51:20,592 --> 00:51:22,385
Why are you telling us that now?

876
00:51:22,636 --> 00:51:24,179
When did you get tested?

877
00:51:26,264 --> 00:51:27,766
It's been a week.

878
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:29,601
I got a biopsy.

879
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,353
I'll get the result tomorrow.

880
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:34,898
The core biopsy.

881
00:51:34,981 --> 00:51:36,191
Yes, that.

882
00:51:39,361 --> 00:51:40,570
The shape doesn't look good.

883
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:44,991
When the doctor told me that,
it did scare me a bit.

884
00:51:45,075 --> 00:51:46,993
Hey, how could you joke about that?

885
00:51:47,077 --> 00:51:49,830
Why did you go to Jae-an Medical Center?
If you had asked me or Ik-jun,

886
00:51:49,913 --> 00:51:51,456
we would've taken care of it right away.

887
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,916
When does the result come out?

888
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:55,418
My cousin works there. I'll ask him now.

889
00:51:55,502 --> 00:51:57,838
My gosh, stop it.

890
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,007
I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd make a fuss.

891
00:52:02,342 --> 00:52:05,387
If it's bad,
people in the hospital will talk about it.

892
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,888
I hate that.

893
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:08,306
What are you talking about?

894
00:52:08,473 --> 00:52:09,891
It's not going to be bad.

895
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,352
The result must be out already.
I'll call them.

896
00:52:12,435 --> 00:52:14,354
Stop it. Don't. Seriously, stop it.

897
00:52:14,437 --> 00:52:16,606
I'll find out tomorrow morning.
What's the point?

898
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,984
I really don't want you to do it,
so don't.

899
00:52:20,443 --> 00:52:23,363
This is why I had it done
at another hospital.

900
00:52:24,531 --> 00:52:26,741
Please don't do anything. Please?

901
00:52:26,825 --> 00:52:28,326
What time tomorrow?

902
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,453
-Seven.
-That early?

903
00:52:30,537 --> 00:52:33,456
Yes. My schedule is full this week.

904
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,876
When I said I couldn't make it,
they bumped me up by an hour.

905
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:38,420
They start seeing outpatients at eight
like we do.

906
00:52:38,503 --> 00:52:39,838
I'm very grateful for it.

907
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:43,258
Did you say you couldn't get the result
because of your outpatients?

908
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:46,136
Unbelievable.
You could've talked to the hospital

909
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:47,929
and rescheduled the appointments.

910
00:52:48,013 --> 00:52:49,264
Are you that inflexible?

911
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:52,184
How could I do that? Some patients
made appointments months ago.

912
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:54,352
Many are coming to Seoul
from the countryside.

913
00:52:54,436 --> 00:52:57,564
I'll be fine.
I'll go and get the result myself.

914
00:52:58,481 --> 00:53:00,775
My gosh, you and your nagging.

915
00:53:00,859 --> 00:53:02,736
But that's an excellent doctor.

916
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:05,197
Your doctor is coming to work
early for you.

917
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,991
Right? It's so early. I can never do that.

918
00:53:08,575 --> 00:53:10,368
Let me know as soon as you get the result.

919
00:53:11,036 --> 00:53:11,953
Okay.

920
00:53:12,037 --> 00:53:15,332
-Should I go with you?
-Don't you dare! I'm serious.

921
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:17,876
I'm sure it's nothing.

922
00:53:17,959 --> 00:53:20,212
Hey, let's eat. Dig in.

923
00:53:25,717 --> 00:53:27,052
It's not mine.

924
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:28,637
Not mine.

925
00:53:33,683 --> 00:53:34,684
Yes?

926
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:39,981
Are the vitals stable?

927
00:53:40,732 --> 00:53:42,108
Is there free air?

928
00:53:42,984 --> 00:53:44,236
Yes, I'm nearby.

929
00:53:45,904 --> 00:53:48,073
If there are a liver laceration
and a perforated bowel,

930
00:53:48,156 --> 00:53:49,699
I should explore that.

931
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:52,202
Okay. I'll be there soon.

932
00:53:53,245 --> 00:53:55,622
Darn it. I'm leaving.

933
00:53:55,914 --> 00:53:57,082
Good luck.

934
00:54:00,919 --> 00:54:03,255
I got off work,
but I'm at the hospital again.

935
00:54:03,713 --> 00:54:05,632
<i>Do you have an emergency patient?</i>

936
00:54:06,383 --> 00:54:08,009
Yes, the patient was in a car accident.

937
00:54:08,093 --> 00:54:10,720
I think the patient's liver
and bowel need surgery.

938
00:54:10,804 --> 00:54:14,307
<i>Oh, no. You'll probably
have to pull an all-nighter.</i>

939
00:54:14,391 --> 00:54:16,351
Yes, I'll probably be done in the morning.

940
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:17,644
And that's if I'm fast.

941
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:20,855
<i>Then, you should come to my shoot
when you're done in the morning.</i>

942
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:22,023
<i>It's nearby.</i>

943
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:24,276
<i>I must be on standby
early in the morning tomorrow, too.</i>

944
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:27,612
<i>I'll buy you coffee. There are a lot
of convenience stores nearby.</i>

945
00:54:27,696 --> 00:54:30,407
I should buy you coffee.
You treated me last time.

946
00:54:32,117 --> 00:54:34,744
If I finish early in the morning,

947
00:54:34,828 --> 00:54:37,372
I'll try to visit you.
I might not be able to make it, though.

948
00:54:37,455 --> 00:54:39,624
<i>Okay. Good luck with the surgery.</i>

949
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,960
<i>I hope I can see you tomorrow morning.</i>

950
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,378
Okay.

951
00:54:44,934 --> 00:54:47,048
ELAPSED TIME

952
00:54:52,804 --> 00:54:54,347
I think the repair is holding well.

953
00:54:55,224 --> 00:54:56,183
Suction.

954
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:25,587
I'll take these.

955
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:48,670
COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL EXAMINATION CENTER

956
00:57:00,598 --> 00:57:03,435
Seriously? Why are you here?

957
00:57:04,686 --> 00:57:07,313
Why do you think?
I came because I'm worried.

958
00:57:15,572 --> 00:57:17,699
Look at that big yawn. Goodness.

959
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:20,118
You should just get some sleep at home.

960
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:22,912
-Why did you come?
-How could I sleep?

961
00:57:24,831 --> 00:57:26,374
Hello.

962
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:27,792
Hello.

963
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:29,461
Thank you for seeing us this early.

964
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:31,671
Gosh, don't mention it.
This happens a few times.

965
00:57:31,754 --> 00:57:34,632
-Please wait.
-Hold on. Have some of this.

966
00:57:34,716 --> 00:57:36,468
It's really cheap. It's nothing big.

967
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:37,635
No, it's all right.

968
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:39,596
I bought way too many. That's why.

969
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:41,347
Please take some. I'm begging you.

970
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,058
Thank you. Please give us ten minutes.

971
00:57:44,142 --> 00:57:45,143
Okay. We can wait.

972
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:02,785
Hey, what if I have cancer?

973
00:58:04,954 --> 00:58:05,830
You can get it fixed.

974
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:10,627
I'll fix it no matter what.

975
00:58:16,049 --> 00:58:18,510
-It's nice.
-What?

976
00:58:18,593 --> 00:58:20,553
Getting a confident answer
from the doctor.

977
00:58:22,722 --> 00:58:27,519
Now, I understand why doctors
shouldn't give out such answers.

978
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:32,440
It's so nice to hear that.

979
00:58:33,107 --> 00:58:35,568
It makes me think
you'll fix whatever is wrong with me.

980
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:41,324
That's why I should never say things
like that to my patients.

981
00:58:42,325 --> 00:58:43,993
What if something goes wrong?

982
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:47,914
If the result comes out badly,

983
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:54,504
I think they would be in utter despair.

984
00:59:05,723 --> 00:59:06,975
Yes, Seok-hyeong.

985
00:59:08,851 --> 00:59:10,311
I'm about to go in.

986
00:59:11,688 --> 00:59:14,274
Okay. I'll tell you right away.

987
00:59:15,692 --> 00:59:17,068
Okay.

988
00:59:20,029 --> 00:59:23,449
-Can Seok-hyeong make calls?
-Yes. Why?

989
00:59:23,992 --> 00:59:25,910
I thought he only texted.

990
00:59:26,286 --> 00:59:27,996
He calls me often.

991
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:35,628
A long time ago,

992
00:59:36,129 --> 00:59:38,089
Seok-hyeong liked you a lot.

993
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:39,382
Hey.

994
00:59:40,383 --> 00:59:41,968
That's ancient history.

995
00:59:42,844 --> 00:59:47,140
You know the day when
Seok-hyeong told you that he liked you?

996
00:59:48,057 --> 00:59:49,892
Did you know that he slept on the street?

997
00:59:51,144 --> 00:59:52,895
-Really?
-Yes.

998
00:59:54,147 --> 00:59:56,357
He and I had drinks that night.

999
00:59:56,566 --> 00:59:59,319
He told me that he confessed his feelings
and you turned him down.

1000
01:00:00,653 --> 01:00:02,322
We had drinks and went home.

1001
01:00:02,405 --> 01:00:04,574
But late at night,
I got a call from the police station.

1002
01:00:04,657 --> 01:00:06,075
They told me to take my friend home.

1003
01:00:06,326 --> 01:00:08,745
They called me
because I was the last person he called.

1004
01:00:08,828 --> 01:00:10,747
I was confused and went to the station.

1005
01:00:11,247 --> 01:00:15,001
My gosh. He was sleeping on the street,
and the officers brought him there

1006
01:00:15,084 --> 01:00:17,003
so he didn't freeze to death.

1007
01:00:19,047 --> 01:00:21,257
Seriously.
That brings back so many memories.

1008
01:00:21,341 --> 01:00:22,800
So many memories.

1009
01:00:26,554 --> 01:00:28,890
Wait, so you knew.

1010
01:00:30,475 --> 01:00:31,726
Why did you pretend you didn't?

1011
01:00:32,727 --> 01:00:34,646
I only knew that Seok-hyeong liked you.

1012
01:00:34,729 --> 01:00:35,938
I didn't know it in detail.

1013
01:00:37,148 --> 01:00:38,524
Ms. Chae Song-hwa, please come in.

1014
01:00:39,025 --> 01:00:39,859
Okay.

1015
01:00:58,795 --> 01:01:01,714
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1016
01:01:12,392 --> 01:01:13,893
We have ten more minutes, right?

1017
01:01:14,227 --> 01:01:15,269
Yes.

1018
01:01:16,771 --> 01:01:18,189
Should I go and get you some coffee?

1019
01:01:18,272 --> 01:01:21,234
No. I'm good. I was just checking.

1020
01:01:21,734 --> 01:01:24,153
Wait. Now that you ask me,

1021
01:01:24,237 --> 01:01:26,155
I kind of want coffee.

1022
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:28,866
What is it?

1023
01:01:29,575 --> 01:01:32,787
-I'm fine. It's benign.
-Okay. Great.

1024
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,670
What's the result?

1025
01:01:41,587 --> 01:01:44,549
It's a fibroadenoma.
We'll test it again in six months.

1026
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:46,801
I knew it.

1027
01:01:46,884 --> 01:01:49,220
-You did well. See you later, then.
-Okay.

1028
01:01:53,182 --> 01:01:56,102
It's benign. Are we good now?

1029
01:01:57,187 --> 01:01:58,104
Okay.

1030
01:02:01,482 --> 01:02:02,692
Did everyone come?

1031
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:04,444
There's one more.

1032
01:02:05,611 --> 01:02:07,196
Did you call the guys today?

1033
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,073
I saw them visit you one at a time.

1034
01:02:10,074 --> 01:02:11,743
You know we have
band practice today, right?

1035
01:02:11,826 --> 01:02:12,910
See you later.

1036
01:02:14,662 --> 01:02:17,206
My brother-in-law, have a great day.

1037
01:02:41,689 --> 01:02:43,274
You can't finish it, right? Pour me some.

1038
01:02:44,484 --> 01:02:46,527
What if we get addicted to Coke?

1039
01:02:46,611 --> 01:02:49,572
I can't drink because I'm worried
that the hospital will call me.

1040
01:02:50,072 --> 01:02:52,867
Jun-wan, do you want Coke or Sprite?

1041
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,036
He's busy.
His mom's about to build a hinoki tub.

1042
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,705
What? You want to switch to cypress?

1043
01:02:58,372 --> 01:03:02,251
Mom, hinoki is cypress.
They are the same thing.

1044
01:03:03,669 --> 01:03:05,630
<i>Heopa</i> also means lung. <i>Kongpat</i>, kidney.

1045
01:03:05,713 --> 01:03:07,715
<i>Jjijimi</i>, pancake. <i>Jeonguji</i>, chives.

1046
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:09,634
-<i>Jeonguji</i> means chives?
-Yes.

1047
01:03:10,384 --> 01:03:11,636
I'm with my friends.

1048
01:03:13,387 --> 01:03:15,598
Okay. I'll call you later.

1049
01:03:16,641 --> 01:03:17,475
Okay.

1050
01:03:18,392 --> 01:03:19,644
We're playing Zoo's song, right?

1051
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:21,145
Did you bring your guitar?

1052
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:25,691
You can switch back to standard Korean
right away. That's impressive.

1053
01:03:25,775 --> 01:03:27,527
What? I don't speak with a dialect.

1054
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:29,445
Buddy, eat it with <i>jeonguji</i>.

1055
01:03:29,529 --> 01:03:31,197
All right.

1056
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,532
Did you know

1057
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:35,034
you two had a huge transformation?

1058
01:03:37,328 --> 01:03:39,080
-Us two?
-Yes.

1059
01:03:39,163 --> 01:03:40,623
What on earth are you talking about?

1060
01:03:41,374 --> 01:03:43,334
These guys looked worse back then.
Especially, you.

1061
01:03:45,753 --> 01:03:47,171
What about me?

1062
01:03:47,255 --> 01:03:49,924
You wanted to copy Leslie Cheung.
You parted your hair and got a perm.

1063
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,635
Don't distort the truth, Ik-jun.

1064
01:03:53,177 --> 01:03:54,971
You two were worse.

1065
01:03:55,054 --> 01:03:56,138
How did we look back then?

1066
01:04:11,821 --> 01:04:13,406
Like this.

1067
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:14,824
You prick.

1068
01:04:14,907 --> 01:04:16,993
-You prick.
-That was Jun-wan.

1069
01:04:17,869 --> 01:04:19,203
You prick.

1070
01:04:19,328 --> 01:04:21,747
No, they weren't that bad.
They looked like this.

1071
01:04:22,248 --> 01:04:23,332
-You prick.
-No.

1072
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:25,334
-He looked like this.
-My gosh. Hey.

1073
01:04:25,418 --> 01:04:28,713
LINE 2, EXIT 3

1074
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:30,715
Is this the way?

1075
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:38,306
Where's the school? Why can't I see it?

1076
01:04:38,389 --> 01:04:40,975
We have to take a bus here. Bus 289-1.

1077
01:04:41,058 --> 01:04:42,894
It's the school entrance. Why take a bus?

1078
01:04:45,021 --> 01:04:46,522
If I knew the answer to that,

1079
01:04:46,606 --> 01:04:49,358
why would I be standing here with you,
holding this paper like a fool?

1080
01:04:49,442 --> 01:04:52,278
-It's freezing cold today.
-You said you'd been to Seoul. You forgot?

1081
01:04:52,361 --> 01:04:55,489
You've been here too, man. We went to
the National Assembly on our school trip.

1082
01:04:56,574 --> 01:04:58,075
-Did we?
-Yes.

1083
01:05:01,746 --> 01:05:03,623
Do you have any change? A 1,000-won bill?

1084
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:07,543
I only have 10,000-won bills.

1085
01:05:08,044 --> 01:05:09,670
Same here.

1086
01:05:09,754 --> 01:05:10,755
How much is the bus fare?

1087
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:13,132
-It's 340 won. Seriously?
-What?

1088
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,801
Things in Seoul are so expensive.
It's no place to live!

1089
01:05:16,636 --> 01:05:18,179
But I'm still going to live in Seoul.

1090
01:05:18,262 --> 01:05:20,848
-Wait here. I'll go and break the bill.
-At where?

1091
01:05:20,932 --> 01:05:23,809
I'll buy something at the cart over there
and get smaller bills.

1092
01:05:27,396 --> 01:05:28,272
Sir.

1093
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:30,733
How much is it?

1094
01:05:30,816 --> 01:05:33,903
Where are you from? Busan? Masan?

1095
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:36,405
That's 700 won.

1096
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:45,665
-What about this?
-3,000 won.

1097
01:05:45,748 --> 01:05:46,666
Here.

1098
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:48,793
Here.

1099
01:05:49,669 --> 01:05:50,795
Good luck with the interview.

1100
01:05:50,878 --> 01:05:52,838
Thank you. Have a good day.

1101
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:55,049
MEDICAL SCHOOL INTERVIEW
WAITING AREA

1102
01:05:55,591 --> 01:05:57,760
EXAM SCHEDULE

1103
01:06:07,812 --> 01:06:11,148
Ik-jun, I don't think I did well
on my essay exam.

1104
01:06:11,399 --> 01:06:14,360
You should cut
your side-swept bangs first.

1105
01:06:14,443 --> 01:06:17,071
-What do you mean?
-I had to take a dump in the bathroom.

1106
01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:19,115
But it was packed with people,

1107
01:06:19,198 --> 01:06:21,242
so I used the staff bathroom downstairs.

1108
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:23,119
Guess what I heard there.

1109
01:06:23,285 --> 01:06:27,123
Do you know what the most important factor
they are considering this year is?

1110
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:28,582
What is it?

1111
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:30,584
<i>Jeonggal.</i>

1112
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:33,813
<i>Jeongal.</i> Scorpion?

1113
01:06:34,755 --> 01:06:36,257
No, I said, <i>Jeonggal.</i> Not scorpion.

1114
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:39,844
<i>Jeonggam?</i> You mean, "warmhearted"?
Gosh, that's my weak point.

1115
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:43,097
Go and clean your ears first, you prick.

1116
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,390
I saw a shovel over there.

1117
01:06:44,473 --> 01:06:46,392
-What the heck?
-Neatness.

1118
01:06:46,934 --> 01:06:49,186
They're going to pick neat students.

1119
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,354
Go cut your hair now.

1120
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:51,522
Really? Darn it.

1121
01:07:04,243 --> 01:07:06,203
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

1122
01:07:57,588 --> 01:08:01,717
<i>I saw you again in front</i>

1123
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:05,387
<i>Of the subway station at the city hall</i>

1124
01:08:05,805 --> 01:08:10,017
<i>When I turned around to buy newspapers</i>

1125
01:08:10,101 --> 01:08:13,270
<i>I saw your figure</i>

1126
01:08:13,854 --> 01:08:18,901
<i>At the crowded newsstand</i>

1127
01:08:18,984 --> 01:08:22,696
<i>When I called out your name</i>

1128
01:08:23,739 --> 01:08:27,118
<i>You looked surprised</i>

1129
01:08:38,504 --> 01:08:42,842
<i>When I was about to go to you</i>

1130
01:08:42,925 --> 01:08:47,138
<i>I stepped on someone's foot</i>

1131
01:08:47,221 --> 01:08:51,809
<i>I had to say I was sorry</i>

1132
01:08:51,892 --> 01:08:54,520
<i>With a big smile</i>

1133
01:08:55,020 --> 01:09:00,359
<i>We talked about our lives
And how we changed</i>

1134
01:09:00,442 --> 01:09:04,655
<i>We even talked about the weather
Which was boring</i>

1135
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:07,867
<i>The flooding memories</i>

1136
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:11,704
<i>Quickly exhausted us</i>

1137
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:15,958
<i>That time which seemed so slow</i>

1138
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:19,879
<i>Passed us by</i>

1139
01:09:20,379 --> 01:09:24,425
<i>You told me that you were a mother of two</i>

1140
01:09:24,508 --> 01:09:27,678
<i>With a gentle smile on your face</i>

1141
01:09:28,387 --> 01:09:33,642
<i>When you asked me how I am doing</i>

1142
01:09:33,726 --> 01:09:37,730
<i>I just shrugged my shoulders
In disappointment</i>

1143
01:09:37,813 --> 01:09:40,983
<i>And told you that I was still looking for</i>

1144
01:09:41,066 --> 01:09:44,820
<i>The love of my life somewhere
In this world</i>

1145
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:52,995
<i>-If we run into each other again someday
-If we run into each other again someday</i>

1146
01:09:54,455 --> 01:10:00,502
<i>-You said you'd show me your children
-You said you'd show me your children</i>

1147
01:10:03,005 --> 01:10:09,094
<i>-But the song engraved in our hearts
-But the song engraved in our hearts</i>

1148
01:10:09,553 --> 01:10:12,598
<i>-From that day
-From that day</i>

1149
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:17,228
<i>-Is still fresh like it was yesterday
-Is still fresh like it was yesterday</i>

1150
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,416
<i>You told me that
Things were getting tough between us</i>

1151
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:24,336
<i>That could have been
The reason you left me</i>

1152
01:11:25,337 --> 01:11:28,590
<i>But I can't know for sure</i>

1153
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:31,092
-Sing it, everyone.
<i>-Lonely night</i>

1154
01:11:31,176 --> 01:11:33,720
<i>-Lonely night</i>
<i>-Lonely night</i>

1155
01:11:33,804 --> 01:11:38,100
<i>I remember the night when you left me</i>

1156
01:11:38,183 --> 01:11:40,769
<i>-Lonely night</i>
<i>-Lonely night</i>

1157
01:11:40,852 --> 01:11:43,230
<i>Lonely night.</i>

1158
01:11:43,314 --> 01:11:47,109
<i>You in my memory</i>

1159
01:11:49,737 --> 01:11:50,904
All right.

1160
01:11:50,988 --> 01:11:54,158
Hey, I'm sorry. No, I mean... Never mind.

1161
01:11:54,241 --> 01:11:55,367
I'm okay.

1162
01:11:56,201 --> 01:11:59,747
Song-hwa, I'm sorry for bringing up
such nonsense.

1163
01:12:30,694 --> 01:12:32,112
<i>Did you want to meet up?</i>

1164
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:34,698
<i>Okay. Where should we meet?</i>

1165
01:12:36,867 --> 01:12:39,244
<i>I'm sorry. Something just came up.</i>

1166
01:12:39,745 --> 01:12:40,829
<i>Let's meet some other time.</i>

1167
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:02,643
DRINKS AND MEALS,
CUSTOMERS FOR A CENTURY

1168
01:13:02,726 --> 01:13:04,561
No. Bye.

1169
01:14:13,505 --> 01:14:14,423
Hello?

1170
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:17,926
Where? Who is this?

1171
01:14:38,906 --> 01:14:44,286
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHAE SONG-HWA

1172
01:14:44,369 --> 01:14:47,289
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1173
01:14:52,794 --> 01:14:55,088
Thank you. Thank you for the coffee.

1174
01:14:56,215 --> 01:14:58,300
You're even diligent. My gosh.

1175
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:04,556
If you have questions, ask Song-hwa.
She really likes that.

1176
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,933
Okay.

1177
01:15:06,308 --> 01:15:08,810
Professor Chae is a good person.

1178
01:15:09,436 --> 01:15:10,687
She is.

1179
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:15,025
I respect her very much and like her.

1180
01:15:16,902 --> 01:15:18,612
Okay.

1181
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,991
Have you been talking to Ik-sun lately?

1182
01:15:23,075 --> 01:15:24,284
Yes.

1183
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:26,620
We talk on the phone at least once a week.

1184
01:15:26,703 --> 01:15:28,372
She's a really close friend of mine.

1185
01:15:29,122 --> 01:15:30,582
Just like you and Professor Chae.

1186
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:34,294
Right. There are times when I realize
she's a woman, not just a friend.

1187
01:15:34,378 --> 01:15:35,629
My gosh, no.

1188
01:15:35,712 --> 01:15:38,507
We're really not involved romantically.

1189
01:15:39,299 --> 01:15:43,595
Besides, Ik-sun is still hurt
by what happened in the past.

1190
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:48,225
She said she's not ready to date

1191
01:15:49,142 --> 01:15:50,519
someone yet.

1192
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,313
She said she can't trust anyone.

1193
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:57,234
I think it will take her some time.

1194
01:15:57,985 --> 01:15:59,278
Really?

1195
01:16:01,613 --> 01:16:02,781
Probably.

1196
01:16:23,552 --> 01:16:25,262
I'm paying this month's utility bill.

1197
01:16:25,345 --> 01:16:27,264
Jeong-won said he already paid.

1198
01:16:27,347 --> 01:16:30,058
My gosh, I guess
he's doing better financially.

1199
01:16:30,142 --> 01:16:31,643
That moocher paid the utility bill.

1200
01:16:33,228 --> 01:16:34,563
Did something happen?

1201
01:16:34,646 --> 01:16:36,565
You look down today.

1202
01:16:37,691 --> 01:16:39,192
It's nothing really. But...

1203
01:16:40,235 --> 01:16:42,070
My gosh, I had no idea,

1204
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:45,574
but Ik-sun...

A NEW MESSAGE FROM IK-SUN

1206
01:16:51,872 --> 01:16:53,081
Bye.

1207
01:17:05,469 --> 01:17:06,845
<i>Yes for what?</i>

1208
01:17:15,103 --> 01:17:16,855
<i>Today is our first day as a couple.</i>

1209
01:17:54,476 --> 01:17:55,852
<i>Hello?</i>

1210
01:17:58,021 --> 01:17:59,231
What are you doing?

1211
01:18:01,316 --> 01:18:03,360
Really? Okay.

1212
01:18:04,444 --> 01:18:06,530
I don't have any surgery today.

1213
01:18:06,613 --> 01:18:07,989
Did you eat?

1214
01:18:09,116 --> 01:18:10,117
Who?

1215
01:18:12,077 --> 01:18:14,579
I see. I didn't know
there was a position for that.

1216
01:18:15,288 --> 01:18:16,581
Are you guys close to each other?

1217
01:18:17,249 --> 01:18:18,500
I see.

1218
01:18:19,501 --> 01:18:22,754
Okay. When is your next day off?

1219
01:18:27,008 --> 01:18:29,386
No, don't do that.

1220
01:18:29,469 --> 01:18:31,263
I'll go pick you up.

1221
01:18:31,346 --> 01:18:32,347
Okay.

1222
01:18:34,683 --> 01:18:35,934
Are you sure?

1223
01:18:36,017 --> 01:18:37,894
<i>Yes, Ji-a will be the recipient.</i>

1224
01:18:38,478 --> 01:18:41,398
<i>The donor is a 22-year-old female.
She weighs 49kg.</i>

1225
01:18:41,481 --> 01:18:44,025
<i>And her LFT is under 40. It's all good.</i>

1226
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:46,278
<i>She stayed at Kangwoon Medical Center
for seven days.</i>

1227
01:18:46,361 --> 01:18:48,822
Then, we'll get the surgery ready.

1228
01:18:49,531 --> 01:18:50,615
Okay.

1229
01:18:52,951 --> 01:18:54,536
Oh my gosh!

1230
01:18:55,871 --> 01:18:57,205
Thank you, doctor.

1231
01:18:58,165 --> 01:18:59,708
Thank you so much, doctor.

1232
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:01,334
Thank you.

1233
01:19:01,543 --> 01:19:03,670
Thank you so much, doctor.

1234
01:19:05,589 --> 01:19:08,800
The committee that confirms brain death
must still go through the protocol.

1235
01:19:08,884 --> 01:19:12,512
And we must check the condition
of the liver from the donor.

1236
01:19:13,013 --> 01:19:15,265
But I think this will work.

1237
01:19:15,348 --> 01:19:18,435
We can proceed with the surgery tonight
at the earliest.

1238
01:19:23,607 --> 01:19:26,234
Then, my daughter, Ji-a,

1239
01:19:26,818 --> 01:19:29,613
can live now. Right, doctor?

1240
01:19:30,489 --> 01:19:31,698
Yes.

1241
01:19:32,365 --> 01:19:35,076
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1242
01:19:49,716 --> 01:19:52,052
How's the liver? Are you heading here now?

1243
01:19:52,135 --> 01:19:53,762
<i>We have a problem, Professor Ahn.</i>

1244
01:19:54,471 --> 01:19:55,806
What's wrong?

1245
01:19:55,889 --> 01:19:57,599
<i>The donor's liver is too thick.</i>

1246
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:00,310
<i>It looks like it weighs over 500g.</i>

1247
01:20:00,393 --> 01:20:02,270
<i>And her AP must be as thick as 8cm.</i>

1248
01:20:02,604 --> 01:20:03,980
<i>What should we do?</i>

1249
01:20:09,528 --> 01:20:11,947
<i>This liver seems too big for Ji-a.
It won't work.</i>

1250
01:20:31,129 --> 01:20:37,391

1251
01:20:53,321 --> 01:20:55,782
<i>This is the last and only way</i>

1252
01:20:55,866 --> 01:20:57,242
<i>to save the baby.</i>

1253
01:20:58,702 --> 01:21:00,161
<i>There's a lot of bleeding, doctor.</i>

1254
01:21:00,245 --> 01:21:01,371
Would you like to try it

1255
01:21:01,955 --> 01:21:03,290
for the next surgery?

1256
01:21:03,373 --> 01:21:04,457
<i>What?</i>

1257
01:21:04,541 --> 01:21:05,959
I'm going to perform the surgery.

1258
01:21:06,042 --> 01:21:07,586
I'm so nervous.

1259
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:09,421
<i>I think you should give up.</i>

1260
01:21:10,046 --> 01:21:11,673
It won't go badly, right?

1261
01:21:13,049 --> 01:21:15,302
<i>It's too embarrassing if others find out.</i>

1262
01:21:15,385 --> 01:21:17,095
<i>Why is my life so hard?</i>

1263
01:21:18,263 --> 01:21:20,223
<i>What? It's fall already?</i>

1264
01:21:20,307 --> 01:21:22,350
<i>Gosh, is fall here already?</i>

1265
01:21:22,434 --> 01:21:24,185
<i>Is something good going on?</i>

1266
01:21:24,269 --> 01:21:25,812
<i>You're always in a good mood lately.</i>

1267
01:21:25,896 --> 01:21:28,189
-A blind date?
-Really?

1268
01:21:28,273 --> 01:21:29,733
<i>Who is it?</i>

1269
01:21:29,816 --> 01:21:31,359
<i>Who is it that you're so crazy about?</i>

1270
01:21:31,443 --> 01:21:33,069
<i>Jun-wan, do I know her?</i>

1271
01:21:33,153 --> 01:21:36,323
I'm Kim Jun-wan's friend, Lee Ik-jun.

1272
01:21:36,406 --> 01:21:38,199
The golf course there is really great.

1273
01:21:38,283 --> 01:21:39,868
The ball rolls in by itself.

1274
01:21:39,951 --> 01:21:42,454
An anonymous letter about bribery came in.

1275
01:21:44,623 --> 01:21:45,582
Did you go to play golf?

1276
01:21:45,665 --> 01:21:47,834
<i>I heard the membership for the golf course</i>

1277
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:50,086
costs two hundred million won.

1278
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:51,671
<i>Hey, you didn't go, right?</i>

1279
01:21:51,755 --> 01:21:53,340
Why? Is something going on?

1280
01:21:53,423 --> 01:21:55,884
<i>What? You did?</i>
