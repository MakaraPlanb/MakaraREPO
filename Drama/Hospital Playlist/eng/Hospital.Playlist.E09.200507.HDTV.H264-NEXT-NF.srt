HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:07,528
Why won't you do the surgery?

3
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:09,488
Please get her the surgery now!

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:11,865
Let's give it more time, sir.

5
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:15,536
And you can't undergo surgery yourself
in that condition, sir.

6
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,956
I'm her father,
and I said I want to donate my liver.

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,833
Who are you to stop me?

8
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,293
It's my decision and I want to save her
with my liver!

9
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,255
We have the same blood types.

10
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:28,465
And she's my daughter. What's the problem?

11
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:30,175
Get her the surgery now.

12
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:32,177
I want the surgery right now!

13
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:35,472
Listen. If my daughter dies
because we wasted our time,

14
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:37,433
will you take responsibility for it?

15
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:39,143
Will you?

16
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:41,437
Sir, I've explained it to you before.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,604
Even if you're her family,

18
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:45,816
it's not that easy to proceed
with transplant surgery.

19
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:48,193
And you're not at a young age.

20
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:51,238
On top of that,
you're not that healthy, either.

21
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:54,241
Sir, would you like to have
some coffee with me?

22
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,369
-Okay.
-Calm down. This way.

23
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,543
Sir, I'll be honest.

24
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:09,089
You're quite old,

25
00:01:09,173 --> 00:01:12,176
so if I were to follow the rules,
you don't qualify to get a surgery.

26
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:15,220
But we ran the tests
for the worst-case scenario.

27
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:17,973
Luckily, everything seemed to be fine
except for one area.

28
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,058
You have a fatty liver.

29
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:23,353
Usually, in these cases,
the donor must lose weight

30
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:25,105
to get rid of fat in the liver.

31
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:28,734
But given your age, this won't be easy.

32
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:33,071
Sir, why don't we wait
for a brain-dead patient a bit longer?

33
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:37,826
There's something called a MELD score.

34
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,870
This number determines
who gets the liver first.

35
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:42,080
And her number is considered pretty high.

36
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:43,791
Given her score now,

37
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:46,627
I think we can afford to wait a few more
days to make our decision.

38
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:51,090
Does my daughter have a high score?

39
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:53,717
Yes.

40
00:01:54,218 --> 00:01:56,929
It's at 36. It's pretty high.

41
00:01:57,137 --> 00:02:01,141
But to be honest,
her score has to be 39 or 40

42
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:03,477
to receive a liver
from a brain-dead patient,

43
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:05,187
so it won't guarantee her a liver.

44
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:12,069
Let's wait a few more days.

45
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:14,822
If your daughter's condition
becomes critical,

46
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:17,866
I'll make a decision, then.
So let's be a bit more patient, sir.

47
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,701
Yes, please.

48
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:25,666
It's time for her meal now.

49
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:28,418
She must be waiting for you.
Please go and enjoy lunch with her.

50
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:32,798
Okay. Thank you.

51
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,028
Hey. She's wearing hair rollers.

52
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:56,697
That's nothing new.

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,407
Do you see the freckles there?

54
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:00,951
I didn't know
So-mi had that many freckles.

55
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:03,036
Bring her here.
A laser treatment will remove them.

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,205
She's wearing makeup. The freckle makeup.

57
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,000
-Why?
-I don't know.

58
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,877
Why not? She's your daughter.

59
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:13,964
-Do you always understand U-ju?
-Right. No.

60
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:19,344
I think U-ju is going
through the sock phase these days.

61
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:21,889
It takes him about 30 minutes
to pick a pair of socks.

62
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:25,225
Right. I subscribed to So-mi's channel.

63
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:28,061
She's the number one teenage YouTuber
when it comes to cosmetic videos.

64
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,981
Seriously. Even I wanted
to try a few of her videos.

65
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:32,983
Forty, okay?

66
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:36,653
What? What's wrong with my age?
Men still want to doll up at 40.

67
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,531
I mean, my daughter weighs 40kg.

68
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:40,532
I see.

69
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,659
I think she weighs less than that.

70
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:45,287
My gosh.
She still hasn't had her first period.

71
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,831
She still hasn't?
But she's in eighth grade.

72
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:49,082
That is a bit late.

73
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,793
I wanted to take her to a clinic,
but she won't listen.

74
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:56,006
What about your lunch?
You're not going to have lunch?

75
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:59,384
I'm meeting up with the others
in the cafeteria. Join us.

76
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:02,137
I have somewhere to be.

77
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,056
I have a shift from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m.

78
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:05,933
What shift?

79
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:08,560
Well...

80
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:13,815
You have outpatients now, right?

81
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:16,777
If I stayed ten minutes longer,
I probably had to marry Seok-hyeong.

82
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,445
-Bye.
-Bye.

83
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:21,782
Ma'am!

84
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:25,911
Did you hear
that Seok-hyeong is going to adopt me?

85
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:29,831
Seok-hyeong promised to give me his house,
TV, and the recliner chair.

YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

88
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:49,434
It's 100 over 70.

89
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,144
It's good.

90
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,938
Really? Thank you.

91
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,356
Did you have dinner?

92
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,817
-I'll need to go home after my shift.
-I see.

93
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,193
What about you?

94
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,153
Later, I'm going to have...

95
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:02,155
Mom, I'm back!

96
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,657
You're back.

97
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:08,370
Hello.

98
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:10,414
Hello.

99
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,085
Did you bring the humidifier?

100
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,047
Jun-wan brought it this morning.

101
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:21,300
And he stopped by to fill it up
this afternoon, too.

102
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,803
He didn't look like the considerate type,
but he is.

103
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:27,222
You can tell he's considerate
just by his looks.

104
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:31,059
Mom, he's a bit perverted like Jeong-won.

105
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:35,439
Ma'am, aren't you sick
of eating hospital food?

106
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:38,567
How about beef bone soup?
I'll sneak it in here from the cafeteria.

107
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,736
I'm all right.

108
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:42,446
You guys should go out and have some food.

109
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,072
Call the others, too.

110
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,949
I'm not leaving.

111
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:48,827
I'm going to stay next to you
for 24 hours starting today.

112
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,537
Don't you need to work?

113
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:52,998
I'm fine now.

114
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:55,959
But what caused arrhythmia
all of a sudden?

115
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:59,713
We couldn't even find out what caused it
from the electrophysiology study.

116
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:02,841
This is making me really anxious.

117
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:04,760
It's because I'm old.

118
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:07,387
When you get old,
your body starts failing one at a time.

119
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:10,265
Go out and get some food now.

120
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:12,309
Ma'am, I'll get you beef bone soup.

121
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:14,394
I think a warm bowl of soup
will help you recover.

122
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,664
Ma'am, I'll get you beef bone soup.

123
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,663
I think a warm bowl of soup
will help you recover.

124
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,301
I'll stay with her now.

125
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,011
I bet you stayed at the hospital all day.

126
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,263
Go outside and get some air.

127
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,183
You must've been startled, Seok-hyeong.

128
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,145
Yes. Are you coming from Yangpyeong?

129
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,314
Yes. I made Jong-su drive.

130
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,233
I made your mom's favorite,
pumpkin porridge and beef bone soup.

131
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,736
I didn't make a lot, so you should
get some food outside. Go.

132
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,279
Yes, Seok-hyeong.

133
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,740
Treat your friends to some meat.

134
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,533
That will help me feel better.

135
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,077
Jeong-won, leave with Seok-hyeong.

136
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,331
He's been staying inside the hospital
for three straight days.

137
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,168
But are they available?

138
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,502
Yes.

139
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,464
I just typed in "meat",
and they are all coming.

140
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,561
Would you like to order?

141
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:16,687
Who's buying today?

142
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,189
-Your dad.
-Nice.

143
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,523
Two of the most expensive sets.

144
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,026
Give us two special sets, please.

145
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,319
-Mushroom set, too.
-Okay.

146
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,112
And a set of homemade sausages, too.

147
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,365
That's too much.
One half dried pollack <i>naengmyeon</i>.

148
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,700
Hey, order noodles after eating the meat.

149
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:30,701
It's my preference.

150
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:34,163
My goodness. You guys would
never turn down a free meal.

151
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,040
Two of pork kimchi stew, please.

152
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:37,792
One for each table. Thank you.

153
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,043
-Okay.
-Right.

154
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,087
It's spicy,
so give us two pots of steamed eggs.

155
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,650
You guys can talk.

156
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:05,903
Can I eat this now?

157
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,530
-What?
-Song-hwa, that's beef!

158
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:08,823
-You can't.
-Is that tuna?

159
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,825
-That's pork.
-Why don't you eat it raw?

160
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,159
Is that pork tartare?

161
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:33,013
No one is going to steal your food.
That's all yours.

162
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,182
You'll eat all of them, so slow down.

163
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,143
I have three older brothers.

164
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,019
Yes, your brothers are all bony.

165
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,232
Seok-hyeong, I heard
your mother decided to divorce him.

166
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,443
-Yes.
-Really? That's great news.

167
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,820
She'll finally be able to live her life.

168
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,655
She decided to divorce him.

169
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,825
I cried and begged her on my knees
to divorce him.

170
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,661
I said we should be happy
even if we just had one day left to live.

171
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,663
-Good job.
-That must've been hard.

172
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,457
My goodness, well done.

173
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,917
She might say that now.

174
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:04,837
But what if she gets angry one day
and says she won't divorce him?

175
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,465
We already filed the divorce papers
through her lawyer yesterday.

176
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,843
Chairman Yang was probably
surprised and happy to see it,

177
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,219
so he filed the paperwork today.

178
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,723
The mandatory waiting period
is four weeks, so just one more month.

179
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,018
In one month, this will all be over.

180
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:23,689
But when my mom told me
that she would divorce him...

181
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,734
Now that she's finally divorcing him,

182
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,403
it felt so freaking nice.

183
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:33,574
It's different from when you got yours,
right?

184
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,285
Of course. When I got divorced,
I was really heartbroken.

185
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,996
-You weren't?
-I wasn't.

186
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,289
Not even in the slightest.

187
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:44,418
I only thought about
how I could have a happy life with U-ju.

188
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,712
Don't tell me
you're still not over Sin-ae.

189
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:49,673
Come on. Do you think I'm mad?
No, that's not it.

190
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,593
I'm over her. I got over her,

191
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:58,516
but deep down, a part of me
always feels sorry to her.

192
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,893
-You're not over her.
-No, I'm already over her.

193
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,770
And it's more like a connection, not love.

194
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,940
I feel sorry and heartbroken.
It's something like that.

195
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,525
-What is that?
-I don't know.

196
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,778
Goodness, you know nothing about love.

197
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,447
Just eat up, you kids.

198
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,700
It's a shame you won't get the company.
When your father passes away,

199
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,912
all of his assets will go
to that woman and her child.

200
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,789
Taegeon Apparel isn't a listed company.

201
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,791
And his father owns
most of the shares, right?

202
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,043
But I think he can claim
a part of his assets legally.

203
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,462
I don't need his money.
I won't accept it even if he offers.

204
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,631
Exactly. Money isn't the problem now.

205
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,424
-No way.
-No way.

206
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,593
You're so annoying.

207
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:38,556
Seok-hyeong, listen to me carefully. Okay?

208
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,142
Don't talk such nonsense like
you won't accept the money or whatnot.

209
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,645
Just take it no matter what.

210
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,063
Take it and give it to us.

211
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,773
Okay.

212
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,693
I'll get the money
and give it to you guys.

213
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:55,614
By the way, did you hear
about the chairman?

214
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:58,117
Yes, I heard from my mom.

215
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,660
What about him?

216
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:03,080
Mr. Ju has been experiencing
early symptoms of depression.

217
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,164
What?

218
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,375
Oh, no.

219
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,795
I can completely relate to him, Rosa.

220
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,256
I also wrote my will once.

221
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,967
What did you write on it?

222
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:19,388
Did you write, "I want you to die,
you bastard, Yang Tae-yang."

223
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,932
I ought to tell them to his face.

224
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,476
Why would I waste papers on that?

225
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,646
Is that why you splashed
a bucket of dirty water on them?

226
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,939
Yes.

227
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,233
It was embarrassing to face my son,

228
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,651
but it felt nice.

229
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,945
That was great.
You must blow off the steam.

230
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,198
Do whatever you want to do and
say whatever you want to say. Good job.

231
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:41,660
So what is the chairman going to do?

232
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,120
Will he go to therapy?

233
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,749
He doesn't want therapy.
He said he's fine.

234
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,417
He said it's the autumn blues.

235
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:49,668
He's so pig-headed.

236
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,546
You should stay with him
and take care of him.

237
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,299
He seemed to have the best time with you.

238
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,176
I told him to come upstairs now.

239
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,637
He said he'll come up after a phone call.

240
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,929
But he won't get that call.

241
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,389
What phone call?

242
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,934
He was going to have dinner with his
second son's family. It's been a while.

243
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,145
But all of a sudden,
his grandson got an upset stomach,

244
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,772
so it was canceled.

245
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,815
They were going to give him a call,

246
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,652
but they probably forgot to call
because things are hectic.

247
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,570
He can call first.

248
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:17,613
Right.

249
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,949
He could just call them first,

250
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,036
but I think he feels bad
that by calling them,

251
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,872
he might be bothering them
when they are already busy.

252
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,376
When you're old,
all sorts of thoughts cross your mind.

253
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,438
<i>Yes, Dad.</i>

254
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,315
Hey.

255
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,443
How's Yun-min? What happened?

256
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:59,029
<i>When we got to the hospital,
he was completely fine, you know.</i>

257
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,699
<i>-Goodness. Can you stop moving?</i>
-Gosh, what a relief.

258
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,159
<i>Yun-hyeon. Yun-min. My goodness.</i>

259
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:05,369
And he's okay now?

260
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,454
<i>Yes, he's okay now.</i>

261
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:10,207
<i>-He's having fun playing with his brother.
-Guys, stop that.</i>

262
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,167
<i>We got him his favorite pizza and Coke.</i>

263
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,128
<i>So he's singing and is in a good mood.</i>

264
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,588
But still, don't feed him a lot of food.

265
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,382
He should be careful today.

266
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,466
<i>Okay.</i>

267
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,302
<i>Oh, Dad.</i>

268
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,388
Yes. What is it?

269
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:28,934
<i>Yun-hyeon and Yun-min took a photo
in their taekwondo suits this afternoon.</i>

270
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,227
<i>They looked so cute.</i>

271
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:31,937
<i>I'll send it to you now.</i>

272
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,355
Okay. Thank you.

273
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,232
Enjoy your dinner.

274
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,651
<i>Okay. Have a goodnight, Dad.</i>

275
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,798
Hey, Rosa.

276
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,258
<i>What's taking you so long?</i>

277
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,718
<i>Did Tae-ung call?</i>

278
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,679
Yes, he called just now.

279
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:07,306
Yun-min is fine.

280
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,683
<i>That's good to hear.
You need to eat your dinner.</i>

281
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,143
<i>Come up now. You must be hungry.</i>

282
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,853
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

283
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,730
<i>You'll skip dinner?</i>

284
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,981
<i>No, come upstairs now.</i>

285
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,026
Hey, skipping a meal won't kill me.

286
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:19,943
I'll be fine.

287
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,072
Aren't you going home soon?
Come down. I'll drive you home.

288
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:25,365
<i>If we start skipping meals at our age,
we'll never eat.</i>

289
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,283
<i>It'll be awful.</i>

290
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,537
<i>I won't nag you. Come upstairs now. Okay?</i>

291
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,876
My goodness, you win.

292
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,797
The liver transplantation from a living
donor usually starts early in the morning.

293
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,966
As both surgeries must be
performed at the same time,

294
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,969
it takes long
and requires a lot of people.

295
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,514
Professors usually come
around eight in the morning.

296
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,641
They come down
when the anesthesiologist is ready.

297
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,019
And before the surgery, the scrub nurses
set up the operating room.

298
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,900
Today, we'll do
a living donor liver transplant.

299
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,318
The donor is a man in his 50s,

300
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,028
is the patient's younger brother.

301
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:06,532
The anatomy type of the donor's biliary
tract is C, so it'll be a difficult case.

302
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,827
But Professor Lee will be careful,
so there won't be a problem.

303
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:13,789
Professor Lee might seem
distracted and all over the place,

304
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,666
but he's a really good surgeon.

305
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,834
What did you say?

306
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,712
Was that criticism or a compliment?

307
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,339
What are you doing here?

308
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,507
I'm studying.

309
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,218
-Are you assisting me today?
-No.

310
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,720
Dr. Jong Se-hyeok will assist you today.

311
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,567
Here's the liver specimen
for frozen biopsy.

312
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:52,327
KIM CHANG-HWAN

313
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,843
It's taking a bit too long today.

314
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,141
<i>This is Kim Mi-ae from Pathology.</i>

315
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,686
<i>Here's the result of the frozen biopsy
of the patient, Kim Chang-hwan.</i>

316
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,147
<i>The macrovesicular fatty change
is six percent.</i>

317
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,192
<i>And there's no inflammation
around the hepatic portal vein.</i>

318
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,693
Okay. Thank you!

319
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,111
Let's start right away.

320
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,868
Please put on some music.

321
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,470
Neurosurgeons don't usually say

322
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,305
that everything will be okay

323
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,724
and that the patient
will definitely recover.

324
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,228
Since we deal with brains,

325
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,356
there's a less chance
of seeing a dramatic improvement

326
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,399
after the surgery
compared to other departments.

327
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,692
I see.

328
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,111
I'm taking out the tumor now.

329
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,498
-Are you cold?
-No, I'm fine.

330
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,334
I easily get cold.

331
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,545
You can't survive in CS, then.

332
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,716
<i>Are you okay, Yun-bok?</i>

333
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,427
<i>Aren't you cold? Hold on.</i>

334
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,847
I can't see it. Pull it to my side.

335
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,140
Yes, sir.

336
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,436
CURRENT TEMPERATURE: 18

337
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,817
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm okay.

338
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,323
Thank you.

339
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,577
When we stop the heart and use
a heart-lung machine during surgery,

340
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,872
the patient won't get much blood flow
as the heart is stopped.

341
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,958
So we must slow down
the patient's metabolic rate.

342
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:04,918
We lower the temperature

343
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:08,547
to help the organs' metabolic rates
go down, so the patient uses less energy.

344
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,342
That way, when the heart beats again,
the patient can make a good recovery.

345
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,052
Where is Hong-do?

346
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,762
He's attending a pediatrics surgery.

347
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,682
I see. Does he easily get hot?

348
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,142
Yes. Very easily.

349
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,810
My goodness.

350
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:22,894
Oh, no.

351
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,292
Gauze, please.

352
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,338
CURRENT TEMPERATURE: 30.3

353
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,598
Hey, are you all right?

354
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:00,974
-Are you okay?
-Doctor.

355
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,225
Are you okay?

356
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,061
The student collapsed, right?

357
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:08,023
-Yes.
-Is he okay?

358
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,776
Yes. It took a while this year.

359
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,944
Last year, a student fainted around June.

360
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,914
Hello, my baby.

361
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,333
It's Mommy.

362
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,421
Okay.

363
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,215
-I don't have a clear view.
-Okay.

364
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,136
When you're suturing the uterus,
make sure to keep it tight.

365
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,222
But you can't pull too hard.

366
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,681
Okay.

367
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:49,731
Professor Yang, the students
from the nursing school are here.

368
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,317
Ma'am, congratulations.

369
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:53,902
Thank you.

370
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,113
I already informed the mother.

371
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,824
If you came a bit early,
you could have seen the baby coming out.

372
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,910
You have another surgery this afternoon.
Hopefully, we can see it then.

373
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,328
You may approach closer.

374
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,164
Make sure not to contaminate
the operating table.

375
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:13,213
NURSING STUDENT, KIM YEONG-JU

376
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,841
Hello.

377
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,391
My gosh. Did your surgery just finish?

378
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,310
-That was a long one.
-Controlling the bleeding took some time.

379
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,311
But it went well.

380
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,439
-You're getting off work late.
-Yes.

381
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,775
Right. It's about the patient, Oh Yu-min.
The patient in Room 6011.

382
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,278
She's waiting for a donor
due to liver cirrhosis.

383
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,989
-Yes.
-Can you call her father?

384
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,366
We must let him know that
the patient is getting worse now.

385
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,370
It's been a while
since he stopped coming to the hospital.

386
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,706
He stopped coming after last week.

387
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,459
That's right.
I haven't seen him around lately.

388
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,045
Does she have other family members?

389
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,423
No. She doesn't have any family.

390
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,926
I heard she hadn't seen her father
for a while before her condition, either.

391
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,095
My gosh, what should we do?

392
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,849
He might have gone somewhere, you know.

393
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,310
-He'll be back.
-I doubt it.

394
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,687
Okay.

395
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,899
I've been doing this over a decade now,

396
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,817
so I can tell just by their eyes.

397
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,903
I can tell if they will go through with it

398
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,113
or if getting the donation
will be difficult.

399
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,283
And her father is the latter case.

400
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,703
I can tell you
that he will never come back.

401
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,247
The decision is his,

402
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,416
so I can't criticize him for it.

403
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,335
Besides, getting a piece of his liver

404
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,129
seemed challenging from the get-go.

405
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,422
Anyway, I got it.

406
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,258
Professor Lee.

407
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,594
It's raining outside.

408
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,056
It's been raining since the morning.
You didn't know, right?

409
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,433
Have a goodnight.

410
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,101
Bye.

411
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,322
It's raining. Let's eat.

412
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,368
-Are you done with the surgery?
-That's why I'm here.

413
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,619
What should we get?

414
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:10,121
How about <i>jeon</i>? Or <i>sujebi</i>?

415
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,916
Of course, it's got to be <i>sujebi</i>.
See you in the lobby.

416
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,751
I didn't drive today. Let's take your car.

417
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,294
Sure.

418
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,763
WET FIELD SUJEBI

419
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,142
It's raining. Shall we go for a drive?

420
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,019
Sounds great.

421
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,063
What about U-ju?

422
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,858
He's in Changwon.
He's hooked on pork rice soup these days.

423
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,236
What about your dad's hearing aid?
Did you really refund it?

424
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,113
No way. You think I'm nuts?

425
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:46,283
I talked to Professor Song
to get the best one for my dad.

426
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,993
Why did you tell him how much it cost?

427
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,286
I didn't tell him.

428
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,329
My dad somehow found out.

429
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:55,041
My gosh. Anyway, I told him
that I got the employee discount,

430
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,627
used a coupon, and a credit card discount.

431
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,296
I came up with all sorts of white lies.

432
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,715
I had to tell about millions of lies

433
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,508
and said I paid less than one million won.

434
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,636
I barely managed to persuade him
to wear it.

435
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,096
Gosh, don't get so mad about it.

436
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,765
He doesn't want you to spend money.

437
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,600
Ma'am, more kimchi, please.

438
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:15,895
Yes, what is it?

439
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,814
<i>The patient has a cerebellar hemorrhage</i>

440
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,567
<i>and is in a semicoma.
And both pupils are fixed at 0.2.</i>

441
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,027
<i>And the patient barely has
any motor skills.</i>

442
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,570
I'm nearby. I'll be right there.

443
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,280
Let's go.

444
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,057
I took the enhanced brain TC.

445
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,267
The bleeding is causing compression
in the brain stem.

446
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,518
How old is the patient?

447
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,853
Thirteen years old.

448
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,105
It's a 13-year-old girl.

449
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,778
GUARDIAN

450
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,128
What is that?

451
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:23,922
Is that a cerebral hemorrhage?

452
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,216
The patient is still young.

453
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:28,635
-Dr. Ahn.
-Yes.

454
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,887
Do you see the AVM in her cerebellum?

455
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,305
AVM: ARTERIO-VENOUS MALFORMATION

456
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:33,681
Yes, I do.

457
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:36,226
The AVM is ruptured,
so it caused ICH in the cerebellum.

458
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,561
She became unconscious and collapsed.
Let's do the surgery.

459
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,563
-Okay.
-Hurry. Get the guardian's consent now,

460
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,982
talk to Anesthesiology
and send her up right away.

461
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,276
-I'll talk to her parents.
-Okay, I got it.

462
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,994
You startled me.

463
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,580
Didn't you go home?
Are you on calls? Do you have an umbrella?

464
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,791
I didn't go home.
No, I'm not on calls and no umbrellas.

465
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,167
Give me 10,000 won.

466
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:02,919
I don't have any cash.

467
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,380
I had a baseball bet with Gwang-hyeon.
Darn it. NC lost.

468
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:07,424
It could've been
their tenth winning game in a row.

469
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,844
-Pay it back.
-Okay.

470
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,763
Give me some cigarettes, too.

471
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,938
You borrowed 10,000 won and 4 cigarettes.

472
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:22,897
And a lighter.

473
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,155
You borrowed 10,000 won,
4 cigarettes, and 1 lighter.

474
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,198
Hey, it's Gyeo-ul.

475
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,081
What are you doing?

476
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:41,958
What do you think? I lied.

477
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,209
Crazy jerk.

478
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:44,627
Bye.

479
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,257
You borrowed 10,000 won,
4 cigarettes, and 1 lighter.

480
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,341
Hold on.

481
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:57,515
<i>You borrowed 10,000 won,
4 cigarettes, and 1 lighter</i>

482
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,643
<i>Jessica, only child, Illinois, Chicago</i>

483
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,354
<i>Ahn Jeong-won from school
Is such a cheapskate</i>

484
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,486
I'm really leaving now.
It's time for the baseball highlight.

485
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,237
That crazy jerk.

486
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,763
Hello, Professor Ahn.

487
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,226
See you later at home. Bye.

488
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,372
That's a different car, right?

489
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,041
Yes. It was a gray sedan yesterday.

490
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,544
Who on earth is Gyeo-ul dating?

491
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,212
I don't like his vibe.

492
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,466
Doesn't Jeong-won have a car?

493
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,386
He does. But it's very sick.

494
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,720
It's always at the hospital.

495
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,014
Hey, Gyeo-ul. Why are you back?

496
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,391
Hello.

497
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,017
-Hi.
-Did you forget something?

498
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,519
I need to take care of some charts.

499
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,354
I was too busy to do them this afternoon.

500
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:29,065
Since I'm here, I'll look at the baby
in the PICU that had surgery.

501
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,484
Do you want some coffee?
Should I get you one?

502
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,404
Yes. But is the cafe still open?

503
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,407
There is a convenience store.
I'll get you one.

504
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,575
Go to the PICU.

505
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:39,826
-I'll meet you there.
-Okay.

506
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,123
Here.

507
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,959
Thank you.

508
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,753
Right. Here's one more. Ta-da.

509
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:52,839
I could have gotten them myself.

510
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:56,134
I get more discounts.
30 percents. Quite a lot, right?

511
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:02,765
Gyeo-ul.

512
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,767
Can I ask you a question?

513
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,187
-It's a personal question. Is it okay?
-Okay.

514
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,902
What does your boyfriend do?

515
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:19,866
What does he do for a living?
How can he drive different cars every day?

516
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,410
Is he a car dealer?
Does he sell imported cars?

517
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:26,956
You only got half right.
The other half is wrong.

518
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,969
THE PATIENT'S SURGERY HAS ENDED
PLEASE COME TO THE OR

519
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,096
Honey.

520
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,645
What are you doing still up?

521
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,773
My gosh, it's past midnight.

522
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,358
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

523
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:56,694
<i>Did your surgery just finish?
Was it a difficult one?</i>

524
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:59,072
No, the previous surgery
didn't finish on time,

525
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,490
so I started late.

526
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,241
<i>You probably didn't eat dinner, then.</i>

527
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,161
I'm going to have <i>ramyeon</i> in the office.

528
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,330
You should go to sleep now.
I'll see you this weekend.

529
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,456
<i>Okay.</i>

530
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,583
<i>Bye, Jun-wan.</i>

531
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,168
Okay. Sleep tight.

532
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:21,803
You're still here?

533
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,262
Hello.

534
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,139
Hi.

535
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,933
-Are you studying?
-No.

536
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:29,727
I just organized my notes I took
this afternoon.

537
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,438
It's getting late. You should go home now.

538
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:34,148
Okay. I'm done now.

539
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,320
Take a taxi. Return my card tomorrow.

540
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,614
No. It's all right.

541
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:42,865
No, take it.

542
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,326
My boyfriend is picking me up.

543
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,870
He's waiting for me downstairs.

544
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,956
Thank you, though.

545
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,171
The surgery went well.

546
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:59,799
We did everything we could.

547
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:03,094
We stopped the brain hemorrhage and
removed the arteriovenous malformation,

548
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,512
but the swelling was severe.

549
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,557
The bleeding was located deep in the brain
and in an unfavorable spot.

550
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,809
So we need to observe her more.

551
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,644
We'll give her medicine to lower

552
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,896
the brain pressure
and keep her in the ICU.

553
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,440
Will she regain consciousness?

554
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,567
We won't know that now.

555
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,987
She was in a life-threatening situation,

556
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,197
so it's too early to judge
if she'll wake up or not.

557
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,242
We need more time.

558
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,453
Bye.

559
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,330
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

560
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:50,433
<i>It's raining a lot outside. I'll leave
an umbrella in front of your office.</i>

561
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,935
<i>Thank you for today.</i>

562
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:16,042
Hey, what is it?

563
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,919
Why are you calling me at this hour?
What's up?

564
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,880
<i>Must you ask? I'm waiting for you.</i>

565
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,507
You're still here?

566
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,509
<i>Where would I go?
You didn't bring your car today.</i>

567
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,552
<i>It's raining. How will you get home?</i>

568
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:27,845
<i>You're done, right?</i>

569
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,639
<i>Come to the ER. I'll pull out the car.</i>

570
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,351
Okay. I'll be there soon.

571
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,868
That looks like Yun-bok.

572
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,873
Why can't you show me?

573
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,001
Why do you need to check my phone?

574
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:04,423
"Are you sleeping?"

575
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:08,261
Doesn't he know what time it is?
Why did he text you at this hour?

576
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,263
-"Are you sleeping?"
-Hey.

577
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:12,932
Did you go through my phone?

578
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,725
Why did you go through my phone?

579
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:16,811
It popped up right there.
How can I not look?

580
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,230
-Give me your phone.
-No.

581
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,607
Why not?
You must be hiding something from me.

582
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,818
No, I'm not.

583
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:28,197
Then, what about you? Why aren't you
using the cell phone case I got you?

584
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:29,282
It's a matching case.

585
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,950
It won't fit in here.

586
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,243
I take it off when I drive.

587
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:33,286
I need to use GPS.

588
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,704
Where's the case?

589
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,425
That bastard.

590
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,510
Give me your phone.

591
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,345
What's wrong with you?

592
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:53,222
I told you it's not what you think. No.

593
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,307
Then, let me see.

594
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,267
-Let me check.
-I don't want to do.

595
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,477
I'll check it and give it back right away.

596
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,813
I told you no. Why do you keep nagging me?

597
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,482
Is showing me your phone that hard?

598
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:06,819
Listen. I don't want to show you my phone.

599
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,488
Look. That's the haircut.

600
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,742
That was U-ju when he was two.

601
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,744
He looks just like Ik-jun
when he was young.

602
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,579
He takes after his grandfather.

603
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,956
CAPTAIN HONG JEONG-HO

604
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,169
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS WEEKEND?

605
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,506
He's Captain Hong in my battalion.

606
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,345
This is his habit.
He's like this to everyone.

607
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:35,223
He's friendly to everyone around him.

608
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,141
Do you want to see his texts?

609
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:38,935
-Look.
-It's fine.

610
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,645
If you say so, then he must be.

611
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:41,896
I don't have to see it.

612
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,399
-Are you sure?
-Yes, why would I check your phone?

613
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,614
So you want to go for a doctorate?

614
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,199
Where's the doctorate program at?

615
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:56,619
It's either the States or the UK. I don't
know where they'll have an opening.

616
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:59,121
I'm studying hard,

617
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,041
but only one or two people
will get picked.

618
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,711
-Do you want to be a professor?
-I might not be as smart as my brother,

619
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:08,589
but I'm pretty smart, too.
I joined the military academy

620
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:09,507
as I'm athletic, too.

621
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,050
How long will you stay if you go?

622
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,469
If I get picked,

623
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,806
the program will last
at least three to five years.

624
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,395
I guess you have no interest
in getting married.

625
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,443
I told you when we first started dating.

626
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,779
That I'm not interested
in marriage at all.

627
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,868
But you know that this kind
of conversation is pointless, right?

628
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,621
It's really hard to get into this program.

629
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,499
Captains probably have
a higher chance of getting picked.

630
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,042
I can't go.

631
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,253
Why can't you?

632
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:48,921
If you don't go, who will?

633
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:50,631
You can get in.

634
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:52,758
I think you'll get picked.

635
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,261
Really?

636
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,433
Yes, that's right.
I also think I'll get picked.

637
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:03,102
I'll probably get to go.

638
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,190
If you do go,

639
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:11,819
does it mean we're breaking up?

640
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:15,865
If you go abroad for your studies,

641
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,368
what will happen to us?

642
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,208
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

643
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:30,046
Let's eat. They are serving
braised pollack in the cafeteria.

644
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:32,089
-Let's go.
-Easy, easy.

645
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,842
Easy, easy.

646
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,927
The choledochal cyst takes place

647
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:40,056
when there's a cystic dilatation of the
biliary duct, so its function decreases.

648
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,891
As a result, this condition

649
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:45,186
may lead to cholelithiasis
and cholangiocarcinoma.

650
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,813
We will make an incision the cyst

651
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,982
in the common bile duct in surgery.

652
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:52,651
We will perform
Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy

653
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,820
to reconstruct the biliary tract.

654
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,614
I see.

655
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:57,740
Hello, ma'am.

656
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,742
Hi, Professor.

657
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,453
Jae-won isn't getting a difficult surgery.

658
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:05,247
Our liver produces something called bile.

659
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:09,335
This is a type of digestive fluid
that helps break down the grease.

660
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:12,838
When our liver produces bile,
it moves down to our stomach.

661
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,841
And the passageway to our stomach
is called the common bile duct.

662
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,093
I see.

663
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:20,930
Most of the kids have
a common bile duct less than 5mm.

664
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:24,850
But Jae-won's bile duct
is stretched to 3cm.

665
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,436
If it's stretched,

666
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,730
the bile can't flow out
and gets stuck in there.

667
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:33,526
And this may lead to gallstones
and other complications.

668
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:36,946
So we'll cut the stretched part
of the common bile duct.

669
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,407
That's the surgery
Jae-won is getting today.

670
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,991
I see. Okay.

671
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,035
Of course, after removing it,

672
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,329
he still needs
a passageway for the bile to go through.

673
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:48,749
So we need to connect a part of his small
intestine with the biliary duct.

674
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,835
And once we connect them together,

675
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,003
the surgery will be over.

676
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,423
It's not that complicated or difficult.

677
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:57,299
You don't have to worry that much.

678
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:00,136
I see. Thank you.

679
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:01,971
I totally understood that.

680
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,557
Please take good care of my son. Please.

681
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,766
Okay.

682
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:11,147
Hey.

683
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,274
All right. I'll see you guys there.

684
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,526
Okay.

685
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,285
Don't laugh like that.
You look like Gargamel.

686
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:25,995
What's so funny?

687
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:29,290
Guys. You know
Professor Cheon Myeong-tae in CS, right?

688
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,791
-No, I don't.
-He's the guy who owns

689
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,293
a lot of real estate properties.

690
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,586
That much I know.

691
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,337
Jun-wan reported him regarding the rebate.

692
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,422
Yes, it's him.

693
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:40,342
Goodness, speak of the devil.

694
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,357
You're even friends with Jae-hak?

695
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:58,777
Yes, I'm also super close
to Dragon in her department.

696
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,696
-Who's Dragon?
-Yong Seok-min.

697
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:03,157
You're not close to anyone
in OB-GYN, right?

698
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,408
Of course not. He may have had

699
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:07,077
a couple of meals with them,
but I'm sure he's not close to anyone.

700
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,079
Chu Min-ha and I are besties.

701
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,917
We're going to have <i>tteokbokki</i> together
next week. With Gyeo-ul too.

702
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:15,044
Hey, Jang Gyeo-ul is busy.

703
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,671
I'm busy too, and so are they.
All of us are busy.

704
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,632
But they asked me to buy them <i>tteokbokki</i>.

705
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:21,300
They all like me so much.

706
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,760
No, you're just too nosy.

707
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,137
Jun-wan, did you hear the news?

708
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:28,307
Professor Cheon and the CEO of
Jinyong Credit Union are getting married.

709
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:29,892
Who is he marrying?

710
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:32,186
Jin Min-ju,
the CEO of Jinyong Credit Union.

711
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,438
The self-made entrepreneur. She's loaded.

712
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:36,607
She's one of the foundation's
board members.

713
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,484
Yes, she's close to the chairman.

714
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,821
She's very capable, and I think
she's an all-around wonderful person.

715
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:46,367
And that's why the chairman is
very concerned at the moment.

716
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:50,162
-Why is he concerned?
-I'm sure he's very worried.

717
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,915
She's a competent businesswoman
and has a great personality,

718
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,208
but she has low standards for men.

719
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,002
Professor Cheon is obviously
after her money,

720
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:59,672
so I bet the chairman is torn
whether or not he should intervene.

721
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,967
-Is he really not a good person?
-That's right. He's a total jerk.

722
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,343
He's really horrible.

723
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,844
I'd describe him as a villain.

724
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:08,389
What is a villain?

725
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:11,767
It's a compliment.

726
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,311
Runs to get and pay bills.

727
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,855
It means a hardworking person
who always does his best.

728
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,607
Really?

729
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,277
Oh, I have to go do my rounds.
See you later, guys.

730
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,403
See you.

731
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:26,198
Otolaryngology and Ophthalmology
will check in as well,

732
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,534
and we'll thoroughly prepare
for your surgery.

733
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,911
-I'll get going.
-Thank you.

734
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,040
Doctor, when can I be discharged?

735
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,209
You look like a different person now.

736
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,421
-The urine output has been okay, right?
-Yes.

737
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,715
What about her prolactin levels?

738
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,174
It's going down.

739
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,552
You can be discharged tomorrow.

740
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,805
Just remember that
you shouldn't blow your nose too hard.

741
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,473
Mild exercise is okay,

742
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:54,101
but please stay away
from water exercises for the time being.

743
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:56,645
Dr. Yong will go over everything again
in detail.

744
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,242
Yes?

745
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:13,412
Okay, I'll be right there.

746
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:17,333
You won't need restitching. It looks fine.

747
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,961
Thank you. You should get going.
I know you're busy.

748
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:22,087
Yes, that was from the ER.

749
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:24,673
If you experience any discomfort again,
let us know.

750
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:31,805
Mom, I'm craving <i>tteokbokki</i>.

751
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:34,350
I'll buy you a ton of it
when you get discharged.

752
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,435
I'll buy you everything you want to eat.

753
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:40,064
My baby...

754
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:42,358
Thanks for staying so strong.

755
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:46,987
She seems to be doing much better
than yesterday. Her speech is clearer too.

756
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,280
Yes, I know.

757
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:51,200
It's a miracle
that she's already recovered this much.

758
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,828
Her cranial nerves are regenerating
very quickly because she's young.

759
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,081
The pressure around the medulla is gone,

760
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:58,666
and we took care of the bleeding too.

761
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:00,793
Just keep up
with the rehabilitation therapy,

762
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,671
and she'll recover to the point
that it won't affect her day-to-day life.

763
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:06,256
Please don't worry too much.

764
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:10,094
We should be able to move her
to the regular ward in about two days.

765
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:13,138
Thank you, Doctor. We owe it all to you.

766
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:14,223
No problem.

767
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:17,643
You haven't been able to go home
for the past few days, right?

768
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:20,187
I saw you sleeping on the chairs at night.

769
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:22,981
She's passed the critical stage,

770
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,067
so you should go home
and sleep comfortably tonight.

771
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:29,071
We were planning
to go home tonight anyway.

772
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:34,326
Our grand opening is tomorrow.

773
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:37,454
I'm starting a business
in the midst of all this.

774
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,292
My mom teaches yoga. She's very famous.

775
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:43,752
Oh, really?

776
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:46,588
So, you're opening a yoga center?

777
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,217
Yes. After working as an instructor
on salary for years,

778
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,803
I took out a loan
and opened a yoga center.

779
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,097
But a few of members from
the previous center signed up

780
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,725
and helped me spread the word,
so I already have many members.

781
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:02,604
They already paid their membership fees,
and some of them are coming from far away,

782
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,606
so I couldn't postpone the opening.

783
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,359
Knowing that my daughter is in the PICU...

784
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,320
I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing.

785
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,990
Gosh, don't say that.
You need to earn money, of course.

786
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:16,744
Tae-hui has her dad, you know.
And we'll check in on her often as well.

787
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,789
Doctor, please feel free to visit
my yoga center when you have some time.

788
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,543
I feel like it'll do very well
if you come.

789
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:26,754
Doctor.

790
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:30,424
You're like a good luck charm
to me and my family.

791
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,137
Whenever you have some free time,
please stop by for a cup of coffee.

792
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:39,016
She won't have time for that.
She must be always busy.

793
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:43,854
Doctor, it's okay even if it's
a year later, or three years later.

794
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:45,439
Just visit us anytime.

795
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:48,233
For you, free yoga classes for life.

796
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:51,195
Thank you for saying that.

797
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:53,781
And I really will stop by
when I have some time.

798
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:55,532
Talk to you soon.

799
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,293
Can you raise this arm for me?

800
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:09,421
Raise this leg for me.

801
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,131
This one too.

802
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13,634
My head hurts so much, Doctor.

803
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,141
When did you get here?

804
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:23,101
I got here a while ago
for another patient.

805
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,187
Do we have the CT angiogram?

806
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,356
That's an aneurysm.

807
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,025
-Shave the area for coil embolization.
-Okay.

808
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:36,114
Yes, hello.

809
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,076
Is the bleeding severe?

810
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,329
Well, I'll go and take a look.

811
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:43,747
Okay.

812
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,500
Sorry. Call the coil embolization team
and Anesthesiology.

813
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,544
-No problem.
-Seong-yeong, can you shave the area

814
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,629
-for coil embolization?
-Sure, no problem.

815
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:54,591
Coil embolization?
Then you'll be late for practice.

816
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,177
I won't be late. It'll be done quickly.

817
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:00,180
-What's for dinner?
-Seok-hyeong wants <i>ramyeon</i>.

818
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:03,517
-Shall we get some dumplings and <i>gimbap</i>?
-That's a given.

819
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,144
-By the way, where are you headed now?
-The ER.

820
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:11,233
Oh, Hui-su wants my advice on something.
I think she fought with her sister-in-law.

821
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,026
Aren't you busy?

822
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,737
Today is not so bad.
I'll be busy next week though.

823
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,948
U-ju has a field trip,
and I have a lot of lectures.

824
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:21,451
I'll be busy with surgery as well. Come
with me if you have some time to kill.

825
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:23,495
-I have the coil procedure.
-Oh, right.

826
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:25,122
Move.

827
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:28,542
PROFESSOR OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
KIM JUN-WAN

828
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,127
THERE IS A 20-MINUTE DELAY

829
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,096
PROFESSOR OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
CHEON MYEONG-TAE

830
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,431
NO WAITING PATIENTS

831
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,267
She got a stent put in last year
at a different hospital,

832
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,935
but the symptoms are reoccurring?

833
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:48,103
Yes.

834
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:52,941
She's been experiencing chest pain
frequently as well as severe constipation.

835
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,279
Doctor, I read in books
and on the Internet

836
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,198
that the medications that are prescribed

837
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:02,784
after a stent procedure
can cause constipation.

838
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:05,162
I read that probiotics can help.

839
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,497
Can she take probiotics?

840
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:10,500
-Where do you live?
-We live in Ilsan.

841
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:16,131
Yeongji Hospital in Ilsan is pretty good.
You should take her there.

842
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:17,799
Pardon me?

843
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,594
You don't need to tell me
about what you read on the Internet.

844
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:23,513
And you don't need to come
all the way here.

845
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:25,724
She should just get treated
at a hospital nearby.

846
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:27,934
Anyway, thank you for coming. Next?

847
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:30,646
-Was she my last patient for the day?
-Yes.

848
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:33,190
Take care.

849
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,906
The surgery was done
on the 23rd of last month,

850
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:42,824
so you still have to wait a bit
to give a bath.

851
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,701
It healed nicely though.

852
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:46,828
Showers are fine, starting next week.

853
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,414
You can bathe the baby
starting next weekend.

854
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:50,999
Okay. Got it, Doctor.

855
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,793
Thank you.

856
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:54,252
-One more thing.
-Yes?

857
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:57,589
When you're using running water,
be gentle with the soap.

858
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:59,257
As for bathing the baby,

859
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:02,678
it'd be best if you could wait
until the scabs fall off naturally.

860
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,097
Okay, thank you.

861
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:08,767
-How many are left?
-Five more.

862
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,561
-You said you have plans this evening.
-It's no problem at all.

863
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,647
Professor, I heard
Professor Cheon is already done.

864
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,941
It's not even 4 p.m. yet.

865
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:21,488
Everything's ready.

866
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:24,324
Professor Chae is in her office.
Call her, and she'll come right away.

867
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:26,034
Thanks for everything.

868
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:34,209
-We're getting a lot of NS patients today.
-I know.

869
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:36,586
-Hello.
-Hello.

870
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:39,589
Seong-yeong, are you done
with the shaving?

871
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:51,238
What's the matter?

872
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:52,948
What's wrong?

873
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,802
Seong-yeong, spare me a second.

874
00:47:14,511 --> 00:47:15,512
Come on.

875
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:23,061
What is it?

876
00:47:30,485 --> 00:47:31,486
Well...

877
00:47:32,154 --> 00:47:35,824
Professor, we told the patient
that we had to shave his head

878
00:47:35,908 --> 00:47:39,786
in case we might have to perform
another brain surgery

879
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,830
in the near future.

880
00:47:42,623 --> 00:47:43,957
-Shut it.
-Okay.

881
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:57,095
Gosh, you...

882
00:48:13,445 --> 00:48:16,907
<i>Patient Oh Yu-min
is really not doing well.</i>

883
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:19,284
But strangely,
her MELD score is going down.

884
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:21,328
What do we do? We don't have time.

885
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,124
Do we have her father's address?

886
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,043
Yes, just a moment.

887
00:48:30,963 --> 00:48:32,047
My gosh, he's here.

888
00:48:37,678 --> 00:48:38,720
My goodness.

889
00:48:44,851 --> 00:48:47,813
At the top, you see the fetal heart rate.

890
00:48:48,146 --> 00:48:50,649
And at the bottom,
you see the mother's contractions.

891
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:53,735
-If you look closely...
-We have a patient with PPH coming in!

892
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:04,037
Her hemoglobin level is four.

893
00:49:05,497 --> 00:49:06,540
That's too low.

894
00:49:07,124 --> 00:49:08,083
Four?

895
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:10,669
What does that mean?

896
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:13,505
It means that she has lost a lot of blood.

897
00:49:15,382 --> 00:49:16,633
Will she live?

898
00:49:17,217 --> 00:49:18,301
Yes.

899
00:49:28,103 --> 00:49:29,354
Are you really the same person?

900
00:49:31,273 --> 00:49:32,274
Yes, Doctor.

901
00:49:33,191 --> 00:49:35,235
I lost 7kg.

902
00:49:36,528 --> 00:49:37,863
Not by starving myself.

903
00:49:38,447 --> 00:49:41,116
I hired a personal trainer
and worked out six hours a day.

904
00:49:41,742 --> 00:49:43,869
And I've been strictly watching
what I eat.

905
00:49:44,661 --> 00:49:46,413
I predict that I'll probably lose

906
00:49:47,748 --> 00:49:50,584
additional 2 to 3kg
in the next week or so.

907
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:53,712
Doctor.

908
00:49:55,422 --> 00:49:58,550
Please allow me to donate my liver.

909
00:50:01,386 --> 00:50:02,387
You see,

910
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:04,556
I don't care if I die.

911
00:50:08,935 --> 00:50:10,395
If I can save my daughter,

912
00:50:12,105 --> 00:50:14,357
I really don't care what happens to me.

913
00:50:16,276 --> 00:50:18,278
I was so preoccupied
with my business abroad

914
00:50:18,904 --> 00:50:20,447
that I neglected

915
00:50:22,407 --> 00:50:24,159
my one and only daughter.

916
00:50:25,368 --> 00:50:28,330
I had no idea at all until
my daughter was on the brink of death

917
00:50:29,998 --> 00:50:31,917
from alcoholism.

918
00:50:35,253 --> 00:50:36,671
She's in this mess now

919
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:39,341
all because of me.

920
00:50:40,884 --> 00:50:42,511
Had I been there for her,

921
00:50:44,262 --> 00:50:45,263
she wouldn't have

922
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:48,141
ended up like this.

923
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:51,144
Doctor.

924
00:50:52,729 --> 00:50:54,940
I know it's late,
but I want to be a good dad to her now.

925
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,153
So please allow me to donate my liver.

926
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:03,657
I'll lose more weight if you tell me to.

927
00:51:04,533 --> 00:51:06,660
And I'll exercise even harder.

928
00:51:08,495 --> 00:51:09,871
Please, Doctor.

929
00:51:11,957 --> 00:51:14,251
Let me donate my liver.

930
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:16,169
Please?

931
00:51:20,382 --> 00:51:21,299
Sir.

932
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:25,762
According to the rules,
you can't be a donor.

933
00:51:27,347 --> 00:51:29,933
You're above the age limit
to qualify as a donor,

934
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,437
and you have a fatty liver. I can't let
you do it if I were to stick to the rules.

935
00:51:36,022 --> 00:51:38,316
And to tell you the truth, I had given up.

936
00:51:39,401 --> 00:51:40,527
But seeing you today...

937
00:51:45,323 --> 00:51:46,408
I'll muster up some courage.

938
00:51:49,077 --> 00:51:50,203
Let's do it.

939
00:51:52,455 --> 00:51:54,249
I'll order a liver ultrasound
and other tests.

940
00:51:54,332 --> 00:51:56,710
We'll proceed with the surgery
if everything looks good.

941
00:51:58,753 --> 00:51:59,754
Thank you.

942
00:52:01,006 --> 00:52:02,424
Doctor, I really

943
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:04,593
appreciate this.

944
00:52:05,177 --> 00:52:06,553
No, please.

945
00:52:08,263 --> 00:52:12,976
I mean, I should thank you. I'm grateful
to see you again, looking so healthy.

946
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,615
Your son will go through a procedure
called coil embolization.

947
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:29,743
We'll insert a thin catheter
via a femoral puncture

948
00:52:29,826 --> 00:52:31,411
and guide it up to his cerebral arteries.

949
00:52:31,912 --> 00:52:34,247
Then we'll insert coils
to fill the aneurysm

950
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:35,999
and close it off.

951
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:39,669
And to prevent infections,
we have to shave the hair

952
00:52:39,753 --> 00:52:41,755
around the groin area before the surgery.

953
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,717
But one of our interns
misunderstood the instructions

954
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,428
and shaved his head instead.

955
00:52:50,764 --> 00:52:53,600
My instructions weren't clear enough,

956
00:52:53,892 --> 00:52:56,478
so this is my fault. I'm really sorry.

957
00:52:59,147 --> 00:53:01,149
You can claim compensation if you'd like.

958
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:04,361
I promise you
that I'll get this all sorted out for you.

959
00:53:05,862 --> 00:53:06,988
It's okay, Doctor.

960
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:11,326
He may lose his life.

961
00:53:11,701 --> 00:53:13,828
Who cares about his hair?

962
00:53:14,412 --> 00:53:15,288
Don't worry about it.

963
00:53:16,581 --> 00:53:17,582
Thank you.

964
00:53:19,584 --> 00:53:23,088
Doctor. The surgery won't hurt, right?

965
00:53:23,797 --> 00:53:25,757
It's all good as long as it won't hurt.

966
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,925
So please...

967
00:53:28,093 --> 00:53:30,095
Don't be so harsh on the intern.

968
00:53:32,264 --> 00:53:35,475
We'll administer anesthesia,
so you won't feel any pain.

969
00:53:36,351 --> 00:53:39,020
Your thigh might feel a little tight
after the surgery,

970
00:53:39,104 --> 00:53:42,399
but I'll tell them
to give you cold compresses.

971
00:53:43,817 --> 00:53:44,693
Thank goodness.

972
00:53:56,121 --> 00:53:58,456
-Which song are we practicing today?
-"Met You by Chance."

973
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,000
Okay.

974
00:54:02,585 --> 00:54:03,753
What are you doing?

975
00:54:04,337 --> 00:54:06,423
-I'm reflecting on myself.
-What for?

976
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,926
For thinking that I knew

977
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:12,637
everything about this world and people.

978
00:54:16,308 --> 00:54:19,269
-I'm reflecting on a bunch of stuff.
-What are you talking about?

979
00:54:19,853 --> 00:54:21,938
Can you step aside?
Chi-hong needs to come in.

980
00:54:23,189 --> 00:54:25,400
-Hello.
-Hi. What's up?

981
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:27,277
He said he had to ask me something.

982
00:54:29,154 --> 00:54:32,365
Jun-wan, if you have the time,
would you please get lost?

983
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:33,616
It's about a family matter.

984
00:55:04,856 --> 00:55:06,316
You can come in and see Jae-won.

985
00:55:06,399 --> 00:55:08,276
No, it's okay. I saw Jae-won earlier.

986
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,071
It's just that I keep wanting
to see my baby.

987
00:55:12,947 --> 00:55:14,866
The surgery went well, right?

988
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:16,743
Professor Ahn explained everything,

989
00:55:16,826 --> 00:55:19,329
but I wasn't really listening
because I was so out of it earlier.

990
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:22,165
-Come in for a second.
-Okay.

991
00:55:22,999 --> 00:55:24,334
I was in the OR

992
00:55:24,417 --> 00:55:26,795
to assist Professor Ahn,
so I saw everything.

993
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:32,926
Look.

994
00:55:33,218 --> 00:55:35,887
This is what the common bile duct
normally looks like.

995
00:55:36,471 --> 00:55:37,889
As we explained before the surgery,

996
00:55:37,972 --> 00:55:41,601
this part of Jae-won's common bile duct
was stretched out.

997
00:55:41,684 --> 00:55:44,479
First, we cut out the stretched-out part.

998
00:55:45,105 --> 00:55:48,066
Then to create a new passageway
for his bile to travel, we connected this

999
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,278
to his small intestine.

1000
00:55:53,405 --> 00:55:54,489
The surgery went well.

1001
00:55:55,407 --> 00:55:57,867
It's only been a while,
so Jae-won seems to be in a bit of pain.

1002
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,370
But there's no bleeding,
and the urine output is good as well.

1003
00:56:00,954 --> 00:56:02,205
The vitals are very stable too.

1004
00:56:02,455 --> 00:56:04,791
We should be able to send Jae-won
back to the ward tomorrow.

1005
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,460
Thank you, Doctor.

1006
00:56:08,586 --> 00:56:09,963
Thank you so much.

1007
00:56:10,922 --> 00:56:11,923
My gosh.

1008
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,967
Thank you.

1009
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:27,439
Yes, they dated for a long time.
About five years?

1010
00:56:28,565 --> 00:56:31,860
But as you know,

1011
00:56:31,943 --> 00:56:33,820
Ik-sun had no interest in getting married.

1012
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:36,656
But the guy kept asking her to marry him,

1013
00:56:36,781 --> 00:56:39,951
and Ik-sun liked him enough
to change her mind about it,

1014
00:56:40,743 --> 00:56:41,828
so she said yes.

1015
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:44,330
Anyway, things were fine between them.

1016
00:56:44,414 --> 00:56:47,709
But one day, they went
to see a fortune-teller on a whim.

1017
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:50,962
Apparently,
the fortune-teller said to Ik-sun

1018
00:56:52,213 --> 00:56:54,340
that she'd destroy his future
if they stayed together.

1019
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:55,592
What?

1020
00:56:55,925 --> 00:56:57,510
She said they're totally incompatible

1021
00:56:57,802 --> 00:56:59,971
and that Ik-sun would be like a roadblock
to his future.

1022
00:57:01,556 --> 00:57:03,057
They were told some nonsense like that.

1023
00:57:04,517 --> 00:57:06,978
-And she believed it?
-No, of course not.

1024
00:57:07,979 --> 00:57:10,773
But that would stay
in the back of your mind, you know?

1025
00:57:10,857 --> 00:57:12,817
So the next day,

1026
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:16,988
Ik-sun made an appointment
with every fortune-teller in the area

1027
00:57:17,238 --> 00:57:20,033
and asked him to come with her
to get that out of their heads.

1028
00:57:20,825 --> 00:57:22,952
-And?
-But that jerk was like...

1029
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:26,164
He said he told his mom about it

1030
00:57:27,248 --> 00:57:29,793
and that she is against them
getting married.

1031
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:32,128
Then he asked her for time apart.

1032
00:57:33,922 --> 00:57:35,423
Ik-sun was baffled.

1033
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:39,052
She was just sitting there,
dazed and confused.

1034
00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:42,889
Then she suddenly got a call
from that guy's mom.

1035
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,225
She answered,

1036
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:49,521
and his mom wanted to hang out
on the weekend.

1037
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,901
In such a happy, jolly voice,

1038
00:57:55,819 --> 00:57:58,655
she asked Ik-sun to join her
on her trip to Sokcho that weekend.

1039
00:57:58,738 --> 00:57:59,948
So he lied.

1040
00:58:01,157 --> 00:58:02,742
He sure did, using his mom as an excuse.

1041
00:58:03,743 --> 00:58:06,412
He didn't know that
his mom and Ik-sun talked often.

1042
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:11,543
If his feelings had changed,
he should've just been honest with her.

1043
00:58:11,626 --> 00:58:12,836
I mean, he's not a kid.

1044
00:58:14,796 --> 00:58:16,631
Why did she even date
a douchebag like him?

1045
00:58:18,508 --> 00:58:21,469
Anyway, she suffered from insomnia
for over six months after that.

1046
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:23,263
She couldn't even eat,

1047
00:58:24,597 --> 00:58:27,183
and she lost over 5kg during those months.

1048
00:58:28,977 --> 00:58:32,647
I was busy at the hospital back then,
so I couldn't really be there for her.

1049
00:58:33,231 --> 00:58:35,108
Is my dear sister okay now?

1050
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:38,528
Yes, she seems
to have fully recovered from it.

1051
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:41,072
Her sense of humor is coming back.

1052
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:51,457
Anyway, thanks for telling me.

1053
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,878
When I talk to Ik-sun, I'll pretend
not to know anything about this.

1054
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:56,379
Okay, sounds good.

1055
00:58:57,672 --> 00:58:58,756
Professor.

1056
00:59:00,592 --> 00:59:02,969
Please believe me.
Nothing's going on between me and Ik-sun.

1057
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:04,679
We're really just friends.

1058
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:08,016
Okay, I heard you. Jeez.

1059
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:11,853
You have your band practice
later today, right?

1060
00:59:12,395 --> 00:59:14,772
May I stop by next time
and watch you practice?

1061
00:59:14,856 --> 00:59:15,773
Sure!

1062
00:59:16,316 --> 00:59:17,984
You can definitely come, but...

1063
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,944
You like Song-hwa, right?

1064
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:21,863
-I mean, you admire--
-Yes.

1065
00:59:27,035 --> 00:59:28,119
I like her.

1066
00:59:35,793 --> 00:59:37,337
Everyone likes Song-hwa.

1067
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:39,839
That's why she's always so busy.

1068
00:59:40,506 --> 00:59:43,760
Anyway, when those who like her
see her playing her bass guitar...

1069
00:59:44,886 --> 00:59:47,722
I'm sure you'll fall for her even more.
She's gotten so much better at it.

1070
00:59:47,972 --> 00:59:49,265
She's such a nerd.

1071
00:59:50,642 --> 00:59:53,102
I heard that she had to do
coil embolization. Would she be done?

1072
00:59:53,853 --> 00:59:55,688
Yes, she should be almost done now.

1073
00:59:56,856 --> 00:59:58,107
Good work, everyone.

1074
01:00:01,569 --> 01:00:03,112
I know a good <i>sujebi</i> place nearby.

1075
01:00:03,196 --> 01:00:04,322
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1076
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:08,284
Professor, you must be exhausted.
Did the surgery go well?

1077
01:00:09,077 --> 01:00:11,537
We struggled to locate
the origin of the bleeding at first,

1078
01:00:11,621 --> 01:00:12,455
but it went well.

1079
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:14,332
We managed to stop the bleeding,

1080
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:17,418
so we'll do a transfusion
and see how she recovers.

1081
01:00:18,044 --> 01:00:19,754
When you're requesting a CBC,

1082
01:00:19,837 --> 01:00:23,174
order a DIC as well.
And let me know when the results are out.

1083
01:00:23,758 --> 01:00:26,427
Also, she's gotten a lot of blood,
so do a chest X-ray tomorrow.

1084
01:00:26,511 --> 01:00:27,720
Got it.

1085
01:00:27,887 --> 01:00:28,888
Professor.

1086
01:00:30,932 --> 01:00:33,977
Did that patient make it?

1087
01:00:34,602 --> 01:00:36,270
Of course, she's okay now.

1088
01:00:38,523 --> 01:00:39,816
See you tomorrow.

1089
01:00:42,276 --> 01:00:43,361
-See you.
-See you.

1090
01:00:45,029 --> 01:00:46,447
Thank you.

1091
01:00:56,332 --> 01:00:59,002
-We're late.
-All right, okay.

1092
01:00:59,085 --> 01:01:00,503
Give me a minute.

1093
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:06,426
Jeez, I heard you!

1094
01:01:33,995 --> 01:01:35,246
Sorry about that.

1095
01:01:35,371 --> 01:01:38,666
Wait, sir. Your wallet.

1096
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,625
Thank you.

1097
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:49,719
Hey, what is this?

1098
01:01:52,305 --> 01:01:53,556
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

1099
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,106
-Where are you headed?
-<i>Doors are closing.</i>

1100
01:02:02,273 --> 01:02:03,524
-It's a secret.
-What?

1101
01:02:13,451 --> 01:02:15,369
Hey, I'm in the lobby.

1102
01:02:28,466 --> 01:02:29,634
It's understandable.

1103
01:02:29,717 --> 01:02:31,719
He's just a middle-aged man
without his white coat.

1104
01:02:31,928 --> 01:02:34,055
I didn't recognize him at all.
What do I do?

1105
01:02:34,263 --> 01:02:36,474
It's okay. Professor Yang is cool
with these things.

1106
01:02:36,557 --> 01:02:37,809
Don't worry about it.

1107
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,229
Girls, the moment
we take off our surgical gowns,

1108
01:02:41,312 --> 01:02:43,856
we're back to being
just like anybody else.

1109
01:02:44,273 --> 01:02:45,233
-Okay.
-Okay.

1110
01:02:45,316 --> 01:02:48,194
I know it can get stressful, but think
that the patients can be your family

1111
01:02:48,277 --> 01:02:49,570
and be patient.

1112
01:02:50,029 --> 01:02:52,490
Give them a second chance
and try to be understanding.

1113
01:02:52,907 --> 01:02:55,201
But no third chance.
Tell your supervisors right away.

1114
01:02:55,493 --> 01:02:56,410
-Okay.
-Okay.

1115
01:02:59,288 --> 01:03:01,249
Yeong-ju, did you say
your father is a doctor?

1116
01:03:01,415 --> 01:03:04,919
Yes, but he's getting chemotherapy
after his cancer surgery at the moment.

1117
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:08,256
My gosh, is he okay?

1118
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:12,385
Yes! He always bad-mouths
his doctor and the hospital.

1119
01:03:12,969 --> 01:03:14,554
He's doing great.

1120
01:03:17,181 --> 01:03:18,933
-Over there.
-Oh, I see them.

1121
01:03:19,267 --> 01:03:21,060
-Seok-hyeong!
-Ik-jun!

1122
01:03:21,144 --> 01:03:22,145
What?

1123
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:24,814
What? What do you want?

1124
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:26,691
Sorry about that.

1125
01:03:26,816 --> 01:03:28,192
Hey, dude.

1126
01:03:28,276 --> 01:03:29,819
-You bumped into me.
-I'm hungry.

1127
01:03:29,902 --> 01:03:32,572
-You're at it again.
-Gosh, you started this skit.

1128
01:03:50,214 --> 01:03:51,048
Who's coming?

1129
01:03:56,512 --> 01:03:58,014
I'll get all shy.

1130
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,516
You never let us down. Well done.

1131
01:04:01,058 --> 01:04:02,310
Will he like it though?

1132
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:03,936
Then my mom will come too.

1133
01:04:09,108 --> 01:04:12,028
Jong-su, when was the last time
you went to a concert?

1134
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:14,447
I don't know what songs
are popular these days.

1135
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:18,659
Jeong-won, can you guys perform a song
by Moon Ju-ran?

1136
01:04:19,452 --> 01:04:21,037
Or something by Cho Mi-mi.

1137
01:04:21,954 --> 01:04:25,082
We'll kick you out if you're going
to keep making such unreasonable requests.

1138
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:26,542
All right, fine.

1139
01:04:27,168 --> 01:04:28,377
Get started, then.

1140
01:04:28,961 --> 01:04:29,921
Yes, sir.

1141
01:04:30,004 --> 01:04:32,381
I'm fine with anything,
but pick something upbeat.

1142
01:04:32,673 --> 01:04:33,966
Pick something exciting, mister.

1143
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:36,010
"Mister"?

1144
01:04:36,761 --> 01:04:37,970
Yes, ma'am.

1145
01:05:02,787 --> 01:05:06,624
<i>I met you by chance</i>

1146
01:05:06,707 --> 01:05:09,043
<i>And your beauty stole my heart</i>

1147
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:14,006
<i>I met you by chance</i>

1148
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:17,134
<i>And your eyes captivated my heart</i>

1149
01:05:18,177 --> 01:05:23,307
<i>There is something I want to tell you</i>

1150
01:05:23,391 --> 01:05:30,064
<i>Why can't I muster up the courage?</i>

1151
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:36,862
<i>I want to say it to you
But I don't feel confident</i>

1152
01:05:36,946 --> 01:05:39,907
<i>My heart is pounding</i>

1153
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:44,704
<i>I shall let all this frustration</i>

1154
01:05:44,787 --> 01:05:47,540
<i>Fly away in the wind</i>

1155
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,585
I'm not a kid, Dad.

1156
01:06:32,668 --> 01:06:34,920
I'll just eat it myself.

1157
01:06:35,004 --> 01:06:36,505
To me, you're still a ten-year-old.

1158
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:41,719
And why do I have to eat porridge?

1159
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:43,763
I haven't even gotten the surgery yet.

1160
01:06:46,724 --> 01:06:50,895
Dad, I want to eat fried chicken.

1161
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:44,115
<i>That lady
Who is as beautiful as a blooming flower</i>

1162
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:46,992
<i>Stole my heart</i>

1163
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:52,123
<i>Her gorgeous eyes
That sparkle like morning dew</i>

1164
01:07:52,206 --> 01:07:54,834
<i>Captivated my heart</i>

1165
01:07:55,709 --> 01:08:01,257
<i>There is something I want to tell you</i>

1166
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:07,221
<i>Why can't I muster up the courage?</i>

1167
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:14,603
<i>I want to say it to you
But I don't feel confident</i>

1168
01:08:14,687 --> 01:08:17,565
<i>My heart is pounding</i>

1169
01:08:18,649 --> 01:08:22,319
<i>A fool, such a fool</i>

1170
01:08:22,403 --> 01:08:25,781
<i>I must be a fool</i>

1171
01:08:41,881 --> 01:08:46,969
<i>There is something I want to tell you</i>

1172
01:08:47,052 --> 01:08:53,976
<i>Why can't I muster up the courage?</i>

1173
01:08:56,562 --> 01:09:00,441
<i>I want to say it to you
But I don't feel confident</i>

1174
01:09:00,524 --> 01:09:03,027
<i>My heart is pounding</i>

1175
01:09:04,236 --> 01:09:07,656
<i>A fool, such a fool</i>

1176
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,036
<i>I must be a fool</i>

1177
01:09:41,774 --> 01:09:43,108
That was amazing!

1178
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:46,111
-Hey! Goodness.
-Gosh, I'm sleepy.

1179
01:09:53,202 --> 01:09:55,079
Daddy, take me with you.
I want to go with you.

1180
01:09:55,955 --> 01:09:58,916
Hey, U-ju. I'll see you in the evening.

1181
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:00,167
You can wait, right?

1182
01:10:02,503 --> 01:10:04,129
Okay, our goodbye ritual.

1183
01:10:05,422 --> 01:10:07,925
There! Okay. See you later.

1184
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:39,248
My gosh.

1185
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:42,835
My gosh, Doctor!

1186
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,503
You actually came.

1187
01:10:45,296 --> 01:10:48,465
WISHING YOU ABUNDANCE OF PROSPERITY
CHAE SONG-HWA

1188
01:10:49,049 --> 01:10:50,467
Congratulations on your opening.

1189
01:10:51,343 --> 01:10:52,386
Thank you.

1190
01:10:53,178 --> 01:10:55,431
Honey, Dr. Chae is here. Come on out!

1191
01:10:55,514 --> 01:10:59,351
No, that's okay. I can't stay anyway.

1192
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:02,104
I'm meeting someone in the area,
so I wanted to stop by.

1193
01:11:05,232 --> 01:11:06,900
Have a great day.

1194
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:25,461
<i>A guy is here to see you.</i>

1195
01:11:25,919 --> 01:11:28,380
<i>He seemed to be in his late 30s,</i>

1196
01:11:29,214 --> 01:11:30,132
<i>and he's handsome.</i>

1197
01:11:37,556 --> 01:11:38,641
What the...

1198
01:11:53,197 --> 01:11:54,031
Surprised to see me?

1199
01:11:57,284 --> 01:11:58,327
You're no fun.

1200
01:11:59,244 --> 01:12:02,164
This one is for spicy fish stew.
All the ingredients are ready to go,

1201
01:12:02,247 --> 01:12:03,707
so just boil them with the sauce.

1202
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:07,795
In this one, you'll find different kinds
of tripe. They're raw, so grill them.

1203
01:12:07,878 --> 01:12:09,421
You have to grill them, okay?

1204
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:13,133
This is <i>sundae</i> and organ meats.
Things like the ears, liver, lung,

1205
01:12:13,217 --> 01:12:15,511
intestines, kidneys, and so on.

1206
01:12:15,594 --> 01:12:17,554
They're cooked,
so you can eat them right away.

1207
01:12:22,393 --> 01:12:24,853
-Did something happen?
-No, not at all.

1208
01:12:24,937 --> 01:12:26,939
-Are you getting remarried?
-No.

1209
01:12:27,022 --> 01:12:29,191
-Is Mom ill?
-No, she's fine.

1210
01:12:29,274 --> 01:12:31,652
-Is Dad ill?
-Jeez, I just came to see you.

1211
01:12:31,735 --> 01:12:33,570
-Are you ill?
-Gosh, I'm off.

1212
01:12:33,654 --> 01:12:35,781
I promised U-ju
I'd take him out for <i>tonkatsu</i>.

1213
01:12:35,864 --> 01:12:37,700
I just stopped by on the way
to give you these.

1214
01:12:37,783 --> 01:12:39,618
-Where's the restaurant?
-In Apgujeong-dong.

1215
01:12:42,871 --> 01:12:44,665
I just came to see you, okay?

1216
01:12:47,793 --> 01:12:48,794
You've been well, right?

1217
01:12:50,045 --> 01:12:51,004
Yes.

1218
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:53,716
I've been well. What about you?

1219
01:12:53,799 --> 01:12:55,426
I'm always well.

1220
01:12:55,718 --> 01:12:58,303
I'm sorry for not visiting you often
and not taking

1221
01:13:00,013 --> 01:13:01,390
better care of you.

1222
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:10,190
Bye.

1223
01:13:14,778 --> 01:13:16,822
I should give you some spending money.

1224
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,991
Here.

1225
01:13:21,827 --> 01:13:23,412
What?

1226
01:13:24,163 --> 01:13:25,456
Are you crying?

1227
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:29,543
Gosh, what is wrong with me?

1228
01:13:32,796 --> 01:13:34,256
You're nuts.

1229
01:13:34,339 --> 01:13:36,216
I'm off. Take it easy.

1230
01:13:37,426 --> 01:13:39,762
Call me if you're ever stressed out.

1231
01:13:40,012 --> 01:13:44,183
I'm not busy at all,
so you can call me anytime.

1232
01:13:45,642 --> 01:13:46,894
I'm off, for real this time.

1233
01:14:11,871 --> 01:14:18,133

1234
01:14:33,607 --> 01:14:35,317
Okay. We'll go together.

1235
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,361
I have to go
if my girlfriend wants me to go.

1236
01:14:37,444 --> 01:14:39,404
<i>They're all nice people.</i>

1237
01:14:39,488 --> 01:14:40,489
-Hello.
-Hello.

1238
01:14:40,989 --> 01:14:41,949
What is this?

1239
01:14:42,032 --> 01:14:45,327
<i>I guess you really want to see
the end of me.</i>

1240
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:48,163
Ik-jun, how about a drink with me tonight?

1241
01:14:48,247 --> 01:14:50,082
What? What's going on?

1242
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:53,293
<i>I'd be a shame for Jeong-won
to quit his job as a doctor.</i>

1243
01:14:53,377 --> 01:14:55,295
<i>There aren't a lot of doctors like him.</i>

1244
01:14:55,379 --> 01:14:57,840
What's up with your kids?

1245
01:14:57,923 --> 01:15:00,884
Our dear Gyeo-ul must be dating someone!

1246
01:15:00,968 --> 01:15:01,802
Really?

1247
01:15:01,885 --> 01:15:04,471
If you like her, say so.
I'll keep it a secret.

1248
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,265
Jeong-won hasn't gone home yet.

1249
01:15:06,348 --> 01:15:07,432
I have to see a patient.

1250
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:09,768
-I'll stay here.
<i>-Professor, by any chance...</i>

1251
01:15:10,644 --> 01:15:12,312
<i>You're not being jealous, are you?</i>

1252
01:15:12,396 --> 01:15:13,981
<i>-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.</i>

1253
01:15:14,064 --> 01:15:15,941
No! When? What time?

1254
01:15:16,024 --> 01:15:18,110
<i>It's nice if you can rely on each other.</i>

1255
01:15:19,278 --> 01:15:20,195
Later.

1256
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,532
I'll tell you guys at once
when we're all together.

1257
01:15:25,492 --> 01:15:27,786
<i>-Who?
-Who's going to do the surgery?</i>

1258
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:28,745
<i>It'll be burdensome.</i>

1259
01:15:28,829 --> 01:15:31,707
It's a given to do well. If not,
it'll harm the hospital's reputation.

1260
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:34,209
<i>The patient's condition is really bad
due to chronic rejection.</i>

1261
01:15:34,293 --> 01:15:37,045
I won't do it. I don't want to.

1262
01:15:37,671 --> 01:15:38,964
<i>Don't do it if you don't want to.</i>

1263
01:15:39,548 --> 01:15:41,008
I've told you though.

1264
01:15:41,508 --> 01:15:44,344
The patient says no,
and Professor Cheon says to follow it.

1265
01:15:44,428 --> 01:15:45,846
If I had an excuse,

1266
01:15:45,929 --> 01:15:47,764
<i>I don't want to proceed
a high risk operation</i>

1267
01:15:48,348 --> 01:15:49,433
<i>It's not up to you.</i>

1268
01:15:49,516 --> 01:15:51,310
It's up to the doctor.

1269
01:15:51,894 --> 01:15:54,062
<i>Professor. What do I do?</i>

1270
01:15:54,146 --> 01:15:56,440
We must protect the baby
who came to us this time.

1271
01:15:56,523 --> 01:15:58,275
<i>If the doctor gives up on the patient,</i>

1272
01:15:58,942 --> 01:16:00,152
<i>he isn't a doctor anymore.</i>
