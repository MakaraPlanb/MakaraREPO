HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:11,056
Your numbers look all normal.

3
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,100
Just keep an eye on your weight.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,601
But you know...

5
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:18,188
Strangely, I catch a cold way more often

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:20,691
-after getting the liver transplant.
-I see.

7
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:23,944
I had one nasty winter last year
because of the cold.

8
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:27,572
I see. I didn't know that.
Did you get the flu shot last year?

9
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:30,492
No way. After getting the transplant,

10
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:32,411
my heart starts beating fast

11
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:34,538
whenever I see a syringe.

12
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:36,915
Even so,
you should've gotten the flu shot.

13
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:37,958
Even I get them.

14
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,544
We'll call you when your shot is due.
Get it this year.

15
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:41,503
But you know,

16
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:44,881
strangely, my skin gets dark spots easily

17
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:47,884
after getting the liver transplant.

18
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:50,178
Before the surgery,

19
00:00:50,262 --> 00:00:54,057
people used to tell me that I had
glowing skin like a man in his 60s.

20
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,184
When you go out, do you apply sunscreen?

21
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:58,478
My gosh, men don't need that.

22
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:00,647
-I don't apply sunscreen.
-Goodness.

23
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:02,774
That's why you're getting tanned.

24
00:01:02,858 --> 00:01:05,235
Besides, your skin was tanned,
to begin with.

25
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:08,697
Is that so? But you know,

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,743
after getting the liver transplant,

27
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:16,288
walking for just an hour would make
my legs hurt these days.

28
00:01:16,997 --> 00:01:19,833
When I'm a little bit tired,
I have pins and needles in my legs.

29
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,918
And my back hurts, too.

30
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,132
Sir, how old are you this year?

31
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:28,050
Me?

32
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:30,635
I turned 84 this year.

33
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:41,480
Come on. What can I do then?

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,652
Do you know Park Jong-jin,
an HCC patient who was admitted?

35
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:50,864
When I told him his tumor got bigger,
he wanted to talk to you.

36
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:53,992
I'll go check on my sister first,
then I'll talk to him before I go home.

37
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:55,494
-Go get some rest.
-Okay.

38
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:05,337
You should take the next one.

39
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:08,048
-What?
-Just take the next one.

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,302
<i>Third floor. Going up. Doors are closing.</i>

41
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:26,525
Hello.

42
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:28,485
Hi.

43
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:37,536
Gosh, this is good.

44
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:41,665
NAME: LEE IK-SUN

45
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,254
It's so good.

46
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,300
Are you a wild beast?

47
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,429
You should cook that.
We've been using fire for centuries now.

48
00:02:56,513 --> 00:02:59,307
Everything is cooked except for this one.

49
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:02,936
-Did Mom call you?
-Yes.

50
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,939
She might be onto something.
She called me yesterday and today.

51
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,441
-You didn't tell her, did you?
-No, I didn't.

52
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:10,610
If I do, I know she'll be worried.
Why would I do that?

53
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:12,779
I guess Jun-wan is pretty good.

54
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:14,698
I feel fine. My head just rings a bit.

55
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:15,991
My gosh, the way you talk.

56
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:18,618
You'll turn 40 soon.
Don't talk like a kid.

57
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:22,414
It's been a while since I saw him.
And he's so old now.

58
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:24,207
Of course. He'll turn 40 soon, too.

59
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,710
-Is he not going to get married?
-You should get married.

60
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:30,380
-Did he come and check on you?
-Four times.

61
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,050
He came to check on me four times.
He's here all the time.

62
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:35,927
He must think I'm still in middle school.

63
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:38,638
Gosh, that's gross.

64
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:41,975
Nice. That makes it five.

65
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,315
Say hello, Professor Kim. He's my brother.

66
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,567
Please take good care of her.

67
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,778
I'm Lee Ik-jun,
Major Lee Ik-sun's older brother.

68
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:57,282
I truly appreciate the work
you did on her.

69
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,075
Just like she told me,

70
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,411
you're just getting old
as a lonely bachelor.

71
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:04,873
-My gosh, yes. I am. My apologies.
-Okay.

72
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:06,958
Seeing how you're goofing around,
you can go home.

73
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,794
I got the medical certificate
and admission note ready for you.

74
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,922
-You can get discharged tomorrow.
-Okay.

75
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:15,800
You're not going back right away, right?

76
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:18,678
She's off for two weeks.
She'll rest up at my house.

77
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:20,639
You're not going to Changwon?
Stay with your mom.

78
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:23,308
Gosh, no. She doesn't know yet.
Hand me some tissues.

79
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:28,939
You know what? Your hospital
must be environmentally friendly.

80
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:29,981
There are birds here.

81
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:32,400
Birds? Are there birds inside?

82
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:34,402
-My gosh.
-Right here.

83
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:40,075
What should I do?

84
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:47,874
Being her brother is so hard.
It really is.

85
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,085
Stay still.

86
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:57,342
What was that?

87
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:59,511
It's <i>buljajangmyeon</i>. It's so good.

88
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:01,221
-Is it spicy?
-Yes, it is a little.

89
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:03,014
But it's the best <i>jajangmyeon</i> I had.

90
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:04,849
I had <i>jajangmyeon</i>
from every restaurant near my base.

91
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:08,144
But this restaurant has
the best <i>jajangmyeon.</i> It's so good.

92
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,813
You must come and try it.

93
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:13,275
No matter how good it is, I won't go
all the way there just for <i>jajangmyeon</i>.

94
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:15,902
How can you never come to see
your own sister in Inje?

95
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:18,321
I visited you when you were in Cheorwon.

96
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:19,990
That was three years ago!

97
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:21,408
I'm busy trying to meet ends meet.

98
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:22,690
I look after my son and my patients.

99
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:25,745
I'm busy, too.
I have 300 soldiers under me.

100
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,455
Don't you feel sorry for your only sister?

101
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,582
I'm stuck in Inje,
only eating <i>buljajangmyeon</i>.

102
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,420
What are you talking about?
Field grade officers get many days off.

103
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:36,423
You're a major in the army,
but all you do is travel.

104
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,091
I didn't get to travel that much.

105
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:39,634
I can't go beyond the border anyway.

106
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:41,803
No matter what, I'm stuck in Inje.

107
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:43,179
I ate all the downstream trouts
and salmons.

108
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:45,849
You always liked sashimi anyway.
You're a sashimi lover.

109
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:48,810
You eat them because you like sashimi.
Why are you blaming it on the fish?

110
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,270
You said <i>buljajangmyeon</i> was great.

111
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:51,938
If you can eat that
delicious thing every day,

112
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,107
you'd be happy every day.
Why would I feel bad for you?

113
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,443
Oh, my. Are you guys rapping?

114
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:58,611
You two should become rappers.

115
00:05:58,695 --> 00:05:59,529
Actually, we used to

116
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:00,822
practice rapping together.

117
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:03,908
When I was in middle school,
and he was in high school,

118
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,702
We entered a comedy contest
as two rappers. But we didn't make it.

119
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,747
-Comedy contest?
-That was a long time ago.

120
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,958
By the way, who did you want
to see from the hospital?

121
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:14,836
-Didn't she come to see you?
-No way. You think she'd come to see me?

122
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,213
I'm sure she came here to see her friend.

123
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:20,800
I was going to see you and my friend, too.

124
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:24,012
It's my best friend. And my best friend
has to work on the weekends, too.

125
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:26,306
So I came here to surprise my friend.

126
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:28,433
Darn it.

127
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:33,229
-Wait, is it a guy?
-Yes.

128
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,148
-Is he your boyfriend?
-No, he's not.

129
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:36,983
He's the closest friend in the army.

130
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,111
-I don't think so.
-We're really just friends.

131
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:42,447
We're like you and Song-hwa.

132
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:43,948
Salute.

133
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,829
My gosh, Major Lee. How long has it been?

134
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,248
Are you okay now?
Sorry I couldn't come yesterday.

135
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:55,168
Mr. Civilian. You look great.

136
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:59,589
-Oh, my. Hello.
-What is this?

137
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:03,426
It's Dr. Ahn Chi-hong from NS?
Are you two friends?

138
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:06,429
Right. You said you graduated
from the Military Academy.

139
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,264
Why didn't I connect the dots?

140
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:09,766
It didn't occur to me, either.

141
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,060
Now that I know,
your names are very similar.

142
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:13,686
-Do you know each other?
-Yes.

143
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:16,773
Hey, by the way, I approve.
I approve of this.

144
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:19,317
-Of what?
-I like Dr. Ahn.

145
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,153
Gosh. I got nothing to say if it's him.

146
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:24,072
-I approve.
-Come on.

147
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:25,990
Hey, stop that nonsense.

148
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:28,034
Song-hwa bought the <i>gimbap</i> you like.
Let's go.

149
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:30,620
-I... Wait. Hold on.
-Just go.

150
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:31,830
Bye.

151
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:36,000
Wait. Please take good care of my sister.

152
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:38,878
She may come across as rough,

153
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:41,131
but she is really funny.

154
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,216
Okay? You know?

155
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:47,720
Hurry. Take a seat. Cheers.

156
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:57,273
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

157
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:04,362
A cup of large iced latte, please.

158
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:06,030
What do you want?

159
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:09,117
I'll have some tomato juice. Thank you.

160
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:11,953
-Who is he?
-A surgical intern.

161
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:13,204
I see. Hello.

162
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:15,290
One tomato juice, too.

163
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:19,085
Say hello. She's a second-year
ob-gyn resident. Dr. Chu Min-ha.

164
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,546
-Hello.
-Is he the only intern?

165
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,214
Are you the only surgical intern?

166
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:25,341
There is another one,
but there's a liver metastasis conference

167
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:26,509
for a breast cancer patient.

168
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,261
So the other intern went
to the conference.

169
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:31,931
-I thought you had a lunch date.
-Gosh, it wasn't a date at all.

170
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:34,934
He wanted me to buy him lunch,
so I just bought him a meal.

171
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:36,811
-I'll pay.
-He's eight years younger than her.

172
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,897
-She's got games.
-Seven years.

173
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:41,774
-Do you want to chat for a bit?
-I have to go.

174
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:42,692
Gosh.

175
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:45,528
-Buy me a cup of coffee, too.
-What would you like to have?

176
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:48,198
I'd like an Iced latte with a lot of ice.

177
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:49,699
One more iced latte, please.

178
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,493
You two are like besties.

179
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,162
I've been bothering him these days.

180
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:57,332
I really can't figure out what kind of
person Professor Yang Seok-hyeong is.

181
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm getting a crash course from him.

182
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,294
When it comes to those five members
of the comedy club,

183
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:04,297
I can describe them in an omniscient
viewpoint as their colleague.

184
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,383
Everything. Their dating history,
families, and what they are really like.

185
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:09,594
It only takes a cup of coffee.

186
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:12,347
Yours are ready. You should go.

187
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:30,990
Hello, when did this happen?

188
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:34,786
It's been an hour.
He passed out in the shower.

189
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,249
Can you move this leg for me?

190
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,793
All right. And this leg.

191
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,341
He's not a Korean national, right?

192
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:49,801
Right.

193
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,477
Right now, he's suffering
from an intracerebral hemorrhage.

194
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,479
If his blood pressure remains high,

195
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:03,356
the bleeding could get worse
and may lead to death.

196
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,027
I managed to get him a bed in the ICU,
so he should stay there

197
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:10,196
and get surgery this afternoon or tonight.

198
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:13,741
Please sign here.

199
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,041
She said she's suddenly discharging blood.

200
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,668
How long has it been?

201
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:26,254
It's been two to three days.

202
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:30,800
Is there a lot of blood or does it hurt
like during your menstrual cycle?

203
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:34,012
Not really. I don't think so.

204
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,223
Just tell the doctor everything.

205
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:39,726
She can be really shy, you know.

206
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:42,103
People say that
kids these days are out of control,

207
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,564
but she's so innocent. Goodness.

208
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:46,691
Then, let me take a look at
her ultrasound.

209
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,735
-Let's do an ultrasound.
-Okay.

210
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,946
Ma'am, you can stay outside.
After the scan, we will bring you back in.

211
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,700
-Okay. Just do it. You'll be okay.
-Mom.

212
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,586
Doctor, do you think
this is implantation bleeding?

213
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:12,091
Has it been two weeks
since I did it with my boyfriend?

214
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:15,678
Damn it. I'm totally fucked.

215
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,307
Do you think I am pregnant?

216
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:21,726
If I am, my mom will kill me.

217
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:25,563
That motherfucker.
I told him to put on a condom.

218
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:27,148
Damn it.

219
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,903
Well, we don't know that yet.

220
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:34,489
Not all vaginal bleeding means
implantation in the uterus.

221
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,991
I see...

222
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:39,577
Then,

223
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,747
does it mean I can still have sex?

224
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,631
You're an intern. So how old you are you?

225
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:52,965
I'm 26 years old.

226
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:54,509
-My gosh.
-My goodness.

227
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:55,677
He's a baby.

228
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,845
-I'm so jealous.
-Goodness.

229
00:11:58,763 --> 00:11:59,764
Hi.

230
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:01,307
-Hello.
-Hello.

231
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:02,642
-Sit down.
-Hi.

232
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:06,062
My gosh, I'm hungry.
Let's do this while we eat.

233
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:09,399
-Here. This is yours, sir.
-Okay.

234
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:10,900
Goodness.

235
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:13,778
I'm sorry.
I just finished seeing my outpatients.

236
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:15,321
My apologies.

237
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:19,158
You must be Im Chang-min.

238
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,830
Age, 26. Hometown, Cheongju.
You met your girlfriend from school.

239
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:26,082
You like to drink Tesla, right?

240
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,211
Do you know what that is?
Not the auto company.

241
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:32,672
It's a cocktail thing.
I haven't eaten yet. I'm starving.

242
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:33,589
Seriously?

243
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:37,927
We have to pay for food like this?

244
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,432
My goodness, what a rip-off.
Don't you think?

245
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,439
-Pardon?
-He wants to be discharged.

246
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:51,190
If he does, he might die.

247
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:52,859
He can't afford it.

248
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,527
We have the Social Services Department.

249
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,696
They can get some help
even if they are foreigners.

250
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:59,574
Actually, I looked into that.
This patient doesn't have a passport.

251
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:01,909
And he can't get
an income certificate, either.

252
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:03,536
Our hospital cannot help him.

253
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:07,790
-What should I do?
-Hold on.

254
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:12,336
<i>Let me characterize those five doctors
in one go. Listen up.</i>

255
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,046
To sum it up,

256
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:15,715
they should be called Lacking Five.

257
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:18,468
I could call them that.

258
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:20,470
I thought you had to go.

259
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:22,847
What does that mean?

260
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,432
So everyone lacks something?

261
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:27,185
That's right. Everyone lacks something.

262
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:28,436
Let's start with Song-hwa.

263
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,062
-The only female.
-The only female

264
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:31,856
and their emotional pillar.

265
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,985
In a nutshell,
she doesn't have any weaknesses.

266
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,863
She's good at her job.

267
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:40,740
And she helps other people, too.

268
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:42,992
When I have some extra time,
I'll write her biography.

269
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:45,536
-I heard about her.
-She's better than what you've heard.

270
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,749
Song-hwa is a perfect nerd.
But she likes having fun, too.

271
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,252
She likes having meals with colleagues
and can drink, too.

272
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,546
And sometimes, she acts all crazy.

273
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,466
She's pure-hearted.

274
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:01,177
Is that possible at her age?

275
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:03,930
What's wrong with our age?

276
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:08,768
The Social Services Department said
they would look into it.

277
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:10,228
-But it may take some time.
-Right.

278
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:12,772
But I don't think
this patient should be discharged.

279
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,899
-I don't know what to do.
-Hold on.

280
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:20,363
<i>Yes, Professor Chae Song-hwa.</i>

281
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:22,490
Didn't you have Grandpa-Long-Legs

282
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:24,700
or something like that
at your previous hospital?

283
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:26,452
<i>Jeong-won knows a lot about that.</i>

284
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:28,663
<i>No, Kangwoon Medical Center's
Social Services Department has</i>

285
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:29,914
<i>someone called Hyeon Jeong-mi.</i>

286
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:32,291
<i>She's the only one
who can directly contact the sponsor.</i>

287
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,126
Okay. Send me her number.

288
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:36,420
Do you have her phone number?

289
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:38,214
Okay.

290
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:40,550
If you give me her number, I'll call her.

291
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:42,051
Okay. Just a moment.

292
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:44,512
Right.

293
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,642
Yes, this patient
has an intracerebral hemorrhage.

294
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:51,602
The bleeding was caused
by high blood pressure.

295
00:14:51,686 --> 00:14:53,938
He must undergo surgery
before the bleeding worsens.

296
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:55,565
I was wondering if you could help.

297
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:59,402
-Where is he from?
-He's from Indonesia.

298
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:01,821
-Professor, I can talk to her...
-He's from Indonesia.

299
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:04,490
No, we don't have much time.
I'll leave my number.

300
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:06,993
If you have any questions, call me.

301
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:10,454
By the way, do you think you can get
Grandpa-Long-Legs on the phone?

302
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:11,914
We really don't have time.

303
00:15:12,498 --> 00:15:15,251
The patient is in critical condition.

304
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:18,754
Please get back to me
as soon as possible. Okay.

305
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:22,884
Usually, the sponsor gets back
to them right away. Let's wait.

306
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:26,554
All right, then.
We took care of the medical bills.

307
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:27,471
Where is he now?

308
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:29,307
He's still in the ER.

309
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,767
Go ahead with the CT navigation
and prep for surgery.

310
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:33,853
I'll call the Anesthesiology
to book an OR.

311
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,396
I'm calling them now. I'll do it.

312
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,981
You go and prep for surgery now.

313
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:39,275
Hey, it's me.
I'll send a patient up for premedication.

314
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:40,860
Get me an OR.

315
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:43,821
All right. Next up is Kim Jun-wan.

316
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:47,533
Jun-wan is the best surgeon.

317
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:49,327
But he is...

318
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:51,996
He's a jerk.

319
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,669
-How's the ultrasound?
-Yes, it's fully blocked.

320
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:01,213
-It's not bleeding, right?
-Yes. It's fine.

321
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,590
Jae-hak.

322
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:05,301
Why should we be careful with the AV node?

323
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:09,180
Why should we be careful with that?

324
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:14,936
Hey!

325
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,315
Is my surgery that boring?

326
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:21,609
A bit.

327
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:24,904
No. Not at all. It's fun!

328
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:27,573
I'm sorry.

329
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,827
How could you doze off when
the patient is between life and death?

330
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,417
Well, I'm also on the verge of...

331
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:48,594
I'm sorry.

332
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:52,598
Professor Kim, there's no bleeding.
The surgery went well.

333
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:54,767
-We'll wrap up the rest.
-Will you?

334
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,852
Yes. Great surgery, sir.

335
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:00,773
Good job.

336
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:03,776
-Great surgery.
-Great surgery, sir.

337
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:07,780
Don't we have footage of TOF surgery?

338
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,073
Yes, sir.

339
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:11,117
Give him that,
so he can reflect on himself.

340
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:20,126
Dr. Jang, you're drooling right now.

341
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:23,713
Dr. Chu, aren't your cheeks too red?

342
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:25,965
-Is it too much?
-Yes.

343
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:29,844
I applied it because I wanted
to look three or four years younger.

344
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,929
You look 34 years younger.

345
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:33,055
Damn you.

346
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,808
-Next.
-What about Professor Yang Seok-hyeong?

347
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:37,184
-Seok-hyeong.
-Yes.

348
00:17:38,686 --> 00:17:40,104
Don't you know?

349
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,902
<i>-me?
-I...</i>

350
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:49,989
<i>I... Where I live...</i>

351
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:52,033
<i>Our house.</i>

352
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:54,785
-Professor Yang.
<i>-Our house.</i>

353
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:57,997
<i>-Our house.</i>
-Yes, this is Yang Seok-hyeong speaking.

354
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:00,875
Yes.

355
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:05,963
-He's not social.
-He's not social.

356
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,758
<i>One, two, three.</i>

357
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,676
<i>-We won.
-We won.</i>

358
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,970
<i>Don't waste your energy. We have two more.</i>

359
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:15,598
<i>-One, two, three. Two more.
-One, two, three.</i>

360
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,310
<i>-We won, we won again
-We won, we won again</i>

361
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:22,354
<i>-We won, we won again
-We won, we won again</i>

362
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:24,273
<i>-We won, we won again
-We won, we won again</i>

363
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:29,695
<i>I feel bad for the younger ghosts.</i>

364
00:18:31,864 --> 00:18:34,575
<i>-We won, we won again
-We won, we won again</i>

365
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:41,832
Who have I missed?

366
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,585
-Professor Lee Ik-jun.
-Dr. Ahn Jeong-won.

367
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:45,920
Lee Ik-jun, that prick...

368
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:48,714
He was at the top of his class
when he entered med school,

369
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:50,174
and graduated at the top, too.

370
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:51,425
-Really?
-Yes.

371
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,677
Ik-jun had the highest mark
on the medical board exam.

372
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,054
Shouldn't he be the biggest clown instead?

373
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:56,764
That's what I heard too.

374
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:59,141
When he was a med student,
he practically lived at clubs.

375
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,434
But he still got the top.

376
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:03,854
I'm not sure if he's just that smart
or he studied in secret.

377
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:05,689
Anyway, a practicum or exam.

378
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,733
It didn't matter.
He always got the highest grades.

379
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:10,152
But do you know
what this punk doesn't have?

380
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:13,239
-Modesty?
-Sure. he's not modest, either.

381
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:15,658
Perhaps, it's because he got it all.

382
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:18,994
But he doesn't have any
inferiority complex or prejudice.

383
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:21,789
-He's not twisted at heart.
-Right.

384
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:24,333
Do they expect anyone to pay
for a thing like this?

385
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,546
This is such a rip-off. My goodness.

386
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:30,047
Sir.

387
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:35,177
You always eat meals prepared by others,
but you always seem to complain.

388
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,721
You should just eat it.
It's actually good.

389
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:38,889
Okay?

390
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:42,935
Starting now, whenever you complain,
you'll have to pay 10,000 won.

391
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,354
You have to. Okay?

392
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:47,523
Hey, why would I pay 10,000 won?

393
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:50,484
That's too expensive.
This meal probably costs less than that.

394
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:53,654
My gosh. Fine. All right.

395
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:56,907
-That punk.
-He stopped at 40,000 won.

396
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:59,535
-Enjoy your meal.
-My gosh.

397
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,121
-So Ahn Jeong-won is the last one.
-Yes.

398
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,248
Jeong-won doesn't have...

399
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,751
-any desire for material possessions.
-Obviously.

400
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:11,130
His family is super-rich.
Even I wouldn't be materialistic.

401
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:14,133
Yes, I just wired the money.

402
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:15,384
And...

403
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:18,846
once the surgery bill comes out,
I'll cover that, too.

404
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:20,764
He shouldn't worry
and just get the surgery

405
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:23,184
Tell him to focus on getting better.

406
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,978
Okay. I got it.

407
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:30,232
BILLS ARE BEING COUNTED
PLEASE WAIT

408
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:32,818
WITHDRAWAL: 100,000 WON
BALANCE: 305,000 WON

409
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:35,112
-Are you supporting a secret family?
-You startled me.

410
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:36,864
It's our payday. Where's your money?

411
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:39,158
Why did you look at my balance,
you lunatic?

412
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:40,993
Where did the money go? You prick.

413
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:44,163
Where do you think?
It went to a good place.

414
00:20:45,414 --> 00:20:49,501
Hey, by the way, we're not getting
any patients for the VIP Ward these days.

415
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:52,963
Why do you say that? Are you finally
concerned about the hospital now?

416
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:56,467
It's not about the hospital.
It's just my finance.

417
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,510
-Didn't you read the article?
-What article?

418
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:00,763
Congressman Sim Yeong-su
will have a liver transplant.

419
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:03,807
He'll be admitted to the VIP Ward
this afternoon. His surgery is soon.

420
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:05,684
You're right. I forgot about him.

421
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:09,438
Hey, I heard that he's taking up
all four of those expensive VIP rooms.

422
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:11,774
He only needs two rooms
for him and his son.

423
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:14,777
But he didn't want people to talk
about them and keep things private.

424
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,947
-He booked all four of them.
-Really? He's a VIP indeed.

425
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,407
I should buy some juice and visit him.

426
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:23,285
Hey, by the way...
What was his son's name?

427
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,329
-Sim Yeong-ho?
-That's right. Sim Yeong-ho.

428
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,581
Didn't he go clubbing
with Ik-jun all the time?

429
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:29,124
Yes, he's Ik-jun's clubbing bestie.

430
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,418
My gosh, he was such a jerk back then.

431
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:34,088
What a surprise. Who knew
he'd give his liver to his dad?

432
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:35,881
Right? Isn't his son the donor?

433
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:37,216
According to Ik-jun, he's a new man now.

434
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:39,969
Ik-jun met with him last month
for the HLA testing and the consult.

435
00:21:40,052 --> 00:21:41,387
Ik-jun told me he's now softer.

436
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:43,681
I have some time left.
Shall we eat <i>tteokbokki</i>?

437
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:45,015
I have to meet with Seok-hyeong.

438
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:47,309
I have a meeting with him
for a gastroschisis patient.

439
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,144
Hey, don't bring it up
in front of Seok-hyeong.

440
00:21:49,228 --> 00:21:52,273
Don't talk about Sim Yeong-su.
He'll lose it again.

441
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:54,483
Okay, I heard you.

442
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:06,954
SEXUAL PREDATOR CONGRESSMAN SIM YEONG-SU
GETS A LIVER TRANSPLANT

443
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:08,497
HE WAS ADMITTED TO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

444
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:15,629
HE WAS FINED FOR ASSAULTING A CADDIE
AT A GOLF COURSE LAST MONTH

445
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:20,301
MOM

446
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:22,678
Hi, Mom.

447
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:25,848
Yes. Did you have your lunch?

448
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:27,933
What did you eat?

449
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:32,187
Mom, I got paid today.
What should I do with this?

450
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:34,523
What do I do? Tell me.

451
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:41,989
By the way, did Professor Ahn Jeong-won
date anyone when he was a med student?

452
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:42,990
Jeong-won?

453
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:44,867
Well...

454
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:50,080
By the way,
you guys seem to have a lot of time.

455
00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:52,416
When I was your age...

456
00:22:58,922 --> 00:23:01,133
Did you study
about the patient's condition?

457
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:04,303
Yes. It's called gastroschi...

458
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:07,389
It's a gastroschisis.
It means a lack of an abdominal wall.

459
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:08,557
Can you elaborate?

460
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,893
When a baby has its abdominal wall
undeveloped,

461
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:12,936
its intestines come out of the body.

462
00:23:13,187 --> 00:23:15,481
When did the patient get diagnosed
with the condition?

463
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,485
The mother was diagnosed with
gastroschisis 20 weeks into her pregnancy.

464
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:21,362
And she's 36 weeks into her pregnancy now.

465
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:22,821
You seem to know better than me.

466
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,824
Does it mean the baby is likely to die?

467
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:28,952
No. This is a rare condition,
but we get a few patients like her.

468
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:30,954
And usually, the babies have surgery
as soon as they are born.

469
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:32,122
They can be healthy again.

470
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:34,917
Because they must get the surgery
right after they are born,

471
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,336
it's better to consult
a pediatric surgeon in advance.

472
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:40,798
So there will be a meeting
with the surgical professor today.

473
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:42,633
Is it okay for us to join?

474
00:23:42,716 --> 00:23:45,386
Those meetings in dramas
seem really serious.

475
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:51,558
Why not? Can't you just do the surgery?
Let's go with the C-section. Please?

476
00:23:51,642 --> 00:23:53,477
It's not something you can decide.

477
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:55,813
That's what the mother wants.

478
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:03,737
Tell him.

479
00:24:04,863 --> 00:24:07,032
I examined the mother.
Her pelvis is in good shape.

480
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:09,701
And the baby's head
is at around the pelvis, too.

481
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,620
So we think
the vaginal delivery will be easier.

482
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:14,248
It means she'll give birth naturally.

483
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,625
I'm glad to hear that.

484
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:18,919
The baby isn't that small, right?

485
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,296
No. The baby isn't too small.

486
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:25,008
Actually, in cases like this,
some people are concerned

487
00:24:25,092 --> 00:24:28,387
that a vaginal delivery might increase
the chance of infections in babies.

488
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:33,517
But I can't guarantee that a C-section
will lower that chance, either.

489
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:38,147
More than anything, the mother strongly
wants to have the vaginal delivery.

490
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:40,149
Okay.

491
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:44,945
But we don't know
when the baby will come out.

492
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:47,531
What if I'm in the middle of surgery
when the baby comes out?

493
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:48,657
You're right.

494
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:53,871
That's why I'll observe her until Week 38
and try inducing labor.

495
00:24:55,664 --> 00:24:58,417
You punk. Why didn't you say so?

496
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:01,295
Don't laugh.

497
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:04,214
Hey, think about it. The mother
would also want her pediatric surgeon

498
00:25:04,298 --> 00:25:06,633
to do the surgery on her baby.

499
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:09,261
She agreed to the inducing labor
over a C-section.

500
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:13,307
With labor induction, we can usually
deliver the baby on the day we want.

501
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:17,769
I'm glad to hear that. Then, pick a day
when I don't have outpatients.

502
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:18,979
Sure.

503
00:25:19,062 --> 00:25:22,191
It's been 36 weeks and 2 days as of today.

504
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:24,359
I'll make it two weeks from today.

505
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:27,446
So should we wrap up the meeting?

506
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:28,947
Yes.

507
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:31,366
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

508
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:34,119
I don't have any plans.
Do you want to get drinks?

509
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:35,412
Sure.

510
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,208
What about other guys?
What's Ik-jun up to?

511
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,544
Congressman Sim was admitted today,
so he'll have to stay with the patient.

512
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,718
Is his son the donor?

513
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:51,303
Yes.

514
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:55,807
I bet he's putting on a show.

515
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:10,322
<i>Let's eat first. The meal boxes
just arrived. They are warm.</i>

516
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:11,240
<i>-Okay.
-Okay.</i>

517
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,744
Here.

518
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:19,289
All the beds are full today.
Eat when you can.

519
00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:20,457
Thank you.

520
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,168
Jo Je-yeong in Room 6103.

521
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:25,212
He had a TACE in 2016.

522
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:27,005
Yes, but there were some lesions left.

523
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:29,258
So he got the RFA and TACE.

524
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:30,467
What's TACE?

525
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:33,220
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.

526
00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:34,805
Chemoembolization in hepatic arteries.

527
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:36,682
"Chemoembolization..."

528
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:41,603
-Yes?
<i>-This is Room 6110.</i>

529
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,814
<i>The patient is suddenly throwing up.
Please come now.</i>

530
00:26:44,106 --> 00:26:46,149
Room 6110? Okay. I'm on my way.

531
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:47,859
-Room 6110.
-Okay.

532
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:51,905
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

533
00:26:52,072 --> 00:26:54,741
My husband can't breathe.

534
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:57,494
He's been having a hard time breathing
for a while. Please come now.

535
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:58,829
-Go.
-Okay.

536
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:09,631
Nurse, my bed is broken.

537
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:11,967
I keep pressing the remote,
but it won't come up.

538
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,552
I need to have my dinner.

539
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:16,263
We can't even have our dinner right now.
Please help.

540
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:18,015
I'm not the one...

541
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,519
Hold on. Let me go with you.

542
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:28,275
Where did he go?

543
00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:33,614
Which room was he in?

544
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:40,704
Su-bin.

545
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:44,708
Can you tell me if Congressman Sim's son,
Sim Yeong-ho,

546
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,502
is in VIP Room Two or Three?

547
00:27:47,586 --> 00:27:50,130
He's in Room Two,
but you can't see him even if you go now.

548
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:52,382
-Why not?
-He's quite sensitive.

549
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:54,593
Only a designated nurse can see him.

550
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:57,346
Even Professor Gwon Sun-jeong
got to see him only once.

551
00:27:57,804 --> 00:27:59,848
Since he's the donor,
he doesn't have to do a lot.

552
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:01,391
But he's very cranky.

553
00:28:01,475 --> 00:28:02,392
What?

554
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:04,770
He's not like that.

555
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:08,315
His son...

556
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:11,276
They say
that his son doesn't want to do it,

557
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,779
but he's forced to donate
to look like a good son.

558
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:15,614
And they say

559
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:19,284
some private security guards are
surveilling him in case he runs away.

560
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:21,328
-What are you looking for anyway?
-What?

561
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,667
A guardian came to me
because of a broken bed.

562
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,211
-But I don't know which room he's in.
-Oh, that? I fixed that.

563
00:28:31,046 --> 00:28:32,589
-When?
-A while ago.

564
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:33,965
How?

565
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:36,259
It wasn't plugged in properly.

566
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:41,556
You didn't eat yet, right?

567
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:45,352
Jeez. You should go and eat first.

568
00:28:45,852 --> 00:28:48,772
I'll sit here and take care
of things here.

569
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:51,274
No, you should go home.
Your son must be waiting.

570
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:53,735
Tomorrow is the weekend.
I'll play with him then.

571
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,570
This feels nice. How nice.

572
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,949
What should I watch?

573
00:28:59,032 --> 00:29:01,076
You really look like a single father now.

574
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,661
Right.

575
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:04,871
Before, I lived the life
of a single father,

576
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:05,789
but it's even true on paper, too.

577
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:08,375
I'm really a single father now.

578
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:09,960
Raising is a kid hard, isn't it?

579
00:29:10,043 --> 00:29:11,962
Being a doctor must be hard enough.

580
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:15,340
It's hard. But my son...

581
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:20,721
But I love my son to pieces.

582
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,022
Father, lift me, please.

583
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:34,401
What should we get?

584
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:37,195
You get ham and cheese.

585
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,989
So ham and cheese for me. What about you?

586
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,741
I'll get Avoholic.

587
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:44,745
You'll get Avoholic. And I'm U-ju-holic.

588
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:46,913
Then, I'm Dad-holic.

589
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:53,795
Are you a genius? Did I make a genius?

590
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:56,423
Give me a kiss.

591
00:30:02,721 --> 00:30:04,973
-Have you been here before?
-Yes.

592
00:30:05,557 --> 00:30:08,143
-Who did you come with?
-With Jang Mo-ne. My girlfriend.

593
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:14,065
-Your girlfriend's name is Mo-ne?
-Yes.

594
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:16,943
Was it just the two of you?

595
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:20,572
No, we came here with Mo-ne's mom.

596
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:22,991
I see. Is that so?

597
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:31,750
-U-ju.
-Yes?

598
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:34,669
If you miss your mom,

599
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:37,172
tell me anytime.

600
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:41,218
You say the word,
and I'll take you to her right away.

601
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,929
No, I'll tell her to come to you. Okay?

602
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,269
If she doesn't miss me,
I don't miss her, either.

603
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:56,149
What do you mean she doesn't miss you?

604
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:58,777
You're wrong. She misses you a lot.

605
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,738
She called me yesterday
and asked how you were doing.

606
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:03,406
She calls me every day.

607
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,911
I just need you, Dad.

608
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:10,413
You're my favorite person
in the entire universe.

609
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:19,339
Dad, are you not going to eat that?

610
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:24,761
I'm going to.

611
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:30,308
Father.

612
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:34,771
Can you buy me one more sandwich, please?

613
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,240
Father, you have a visitor.

614
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:48,118
Oh, him? It's my younger brother.
He said he'd come see me.

615
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:50,328
-I don't think it's him.
-What?

616
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:52,789
He's handsome.

617
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:54,249
I see.

618
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:05,552
Were you playing baseball?

619
00:32:06,136 --> 00:32:07,762
No. I came from home.

620
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:10,849
Do you not have anyone
to spend your weekend with?

621
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,310
I'll go see Mom later.

622
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:16,688
You are not going on a date? You punk.

623
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:19,816
You're wasting your good days.

624
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,736
What are you talking about?
Why would I go on a date?

625
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:25,030
I'm not interested.

626
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,868
By the way,
I still haven't gotten an answer yet.

627
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,288
I sent the recommendation letter
almost two months ago.

628
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:35,957
You'll get it soon. Just wait.

629
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,375
Oh, that reminds me.

630
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:39,085
Did you...

631
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:41,254
Did you tell Mom?

632
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:46,092
I'm planning to tell her today.

633
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:48,178
She'll pass out today.

634
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:50,263
I'm sure she'll understand.

635
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:52,057
What?

636
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,728
She encouraged all of you
when you were called by God.

637
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,898
I believe in Mom.

638
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:03,151
She's not like the others.

639
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:05,904
What?

640
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:08,907
Mom!

641
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,200
Mom!

642
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:12,869
Please hear me out.

643
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:14,371
Mom!

644
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:38,436
Mom.

645
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:43,858
I'm fine.

646
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:47,612
There are stairs all the way down.
Get on my back now.

647
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:56,287
All right. Hold on tight.

648
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:06,256
Mom, should we have
spicy noodles for dinner tonight?

649
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:08,550
Call Song-hwa.

650
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:09,926
Ask her to come for dinner.

651
00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:12,721
I really like her.

652
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:14,848
She's calm and kind.

653
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,599
Why would she join us for dinner?

654
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:18,476
I told you she's just a friend.

655
00:34:18,935 --> 00:34:20,937
Besides, she's not calm at all.

656
00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:23,356
She is a wild one.

657
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:27,986
"REJOICE IN THE LORD"
CHURCH MEMBER CHAE SONG-HWA

658
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:13,448
I didn't know "Rejoice in the Lord"
was such a fun song.

659
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:16,576
The professor is doing a good job with it.

660
00:35:17,243 --> 00:35:19,788
There comes the highlight.

661
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:04,707
My dear U-ju. I wonder
where you get your good looks from.

662
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,960
-Lee Ik-jun.
-My gosh.

663
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:09,838
The micro-dust level is high today.
Will there be outdoor classes?

664
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,340
Okay. If you go outside this afternoon,

665
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:15,635
use the mask I put in the front pocket
of U-ju's backpack.

666
00:36:15,718 --> 00:36:18,471
And if you have any sunscreen,
please gently apply it on his face.

667
00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:19,806
Okay.

668
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,934
-Dad.
-I'll see you after work.

669
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:34,028
That startled me. Darn it.

670
00:36:39,826 --> 00:36:40,952
Goodness.

671
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:43,830
My gosh, you're the queen of parking.

672
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:48,293
If I have to quit,
I'll work as a chauffeur.

673
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:54,924
Someone, park my car, please.

674
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:02,682
My gosh.

675
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:07,062
My gosh.

676
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:09,690
My gosh. Hello. Are you back for good?

677
00:37:09,773 --> 00:37:10,857
Goodness.

678
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:12,943
She came back to work today.

679
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,404
-She already delivered a baby.
-I see.

680
00:37:15,696 --> 00:37:18,156
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

681
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:20,325
We heard she's the goddess of delivery.

682
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:23,036
You bet she is.
She's been working for 15 years

683
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,414
as a nurse in the delivery room.

684
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:27,958
She had to deliver her own baby,
so she was on leave.

685
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:31,545
As long as we have her,
we're not needed here. We can all go home.

686
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:34,089
You're just as I remember.
You haven't changed at all.

687
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:35,590
My gosh, people shouldn't change.

688
00:37:35,674 --> 00:37:38,385
But we got new professors
while you were away.

689
00:37:38,468 --> 00:37:41,179
Just one. A young doctor who seems sullen.

690
00:37:41,263 --> 00:37:43,849
-I've never met him before.
-You mean Professor Yang Seok-hyeong.

691
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:47,978
He's the only one I haven't met.
Others are all the same.

692
00:37:48,562 --> 00:37:50,814
We have a delivery scheduled
for a baby with anencephaly.

693
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:51,940
Whose case is that?

694
00:37:52,024 --> 00:37:53,567
Mine. I'm assisting the delivery.

695
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:54,985
Do a good job.

696
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:57,237
What's anencephaly?

697
00:37:58,488 --> 00:37:59,406
A baby without a brain.

698
00:38:02,117 --> 00:38:04,911
We suspected the baby had anencephaly
during an ultrasound at 13 weeks.

699
00:38:04,995 --> 00:38:07,330
We're not allowed to induce abortion.

700
00:38:07,414 --> 00:38:09,875
And the mother wanted
to give birth anyway.

701
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,961
She's now 32 weeks pregnant.
Her water broke at dawn.

702
00:38:13,045 --> 00:38:14,671
And she's having contractions now.

703
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:18,050
I think the baby will come out
this afternoon.

704
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:23,305
The baby can only live for a few hours
or several days, the most.

705
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,516
That's enough. The rest is for us
to worry about and prepare for.

706
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:29,519
Professor Yang will take the patient?

707
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,897
Actually, he wanted to see me.

708
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,859
Who's in my anencephaly case today?

709
00:38:35,942 --> 00:38:38,361
-I'm assisting you.
-I see.

710
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:40,447
Min-ha, I need to talk to you then.

711
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,866
Me? Okay. Sure.

712
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:46,369
You want me to cover the mouth?

713
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:48,789
Don't block the nose or the airway.

714
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:52,167
Just cover the mouth gently,
so we don't hear the baby cry.

715
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:55,545
Eun-won can't
because she has to assist me.

716
00:38:56,505 --> 00:38:58,131
So, you come in
and cover the baby's mouth.

717
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,426
Do it as soon as the baby's born.

718
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:03,178
Understood?

719
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:13,522
The X-ray shows no problem.

720
00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:15,774
He also has no fever.
Maybe I called you for no reason.

721
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:17,609
I even called you last night.

722
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:20,612
She's just worried since
it hasn't been long since his surgery.

723
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:22,155
We'll just have to deal with it.

724
00:39:23,156 --> 00:39:24,866
Why did Jin-yong return?
What's the matter?

725
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,702
He's fine now. I'm sorry, Professor.

726
00:39:27,786 --> 00:39:29,579
Jin-yong kept throwing up last night

727
00:39:29,663 --> 00:39:31,915
so he was brought to the ER.
But he's okay now.

728
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:34,543
Then... Is there any other problem?

729
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:36,795
What about his fever
and abdominal distention?

730
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:38,839
His fever broke
after I gave him a fever reducer.

731
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:40,298
He's better after vomiting once.

732
00:39:40,382 --> 00:39:42,551
He has no other problems
and we explained everything.

733
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:45,762
But his mother insisted
on seeing you, so...

734
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:46,972
I'm sorry.

735
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:48,974
No, it's okay.

736
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,563
Dr. Bae, a patient with a fracture
came in. You should come.

737
00:39:54,646 --> 00:39:55,647
Sure.

738
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:57,274
Let's see.

739
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:02,946
Ma'am, his intestine is fine,
so you don't have to worry too much.

740
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:07,951
Jin-yong, you think
you can eat something now?

741
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:10,996
Oh, my. You look haggard.
Your cheeks are hollow.

742
00:40:12,038 --> 00:40:14,624
It hurts, doesn't it? I'm sorry.

743
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:16,710
What happened?

744
00:40:16,793 --> 00:40:19,004
He was playing on a dining table
and suddenly fell.

745
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,464
Since then, he hasn't been able
to move his arm.

746
00:40:21,548 --> 00:40:23,884
He fell on his right side.

747
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,844
I think he broke his arm.

748
00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:28,180
Please do something. Please.

749
00:40:29,181 --> 00:40:31,683
How do you feel
when I press here and here?

750
00:40:32,017 --> 00:40:33,310
Do they feel the same?

751
00:40:33,894 --> 00:40:35,353
Is your head okay?

752
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:37,606
Does it hurt here too?

753
00:40:38,607 --> 00:40:40,150
Take a deep breath.

754
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:42,569
Does it hurt when you breathe?

755
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:46,615
I think we should X-ray his chest too.

756
00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:50,243
Did he fall on his arm?

757
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:53,288
Didn't he hit his chest hard on something?

758
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,665
-Okay.
-I'm not sure.

759
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:59,920
But I heard a really loud sound
when he fell from the table.

760
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:02,130
He fell really hard on his right side.

761
00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:06,801
I think his arm is broken,
and there must be a chest problem too.

762
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:08,386
So we should X-ray him first.

763
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:13,475
But I heard...
X-rays are bad for children.

764
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:15,769
Is it really necessary?

765
00:41:15,852 --> 00:41:17,646
It's okay
since the radiation is very little.

766
00:41:17,729 --> 00:41:20,315
I see... All right, then.

767
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:23,401
Goodness, Doctor. Whatever you do,

768
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:25,487
please hurry and stop his pain.

769
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,197
I will. Don't worry.

770
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,991
Let's the X-ray done.
And give him some painkiller.

771
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:31,034
Yes.

772
00:41:35,497 --> 00:41:38,541
Professor, they say the Kasai's
operation's ready. You should go.

773
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,542
Okay.

774
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:43,880
You haven't received an enema, right?

775
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,258
He'll get it later this evening.

776
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:49,302
That's all he needs to do
before surgery, right?

777
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:52,931
Why are there so many things to do
for preparation?

778
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:55,016
He'll be exhausted
even before the surgery.

779
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:58,103
A transplant recipient
usually has a lot to prepare.

780
00:41:58,186 --> 00:41:59,688
The surgery takes a long time as well.

781
00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:03,525
So... Did you say it'll take
about ten hours?

782
00:42:04,484 --> 00:42:07,153
We'll only know for sure
after the surgery begins.

783
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:10,448
But you're right.
It usually takes nine to ten hours.

784
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:14,619
But as for your son,

785
00:42:14,703 --> 00:42:17,455
if I take out the time for
anesthetizing and closing his chest,

786
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,457
the surgery will take only
about four hours. So it's better.

787
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:22,252
He won't have any side effects
after his surgery, right?

788
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:26,673
I mean, he's getting a liver transplant
to get better after all.

789
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:28,258
Well...

790
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:31,303
It's not that
he's getting it to get better.

791
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:34,848
The liver transplant is the only way
for him to live.

792
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:37,642
Your son is doing a great thing.

793
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:41,813
You should know that not everyone does it
for their family or parents.

794
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:44,941
Not doing it is also understandable.

795
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:45,859
I see...

796
00:42:46,985 --> 00:42:48,987
We took an x-ray because of your cough.

797
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,031
-How does it look?
-It looked fine.

798
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:53,158
Then it's all good.

799
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:54,659
See you tomorrow.

800
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:57,078
Okay. Have a good rest today, Professor.

801
00:42:57,162 --> 00:42:59,664
Don't drink tonight,
and just go home and rest, okay?

802
00:42:59,748 --> 00:43:01,207
Yes, ma'am.

803
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,294
Yes. He really told me
to cover the baby's mouth first.

804
00:43:04,627 --> 00:43:07,589
Clearly, he doesn't even
want to hear the baby crying.

805
00:43:07,672 --> 00:43:10,675
I'm telling you, he's a total psycho.

806
00:43:13,178 --> 00:43:14,554
Did he really say that?

807
00:43:14,637 --> 00:43:16,097
Did Dr. Yang Seok-hyeong say that?

808
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:18,725
He told me that just a while ago.

809
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:23,897
I didn't think he was that kind of doctor.
He has a different side.

810
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,192
What do you mean?
He does look like that type of doctor.

811
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:30,403
He has no consideration
or affection for pregnant women.

812
00:43:30,487 --> 00:43:32,947
He's a simple, ignorant,
and selfish loner.

813
00:43:33,031 --> 00:43:35,116
He's exactly that kind of doctor.

814
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:39,871
Dr. Chu, how long have you been
a resident?

815
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:42,165
It's my second year.

816
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:43,833
I see...

817
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:46,544
Listen carefully.

818
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:52,801
<i>The patient with gastroschisis
went into labor and is in the ER now.</i>

819
00:43:52,884 --> 00:43:54,219
<i>Hurry up, Professor.</i>

820
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:02,143
DELIVERY ROOM
RESTRICTIONS FOR VISITORS

821
00:44:07,816 --> 00:44:09,818
I think it's going too fast.

822
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:11,820
The interval is too short.

823
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:14,781
Eun-won, he's here.

824
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:17,283
Jo Mi-hyeon, a primi mother
at 37 weeks pregnant.

825
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:19,869
We planned to induce labor next week,

826
00:44:19,953 --> 00:44:21,162
but she has labor pain now.

827
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:23,331
Her husband's pretty shaken up.

828
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:25,917
It's okay. You don't have to worry.

829
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:28,753
The cervix is dilated to 3cm,

830
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:30,922
and she received an epidural just now.

831
00:44:32,841 --> 00:44:35,552
VIP ROOM 2

832
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:38,972
BED REST!
VISITORS ARE RESTRICTED

833
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:54,446
I'm worried.

834
00:44:55,613 --> 00:44:57,240
He's mentally unstable.

835
00:44:57,824 --> 00:44:59,200
He refused all the visitors.

836
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:01,744
He took a blood test and an X-ray, right?

837
00:45:01,828 --> 00:45:03,037
Yes, of course.

838
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:06,666
But since then,
he hasn't come out of the room.

839
00:45:06,749 --> 00:45:09,002
He seemed fine
when I talked to him last time.

840
00:45:10,503 --> 00:45:13,381
You don't think he'd run away, do you?

841
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:16,426
I don't think so.

842
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:24,851
It's 3cm, so we still have some time.

843
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:26,728
-You called the Pediatrics, right?
-Yes.

844
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:28,062
What about Pediatric Surgery?

845
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:30,857
You haven't called Jeong-won yet, right?
We still have some time.

846
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,858
No, not yet.

847
00:45:31,941 --> 00:45:33,985
I talked with their chief doctor
on the phone.

848
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:37,655
Dr. Ahn's surgery that started
this morning has just finished.

849
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:39,199
He hasn't eaten anything all day,

850
00:45:39,282 --> 00:45:40,825
so he'll come after eating something.

851
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:42,869
That's good. I'll be in my office then.

852
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:48,082
I heard it's still 3cm.

853
00:45:48,166 --> 00:45:49,042
Yes.

854
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:51,336
Then she still has a long way to go.

855
00:45:52,212 --> 00:45:54,422
Don't tell me you already called PS?

856
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:56,341
Of course not.
I'm a second-year now, you know.

857
00:45:56,424 --> 00:45:58,009
I know that much.

858
00:45:59,677 --> 00:46:00,845
Hello?

859
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:03,139
This is bad.

860
00:46:04,432 --> 00:46:05,600
What's going on?

861
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:07,018
The cervix is fully dilated.

862
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:13,191
RESTRICTED AREA

863
00:46:22,492 --> 00:46:24,536
It's okay.
Take your time before coming in.

864
00:46:24,702 --> 00:46:25,620
Yes, sir.

865
00:46:27,455 --> 00:46:30,250
What do I do? I told PS they could go eat.

866
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,835
What should I tell them?

867
00:46:33,753 --> 00:46:35,171
You don't have to call them.

868
00:46:35,672 --> 00:46:36,506
Pardon?

869
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,424
He's already in there.

870
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:41,719
Dr. Ahn came ten minutes ago
and is now in the delivery room.

871
00:46:42,512 --> 00:46:43,638
Has he eaten already?

872
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:45,640
"Is eating important?
We are delivering a baby."

873
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,936
That's what Dr. Ahn said.

874
00:46:51,187 --> 00:46:54,691
He said he should be on standby
since Dr. Yang's delivering the baby.

875
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:30,768
Jeong-won.

876
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:35,273
-Thanks.
-Sure.

877
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:47,869
-Yes?
-<i>Professor, it's ready.</i>

878
00:47:47,952 --> 00:47:48,953
Okay.

879
00:47:52,457 --> 00:47:53,458
What about Jeong-won?

880
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:55,752
He's been doing surgeries
since this morning.

881
00:47:56,628 --> 00:47:58,296
-Seok-hyeong, too?
-Yes.

882
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,506
He had an emergency delivery

883
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,966
and has an anencephaly case soon,

884
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,009
so he can't eat now.

885
00:48:03,092 --> 00:48:04,010
What was it again?

886
00:48:04,469 --> 00:48:05,637
A baby without a brain?

887
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,846
You're right..

888
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:08,640
Oh, dear.

889
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:16,981
Okay. Please take a long breath.

890
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:19,359
Good. You're doing a good job.

891
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,737
It's almost done. Just a bit more.

892
00:48:23,446 --> 00:48:26,282
Good. You're doing a good job, ma'am.

893
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:29,827
Okay, with all your might,
push one last time.

894
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:32,163
Good. One more time.

895
00:48:34,332 --> 00:48:35,750
One more.

896
00:48:36,918 --> 00:48:37,835
More.

897
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:39,754
More.

898
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:43,800
Hang in there. You're doing a good job.

899
00:48:46,302 --> 00:48:49,263
Good. The baby has come out.

900
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:24,966
You did a good job.

901
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,176
You've really done well.

902
00:49:29,137 --> 00:49:30,138
Doctor...

903
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:34,350
I feel...

904
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:36,686
so sorry for my baby.

905
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,188
My baby...

906
00:49:42,525 --> 00:49:43,901
Ma'am,

907
00:49:44,402 --> 00:49:46,654
You didn't give up on the baby
until the end.

908
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,199
That alone is amazing.

909
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:55,037
You really did your best, ma'am.

910
00:50:01,169 --> 00:50:04,422
You've done a great job.

911
00:50:18,686 --> 00:50:21,689
Dr. Chu, how long have you been
a resident?

912
00:50:22,899 --> 00:50:23,983
It's my second year.

913
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:26,110
Listen carefully.

914
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:29,947
I've been worried about that mother
for a while,

915
00:50:30,031 --> 00:50:31,949
so I went to see her a little while ago.

916
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:35,995
I asked her if she wants to see the baby
when it's born.

917
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:39,415
I told her I can show her if she wants to.

918
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,752
She thought it over and told me that

919
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:45,338
she doesn't want to

920
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:50,134
because if she sees the baby,
it might be too hard for her.

921
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:55,807
She hasn't gotten an abortion until now.

922
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,225
That alone is great.

923
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:02,146
But when I was coming out of the room,

924
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:05,233
I saw Dr. Yang standing outside the door.

925
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:07,819
He came to ask me a favor.

926
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:11,447
He said, "When the baby's born later,

927
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:15,326
if it starts crying,

928
00:51:17,036 --> 00:51:19,497
could you play really loud music?

929
00:51:20,665 --> 00:51:23,292
I asked another person a different thing,

930
00:51:23,376 --> 00:51:26,087
but I'm asking you too just in case."

931
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:29,507
Yes.

932
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:31,759
Come further inside.

933
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,261
Yes.

934
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:35,847
<i>I understood what he meant right away.</i>

935
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:39,058
But it was so unlike him,

936
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:40,685
so I asked him as if I didn't get it.

937
00:51:40,768 --> 00:51:42,395
"Why should I play loud music?"

938
00:51:44,105 --> 00:51:46,732
He said,
"The mother already knows about it

939
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:48,818
and has prepared herself.

940
00:51:49,527 --> 00:51:53,239
But still, if she hears the cry

941
00:51:53,823 --> 00:51:55,575
when the baby is born,

942
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,870
she'll be traumatized for life."

943
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:06,460
Mom.

944
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:09,714
Did you see the doctor?

945
00:52:09,797 --> 00:52:11,507
I told them to take good care of you.

946
00:52:11,591 --> 00:52:13,384
Yes, it went well.

947
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:14,886
They said everything's fine.

948
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:17,138
It's just that my legs feel weak.

949
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,599
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Sure.

950
00:52:19,682 --> 00:52:22,935
He said he didn't want
to make her traumatized

951
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:25,187
after all she's been through.

952
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:28,774
The mother is aware of everything
about the baby

953
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:30,651
and has prepared herself.

954
00:52:31,277 --> 00:52:35,031
But he thinks
she'll be traumatized for life.

955
00:52:35,698 --> 00:52:36,699
Oh, my.

956
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,536
He looks quite dull,

957
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,663
so I didn't think he'd care about
small things.

958
00:52:42,747 --> 00:52:44,165
That was unexpected.

959
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,709
You know, it's not easy
to be thoughtful like that.

960
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:51,130
Then he should've told me
the reason first.

961
00:52:51,213 --> 00:52:52,924
Does he really have to say it out loud?

962
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:55,468
You should've gotten it right away.

963
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:57,929
Oh, no...

964
00:53:02,642 --> 00:53:04,852
You even eat green onion kimchi now?

965
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:06,270
You didn't like it before.

966
00:53:06,354 --> 00:53:07,480
I suddenly like it.

967
00:53:08,314 --> 00:53:11,108
I crave cold bean soup noodles these days.

968
00:53:11,192 --> 00:53:12,485
I never liked it before.

969
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:15,529
-Our taste in food changes as we grow old.
-Yes, but not gradually.

970
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:17,573
It changes overnight. All of a sudden.

971
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:19,825
I suddenly became allergic to cats.

972
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:21,869
I was never allergic to anything.

973
00:53:21,953 --> 00:53:24,705
I suddenly developed presbyopia
on Christmas morning last year.

974
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:26,332
My girlfriend asked me if I liked

975
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,668
something on her phone,
but I couldn't see it at all.

976
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:29,877
I just said I liked it.

977
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:33,047
Two days ago, I went to the park with U-ju

978
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:35,716
and took 6,000 photos of flowers.

979
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:37,843
I'm serious. I took 6,000 photos.

980
00:53:37,927 --> 00:53:40,054
Don't laugh.
I took them without realizing it.

981
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:41,722
And U-ju was...

982
00:53:41,806 --> 00:53:43,766
They were selling bean soup there.

983
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:47,603
So U-ju was eating it, and I was suddenly
immersed in those flowers.

984
00:53:47,687 --> 00:53:49,772
-I'll show you.
-No, thanks.

985
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:51,565
-Look at them.
-I'm okay.

986
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:54,443
Well, Seok-hyeong's worse.

987
00:53:54,527 --> 00:53:57,113
-Of course. He's the worst.
-He's the worst.

988
00:53:57,405 --> 00:54:00,574
He never talked with his mom,
but now he's a mama's boy.

989
00:54:00,658 --> 00:54:03,202
He was really brusque with his mom.

990
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:05,079
He talked behind her back a lot,

991
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,415
saying she was so spiteful and scary.

992
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:10,376
You never know how people turn out.

993
00:54:10,543 --> 00:54:12,461
Anyone would be like that

994
00:54:12,837 --> 00:54:14,296
after going through all of that at once.

995
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:18,592
He was close to his little sister,
but she suddenly died.

996
00:54:19,427 --> 00:54:21,262
And his father had an affair
with a young woman,

997
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:22,847
His mom then had a stroke.

998
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:27,810
Gosh... I think only Seok-hyeong
can endure all that.

999
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:28,894
If it were me...

1000
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:30,980
How's his mom doing these days?

1001
00:54:31,063 --> 00:54:33,274
I heard she'd come here today.
Didn't she go to you?

1002
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:34,900
She came to see a neurologist today.

1003
00:54:34,984 --> 00:54:36,944
She is a lot better.
She can go out by herself now.

1004
00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:41,907
So he was going to see his mom
if he has time after the delivery.

1005
00:54:42,408 --> 00:54:43,993
I wonder if he met her.

1006
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:47,246
I'm okay.

1007
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:55,838
Excuse me.

1008
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,339
I'm sorry, but...

1009
00:54:57,423 --> 00:55:00,301
The woman who just went in is my mother.

1010
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:02,553
She has trouble moving around
after having surgery.

1011
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,680
-I see.
-I'm sorry, but...

1012
00:55:04,764 --> 00:55:07,141
I'm just worried
that she might collapse in there.

1013
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:11,228
If it's not too much trouble for you,
could you keep an eye on her?

1014
00:55:11,312 --> 00:55:14,774
If you could just watch her
once or twice if she's okay...

1015
00:55:15,316 --> 00:55:16,817
I'd appreciate it. I'm sorry.

1016
00:55:16,901 --> 00:55:19,403
No, don't be. I'll go watch her now.

1017
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:31,791
<i>Seok-hyeong's father
is beyond our imagination.</i>

1018
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:33,209
<i>He doesn't deserve to be a father.</i>

1019
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:35,461
Even Seok-hyeong doesn't call him
his father anymore.

1020
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:38,130
They didn't get a divorce yet, right?

1021
00:55:38,214 --> 00:55:41,425
Right. His mom's absolutely against it.

1022
00:55:41,926 --> 00:55:43,803
She'll never do it.

1023
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:45,888
You should go in now. I know you're busy.

1024
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:47,348
I will after I see you get a cab.

1025
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:48,766
I know how to get a cab.

1026
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:51,560
I called a cab.
I'll go back after you get in.

1027
00:55:52,144 --> 00:55:54,063
What about Song-hwa? Is she busy?

1028
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:55,397
Why don't you call her?

1029
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:59,110
Tell her to come down and get some coffee.

1030
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,861
Mom, we're really just friends.

1031
00:56:00,945 --> 00:56:03,447
There's nothing going on between us,
so stop that.

1032
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:04,782
I didn't say anything.

1033
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:08,828
I just want to see her
since I'm at the hospital.

1034
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:10,996
Why are you getting so worked up?

1035
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,832
Is there really something going on?

1036
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,250
The cab's here. You should go.

1037
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:21,590
-Bye, mom.
-Bye.

1038
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:28,722
<i>Seok-hyeong, come home right away.</i>

1039
00:56:28,973 --> 00:56:30,224
<i>What's the matter, Aunt?</i>

1040
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:32,143
<i>Ji-eun is dead...</i>

1041
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:35,479
<i>-What?
-They said she accidentally fell and died.</i>

1042
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:37,481
<i>How did something like this happen?</i>

1043
00:56:37,565 --> 00:56:38,732
<i>You should hurry.</i>

1044
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:42,111
<i>Take the earliest flight
and come here as soon as possible.</i>

1045
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:45,114
<i>Your mom collapsed
and was taken away in an ambulance.</i>

1046
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:48,784
<i>And your father went for hiking
with his new employees,</i>

1047
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:50,744
<i>so he can come tomorrow night.</i>

1048
00:56:50,828 --> 00:56:53,205
<i>So you should hurry, okay?</i>

1049
00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:56,792
<i>How could something like this happen?</i>

1050
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:21,108
Father.

1051
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:39,543
JANUARY 2019

1052
00:57:39,627 --> 00:57:41,003
Can he call himself human?

1053
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:44,798
What about your mom?
Have you told her about this?

1054
00:57:45,424 --> 00:57:46,842
I will tell her tonight.

1055
00:57:46,926 --> 00:57:48,052
Are you sure about this?

1056
00:57:51,055 --> 00:57:52,640
He's not even human.

1057
00:57:53,057 --> 00:57:54,725
He really isn't.

1058
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:58,020
-Do you want me to tell her?
-No, I will.

1059
00:57:58,229 --> 00:58:00,856
It's drizzling. It'll pour soon.

1060
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,442
Come inside. Let's talk inside.

1061
00:58:08,364 --> 00:58:09,782
I knew.

1062
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:14,036
I've known all along that he's having...

1063
00:58:14,662 --> 00:58:15,829
an affair.

1064
00:58:15,913 --> 00:58:19,166
But... But then, mom.

1065
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:21,460
Why didn't you do anything?

1066
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:23,337
I tried everything.

1067
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:25,714
I went to him and cursed him.

1068
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:27,633
I even pulled his hair.

1069
00:58:28,384 --> 00:58:29,635
But...

1070
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:32,012
he said we should get a divorce.

1071
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:35,182
He said he only wants a divorce.

1072
00:58:35,808 --> 00:58:38,811
Then he'd give me this house
and all his buildings.

1073
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:41,647
He begged me for a divorce.

1074
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:44,358
So I said no.

1075
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:47,736
I said we should live together

1076
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:50,531
and die together.

1077
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:57,204
I won't get a divorce. For whose sake?

1078
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:03,002
Hiking with his new employees?

1079
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:04,878
I know...

1080
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:08,340
I know he goes on a trip abroad
at the end of each year.

1081
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:12,678
Even on the day Ji-eun died,

1082
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:14,805
I'm sure he was with her.

1083
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:17,308
I know that.

1084
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:20,769
But I won't divorce him.

1085
00:59:21,145 --> 00:59:22,855
It would just make him happy.

1086
00:59:23,439 --> 00:59:25,899
Why would I divorce him
when he'd live happily with that wench?

1087
00:59:26,608 --> 00:59:28,402
Just divorce him, Mom.

1088
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:30,404
You can live happily with me.

1089
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:32,197
It's okay if I become unhappy.

1090
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:36,285
But I can't let your father become happy.

1091
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:43,083
Even on the day we buried Ji-eun...

1092
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:45,878
your dad slept...

1093
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:49,048
with that wench in the same room.

1094
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:53,635
I'm okay.

1095
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:56,805
I'll bear everything by myself.

1096
00:59:57,306 --> 00:59:59,099
So you focus on your job.

1097
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,018
For me...

1098
01:00:02,186 --> 01:00:03,937
your happiness is everything.

1099
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:55,197
Mom...

1100
01:00:57,408 --> 01:01:00,077
Take me, Mom.

1101
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,163
Mom...

1102
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:07,209
Take me with you, Mom.

1103
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:11,588
Take me, Mom.

1104
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,050
Mom...

1105
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:19,930
Take me, Mom.

1106
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,228
Mom...

1107
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:31,316
Take me, Mom.

1108
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:34,903
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1109
01:01:36,405 --> 01:01:37,322
Who's this?

1110
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:39,366
This is Dr. Ahn Chi-hong from NS.

1111
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,659
He's also from graduate school.

1112
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:43,370
He's quite old.
He's a third-year resident like me.

1113
01:01:43,454 --> 01:01:45,873
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome to Dr. Bong's Salon.

1114
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:47,583
Thank you.

1115
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:50,294
This gathering is popular among residents.

1116
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:53,088
Since we can get a lot of
information about our professors,

1117
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:54,923
everyone wants to come.

1118
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:59,052
So Dr. Ahn here has been selected today
out of ten candidates

1119
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:01,388
because he treated us to a lot of pizza.

1120
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:05,309
By the way, Dr. Bong's not here yet?

1121
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:06,226
I'm here.

1122
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:10,814
Hey, if you have time for this,
just go home or get some sleep.

1123
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,065
What would you like to drink?

1124
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:15,652
Well, should I have
a cold one or a hot one?

1125
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:18,197
You can have both. I'll go buy them.

1126
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,115
I'll just pick drinks for you guys, okay?

1127
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:21,366
Okay.

1128
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,244
Who is this new guy here?

1129
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:27,122
Hello. I'm Ahn Chi-hong,
a third-year resident from NS.

1130
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:28,832
Dr. Ahn from NS.

1131
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:31,793
Who are you curious about?

1132
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:34,087
About Professor Chae Song-hwa.

1133
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:35,339
-Song-hwa?
-Yes.

1134
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:37,674
What do you want to know about her?

1135
01:02:38,383 --> 01:02:40,177
Maybe, her hobbies?

1136
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:41,720
Ahn Jeong-won for me.

1137
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:42,846
I want to know about his hobbies.

1138
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:46,433
You guys know they're doing
a band together, right?

1139
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:49,770
The five of them formed a band.

1140
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:52,523
Well, they were considered a gag club
when we were in school.

1141
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:54,149
They didn't play officially,

1142
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:56,527
but they always practiced together.

1143
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,279
Oh, right.
I heard they're practicing tonight.

1144
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:04,743
Good. I totally mastered this song.

1145
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:07,246
After the break,
how about we make this part longer?

1146
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:08,205
You finished early.

1147
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,332
-How about some <i>ramyeon?</i>
-No.

1148
01:03:10,415 --> 01:03:12,292
I have to go watch my kid,
so sit down now.

1149
01:03:12,376 --> 01:03:14,628
Let's play it once properly
and call it a day.

1150
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:18,131
This is my favorite song.

1151
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:19,466
No, it's mine.

1152
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,425
No, it's mine.

1153
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:24,513
A band? Dr. Yang too?

1154
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:27,599
-Thanks. Seok-hyeong plays the keyboards.
-What?

1155
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:29,768
-Who plays what?
-He said Seok-hyeong plays the keyboards.

1156
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:34,273
Ik-jun and Jun-wan were in a band
when they were in high school.

1157
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:37,401
They were the best in Changwon.
Well, they were, according to Ik-jun.

1158
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:40,904
Anyway, Ik-jun's good
at playing the guitar and bass guitar.

1159
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:42,114
Jun-wan plays the guitar.

1160
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:44,366
They joined a med school band,

1161
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:46,827
but they left
because things weren't right for them.

1162
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,496
Then they started their own band for fun.

1163
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,499
Luckily, Seok-hyeong was good at piano,

1164
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,960
and I think Jeong-won started
the drums then.

1165
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:56,962
And Song-hwa's the vocalist.

1166
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:58,589
She's the vocalist?

1167
01:03:58,672 --> 01:03:59,965
Yes, she is.

1168
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:01,508
But she can't sing

1169
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:04,261
That's right. I know that.
Actually, everyone knows that.

1170
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:05,596
But Song-hwa lied to them.

1171
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,682
-Sorry?
-She's really good at lying.

1172
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:10,767
When she sets her mind
on having something,

1173
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:13,061
she'll get it at all means.

1174
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:15,647
That's an unexpected charm.

1175
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,065
<i>A vocalist?</i>

1176
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:18,692
Are you saying you're good at singing?

1177
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:19,860
Yes.

1178
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:21,320
SPRING 1999

1179
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:25,157
I'm a little hoarse right now,

1180
01:04:25,824 --> 01:04:27,743
but I'm really good at singing.

1181
01:04:28,035 --> 01:04:29,369
I'll be the vocalist.

1182
01:04:29,453 --> 01:04:31,330
But you were fine until yesterday.

1183
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:32,789
This morning,

1184
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,083
I suddenly got hoarse.

1185
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,798
Oh, I need more coffee.

1186
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:45,802
Okay, then. Song-hwa can be the vocalist.

1187
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,848
And you're good at piano, you said?

1188
01:04:49,931 --> 01:04:51,600
-Yes.
-Really?

1189
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:53,518
I'm pretty good.

1190
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:55,646
Can't you tell? Look at this place.

1191
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,732
I'm from a musical family.

1192
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:02,611
Then, show me.

1193
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:06,603
Then, show me.

1194
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:32,504
<i>Are you...</i>

1195
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:39,970
Any other songs?

1196
01:06:38,153 --> 01:06:40,113
-When did he learn it?
-Be quiet.

1197
01:06:41,156 --> 01:06:42,949
Continue playing. I want to listen more.

1198
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,489
Well... This guy...

1199
01:07:22,822 --> 01:07:24,532
This jerk...

1200
01:07:26,701 --> 01:07:27,827
Wait.

1201
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:32,582
Wow, how much is it?

1202
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:33,959
It's 300,000 won.

1203
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:36,294
You really are rich.

1204
01:07:36,378 --> 01:07:39,923
You can write 35 Korean characters
up to 5 lines.

1205
01:07:40,006 --> 01:07:41,174
-Wow, this is so light.
-Right?

1206
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:43,426
The technology has advanced a lot.

1207
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,595
Maybe it'll have a camera on it too.

1208
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:47,222
-That's nonsense.
-Or we will be able to

1209
01:07:47,305 --> 01:07:49,182
buy things and pay bus fare with it.

1210
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:50,976
-What?
-You've gone too far.

1211
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:52,686
Why not watch TV on it then?

1212
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:54,646
Why not recharge it like this?

1213
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:56,481
They say all that will be possible.

1214
01:07:56,564 --> 01:07:58,191
It will. But after we all die.

1215
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:01,528
But there's one thing I can play
until the end.

1216
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:02,696
-"Beyer"?
-"Canon."

1217
01:08:03,196 --> 01:08:04,281
"Canon"?

1218
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:06,866
-You can play "Canon"?
-Yes.

1219
01:08:07,575 --> 01:08:10,453
I'm not as good as George Washington,
but I can play it until the end.

1220
01:08:11,037 --> 01:08:13,164
-I learned it from my sister.
-It's George Winston.

1221
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,584
You.

1222
01:08:18,253 --> 01:08:19,796
This is your last chance.

1223
01:09:10,722 --> 01:09:12,932
What a show-off.

1224
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:20,273
Like this.

1225
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:22,984
And then, the second line...

1226
01:10:07,779 --> 01:10:09,239
Song-hwa, you've improved a lot.

1227
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:53,486
He's a TA patient.

1228
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:56,573
He's been X-rayed because of
a rigid abdomen and rebound tenderness.

1229
01:12:56,656 --> 01:12:58,491
It seems like he has a pan-peritonitis
from bowel perforation.

1230
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:00,159
He needs surgery so I called you.

1231
01:13:00,243 --> 01:13:01,244
Okay.

1232
01:13:02,328 --> 01:13:03,913
-Did you give him a painkiller?
-Yes.

1233
01:13:04,497 --> 01:13:07,083
Okay, let's see.

1234
01:13:08,876 --> 01:13:10,587
My, it hurts a lot, doesn't it?

1235
01:13:11,129 --> 01:13:12,297
What?

1236
01:13:16,676 --> 01:13:17,927
He looks just like him, right?

1237
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:22,682
I was surprised too,
so I was thinking about how it's possible.

1238
01:13:23,224 --> 01:13:26,144
-Maybe they're twins...
-Yes, they're twins.

1239
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:29,856
Jae-hun got hurt yesterday,
and today, his brother...

1240
01:13:30,732 --> 01:13:32,108
Jae-yong.

1241
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:33,568
Dad's here. It's okay.

1242
01:13:34,569 --> 01:13:36,404
Doctor, he's going to be okay, right?

1243
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:38,865
It was a car accident, right?

1244
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:42,410
Yes, I dozed off while driving
and hit a lamp post.

1245
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,538
He was in the back seat.

1246
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:47,290
I don't know what I was thinking.

1247
01:13:47,373 --> 01:13:49,334
I need to check some things,

1248
01:13:49,417 --> 01:13:51,628
so could you leave us for a moment?

1249
01:13:51,711 --> 01:13:54,505
Why? Why should a guardian leave?

1250
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:58,301
Before surgery, I need to prepare him.

1251
01:13:58,384 --> 01:13:59,677
I see.

1252
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:06,726
Jae-yong, let me see.

1253
01:14:08,728 --> 01:14:09,896
What's wrong with the patient?

1254
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:12,732
He was in his dad's car
and got a pan-peritonitis from TA.

1255
01:14:13,441 --> 01:14:15,068
What kind of father would let that happen?

1256
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:16,694
It can happen when you drive.

1257
01:14:16,778 --> 01:14:18,154
But the father seemed totally fine.

1258
01:14:18,237 --> 01:14:21,199
Jae-yong, let me see.

1259
01:14:23,868 --> 01:14:25,495
He's covered in bruises.

1260
01:14:28,039 --> 01:14:29,957
Jae-yong, lie on your stomach.

1261
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:32,043
Good.

1262
01:14:33,961 --> 01:14:34,921
My goodness.

1263
01:14:42,929 --> 01:14:46,140
What kind of sick son of a bitch
does this?

1264
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:54,607
We still have a lot of time left
before surgery.

1265
01:14:55,274 --> 01:14:57,819
But I don't know
why I'm already so nervous.

1266
01:14:59,612 --> 01:15:00,446
That's natural.

1267
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,074
Your son...

1268
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:06,828
His surgery will begin soon.

1269
01:15:06,911 --> 01:15:08,079
If it goes well,

1270
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:12,583
my husband will be able to play golf

1271
01:15:13,334 --> 01:15:14,877
and go on a trip abroad again, right?

1272
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:18,339
Yes.

1273
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:22,218
He will.

1274
01:15:23,845 --> 01:15:25,346
Can we have a word?

1275
01:15:40,778 --> 01:15:44,657
This is the VIP Ward on the 10th floor.
Please send four men now. Hurry.

1276
01:15:44,782 --> 01:15:46,075
Yes, right now.

1277
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:48,369
Why did you call the security guards?

1278
01:15:48,453 --> 01:15:50,329
-Listen.
-Yes?

1279
01:15:50,496 --> 01:15:52,832
Didn't you notice anything strange
when you check on Mr. Sim?

1280
01:15:55,793 --> 01:15:58,337
His wife is with him all the time.

1281
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:02,467
-What's wrong with that?
-She never goes to her son's room.

1282
01:16:03,843 --> 01:16:06,053
Her son is giving her husband his liver,

1283
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:08,681
but she always stays with her husband.

1284
01:16:10,683 --> 01:16:12,351
Even the most unmotherly mother

1285
01:16:12,852 --> 01:16:15,688
would be worried about her child
more than she is.

1286
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,072
Who are you?

1287
01:16:25,656 --> 01:16:27,658
Well... I...

1288
01:16:27,742 --> 01:16:29,410
Who are you?

1289
01:16:38,377 --> 01:16:39,587
Ik-jun.

1290
01:16:48,346 --> 01:16:50,431
THE CENTER OF THE DEFENSE
THE 2ND BATTALION

1291
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:01,859
What brings you here?

1292
01:17:12,078 --> 01:17:15,206
Did you come here to see me?

1293
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:17,333
No, I came to eat <i>Jajangmyeon</i>.

1294
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:20,086
What?

1295
01:17:21,671 --> 01:17:23,548
I said I came to eat <i>Jajangmyeon</i>.

1296
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:50,187
Subtitle translation by Won-hyang Son

1297
01:18:07,842 --> 01:18:09,886
<i>I'm thinking of confessing my feelings.</i>

1298
01:18:10,469 --> 01:18:12,138
<i>Do you like me?</i>

1299
01:18:13,639 --> 01:18:14,765
Hey, Ik-jun.

1300
01:18:14,849 --> 01:18:15,933
Did you see this?

1301
01:18:16,017 --> 01:18:17,351
<i>It's about a girl.</i>

1302
01:18:17,435 --> 01:18:19,896
I knew it. He's been single for too long.

1303
01:18:19,979 --> 01:18:21,397
<i>Seok-hyeong,
is it a crime to get a divorce?</i>

1304
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:24,400
Just drink some beer, man.
Gosh, you're so frustrating.

1305
01:18:25,902 --> 01:18:27,153
Hey, you got nothing?

1306
01:18:28,112 --> 01:18:29,113
<i>Just tell me.</i>

1307
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,283
<i>Is there anyone you're interested in?</i>

1308
01:18:32,366 --> 01:18:33,284
There is.

1309
01:18:33,367 --> 01:18:34,327
Who?

1310
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,621
I forgot that Jeong-won
has been staying at my house.

1311
01:18:36,704 --> 01:18:39,332
Really? Invite me to your home.

1312
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:40,791
Yes, let's pick a day. Today?

1313
01:18:41,834 --> 01:18:44,962
There's nothing wrong with her, right?
Is she fine?

1314
01:18:45,046 --> 01:18:46,464
Yes, everything looks good.

1315
01:18:46,547 --> 01:18:48,591
I'll make sure
her surgery doesn't hurt at all.

1316
01:18:48,674 --> 01:18:49,926
Don't worry about it.

1317
01:18:50,009 --> 01:18:50,843
I'll do my best.

1318
01:18:50,927 --> 01:18:53,012
<i>She was fine when I checked
during my afternoon round.</i>

1319
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:54,388
<i>I need your help, sir.</i>

1320
01:18:54,513 --> 01:18:56,474
<i>-I brought three bags of RBC.
-Spread this part.</i>

1321
01:18:56,557 --> 01:18:58,851
<i>-Great. Keep suctioning.
-Bring more blood.</i>

1322
01:18:58,935 --> 01:19:00,853
You must save him.
If you don't, I'll kill you.

1323
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:03,981
Please save him, doctor.
