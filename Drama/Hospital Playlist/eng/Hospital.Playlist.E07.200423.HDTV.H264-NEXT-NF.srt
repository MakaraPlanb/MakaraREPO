HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,629
How's the liver? Are you heading here now?

3
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:22,339
<i>We have a problem, Professor Ahn.</i>

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,051
-What's wrong?
-<i>The donor's liver is too thick.</i>

5
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:30,514
<i>It looks like it weighs over 500g.
And her AP must be as thick as 8cm.</i>

6
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:32,558
<i>What should we do?</i>

7
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:50,826
<i>This liver seems too big for Ji-a.
It won't work.</i>

8
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:54,121
<i>I think you should give up.</i>

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,582
No, we'll proceed as planned.

10
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,418
I'm going to do this.

11
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:10,846
Hello.

12
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,432
-You're still here?
-Yes.

13
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,768
Did the painter Mr. Jang Hong-do
leave for the day?

14
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:18,646
Yes, Mr. Jang was...

15
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:21,065
I mean, he was here, but he left just now.

16
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,651
All right. You should get going too.

17
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:24,568
Okay.

18
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,531
Want to see a liver transplant?

19
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:32,743
Yes.

20
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:36,372
Thank you.

21
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,928
<i>For a baby to get a liver transplant,
the size is the most important factor.</i>

22
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,931
<i>If it's too big,
the results will be fatally affected.</i>

23
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,351
For a baby, we'd usually cut
a brain-dead donor's liver in half,

24
00:01:57,434 --> 00:01:59,895
but this donor's liver
is much bigger than we expected.

25
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:03,232
Even if we cut it in half,
it'll still be too big for the baby.

26
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,359
Ji-a is only six months old.

27
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:08,654
So, Ji-a can't get the surgery?
Will she have to wait for another liver?

28
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:09,947
She doesn't have a "next time."

29
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,950
Her liver can't release the bile,
so hepatocirrhosis is worsening rapidly.

30
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:15,119
She vomited blood
and had blood in her excrement.

31
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,662
She won't last more than a week.

32
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:18,122
-Then what do we do?
-What?

33
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:21,083
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,460
Then what do we do, Professor?

35
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:27,131
She can't get the surgery
and won't live if we don't do anything.

36
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,049
-What do we do?
-We'll perform the surgery.

37
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,427
But you said
even the half-cut liver is too big.

38
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,011
-We can cut it again.
-What?

39
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:34,888
What? What's wrong?

40
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,974
I'm really sorry.

41
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:41,603
Did you say we can cut the liver again?

42
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:42,604
Yes.

43
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:47,651
We'll cut the half-cut liver
in half again.

44
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,072
It happens occasionally. Of course,
the surgery will be very difficult.

45
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:55,075
Still, we have to do it.

46
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,869
It won't be easy,

47
00:02:57,286 --> 00:03:00,998
but this is the last and only way
to save the baby.

48
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,912
-Ji-a.
-Please, God...

49
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:00,224
Here.

50
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,440
-Three, three, three.
-Three, three, three.

51
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:10,150
-Liver coming out.
-One.

52
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:12,194
-Gosh, it must have been hard for her.
-Two.

53
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,905
-Three, four.
-I'm amazed she held out with that liver.

54
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,616
-Five, six.
-Ji-a is really amazing.

55
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,535
-Seven, eight.
-Seven, eight.

56
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:22,037
-Nine.
-Nine, ten.

57
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:31,588
The liver is here.

58
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,971
Thank you. Thanks for your help, Dr. Jang.

59
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,683
You said you were
by the traffic light across the street.

60
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,393
You got here so fast.

61
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,062
-Did you run?
-Thankfully, the traffic wasn't so bad.

62
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:50,649
But the elevator in this building
is broken,

63
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:52,484
so I ran up here.

64
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,028
I mean, I didn't run.

65
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:57,281
I quickly...

66
00:04:57,948 --> 00:05:00,826
I walked quickly. Just walked.

67
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,912
I was being careful
to deliver this safe and sound.

68
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:11,253
My gosh, Gyeo-ul.

69
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,963
Great job.

70
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,438
It looks like we're done, Professor.

71
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:32,190
Yes, thanks for all your help.

72
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,178
-We're ready, Professor.
-Okay.

73
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:09,853
Would you like to try
the next External Ventricular Drainage?

74
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:11,438
What?

75
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,733
You're in your third year,
so it's about time.

76
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,610
Get ready.

77
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,072
Thank you.

78
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:28,538
The liver has been cut,
so it's bleeding a lot.

79
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:29,498
Forceps. Quick.

80
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,209
Suction.

81
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:38,382
This will take a while. Ik-jun.

82
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,384
Yes, I'll let her parents know.

83
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,639
There's a lot of bleeding, Doctor.

84
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:49,184
Yes, she's still okay though.

85
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,563
Focus. You have to do a thorough job
with the suction.

86
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:57,109
-I can't see.
-Okay.

87
00:06:58,568 --> 00:06:59,444
Pass me the gauze.

88
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:17,713
Doctor.

89
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,923
Is Ji-a well now?

90
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:22,092
Did the surgery go well, Doctor?

91
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,429
Yes.

92
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,097
It went well.

93
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:37,024
Why are you crying? It went very well.
Ji-a is such a strong girl.

94
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,070
Please don't cry. People will think
that the surgery didn't go well.

95
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:44,156
Thank you.

96
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,825
Thank you, Doctor.

97
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,745
Thank you so much for everything.
We'll never forget this.

98
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:53,081
There was more bleeding
than we had expected, so it wasn't easy.

99
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:54,916
But we managed to get it under control.

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,211
She's stable now,
and we'll move her to the ICU shortly.

101
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,964
The transplant went well,

102
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,175
so she'll be fine
as long as the liver works well.

103
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:06,595
The surgery went successfully,
so Ji-a will recover soon.

104
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,764
-Thank you.
-This must've been so hard for you.

105
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:11,099
You held out very well.

106
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:13,894
I don't know
how I can express my gratitude.

107
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,022
Thank you so much.

108
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:22,944
Ji-a could live because she was
lucky enough to find a brain-dead donor.

109
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,946
This is truly a miracle.

110
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,450
And we were very lucky
to find a young donor.

111
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,577
We owe it all to you, Doctor.

112
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:32,537
Thank you so much, Doctor.

113
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,457
Thank you.

114
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,919
All I did was perform the surgery.

115
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:41,963
Pardon?

116
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,135
You should thank that person instead.

117
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:50,639
-Who?
-Who?

118
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:54,935
Age 22, female.

119
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,020
Tall and slim.

120
00:08:58,355 --> 00:08:59,356
A traffic accident victim.

121
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:05,821
I'm talking about the donor.

122
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,031
The person who gave Ji-a the liver.

123
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:11,368
I can't give you

124
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,704
more information about the donor
as it's against our rules,

125
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:18,291
but Ji-a could live thanks to her.

126
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:22,754
I'm so ashamed, Doctor.

127
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:28,593
I'll thank her for the rest of my life.

128
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:31,388
I was only thinking about my baby.

129
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:34,558
-I'm so sorry.
-We're sorry.

130
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,811
No, don't be sorry. I fully understand.

131
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:42,149
But every year, on Ji-a's birthday,

132
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,234
please thank her

133
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,903
with all your heart.

134
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:50,532
-We will.
-Yes, thank you.

135
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:52,659
Thank you.

136
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:56,288
Then I'll see you in the PICU later.

137
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:57,956
Okay.

138
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,876
Thank you.

139
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:21,792
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

140
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:26,109
Yes. Can you send this to me
with the image?

141
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,153
Yes, thank you. Will do.

142
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:32,115
-Still, I'm worried.
-Don't be.

143
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:34,910
The contractions are under control,
and the baby is doing well too.

144
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:38,538
-She'll be fine.
-Do you have to keep using the drugs?

145
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:41,958
As I explained before,
those drugs are completely fine.

146
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:45,253
I'll go through them again with you.

147
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:46,421
Just a moment, please.

148
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:49,090
That patient, Park Mi-jeong.
What was her cervical length again?

149
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:50,467
-Hold on.
-It was 1.5cm.

150
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:52,177
I see, 1.5cm.

151
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:55,180
-Dr. Chu.
-Yes, Professor.

152
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:58,183
The C-section patient bled a lot
because her contractions weren't good.

153
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:00,477
Check the pad
and keep an eye on her contractions.

154
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,603
Yes, sir.

155
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:07,400
Doctor, my wife says that
she's in a lot of pain. What should I do?

156
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:11,321
I checked her five minutes ago but didn't
notice any changes with her cervix.

157
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:14,115
I'll check in a bit
and give her an analgesic if needed.

158
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:16,534
Can you please check now?

159
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,535
Sure.

160
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:19,329
-Dr. Chu.
-Yes?

161
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,706
We're giving Sin Hyo-jeong
ritodrine at 12gtt per minute,

162
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,250
but she has tachycardia.

163
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,294
Oh, let's bring it down to 8gtt.
And check her vitals in an hour.

164
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:27,212
Okay.

165
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,506
We'll see how the baby is doing

166
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,425
and keep the baby in the womb
for longer if needed.

167
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:37,639
Is there a chance that the baby
will be weak compared to other babies

168
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:40,433
or can't live for long?

169
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:42,394
No, that won't happen.

170
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:46,147
My mom also had a very hard time
when she had me.

171
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:48,858
-Really?
-In my case...

172
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,654
My mom is diabetic,
and she got pregnant unexpectedly.

173
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:54,072
She's diabetic?

174
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:57,367
Patient Seo Jeong-won's episiotomy site
looks pretty good, doesn't it?

175
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:00,996
Yes, I checked in the morning.
She doesn't have a hematoma. All good.

176
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:03,415
Dr. Chu, can you have a look at this NST?

177
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:05,250
Jeong Min-gyeong is exhibiting
decelerations.

178
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,003
Let's hydrate her.

179
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,588
Give her 3L of oxygen via nasal prong
in the lateral position.

180
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:11,506
Okay.

181
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,759
-Doctor.
-My sister's baby was born prematurely,

182
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:17,304
but she's so optimistic
and easygoing though.

183
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:21,224
I was worried about her
even though I'm an ob-gyn,

184
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,226
but she said she was happy
to meet her baby early.

185
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:25,812
-My gosh, really?
-Yes.

186
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,148
-Doctor.
-Yes?

187
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:30,900
I'm really hungry.

188
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:32,777
Can I eat something?

189
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:36,114
Let's check fetal movements.
Hold on. I'll be with you in a minute.

190
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:39,701
She'll have a healthy baby,
and the baby will stay healthy.

191
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:43,204
My sister's baby is already two years old.
Do you want to see photos?

192
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:44,331
Yes, I'd love to.

193
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:47,667
-Dr. Myeong.
-Yes?

194
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:50,045
We need to check
Sin Ha-yun's fetal movements,

195
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:52,922
and we have to check Jeong Min-gyeong
for decelerations.

196
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:54,758
Also, we have two C-sections scheduled,

197
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,093
so we have to get ready.
We have a lot to do.

198
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:59,554
Okay, got it.

199
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:10,774
Doctor, you're very straightforward.

200
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:12,942
Have a good day.

201
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,403
You too.

202
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:21,743
Well... I'll go check
the C-section patient's pad.

203
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:22,786
Okay.

204
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,126
Oh, boy.
A showdown between the bear and the fox.

205
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:33,546
-Who's the fox?
-Isn't it obvious?

206
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:38,843
RESTRICTED AREA

207
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,057
Professor, Jeong Min-gyeong is exhibiting
decelerations. I'll go check.

208
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:47,394
Give her 3L of oxygen
via nasal prong, right?

209
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:49,479
Yes.

210
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:51,523
Okay.

211
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:57,654
What's taking him so long?

212
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,031
I should've offered to pick it up.

213
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,699
It's his minor personal satisfaction.

214
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:03,660
He's probably chatting
with the delivery guy.

215
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:09,958
Couldn't you have hurried?
We're dying of hunger here.

216
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:14,129
How can you talk about death so easily
when you're a doctor?

217
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:18,383
Hong-do and Yun-bok,
eat as much as you want.

218
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,593
Eat up and join our department later on.

219
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:21,719
-Okay.
-Okay.

220
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,514
Here. If you don't, that's a eat and run.

221
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,807
-Okay.
-Okay.

222
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:29,102
Can I have Double Bacon?
It's my favorite sandwich.

223
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:30,687
My gosh, of course.

224
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,982
-You can have two.
-Great, I will.

225
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:36,484
We'll still have leftovers.

226
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:38,319
So I called someone to join us.

227
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,618
Oh, Jeong-won is--

228
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,873
-Sandwiches? Nice.
-What the...

229
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:51,916
Well, he's a rain check.

230
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,878
You should have let me finish my sentence.
Goodness.

231
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,630
Hello.

232
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,090
-Hello.
-Hello.

233
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:00,425
Sit down, guys.

234
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:05,638
-But why am I a rain check?
-Don't ask. You don't need to know.

235
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:08,099
Hurry and eat,
or Gyeo-ul will eat everything. Here.

236
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,145
Oh. It's been a while, guys.

237
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:14,981
Gyeon-u and Jik-nyeo, right?

238
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:18,693
You called us like that last time,
and I told you our names.

239
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:20,653
Right, they were some painters' names.

240
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:22,947
Ma-ne and Mo-ne?

241
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:25,992
We're Hong-do and Yun-bok.

242
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:29,537
Right. Gosh, I'm really sorry.
We even did the Wakanda gesture together.

243
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:31,414
-Sorry, guys.
-It's okay.

244
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,625
And Ma-ne and Mo-ne are our cousins.

245
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:36,669
What? Seriously?

246
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:37,712
Yes.

247
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:42,592
Don't tell me they're twins.

248
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:44,260
They are.

249
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,970
-Identical twins?
-Identical twins.

250
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:47,764
-Five years old?
-Five years old.

251
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,142
Why are you saying the exact same things?

252
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,694
Dr. Bong.

253
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:06,032
-Here, have some water.
-You're having a late lunch.

254
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,200
I brought you some napkins.

255
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:12,121
Oh, I had an emergency patient.
How did you guys all become friends?

256
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,083
We're both chief residents,
and I've known him for a while.

257
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,711
As for Chi-hong, he's Seok-min's favorite.

258
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:20,922
-What? When did I say that?
-Really?

259
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:23,508
I mean, he's very fond of you.

260
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:26,177
He talks about you all the time,
so I feel like I know you so well.

261
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:29,806
By the way, why did you leave
the military, Captain Ahn?

262
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:33,309
I bet it was because of a woman.
Come on. Tell us.

263
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:37,522
There wasn't any special reason.
I'll tell you another time.

264
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:42,193
I guess I should be like that too.
It makes him look all mysterious.

265
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:43,903
Professor.

266
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,907
I wasn't sure what you'd like,
so I got one of each.

267
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:50,201
An iced Americano,
a hot Americano, and a latte.

268
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:51,286
Hello.

269
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:54,831
What kind of story
shall I tell you guys today?

270
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:57,834
Dr. Chu, what happened to your face?

271
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,795
-What?
-Your skin looks ashy. Are you okay?

272
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:03,590
My foundation is to blame.
I'm wearing 25, which is quite dark.

273
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:07,760
It's too dark for you. Your neck looks
much lighter than your face now.

274
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,971
This is the Black Pearl Makeup.

275
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:12,807
Your face looks tiny if you wear this
because it makes you look tanned.

276
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,893
You look like you went to a tanning salon
because you couldn't go on vacation.

277
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:19,314
By the way,
how did you two become friends?

278
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:21,566
You're in different departments.
Also, your ages and even

279
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:23,568
your skin colors are different.

280
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,653
We're both members of ARMY.

281
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:29,282
You served in the military together?
Dr. Ahn, they're your juniors.

282
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,493
Not the army. They meant...

283
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:34,871
Did you get Internet service installed
yesterday?

284
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:35,830
Yes.

285
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:41,210
I got ADSL Mega pass installed yesterday,
the fastest Internet service in Korea.

286
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,130
I sold all my acorns

287
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,507
and used up all my KTF Bigi eggs for it.

288
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:50,887
-What's he saying?
-Anyway...

289
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,433
So you two like BTS.
My sister is a huge fan as well.

290
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:57,060
Yes, we met in the fan club.

291
00:17:57,143 --> 00:18:00,355
Jeez, it looks like residents these days
have so much time on their hands.

292
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:03,399
You guys have time to join a fan club
and chat like this at the cafeteria.

293
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:06,819
-Back in my day--
-Professor, have this latte.

294
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:08,196
-A latte.
-Yes.

295
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,243
Forget the cafeteria.
We didn't even have time to eat.

296
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:18,164
Shall I tell you a story
about when I was a resident?

297
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:19,999
-Bye.
-Bye.

298
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,504
However, those two on the Gongnyong Ridge.

299
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:28,257
The first love. The old love.
I should tell you guys the love story.

300
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:30,927
My goodness.

301
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:38,351
I'm not really interested though.

302
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:43,773
Ik-jun and Jun-wan were always
dating someone. They were both popular.

303
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:46,776
I'm pretty sure
they always had girlfriends.

304
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:49,445
Wow, really? I'm impressed.

305
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,531
Moving on.
What about Professor Yang Seok-hyeong?

306
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:53,741
Seok-hyeong? He barely dated.

307
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:56,494
And he married the woman
his parents chose.

308
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:58,287
They got a divorce in less than a year.

309
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,998
He went to the US right after that,
but he did nothing but study.

310
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:01,916
I see.

311
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:05,378
But he's in love now. So in love.

312
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:07,046
What? With who?

313
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:08,923
With his TV.

314
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:12,301
No woman can beat his TV.

315
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,388
What about Professor Chae?
Was she a campus couple?

316
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:17,140
Yes, she was.

317
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,434
-Professor Lee Ik-jun, right?
-Ik-jun?

318
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:22,228
Gosh, no. They're really just friends.

319
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,648
Was it from the winter of
her freshman year or her second year?

320
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,483
Anyway,
she was in a long-term relationship.

321
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,652
She dated a senior guy
for a number of years.

322
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:33,656
They dated for over three to four years,
and she dated other guys after that too.

323
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,074
She just doesn't want to get married.

324
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,410
What about Professor Ahn Jeong-won?

325
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:41,873
If anyone has a crush on Jeong-won,

326
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:44,667
that person will have to beat God first.

327
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,462
Gosh, who can do that?

328
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,089
If there is someone that likes him,
she should give up.

329
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:54,051
How dare she compete against God?

330
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:00,391
Dr. Jang.

331
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,268
Are you a Buddhist?

332
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:05,897
This is probably making you uncomfortable.

333
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,483
Let's change the topic.

334
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,320
Okay, we are done. Finished.

335
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:16,657
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

336
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:31,756
Why are you still up?

337
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:35,551
-I'm studying the EVD procedure.
-EVD?

338
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,429
We do that all the time.

339
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:42,517
When we get an IVH patient,
I'll be the lead surgeon for the surgery.

340
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,187
What?

341
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:48,898
You still haven't done that yet?

342
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:51,609
Gosh, Professor Chae is too much.

343
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:55,571
I did it in my second year.

344
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,201
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

345
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:04,163
You'll probably get scolded,

346
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:07,291
-but still... Best of luck.
-Thanks.

347
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,876
Professor Chae...

348
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,463
When you make a mistake
for the first time, she lets it go.

349
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,590
But if you make another mistake...

350
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:20,930
Anyway, you can do it.

351
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,390
Thanks.

352
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:30,731
I can do this too.

353
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:01,429
Why don't you just shower here?

354
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:04,891
Oh, Professor Cheon. I'm sorry.

355
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,059
Do you have surgery?

356
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:10,354
Yes, I'm going into
Professor Kim Jun-wan's VSD surgery.

357
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,565
You two are like besties.

358
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:15,818
Yes.

359
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:18,738
He's quite fond of me.

360
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:22,450
-He speaks very highly of you.
-No way.

361
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:26,370
-Thank you.
-All right, get going.

362
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:28,205
Oh, right.

363
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:35,129
<i>What's with him today?
He didn't even swear at me.</i>

364
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:40,426
First, we'll block the hole
between the left and right ventricles.

365
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:44,055
If the mitral regurgitation continues
even after we block the VSD,

366
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:45,765
we'll fix that too.

367
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:49,560
We expect
that it'll take about five hours.

368
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:50,937
Don't worry too much.

369
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,564
Okay. Thank you for everything
in advance, Doctor.

370
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:56,442
-Thank you, Doctor.
-No problem. I'll see you later.

371
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,253
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

372
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:21,133
Captain Ahn will get an earful
from Professor Chae today.

373
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:25,471
It's so hard to set Kocher's point
when you can't see the coronal suture.

374
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:27,848
Go in and watch.
You guys are in the same year.

375
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:29,976
I can't. I'm too nervous for him.

376
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:32,395
I'm even more nervous now
than when I had to do it.

377
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,446
Can you see the coronal suture?

378
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:43,739
I'll try again.

379
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:47,618
Sometimes, you can't see it
because of the blood. Use gauze.

380
00:23:47,702 --> 00:23:49,078
Okay. Forceps.

381
00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:33,622
Bone wax, please.

382
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,416
WAXY SUBSTANCE USED TO CONTROL BLEEDING

383
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:41,881
Try to control bleeding with bone wax
while you're at it.

384
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,425
Heavy bleeding may occur
when you use the curette.

385
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:45,843
-Be careful.
-Okay.

386
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,222
Curette.

387
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:07,239
Tilt it a little.

388
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,284
No, up.

389
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,287
Good.

390
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:30,596
Well done. I think the angles
on the left and right are wrong.

391
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:33,349
Let's wrap up here. Can you pull it out?

392
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:35,434
Sure.

393
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:45,152
This has to go in straight.

394
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:48,864
You need to look at the inner canthus,
but you're not used to it yet.

395
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:50,616
Got it. I'm sorry.

396
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:54,245
This is a common mistake.
Just do a good job next time.

397
00:25:54,995 --> 00:25:55,830
Okay.

398
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:58,749
Bayonet forceps, please.

399
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,431
Blade 15.

400
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:33,576
I cut through it again.

401
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,412
How many times have I done this already?

402
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:40,416
The valve is so delicate.

403
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:45,754
Get me a smaller needle.

404
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:53,012
ELAPSED TIME

405
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:56,265
Honey, it's been over nine hours.

406
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,809
He said it'd take around five hours.

407
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:03,939
What if

408
00:27:06,483 --> 00:27:08,110
something went wrong?

409
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:19,288
All right. Let's go in together.

410
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,372
Okay.

411
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:28,130
It took longer than we had expected.

412
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:31,467
Even I wanted to cut my hand off.

413
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:34,261
-Pardon?
-Gosh, Doctor!

414
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,598
After repairing
the ventricular septal defect,

415
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:40,476
the mitral regurgitation was quite severe,
so I tried to fix it.

416
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:43,979
But the regurgitation continued to worsen
because the tissues kept ripping.

417
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,607
Right. But in conclusion,
everything went well.

418
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:49,610
-I see. Thank you.
-Thank you.

419
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,362
So Chang-mo is okay, right?

420
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:54,448
He bled quite a bit halfway through,
so we struggled a little,

421
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:55,824
but the surgery went well.

422
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:58,744
Then when can we see Chang-mo?

423
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,829
We managed to minimize the regurgitation,

424
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,665
so the baby is stable now.

425
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,877
As I explained before, we'll put Chang-mo
to sleep for the next three days--

426
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:09,713
You'll be able to see Chang-mo shortly
in the PICU.

427
00:28:09,797 --> 00:28:11,340
Don't worry about a thing.

428
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,592
-Honey, we can see him shortly.
-Yes.

429
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,387
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

430
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:20,808
Professor, you need to state
the conclusion first.

431
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:25,562
Start with the conclusion,
whether it went well or not.

432
00:28:25,646 --> 00:28:29,942
Doctors must inform the guardians
about everything that happens in the OR.

433
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:32,403
From beginning to end, in a calm manner.

434
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:36,907
If you keep doing that,
every guardian will get a heart attack.

435
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,034
Gosh, seriously.

436
00:28:40,077 --> 00:28:42,454
You're so insensitive sometimes.

437
00:28:42,997 --> 00:28:44,665
I'm not telling you to sugarcoat things.

438
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:48,961
State the facts.
But first, you need to ease their minds.

439
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:50,754
Gosh, forget it.

440
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:56,468
Hey, my mom never scolded like that
even when I was five.

441
00:28:57,094 --> 00:28:59,388
He's right. Can you be more considerate
when you talk?

442
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,307
Dr. Do, well done.

443
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,059
-Hello, Professor.
-Yes, hello.

444
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,770
Please talk casually to me.

445
00:29:06,854 --> 00:29:07,771
Gosh, no.

446
00:29:08,689 --> 00:29:11,483
Don't you have to go home?
You took a shower, so go home already!

447
00:29:12,276 --> 00:29:14,695
A baby got surgery for enteroclysis
earlier in the day.

448
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,363
But there was some bleeding,

449
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:19,450
so I want to monitor
the baby's vitals tonight.

450
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,286
You sure live up to your nickname, Buddha.

451
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,496
You should've done a better job
with the surgery.

452
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:27,541
And you too live up to...

453
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:30,836
Right, you sure are Buddha's buddy.

454
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:32,671
I'm Catholic.

455
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,425
I knew it! My wife is a devoted Catholic.

456
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:41,013
Catholics are beautiful inside and out.

457
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:42,222
Thank you.

458
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:45,559
Oh, right.

459
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:49,938
Is there a professor named
Cheon Myeong-tae in your department?

460
00:29:50,731 --> 00:29:51,857
Yes. Why do you ask?

461
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,152
I heard we received an anonymous letter
about a pharmaceutical company's rebate.

462
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:56,987
He got a golf club membership

463
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:01,241
and free meals
at an upscale restaurant through them.

464
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:04,161
It sounds like most CS professors did it.

465
00:30:04,244 --> 00:30:05,496
Hey, you didn't go, right?

466
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:19,259
Of course, I go often.
My brother owns the golf club.

467
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,264
By the way,

468
00:30:24,765 --> 00:30:26,683
who told you?

469
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,812
That you don't need to know.

470
00:30:30,187 --> 00:30:33,899
I heard it was paid for
with XG&YU's corporate credit card.

471
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:36,485
A guy who works there
put it on the wrong card.

472
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:41,657
We play golf together often,
so he got confused.

473
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:44,368
He kept apologizing.

474
00:30:45,202 --> 00:30:47,621
Even today, he sent me over ten messages.

475
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:54,294
Sir, please. Don't make me look so petty.

476
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,798
A day on the golf course costs peanuts.

477
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:02,136
"Peanuts"?
I heard the membership for the golf course

478
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,141
costs two hundred million won.

479
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:10,894
My brother owns the golf club,
and I'm a member too.

480
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:13,605
Please believe me.
It is not what you think it is.

481
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,025
Professor Kim Jun-wan

482
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:19,528
got a big mouth.

483
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,071
He kept overreacting.

484
00:31:21,655 --> 00:31:24,658
I see that he practically wrote a novel.

485
00:31:36,712 --> 00:31:40,299
Stop sighing. Are you trying
to make the floor collapse or what?

486
00:31:45,345 --> 00:31:46,722
I'm so embarrassed.

487
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,977
During Seon-bin's first surgery
as a lead surgeon,

488
00:31:52,352 --> 00:31:54,354
she suddenly put up both hands like this
and said,

489
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,610
"I can't do this. I'm afraid
I'll end up killing this patient."

490
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,573
Come on. Let's grab a drink together.

491
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:07,201
I can't.
I'm working the night shift today.

492
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:08,952
Oh, boy.

493
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:12,289
I'm dying for a drink, but I happen
to be working the night shift today.

494
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:20,422
-You're still here?
-How's the baby?

495
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:23,717
The baby is doing okay at the moment.
I'll check back later.

496
00:32:24,968 --> 00:32:27,012
I hope you didn't play golf
with Professor Cheon.

497
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,099
-I did, once.
-What? You did?

498
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,477
The golf course there is really great.

499
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:35,437
The ball rolls in by itself.

500
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:38,440
Damn it.
This will turn into a headache, then.

501
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:41,193
No, it won't. I paid for it myself.

502
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:42,861
How?

503
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:45,697
Didn't you guys use XG&YU's
corporate card and their membership?

504
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:48,659
I kept getting a bad feeling
during the game.

505
00:32:48,742 --> 00:32:50,744
Professor Cheon
always brags about his money,

506
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:52,788
so I assumed we were using his membership.

507
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:55,499
But something seemed off
when we were cashing out.

508
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:57,918
So I went back and asked the staff

509
00:32:58,001 --> 00:32:59,711
if we used their corporate credit card.

510
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,422
He said yes, so I paid for mine
on the spot and left.

511
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,299
How much did you pay?

512
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:07,177
The most expensive membership
is 200 million won.

513
00:33:07,261 --> 00:33:08,554
It's usually for about 20 years,

514
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:10,347
so I multiplied it by 365,
and it was 7,300.

515
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:13,392
Then it's about 27,397 won per day
after dividing 200 million by 7,300 days.

516
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:17,020
Round it up to 28,000 won.
The green fee was about 150,000 won,

517
00:33:17,104 --> 00:33:18,689
and the cart was 20,000 won per person.

518
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:20,524
On top of that, the caddie fee was
30,000 won per person.

519
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:22,526
So I paid 228,000 won in total.

520
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:27,948
What? My GPA was second-highest
in the entire Natural Science division.

521
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:30,951
Right, I'm relieved.

522
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:34,538
Gosh. Knowing how much you love golf,

523
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:37,708
I was worried you might've hung out
with them without thinking.

524
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:40,294
Jeong-won.

525
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:42,754
These days,

526
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,174
I'm not even thinking about golf.

527
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:47,968
Bye.

528
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:51,847
Goodness.

529
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:56,768
Professor, did you go there too?

530
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,563
Did you play golf last weekend?

531
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:01,481
It's none of your business! It's personal.

532
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:04,067
Why are you interrogating me like this?

533
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:05,902
Gosh, you're such a nuisance.

534
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,989
Hey, you keep acting up these days.

535
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:10,782
Enough. Mind your own business.

536
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:14,453
Then tell me what you did last weekend.

537
00:34:16,246 --> 00:34:17,581
What did you do last weekend?

538
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,125
I ate <i>jajangmyeon</i>.

539
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,002
<i>Jajangmyeon</i>? What?

540
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,048
I had <i>buljajangmyeon</i>. Are we good now?

541
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:32,888
Good call.

542
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:42,064
BEST MENU: <i>BULJAJANGMYEON</i>
NEW MENU: NUKE <i>BULJAJANGMYEON</i>

543
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,986
Look at this name. It's so gutsy.

544
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:49,821
Don't your colleagues complain?

545
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:51,406
Even our commander is a regular here.

546
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:58,747
AUTHENTIC CHINESE RESTAURANT
NUCLEAR KITCHEN

547
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,625
Enjoy.

548
00:35:04,127 --> 00:35:06,296
It's one level below
the one we had last week.

549
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:10,258
-Which level is this?
-Level Four. Last week, we had Level Five.

550
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:13,261
-Were you okay last week?
-I almost had to go to the ER.

551
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:19,393
I can definitely handle spicy food,
but the one we had last week was hard.

552
00:35:19,476 --> 00:35:22,187
This one looks quite spicy too.

553
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:26,525
The <i>buljajangmyeon</i> here should be used
as the ROKA's new secret weapon.

554
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:30,320
Watch what you say.
My unit is right across the street.

555
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:33,407
Who cares? My girlfriend is a major.

556
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,242
I bet only a handful of people
outrank you.

557
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:38,870
No, there are so many officers
who outrank me. There's a ton.

558
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:41,832
A lieutenant general, then a general?

559
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:47,421
Jun-wan. You were exempted, weren't you?

560
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:51,883
There's no three-star general
in my division.

561
00:35:52,968 --> 00:35:56,888
I knew it. I wondered how you became
a professor before my brother did.

562
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:02,644
That's right. I was exempted.

563
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:08,233
What do you say? Do you want
to hear my story? It's very long.

564
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:10,485
No, thanks. I'm sure you had your reason.

565
00:36:10,986 --> 00:36:14,865
By the way, did you just mix
my <i>jajangmyeon</i> for me?

566
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,450
Yes.

567
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:20,912
I'm so touched.

568
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,165
What? This is nothing.

569
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:30,881
Do you do this for my brother
or your roomie, Jeong-won?

570
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:32,090
Hell no.

571
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:36,178
Why would I do it for them?
We're always busy stuffing our own faces.

572
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:37,721
I don't even do it for my mom.

573
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:38,805
Because it's you...

574
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:44,394
I only do it for you.

575
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:28,480
Did you get an emergency call already?

576
00:37:28,563 --> 00:37:30,065
No, I'm late.

577
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:32,526
Don't you still have some time
until your rounds?

578
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:34,736
I'm late for breakfast.
I never skip breakfast.

579
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,279
Oh, Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul is here.

580
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:38,990
What? It's fall already?

581
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:41,117
Gosh, is fall here already?

582
00:37:41,618 --> 00:37:45,580
Right? I put on this trench coat today
because of her.

583
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:48,208
What are you two talking about?

584
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,795
When you start wearing your denim shirt,
that means fall is here.

585
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:53,964
When we see your white T-shirt,
we know it's summer.

586
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:57,425
For us, you're like an indicator
of the passage of time.

587
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,427
So I'm like your human calendar.

588
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,638
-Exactly.
-Let's go, Dr. Jang.

589
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:05,350
Breakfast is on me
since you informed me that fall is here.

590
00:38:06,643 --> 00:38:08,353
You'll buy me breakfast?

591
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:12,190
Yes, Professor Kim Jun-wan
gave me his card.

592
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,026
He gave me this yesterday,
but I haven't returned it.

593
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:20,115
Something good must've happened to him.
He's always in a good mood.

594
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,534
I bet he has no idea
that I still have his card.

595
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:24,202
Let's hurry.

596
00:38:28,164 --> 00:38:29,791
A male patient, age 29.

597
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,210
Based on his MRI,
it looks like he has an astrocytoma.

598
00:38:32,794 --> 00:38:35,630
The tumor is in the dominant hemisphere,
and the size is about 7cm.

599
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:39,259
We'll have him get a navigation CT
and a TFCA this afternoon.

600
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:42,929
Doctor.
The surgery won't be difficult, right?

601
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:48,393
Everyone around us is worried, saying
awake surgery is a difficult procedure.

602
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,229
There aren't any easy brain surgeries.

603
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:53,356
Awake surgery
is an especially complicated procedure.

604
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:57,569
As I explained before, Hyeon-su's tumor

605
00:38:57,652 --> 00:39:00,989
has seeped into his normal brain tissues,
so the divide has been blurred.

606
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,074
That's why I think
awake surgery will be helpful.

607
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:08,121
Based on my experience, it's highly likely
that the tumor is affecting

608
00:39:08,204 --> 00:39:10,957
the parts of his brain
that perform important functions.

609
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,460
We'll wake him up briefly
during the surgery

610
00:39:13,543 --> 00:39:17,380
so that we can remove the tumor
while checking his neurological symptoms.

611
00:39:17,464 --> 00:39:19,633
He's still young,

612
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:23,345
so it's very important to minimize
post-surgical neurological complications.

613
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,096
How long will the surgery take?

614
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:28,016
It all depends,

615
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,560
but it usually takes seven to eight hours.

616
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:34,481
And the amount of time
the patient is kept awake can vary,

617
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:36,942
but I'd say it usually ranges
from 30 minutes to an hour.

618
00:39:38,193 --> 00:39:40,528
I'll quickly figure out brain functions
around the tumor

619
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:43,114
so that we can minimize
the time he has to stay awake for.

620
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,408
The experience
can traumatize some patients.

621
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:47,035
Okay.

622
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,995
You have a day before the surgery,

623
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,707
so let us know if you're too scared
or concerned.

624
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,334
Your condition matters the most.

625
00:39:55,377 --> 00:39:57,671
I don't care.

626
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,090
I'll do as you say.

627
00:40:00,757 --> 00:40:05,720
Hyeon-su, you can work again
after you get this surgery.

628
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,639
Don't be so listless.

629
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:09,933
How can I go back to work?

630
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:12,811
Stop talking nonsense, Mom.

631
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:16,564
Why not? You can totally do it.

632
00:40:16,856 --> 00:40:20,694
I heard you're a cop.
It's very difficult to become a cop.

633
00:40:20,777 --> 00:40:24,114
You even passed that difficult exam,
so don't be like this.

634
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,325
Hyeon-su, you can get through this.

635
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:32,872
Doctor, I don't care whether or not
he can go back to being a cop.

636
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:34,124
Please

637
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,501
just save my son.

638
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:39,754
Yes, we'll do our very best.

639
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,381
See you.

640
00:40:47,887 --> 00:40:49,723
What happened
with Sin Mi-jin's liver index?

641
00:40:50,265 --> 00:40:51,891
Her ALT is over 300.

642
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:53,059
ALT: A TRANSAMINASE ENZYME

643
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:55,353
Her bilirubin is over 10 as well.

644
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:56,980
HIGH LEVELS OF BILIRUBIN CAUSES JAUNDICE

645
00:40:57,147 --> 00:40:59,733
The rejection reaction was low.
Why did it suddenly spike?

646
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,318
I actually ran into her in the hallway.

647
00:41:02,986 --> 00:41:04,946
Well, I'll tell you later.

648
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,450
I don't feel

649
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:12,704
so bad. I feel all right.

650
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:15,206
You're not all right.
These numbers tell me that you need

651
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,168
to check in right away for tests
and treatment. It's not looking good.

652
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:21,796
Have you been taking your medication?

653
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,843
It doesn't look like
you've been taking it.

654
00:41:33,808 --> 00:41:36,478
To me, it seems like you've been
off your medication for a while.

655
00:41:37,312 --> 00:41:39,022
Did something happen?

656
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:43,193
If you continue to skip your medication,

657
00:41:43,276 --> 00:41:46,404
your liver will get all ruined,
and you may need another transplant.

658
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:48,782
The liver won't function.
Let's get you checked in.

659
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:49,741
No,

660
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,243
I don't want to be hospitalized.

661
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,540
I just want to die, Doctor.

662
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,461
What are you talking about?

663
00:42:02,045 --> 00:42:04,798
I worked very hard on your surgery.
Please don't say that to me.

664
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:07,008
Let's get you admitted
and get a CT scan of your liver.

665
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:09,969
Then, we'll run a biopsy
while doing your ultrasound.

666
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:11,930
We'll also treat transplant rejection.

667
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:19,104
He's a nine-year-old boy, who complained
of pain in his right abdomen,

668
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:21,106
so I took a CT and it showed appendicitis.

669
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:23,983
He has a fever and a high level of CRP.

670
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:26,402
Since when did it start to hurt?

671
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:28,571
Last night.

672
00:42:28,905 --> 00:42:32,450
Oh, no. Let me take a look. All right.

673
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:36,246
I'll talk to the guardian.

674
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:38,623
Dr. Jang, please call Anesthesiology now.

675
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:39,707
Okay.

676
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,876
-Hello, Professor Ahn.
-Hi.

677
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,961
Professor Ahn.

678
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:45,338
Can we watch a movie together next time?

679
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,508
Sure. Let's watch one together
when we have time.

680
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:50,301
Bye.

681
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:55,014
What do you mean, "next time"?

682
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:57,058
Did you two meet in private?

683
00:42:57,142 --> 00:43:00,311
Yes. I had dinner
with Professor Ahn last weekend.

684
00:43:00,895 --> 00:43:02,480
Just the two of us? Outside the hospital?

685
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:05,733
Yes. Just the two of us,
outside the hospital.

686
00:43:05,942 --> 00:43:07,318
In our own clothes, not in scrubs.

687
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:10,780
Did Professor Ahn ask you
to have dinner with him?

688
00:43:11,614 --> 00:43:12,824
Well, I asked him.

689
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:14,534
I asked him to buy me dinner.

690
00:43:14,617 --> 00:43:18,496
My gosh. Professor Ahn is known
to buy a lot of people meals.

691
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,457
He has a get-together
with the nurses often, too.

692
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,793
-I thought it was different.
-It was just us.

693
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:25,962
It doesn't matter
if it was just with you or 20 people.

694
00:43:26,045 --> 00:43:28,131
When people ask him to buy them a meal,
he always does.

695
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,843
Dr. Bae. You know what?

696
00:43:31,926 --> 00:43:35,638
I even watched a movie with Professor Ahn.
I'm serious.

697
00:43:35,722 --> 00:43:38,224
Goodness. You got me there!

698
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:50,653
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

699
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,298
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

700
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,469
<i>I have a photo of you,
so I can look at your photo.</i>

701
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,138
<i>I don't have a photo of you. Send me one.</i>

702
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,723
<i>Send me the best photo of you.</i>

703
00:44:09,673 --> 00:44:11,466
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

704
00:44:12,551 --> 00:44:15,637
<i>I have a photo of you,
so I can look at your photo.</i>

705
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:18,306
<i>I don't have a photo of you. Send me one.</i>

706
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,891
<i>Send me the best photo of you.</i>

707
00:44:35,448 --> 00:44:37,409
My goodness.

708
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,001
Who is it?

709
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:48,169
Who is it that you're so crazy about?

710
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:50,005
It's my mom.

711
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:53,216
Let's go. I'm hungry.

712
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,218
Give me a second. Let me change first.

713
00:44:55,302 --> 00:44:56,344
Wait.

714
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:11,234
Jeong-won, you told the gang
to meet us in the basement, right?

715
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:12,861
We're only taking my car.

716
00:45:13,153 --> 00:45:14,154
You do it.

717
00:45:14,237 --> 00:45:15,739
Why do I always have to do that?

718
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:18,533
Because you did it already.

719
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:23,204
Let's go.
They said they'd meet us downstairs.

720
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:24,956
Okay.

721
00:45:38,929 --> 00:45:40,013
What are you doing?

722
00:45:40,555 --> 00:45:43,224
Do you think we're in <i>Reply 1988</i>?
That's such an old trick.

723
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,310
What about you? Are you in <i>Seoul Claypot</i>?

724
00:45:45,393 --> 00:45:46,394
Jeez.

725
00:45:47,562 --> 00:45:49,022
Should I buy you Bluetooth earphones?

726
00:45:49,105 --> 00:45:51,775
These are more comfortable.
I just need to plug them in.

727
00:45:51,858 --> 00:45:53,485
I don't have to use Bluetooth.

728
00:45:53,568 --> 00:45:56,154
What? You just need to plug them in
to listen to songs? How--

729
00:45:57,739 --> 00:45:59,908
Hey, give them to me. Let me try them.

730
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,701
What? Did that prick get a new car?

731
00:46:01,785 --> 00:46:03,036
Really? Where?

732
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,038
He really did. When did he get a new car?

733
00:46:10,085 --> 00:46:12,087
Hey, hop in.

734
00:46:12,963 --> 00:46:14,839
Oh, my. Showing off your car now?

735
00:46:15,757 --> 00:46:18,426
Hey, he's just too old
to show off things, right?

736
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,470
-Take the passenger seat, Song-hwa.
-Thanks.

737
00:46:20,553 --> 00:46:23,139
-I'm starving. Did you make a reservation?
-Of course.

738
00:46:23,223 --> 00:46:25,642
-Three orders of spicy pork and duck?
-Yes. Let's go.

739
00:46:35,485 --> 00:46:36,611
You want to listen to music?

740
00:46:36,695 --> 00:46:39,322
Yes. We should listen to the song
we'll practice this week.

741
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:42,450
This car smells nice.
I think it's women's perfume.

742
00:46:42,534 --> 00:46:43,910
He is dating someone.

743
00:46:43,994 --> 00:46:45,537
I'm 100 percent it's hers.

744
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,288
He's been glued to his phone.

745
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:48,957
No, I'm not.

746
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,710
The fragrance of the perfume

747
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:56,297
and the scent of nature are mixed
with a ratio of 5.5 and 4.5.

748
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:58,341
I don't think she's from the city.

749
00:46:58,425 --> 00:46:59,718
She either works outside

750
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:01,511
or sweats a lot on the job.

751
00:47:01,636 --> 00:47:03,346
-Really?
-She either lives

752
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,597
in Gangwon Province or farms.

753
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:06,224
Do you have a dog's nose?

754
00:47:07,142 --> 00:47:09,978
I was just making stuff up.
Did you see his face?

755
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:11,938
One of these must be true.

756
00:47:12,355 --> 00:47:14,190
Song-hwa, should we listen to music?

757
00:47:14,274 --> 00:47:16,776
Yes, I want to listen to music,

758
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,571
but the Bluetooth isn't working.
Have you tried it before?

759
00:47:19,654 --> 00:47:21,531
-Hey, forget about the music.
-Yes, I answer phone calls

760
00:47:21,614 --> 00:47:23,408
-and listen to music!
-Jun-wan, who is she?

761
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:26,411
-Was it a blind date? An arranged meeting?
-No, I didn't go on a blind date.

762
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:30,540
It's not working.

763
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:33,668
Jun-wan, it's not working
because it's connected to your phone.

764
00:47:33,752 --> 00:47:35,336
Jun-wan, do I know her?

765
00:47:36,713 --> 00:47:38,840
Hey, do we know this lady?

766
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:42,093
My friend, does she work at the hospital
or did we know her from school?

767
00:47:42,177 --> 00:47:43,595
Song-hwa, lower the volume.

768
00:47:43,678 --> 00:47:46,306
No, don't. Can you increase the volume?
Please. I'm begging you.

769
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:48,767
My gosh. Why isn't this connecting?

770
00:47:50,143 --> 00:47:51,019
What?

771
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:51,936
MY LOVELY <i>BIDULGI</i>

772
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,438
Jun-wan.

773
00:47:53,521 --> 00:47:55,482
Someone saved as <i>Bidulgi</i> is calling you.

774
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:00,487
Hey, eyes on the road.
Will you kill us all?

775
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,448
Baby... I mean Jeong-won, can you
take out my phone in the bag?

776
00:48:03,531 --> 00:48:05,116
Take it out and decline the call.

777
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,202
I see. Your phone is in your bag, sweetie?

778
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,537
-Sure, sweetie.
-Jeong-won, quickly. Hurry.

779
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:11,623
No, forget it. Jeong-won, leave it.

780
00:48:11,706 --> 00:48:12,540
Hello.

781
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:14,542
-Your cell phone.
-Hello. Hi.

782
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:16,086
Hey, we're here.

783
00:48:16,169 --> 00:48:18,463
-There are a lot of empty parking spots.
-Yes.

784
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:20,715
Where's your phone, sweetie?

785
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:22,217
Mom?

786
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,928
I'm out with my friends to have dinner.

787
00:48:25,011 --> 00:48:26,304
<i>Jun-wan has a girlfriend.</i>

788
00:48:26,387 --> 00:48:28,389
<i>Her name is </i>Bigulgi,<i> as in "dove." </i>

789
00:48:29,015 --> 00:48:32,227
<i>-Bi is a unique last name, right?
-Bi as in "Rain"?</i>

790
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:33,937
Okay.

791
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,105
-I found it.
-Give me that.

792
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,358
Hello?

793
00:48:38,858 --> 00:48:41,611
I'm Kim Jun-wan's friend, Lee Ik-jun.

794
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,572
He can't answer the phone right now.

795
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:46,658
If I may, please tell me your name.

796
00:48:46,741 --> 00:48:48,743
I'll make sure I tell him--

797
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:52,163
I would like to do that,
but he took the phone.

798
00:48:52,247 --> 00:48:53,081
Yes.

799
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:54,916
Okay. Yes.

800
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:57,210
I'm starving.
They serve <i>nurungji,</i> too, right?

801
00:48:57,293 --> 00:48:59,420
Yes. They serve <i>nurungji</i>
and perilla seed <i>sujuebi</i>.

802
00:48:59,504 --> 00:49:00,880
Jun-wan, we'll be inside.

803
00:49:00,964 --> 00:49:02,882
It's already getting chilly.

804
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:05,009
It's pretty chilly at night.

805
00:49:05,093 --> 00:49:06,094
It's autumn now.

806
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:08,388
This chilly weather
is making me miss my sister.

807
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:10,473
That never happened to me.

808
00:49:12,267 --> 00:49:15,228
Even so, I think
it's better that you tell her.

809
00:49:16,437 --> 00:49:17,438
Really?

810
00:49:19,649 --> 00:49:20,650
I really can't decide.

811
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:23,611
Of course, you should tell your mom.
Why are you even thinking about it?

812
00:49:24,112 --> 00:49:25,864
Don't make her feel like a fool.

813
00:49:25,947 --> 00:49:27,740
You should tell her everything
that everyone knows,

814
00:49:27,824 --> 00:49:30,243
so she divorces your dad right away
and lives a better life.

815
00:49:30,326 --> 00:49:32,203
He's worried because of her health.

816
00:49:32,287 --> 00:49:34,330
What if he tells her
and she collapses again

817
00:49:34,414 --> 00:49:35,790
from the shock? What then?

818
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:37,792
But at the same time,

819
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,295
I think she should know about it.

820
00:49:43,673 --> 00:49:47,510
Are you and Song-hwa possessed
by ghosts who'd starved for years?

821
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:49,429
I have three older brothers.

822
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:51,097
I'm really possessed by a ghost.

823
00:49:51,848 --> 00:49:53,266
-Jeong-won, water, please.
-Okay.

824
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:55,602
Ma'am.

825
00:49:57,729 --> 00:50:00,648
I should tell her, so it gets rid of
the slightest affection she has left.

826
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:03,526
Well, I don't think there's
any ounce of affection left.

827
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:06,446
But then,
I thought it would be better to tell her

828
00:50:06,654 --> 00:50:08,448
to get a divorce
since that lady is pregnant,

829
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:10,575
so that Mom could live freely
without any stress.

830
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:12,493
But then again,

831
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:15,121
they are already strangers.

832
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:17,707
And what if her health gets worse
because of the shock?

833
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:19,375
I really don't want that.

834
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:21,294
But wouldn't it better to tell her?

835
00:50:21,377 --> 00:50:22,337
I agree.

836
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:24,255
What about you?

837
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,883
Tell her or don't?

838
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:28,968
You should tell her.

839
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:32,096
What should I do?

840
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,599
-Just tell her.
-Tell her.

841
00:50:34,682 --> 00:50:36,643
Hey, Song-hwa. What do you think?

842
00:50:38,394 --> 00:50:39,520
Well,

843
00:50:40,188 --> 00:50:41,648
I agree. I think you should tell her.

844
00:50:41,731 --> 00:50:42,857
Really?

845
00:50:43,524 --> 00:50:46,027
Yes. I think she should know.

846
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,695
Let her down gently.

847
00:50:48,196 --> 00:50:50,573
Make sure to comfort her
before and after telling the news.

848
00:50:50,657 --> 00:50:52,200
Okay. I'll tell her.

849
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:55,328
We've been telling you that for ten
minutes. You never take our advice.

850
00:50:55,411 --> 00:50:58,623
If you are going to do this,
you should just ask her for the advice.

851
00:50:58,706 --> 00:51:00,166
Go drink some tea separately.

852
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,918
We're just fillers here.

853
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:03,753
The owner personally dug up the arrowroot,

854
00:51:03,836 --> 00:51:06,422
and it's on us, too.

855
00:51:06,506 --> 00:51:08,174
Does anyone want it?

856
00:51:09,384 --> 00:51:11,135
Okay. Please wait.

857
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:12,220
I'll bring it over.

858
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:14,055
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

859
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:17,058
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

860
00:51:18,768 --> 00:51:20,270
Hey, you did well.

861
00:51:21,354 --> 00:51:23,064
Your mother is okay, right?

862
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:26,234
Yes, she took the news
better than I expected.

863
00:51:27,193 --> 00:51:28,569
At first, she was really shocked.

864
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:31,364
She didn't say a word for ten minutes,
so I was worried.

865
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:34,617
But I comforted her afterward.
She's divorcing him.

866
00:51:35,201 --> 00:51:37,620
She said she wanted to emigrate
because she's humiliated.

867
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:45,253
It's all right. You guys managed to get
through such an unpleasant incident.

868
00:51:46,212 --> 00:51:48,423
You weren't in your office,
so I knew you'd be here.

869
00:51:51,259 --> 00:51:53,761
You should have at least dried
your hair. Goodness.

870
00:51:53,845 --> 00:51:56,264
I guess you couldn't wait
to tell Song-hwa.

871
00:51:58,391 --> 00:52:01,185
You haven't seen him yet, right?
But I guess he told you right away.

872
00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:02,854
What are you talking about?

873
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:06,566
We were just talking about
how he told her about the pregnancy.

874
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,651
Why? Is something going on?

875
00:52:09,736 --> 00:52:12,905
Seok-hyeong's father got admitted
to the hospital last night.

876
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:14,991
At our hospital. He's in VIP Room Three.

877
00:52:15,575 --> 00:52:17,035
Is he sick?

878
00:52:17,118 --> 00:52:18,870
No, he's faking it.

879
00:52:20,955 --> 00:52:24,292
He kept getting summoned by the court,
so I think he got admitted here.

880
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,169
He didn't request me as his physician.

881
00:52:26,252 --> 00:52:29,130
I think his secretary directly
called the hospital director.

882
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:34,135
Hey. Visit him later.

883
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:36,054
I'll go with you later.

884
00:52:36,637 --> 00:52:38,014
It's time to meet the outpatients.

885
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:45,855
Jun-wan. Do not treat Chairman Yang.

886
00:52:47,148 --> 00:52:47,982
Okay?

887
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,443
Yes.

888
00:52:54,781 --> 00:52:56,449
She took the morning medication

889
00:52:56,532 --> 00:52:58,701
because Nurse Song
literally begged her to take it.

890
00:52:58,785 --> 00:53:00,453
But I don't know
if she'll take it tonight.

891
00:53:00,536 --> 00:53:02,538
Judging from this morning,
I doubt that she will.

892
00:53:02,705 --> 00:53:05,416
I get that she hates her husband,
but if her health deteriorates,

893
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,417
it's her loss.

894
00:53:07,085 --> 00:53:08,669
I can somewhat understand her.

895
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:11,547
It doesn't matter if her husband donated
his liver. He cheated on her.

896
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:14,008
Would you want to live
with the liver of a cheating husband?

897
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:17,387
She probably hates her husband
and her new liver. I'd hate everything.

898
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,972
Even so, she has to take her medication.

899
00:53:20,556 --> 00:53:21,933
Did you sleep well?

900
00:53:22,016 --> 00:53:24,519
Yes, I slept well. It's been a while
since I had good sleep.

901
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:26,646
I'm glad to hear that.
You must exercise a lot.

902
00:53:26,729 --> 00:53:28,606
Try to walk the hallways whenever you can.

903
00:53:28,689 --> 00:53:30,858
Yes. I went back and forth
ten times yesterday.

904
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,486
I think I can even participate
in the Olympics.

905
00:53:33,986 --> 00:53:37,281
Doctor, are you married?

906
00:53:37,865 --> 00:53:38,699
Pardon?

907
00:53:39,158 --> 00:53:41,077
Why do you ask?
Are you going to set him up?

908
00:53:41,702 --> 00:53:43,454
Yes, I have a younger sister.

909
00:53:43,538 --> 00:53:45,373
I want to set you up with my sister.

910
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:47,500
My goodness. Oh, my.

911
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,919
I'm married. And I have a son, too.

912
00:53:50,378 --> 00:53:54,257
I should've known. Women wouldn't
have let a fine man like you alone.

913
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,883
No, I married late.

914
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:57,760
I wonder what lucky woman married you.

915
00:53:57,844 --> 00:53:59,137
It's a pity you are married.

916
00:53:59,887 --> 00:54:02,390
Seriously, you're my type.

917
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:04,225
My gosh.

918
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:08,020
Goodness, you're flattering me.
Your husband is here.

919
00:54:08,104 --> 00:54:10,898
I mean, look at you, Doctor.
You're handsome.

920
00:54:11,399 --> 00:54:13,359
And I bet you got good grades.

921
00:54:13,443 --> 00:54:15,862
You're so amiable and great at your job.

922
00:54:16,571 --> 00:54:19,115
You're totally my type. My gosh.

923
00:54:19,198 --> 00:54:21,742
But my husband is a slug.

924
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:24,787
But he has such a likable face
and a good build.

925
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:26,956
He does, doesn't he?

926
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:28,166
He runs a jewelry shop.

927
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:30,793
He has a shop in Ssangmun-dong.
It's called Phoenix Shop.

928
00:54:30,877 --> 00:54:31,878
I see.

929
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:37,091
I picked it up on my way here.

930
00:54:38,968 --> 00:54:40,761
My gosh, no. I should get going.

931
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:43,598
Doctor, it's coming
from the bottom of my heart.

932
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:46,851
I want to give you everything I have.
I am so grateful for your help.

933
00:54:46,934 --> 00:54:48,686
My son won this at a contest.

934
00:54:48,769 --> 00:54:50,813
No, I can't accept this.
If I do, I'll be in trouble.

935
00:54:50,897 --> 00:54:52,857
-I'm serious.
-Doctor, it's from my heart.

936
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,359
You saved my wife.
I am so thankful for it.

937
00:54:55,443 --> 00:54:57,069
-Please accept this.
-Wait.

938
00:54:57,153 --> 00:54:58,362
I'll be back later.

939
00:54:58,446 --> 00:55:00,198
-Bye.
-Doctor.

940
00:55:00,281 --> 00:55:01,782
-What?
-Rest up, ma'am.

941
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:03,743
I guess doctors can't accept
gifts these days.

942
00:55:03,826 --> 00:55:06,037
How is the baby?
The baby is active, right?

943
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,956
-Yes.
-It's been 24 weeks now.

944
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:13,544
All right. The black part on the scan
is the amniotic fluid.

945
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:15,379
When you look at the scan...

946
00:55:19,425 --> 00:55:21,219
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

947
00:55:24,972 --> 00:55:26,599
Hello. What is this about?

948
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,229
<i>I had a bad feeling about it in case--</i>

949
00:55:31,312 --> 00:55:33,689
Okay. I got it.

950
00:55:39,946 --> 00:55:41,030
I'm sorry.

951
00:56:05,513 --> 00:56:08,057
I guess they don't use that
anymore these days.

952
00:56:18,317 --> 00:56:19,777
Hello, Ms. Sin.

953
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:22,488
Hello.

954
00:56:22,572 --> 00:56:23,823
Did you eat?

955
00:56:23,906 --> 00:56:25,491
She ate very little.

956
00:56:25,575 --> 00:56:26,867
Why?

957
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,661
You should eat a lot.

958
00:56:28,744 --> 00:56:30,621
Hospital meals are expensive.

959
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:33,291
You should eat a lot.
That's a waste of money if you don't.

960
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:34,959
Doctor,

961
00:56:36,377 --> 00:56:38,212
I'm sure you heard about my situation.

962
00:56:38,296 --> 00:56:40,590
That my husband cheated on me.

963
00:56:42,842 --> 00:56:43,759
Yes.

964
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:48,306
Because he's having an affair
with another woman,

965
00:56:48,681 --> 00:56:51,851
he felt guilty, so that's why
he gave me a piece of his liver.

966
00:56:52,393 --> 00:56:54,312
To feel better about himself.

967
00:56:55,104 --> 00:56:56,647
I'm sure that's not true.

968
00:56:57,148 --> 00:57:00,901
Your husband took very good care of you
when you got the transplant surgery.

969
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,905
He held my hand and cried a lot at night.

970
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:07,992
You're very naive.

971
00:57:09,744 --> 00:57:13,831
It sounds like you lived a good life
without undergoing any hardships.

972
00:57:15,374 --> 00:57:16,751
How do you feel today?

973
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:20,963
Luckily, the CT scan shows
the biliary duct isn't stretched.

974
00:57:21,047 --> 00:57:23,382
You didn't take any immunosuppressants,

975
00:57:23,466 --> 00:57:25,843
so your body had
acute transplantation rejection.

976
00:57:25,926 --> 00:57:27,803
We'll treat it
with a high dose of steroids.

977
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:30,014
And once you start taking
immunosuppressants,

978
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:32,350
you'll recover, so don't worry.

979
00:57:33,476 --> 00:57:35,186
I'm not worried, Doctor.

980
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:39,357
I don't want

981
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:43,194
to live with his liver.

982
00:57:45,571 --> 00:57:46,864
Goodness.

983
00:57:48,783 --> 00:57:52,953
I had no idea that my husband was
cheating on me with a younger woman.

984
00:57:53,162 --> 00:57:55,122
I even made a deep bow to him.

985
00:57:56,832 --> 00:57:58,292
Gosh.

986
00:57:59,627 --> 00:58:01,962
Doctor, he gave me a piece of his liver,

987
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:05,216
so he wouldn't feel guilty
about the affair.

988
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,802
He was just sorry.

989
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:11,597
I'm sure that's not true.
Your husband can't be that evil.

990
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,937
Doctor, everything in this world seems
beautiful and kind to you, right?

991
00:58:20,439 --> 00:58:24,402
People who were raised by rich parents
and had a good education

992
00:58:24,485 --> 00:58:26,278
will never understand me.

993
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,698
I don't need you to understand me.

994
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:30,658
And what's the point if you do?

995
00:58:32,451 --> 00:58:34,995
-Help me go to the restroom.
-Okay.

996
00:58:46,424 --> 00:58:47,758
WOMEN'S TOILET

997
00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:56,851
Excuse me.

998
00:58:57,184 --> 00:58:58,352
Yes?

999
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:08,320
-This is good.
-Yes.

1000
00:59:14,493 --> 00:59:15,870
Are there reporters outside?

1001
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:16,954
No.

1002
00:59:19,915 --> 00:59:20,750
Mr. Jeong,

1003
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:25,713
if there's a nurse outside, ask her
to give me an IV drip or something.

1004
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,673
It can be a vitamin IV drip
or just saline.

1005
00:59:27,757 --> 00:59:29,800
People could barge in here
out of the blue.

1006
00:59:31,677 --> 00:59:36,307
This person here
told me not to let anyone inside.

1007
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:39,185
I even got permission
from the hospital director--

1008
00:59:39,268 --> 00:59:40,352
Hey.

1009
00:59:45,775 --> 00:59:47,777
So this is how he addresses me.

1010
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,195
My name

1011
00:59:50,321 --> 00:59:51,489
is this person.

1012
00:59:53,783 --> 00:59:56,118
You really can't address me properly?

1013
00:59:56,869 --> 01:00:00,122
Why don't you call me
by my name, Tae-yeon?

1014
01:00:01,165 --> 01:00:02,416
I'll be outside.

1015
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:05,044
And I'll tell the nurse
that you want an IV drip.

1016
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:07,254
-Okay.
-Unbelievable.

1017
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,840
Is he looking down on me?

1018
01:00:10,925 --> 01:00:12,885
I'll talk to him.

1019
01:00:13,594 --> 01:00:15,971
He’s new, so he doesn’t know how to act.

1020
01:00:16,055 --> 01:00:18,891
No, it’s because
he knows exactly how to act.

1021
01:00:18,974 --> 01:00:20,142
When he started his job,

1022
01:00:20,226 --> 01:00:22,937
-it was obvious that I'm your wife.
-Yes.

1023
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:26,315
But from the first day he started,
he's been looking at me suspiciously.

1024
01:00:27,107 --> 01:00:31,529
"I see. You're the mistress
people talked about."

1025
01:00:33,322 --> 01:00:35,282
That's what he was saying with his eyes.

1026
01:00:36,909 --> 01:00:38,536
You can come back later.

1027
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:45,709
What are you--

1028
01:00:47,378 --> 01:00:48,295
You crazy bitch!

1029
01:00:48,379 --> 01:00:49,630
I should ask you that.

1030
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:51,131
Are you out of your mind?

1031
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:53,259
How dare you come here?

1032
01:00:53,342 --> 01:00:55,886
How dare you come to the hospital
your son works?

1033
01:00:56,679 --> 01:00:57,888
Aren't you even embarrassed?

1034
01:00:57,972 --> 01:00:59,098
Or humiliated?

1035
01:00:59,682 --> 01:01:02,184
Did you come to the hospital
your son works with your mistress

1036
01:01:02,268 --> 01:01:04,520
to show people
that you're living such a wonderful life?

1037
01:01:04,603 --> 01:01:06,730
-Hey!
-You be quiet.

1038
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:07,773
Shut up.

1039
01:01:08,899 --> 01:01:10,109
Leave now.

1040
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:13,028
Stop humiliating my son.

1041
01:01:13,112 --> 01:01:15,364
Leave the hospital now, you asshole!

1042
01:01:15,656 --> 01:01:17,074
Mom, let's go.

1043
01:01:17,157 --> 01:01:18,742
Why did you come here?

1044
01:01:18,826 --> 01:01:20,035
Let's just go. Please?

1045
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:21,954
Let go. Let go of me.

1046
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:27,042
You want me to divorce you? Never.

1047
01:01:28,168 --> 01:01:29,753
Taking care of my health is hard enough,

1048
01:01:30,671 --> 01:01:33,257
so up until yesterday,
I was going to divorce you.

1049
01:01:33,674 --> 01:01:36,468
But I'm disgusted by your behaviors,

1050
01:01:37,052 --> 01:01:38,429
so I will never divorce you.

1051
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:41,599
Before you or I die,

1052
01:01:41,891 --> 01:01:43,058
I will not divorce you.

1053
01:01:44,685 --> 01:01:48,230
You, quit dreaming. You will be
his cohabitant for the rest of his life.

1054
01:01:48,814 --> 01:01:49,940
And so will be your child.

1055
01:01:50,024 --> 01:01:51,358
Gosh.

1056
01:02:01,368 --> 01:02:02,411
Cottonoid.

1057
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,303
Doctor, let's wake up the patient.

1058
01:02:19,887 --> 01:02:20,846
Okay.

1059
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:32,650
ELAPSED TIME

1060
01:02:36,028 --> 01:02:37,738
Can you lift your arm?

1061
01:02:39,448 --> 01:02:42,785
Good job. All right. Squeeze my hand.

1062
01:02:45,454 --> 01:02:46,664
He squeezed my hand.

1063
01:02:49,249 --> 01:02:51,043
His facial muscles moved.

1064
01:03:00,052 --> 01:03:01,220
Let's do a language test now.

1065
01:03:01,303 --> 01:03:02,179
Okay.

1066
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:05,182
How are you holding up? Are you all right?

1067
01:03:05,766 --> 01:03:08,143
Yes. I'm okay.

1068
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:10,854
Where do you live, Hyeon-su?

1069
01:03:15,943 --> 01:03:18,612
Sadang-dong, Dongjak-gu.

1070
01:03:18,696 --> 01:03:20,656
Do you have any siblings?

1071
01:03:22,157 --> 01:03:24,952
I have a younger sister.

1072
01:03:25,536 --> 01:03:26,954
You're doing great.

1073
01:03:28,288 --> 01:03:30,541
What do you do? What's your job?

1074
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:33,210
Well...

1075
01:03:33,293 --> 01:03:34,712
What do you do?

1076
01:03:34,795 --> 01:03:36,338
I...

1077
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:47,391
Keep talking to him.

1078
01:03:48,726 --> 01:03:50,477
Hyeon-su, aren't you a police officer?

1079
01:03:52,646 --> 01:03:55,232
-Yes.
-Why did you want to be a police officer?

1080
01:03:57,568 --> 01:03:58,819
It had been my dream

1081
01:04:00,612 --> 01:04:02,448
ever since I was seven years old.

1082
01:04:03,657 --> 01:04:04,700
But

1083
01:04:06,702 --> 01:04:07,911
I can't be one anymore

1084
01:04:08,787 --> 01:04:10,622
because I had this surgery.

1085
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:16,045
Hyeon-su, it's almost over.
I'll wrap it up quickly.

1086
01:04:16,128 --> 01:04:18,088
Can you say a few more things?

1087
01:04:18,672 --> 01:04:20,215
You can go back to work.

1088
01:04:20,299 --> 01:04:22,593
Or you can take up another job.
It's not too late.

1089
01:04:24,011 --> 01:04:25,429
I'm too old

1090
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:27,473
to get another job.

1091
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:33,604
When I was 29 years old,

1092
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:35,564
I also got sick.

1093
01:04:39,026 --> 01:04:41,612
I suddenly got sick when I was 29,

1094
01:04:41,695 --> 01:04:42,988
so I left the military.

1095
01:04:44,782 --> 01:04:46,533
What was it?

1096
01:04:47,826 --> 01:04:49,536
What was your illness?

1097
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:53,749
The ligament in the cervical spine
stiffened like a bone.

1098
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:56,919
It was paralyzed during my training.

1099
01:04:58,045 --> 01:04:59,379
What did you do?

1100
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:01,173
What do you think?

1101
01:05:01,715 --> 01:05:03,717
I'm living a great life now.

1102
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,554
Right.

1103
01:05:09,515 --> 01:05:11,266
You became a doctor.

1104
01:05:13,268 --> 01:05:14,895
You can do it, too, Hyeon-su.

1105
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:28,075
Hyeon-su,
once you recover from the surgery,

1106
01:05:28,909 --> 01:05:32,204
you'll be able to start anything you want.

1107
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:34,832
Okay.

1108
01:05:35,624 --> 01:05:36,542
Thank you.

1109
01:05:38,418 --> 01:05:41,505
Chi-hong, I wanted the patient to talk.

1110
01:05:42,089 --> 01:05:43,757
You went on about yourself.

1111
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:46,135
I'm sorry.

1112
01:05:46,927 --> 01:05:48,220
Hyeon-su.

1113
01:05:49,263 --> 01:05:51,640
Good job. It's done.

1114
01:05:51,849 --> 01:05:54,351
I'll remove the tumor as safely as I can.

1115
01:05:54,434 --> 01:05:57,563
Don't worry too much. And get some sleep.

1116
01:05:58,147 --> 01:06:00,107
Okay. Thank you.

1117
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:02,192
Good job.

1118
01:06:04,236 --> 01:06:05,070
Doctor.

1119
01:06:05,154 --> 01:06:06,155
Yes?

1120
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:10,784
Good luck.

1121
01:06:20,252 --> 01:06:22,171
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1122
01:06:22,254 --> 01:06:24,339
Daddy will be a little late tonight.

1123
01:06:24,548 --> 01:06:27,259
<i>Dad, I baked cookies today.</i>

1124
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:29,178
Really? How many did you bake?

1125
01:06:29,261 --> 01:06:31,930
<i>Three. But I ate two of the cookies.</i>

1126
01:06:32,014 --> 01:06:33,974
<i>And I'll give one to Mo-ne.</i>

1127
01:06:34,516 --> 01:06:38,770
My gosh, Mo-ne will be over the moon!
Goodness.

1128
01:06:39,438 --> 01:06:41,064
U-ju, make sure to brush your teeth.

1129
01:06:41,148 --> 01:06:44,109
And I'll see you in your dream. Goodnight.

1130
01:06:44,193 --> 01:06:45,485
<i>Night.</i>

1131
01:06:45,569 --> 01:06:46,695
Okay.

1132
01:06:51,158 --> 01:06:52,534
I see.

1133
01:06:53,076 --> 01:06:55,287
Yes. Right.

1134
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:57,873
Yes, it went well.

1135
01:06:58,707 --> 01:06:59,708
Yes.

1136
01:07:04,838 --> 01:07:06,215
-My gosh, okay.
-Hello.

1137
01:07:08,842 --> 01:07:09,885
Hello.

1138
01:07:11,887 --> 01:07:13,764
Where's your caregiver?

1139
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:17,017
My children stayed with me today.

1140
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,102
She went out to see them off.

1141
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:25,192
You didn't take your medication yet.

1142
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,417
Ms. Sin.

1143
01:07:43,877 --> 01:07:47,172
Your husband made a huge decision
by donating a piece of his liver.

1144
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:55,305
It doesn't matter when he had the affair
and why he decided to donate the liver.

1145
01:07:57,891 --> 01:07:59,518
What he did was incredible.

1146
01:07:59,601 --> 01:08:02,229
He risked his life to donate
a piece of his liver to you.

1147
01:08:06,942 --> 01:08:08,235
You should just

1148
01:08:09,903 --> 01:08:13,282
let your husband live his life
without you.

1149
01:08:19,246 --> 01:08:20,831
You should live your own life now.

1150
01:08:25,877 --> 01:08:27,671
I got divorced
because my wife cheated on me.

1151
01:08:32,384 --> 01:08:33,760
I worked at the hospital all day,

1152
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:36,638
and looked after my son alone.
I really lived hard, but...

1153
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:41,935
She had an affair
with her friend's husband.

1154
01:08:43,312 --> 01:08:44,354
At first,

1155
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,857
it hurt my pride.

1156
01:08:48,275 --> 01:08:49,109
And

1157
01:08:51,695 --> 01:08:53,739
I was embarrassed to face other people.

1158
01:08:53,822 --> 01:08:57,409
I wondered why my life was getting
so difficult. It was really tough.

1159
01:08:59,077 --> 01:09:00,245
But all of a sudden, one day,

1160
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:07,336
I realized how much time I was wasting.

1161
01:09:13,884 --> 01:09:15,260
Wasting my life away like this

1162
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:19,848
because of what she did to me
was doing a disservice to myself.

1163
01:09:30,942 --> 01:09:34,154
My goodness.
You spent a long time being sick.

1164
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:36,198
It was so hard to get your health back.

1165
01:09:36,531 --> 01:09:39,618
For the sake of you, not your husband,
please take the medication.

1166
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:42,371
Give it your all

1167
01:09:43,663 --> 01:09:45,540
to make a full recovery.

1168
01:09:49,461 --> 01:09:51,713
It's your life, after all. Right?

1169
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:04,601
Excuse me.

1170
01:10:06,144 --> 01:10:08,980
Can you bring me a cup of water?

1171
01:10:20,784 --> 01:10:22,077
Thank you.

1172
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,371
Thank you.

1173
01:10:58,697 --> 01:10:59,948
Who is it?

1174
01:11:00,198 --> 01:11:01,283
It's Chi-hong.

1175
01:11:01,783 --> 01:11:02,951
Come in.

1176
01:11:07,038 --> 01:11:09,458
You knew? When?

1177
01:11:11,168 --> 01:11:12,502
Let's see.

1178
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:16,131
The day when you bombed the EVD.

1179
01:11:16,923 --> 01:11:17,924
That's when I found out.

1180
01:11:20,385 --> 01:11:21,970
I checked your record.

1181
01:11:23,054 --> 01:11:25,432
You got discharged as a captain
due to OPLL.

1182
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:27,517
I saw it in your record,
so I went digging.

1183
01:11:28,727 --> 01:11:31,646
You don't have any problems
to live a normal life.

1184
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:35,358
It's a treatable condition with medication
or exercise when caught early in life.

1185
01:11:35,942 --> 01:11:38,320
However, that doesn't apply
to sports or careers

1186
01:11:38,403 --> 01:11:41,114
that require you
to move your body rigorously.

1187
01:11:42,324 --> 01:11:46,119
If you hurt your neck,
it may lead to tetraplegia.

1188
01:11:47,037 --> 01:11:49,372
I really didn't have any problems
with my condition so far.

1189
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,211
Perhaps, it was because
I was very nervous that day.

1190
01:11:55,212 --> 01:11:57,589
During the surgery, my legs went numb.

1191
01:11:58,465 --> 01:12:00,425
And I had a tingling sensation
in my neck, too.

1192
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:05,472
Feeling that pain all over again
after several years

1193
01:12:06,181 --> 01:12:07,557
drove me crazy.

1194
01:12:07,641 --> 01:12:09,267
Why didn't you tell me?

1195
01:12:09,351 --> 01:12:10,477
It's not a serious condition.

1196
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,312
I was going to tell you,

1197
01:12:13,146 --> 01:12:14,773
but I never had the right timing.

1198
01:12:16,316 --> 01:12:18,235
Also, it hurt my pride a bit

1199
01:12:19,194 --> 01:12:20,779
because everyone was so curious about it.

1200
01:12:21,947 --> 01:12:23,990
Where does that pride come from?

1201
01:12:25,325 --> 01:12:26,868
That's some pride you have.

1202
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:28,703
Should I tell you my medical conditions?

1203
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,291
Professor Chae.

1204
01:12:34,334 --> 01:12:37,254
Why didn't you say anything
on the day of the surgery?

1205
01:12:37,337 --> 01:12:40,006
I told you I found out after the surgery.

1206
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:41,466
I mean, I messed up a lot.

1207
01:12:42,175 --> 01:12:44,261
But you didn't say anything in the OR.

1208
01:12:45,136 --> 01:12:46,221
You didn't scold me either.

1209
01:12:49,182 --> 01:12:50,684
I have faith in you.

1210
01:12:54,062 --> 01:12:56,064
You are always diligent.

1211
01:12:56,648 --> 01:12:58,525
And you study and read up
on the patients a lot.

1212
01:12:58,608 --> 01:12:59,693
So I couldn't understand it.

1213
01:13:00,735 --> 01:13:02,737
And I thought
there must have been a reason for it.

1214
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:05,657
So I decided to scold you later

1215
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,951
and look into this first.

1216
01:13:09,744 --> 01:13:12,289
Why? Are you disappointed
that I didn't scold you?

1217
01:13:12,372 --> 01:13:13,248
No.

1218
01:13:16,918 --> 01:13:18,211
If you

1219
01:13:19,045 --> 01:13:21,172
scolded me that day,

1220
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:22,716
I wouldn't have been here today.

1221
01:13:28,847 --> 01:13:30,640
You should have bought me
some drinks, then.

1222
01:13:31,433 --> 01:13:32,892
I was going to.

1223
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:38,690
When I went to the office to take you out,
you had already left to get drinks.

1224
01:13:41,067 --> 01:13:42,736
Oh, right. Darn it.

1225
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:44,946
I'm sorry.

1226
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:46,573
I know that drinking with your colleagues

1227
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:49,034
is more comfortable than with me.

1228
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,078
Anyway,
we'll settle that I bought you drinks.

1229
01:13:54,164 --> 01:13:54,998
Okay.

1230
01:13:56,416 --> 01:13:59,628
I'm dying for a drink, but I happen
to be working the night shift today.

1231
01:14:04,257 --> 01:14:07,594
Seon-bin took your shift.

1232
01:14:08,637 --> 01:14:10,055
She'll be on call tonight for you.

1233
01:14:12,349 --> 01:14:15,894
She said you shouldn't think
about anything else

1234
01:14:16,144 --> 01:14:18,188
and should just go drink a lot tonight.

1235
01:14:21,274 --> 01:14:22,984
My goodness.

1236
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:26,738
And she told you
not to get the wrong idea.

1237
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:29,324
She said she doesn't have
feelings for you.

1238
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:32,619
What are you doing?

1239
01:14:33,745 --> 01:14:34,829
Go change now.

1240
01:14:37,207 --> 01:14:38,208
Okay.

1241
01:14:44,923 --> 01:14:46,424
Yes, I'm heading out, too.

1242
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:47,926
Okay.

1243
01:14:57,394 --> 01:14:58,478
Is it an emergency patient?

1244
01:14:58,645 --> 01:15:00,105
Let's go. We'll talk on our way.

1245
01:15:00,897 --> 01:15:03,525
No, Professor Ahn.
We don't have a patient.

1246
01:15:08,196 --> 01:15:09,823
Buy me dinner, please.

1247
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:18,081
Buy me dinner this weekend, Professor Ahn.

1248
01:15:21,209 --> 01:15:23,670
Sure. Let's have a get-together
with everyone.

1249
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:25,046
Just the two of us.

1250
01:15:28,842 --> 01:15:30,385
Just the two of us, outside the hospital

1251
01:15:30,468 --> 01:15:32,762
and not in these scrubs,
but in our personal clothes.

1252
01:16:22,061 --> 01:16:24,773
<i>You were always</i>

1253
01:16:30,612 --> 01:16:33,323
<i>You were always</i>

1254
01:17:04,729 --> 01:17:08,817
<i>My longing for you</i>

1255
01:17:09,776 --> 01:17:12,987
<i>Gets bigger every single day</i>

1256
01:17:13,905 --> 01:17:18,034
<i>The pain of not seeing you always
Leaves me with fresh wounds</i>

1257
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:21,120
<i>But you're going your way</i>

1258
01:17:21,538 --> 01:17:24,833
<i>If you want, I can wait for you</i>

1259
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:26,209
Thank you.

1260
01:17:26,584 --> 01:17:29,921
<i>I haven't changed at all</i>

1261
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,926
<i>It was you who had changed</i>

1262
01:17:35,009 --> 01:17:37,136
<i>So you can</i>

1263
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,514
-<i>Come back to me</i>
-Thank you.

1264
01:17:41,307 --> 01:17:47,188
<i>If you're blaming me for my mistake</i>

1265
01:17:47,605 --> 01:17:51,818
<i>You can still blame me after you come back</i>

1266
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:58,575
<i>We still have time for that</i>

1267
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:04,122
<i>I will be the same guy</i>

1268
01:18:04,539 --> 01:18:08,042
<i>That you left</i>

1269
01:18:08,126 --> 01:18:12,797
<i>I don't want to comfort myself</i>

1270
01:18:12,881 --> 01:18:15,717
<i>With false hope anymore</i>

1271
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:21,180
<i>For the first time, I learned
What it means to be in love</i>

1272
01:18:21,514 --> 01:18:25,018
<i>I'm going to get you back</i>

1273
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:29,606
<i>I just realized that the purpose</i>

1274
01:18:29,689 --> 01:18:34,986
<i>Of my life had been you all along</i>

1275
01:18:41,618 --> 01:18:43,786
TRY THIS COOKIE, DAD!

1276
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:52,211
<i>If you want, I can wait for you</i>

1277
01:18:52,879 --> 01:18:56,132
<i>I haven't changed at all</i>

1278
01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:01,137
<i>It was you who had changed</i>

1279
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:05,725
<i>So you can come back to me</i>

1280
01:19:07,644 --> 01:19:13,274
<i>If you're blaming me for my mistake</i>

1281
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:18,071
<i>You can still blame me after you come back</i>

1282
01:19:18,404 --> 01:19:24,911
<i>We still have time for that</i>

1283
01:19:25,244 --> 01:19:30,541
<i>I will be the same guy</i>

1284
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,379
<i>That you left</i>

1285
01:19:34,462 --> 01:19:39,050
<i>I don't want to comfort myself</i>

1286
01:19:39,133 --> 01:19:41,970
<i>With false hope anymore</i>

1287
01:19:42,053 --> 01:19:47,433
<i>For the first time, I learned
What it means to be in love</i>

1288
01:19:47,892 --> 01:19:51,187
<i>I'm going to get you back</i>

1289
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:55,858
<i>I just realized that the purpose</i>

1290
01:19:55,942 --> 01:20:02,240
<i>Of my life had been you all along</i>

1291
01:21:04,427 --> 01:21:06,137
-Hello.
-Hi.

1292
01:21:08,681 --> 01:21:09,640
Where are you going?

1293
01:21:10,725 --> 01:21:11,768
On a date with my wife.

1294
01:21:12,769 --> 01:21:14,979
Didn't you say
you've been married for over ten years?

1295
01:21:15,063 --> 01:21:16,814
Yes, this year is our tenth year together.

1296
01:21:17,607 --> 01:21:21,027
We got a rent-free apartment
with just our deposit on our tenth year.

1297
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,738
We made reservations
to take our parents on a trip.

1298
01:21:27,033 --> 01:21:29,410
People might think I beat you up
or something.

1299
01:21:30,078 --> 01:21:31,037
I won't kill you.

1300
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:37,085
You can kill me with your words alone.

1301
01:21:49,347 --> 01:21:50,765
I'll be out for a while.

1302
01:21:52,266 --> 01:21:54,060
What? This wasn't going up?

1303
01:21:56,104 --> 01:21:57,897
I will help you go up.

1304
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:00,358
Bye.

1305
01:22:05,905 --> 01:22:06,906
You're here.

1306
01:22:07,824 --> 01:22:10,535
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, this is your landlady.</i>

1307
01:22:10,618 --> 01:22:12,703
Hello. Have you been well?

1308
01:22:14,116 --> 01:22:15,117
You're here.

1309
01:22:16,035 --> 01:22:18,746
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, this is your landlady.</i>

1310
01:22:18,829 --> 01:22:20,914
Hello. Have you been well?

1311
01:22:20,998 --> 01:22:25,044
<i>Yes. I just wanted to remind you that
you forgot to wire the rent this month.</i>

1312
01:22:25,127 --> 01:22:27,755
-Pardon?
<i>-Your monthly rent.</i>

1313
01:22:27,838 --> 01:22:29,048
<i>You forgot to wire me the rent.</i>

1314
01:22:29,131 --> 01:22:32,009
My gosh, what are you talking about?
I signed a deposit-based apartment.

1315
01:22:32,092 --> 01:22:33,802
A 2-year contract and 200-million-won...

1316
01:22:35,512 --> 01:22:37,306
I don't follow.

1317
01:22:37,389 --> 01:22:38,599
<i>Deposit-based apartment?</i>

1318
01:22:39,183 --> 01:22:41,268
<i>You signed a contract with monthly rents.</i>

1319
01:22:41,351 --> 01:22:43,896
<i>The deposit was 20 million won,
and the rent was 900,000 won.</i>

1320
01:22:44,646 --> 01:22:45,647
What...

1321
01:22:46,982 --> 01:22:49,401
What are you talking about?

1322
01:23:07,324 --> 01:23:13,586
Subtitle translation by Won-hyang Son

1323
01:23:28,982 --> 01:23:30,609
<i>My son is sensitive and delicate.</i>

1324
01:23:30,692 --> 01:23:32,486
<i>It'd be nice
if he has a reliable life partner.</i>

1325
01:23:32,569 --> 01:23:34,113
<i>Jeong-won, you can tell her now.</i>

1326
01:23:34,196 --> 01:23:36,907
<i>I think it will be around the end
of December. Will that work?</i>

1327
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:39,118
My goodness, what's wrong with Jeong-won?

1328
01:23:39,201 --> 01:23:40,244
What are you doing? Focus.

1329
01:23:40,327 --> 01:23:41,787
<i>I'm bad at my job because I'm dumb.</i>

1330
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:42,913
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>

1331
01:23:42,996 --> 01:23:44,915
-Dr. Chu.
<i>-My professor</i>

1332
01:23:44,998 --> 01:23:46,625
<i>is the biggest slug ever.</i>

1333
01:23:46,708 --> 01:23:48,210
<i>Will you kill both the mother
and the baby?</i>

1334
01:23:48,293 --> 01:23:50,879
I'll go tell the slug tomorrow morning.

1335
01:23:50,963 --> 01:23:52,422
I'll put an end to this.

1336
01:23:52,506 --> 01:23:55,134
Have you gone mad? Why are you quitting?
I won't let you quit.

1337
01:23:55,217 --> 01:23:57,886
<i>I think I'm messing up my life.</i>

1338
01:23:57,970 --> 01:23:59,138
<i>My existence is harming others.</i>

1339
01:23:59,221 --> 01:24:01,849
I barely managed to stop him
from talking to the TV station.

1340
01:24:01,932 --> 01:24:03,308
<i>Professor, I need to talk to you.</i>

1341
01:24:03,392 --> 01:24:05,769
-Min-ha isn't here yet?
-<i>Did the resident who went MIA come back?</i>

1342
01:24:05,853 --> 01:24:07,688
<i>MIA since yesterday morning,
no word for two days.</i>

1343
01:24:07,771 --> 01:24:09,022
<i>Be nice to the resident.</i>

1344
01:24:09,106 --> 01:24:10,566
<i>It must've been hard on the resident.</i>

1345
01:24:12,484 --> 01:24:13,360
I'll come back later.

1346
01:24:13,443 --> 01:24:16,113
<i>Song-hwa is beautiful and smart.</i>

<i>-He has plans.</i>

1348
01:24:18,115 --> 01:24:20,033
<i>You're going crazy about this girl.</i>

<i>Who are you dating? I'd love to meet her.</i>

1350
01:24:22,786 --> 01:24:23,871
So, she is your girlfriend.

1351
01:24:23,954 --> 01:24:25,622
I'll tell you everything another time.
