HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:16,104
What kind of sick son of a bitch
does this?

3
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,362
Dr. Jang. Call the police.

4
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:25,572
-Sorry?
-It's child abuse, isn't it?

5
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:28,909
I think so.
These aren't bruises from a car accident.

6
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,787
Besides,
the bruises have different colors.

7
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:35,290
The bruises from long ago are lighter,

8
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:37,459
and the recent ones are more vivid.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,379
Seeing that his back
is covered with bruises,

10
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:41,922
his father must beat him often.

11
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:44,966
Haven't you called the police yet?

12
00:00:58,063 --> 00:00:59,314
-Wait!
-Hey!

13
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,902
-He needs surgery right now.
-Of course.

14
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:49,531
By the way, will Dr. Jang be all right
without her shoes?

15
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,996
I've called the police.
They'll be here in five minutes.

16
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:58,707
They'll bring a social worker with them.

17
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:01,460
Shouldn't someone follow Dr. Jang?

18
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:04,838
-You also called the security team, right?
-Yes.

19
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,507
She's so bold.

20
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,634
What if he has a knife or something?

21
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,223
By the way, Jae-yong's brother
was here yesterday as well.

22
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:16,600
Will he be all right?

23
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:18,560
His father said he broke his arm,

24
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:20,604
but the X-ray showed
he had broken ribs as well.

25
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:22,230
It did seem strange.

26
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:24,983
Let me see his X-ray.

27
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:48,798
What are you doing, you crazy bitch?

28
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:50,800
Let go. Let go of me.

29
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,803
Let go of me. Get lost!

30
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:08,985
Are you all right?

31
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,572
Yes. Thank you.

32
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,078
Let go of me.

33
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:21,081
Keep it up, guys.

34
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:22,749
Let go!

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,628
Do you have any proof that I beat him?

36
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,713
Let's go to the police station
and talk about it.

37
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:32,092
Hey, you doctor. Do you have any proof
that I beat my child?

38
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:33,927
Tell me.

39
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:38,223
The doctor suspects you've been
beating both of your sons.

40
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:39,766
Are they supposed to be gods or what?

41
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,143
Do they know everything that's happened?

42
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:45,397
They're my children. Okay?

43
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:48,525
They're my children, so I know better.

44
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:52,362
They only saw them for ten minutes.
What do they know?

45
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,699
If you think it's unfair,
you can explain yourself at the station.

46
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,493
-Let's go already.
-About Jae-hun.

47
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:06,293
He broke his arm when he fell off
the table yesterday.

48
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:10,422
I saw the X-ray,
and his right rib was broken too.

49
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:12,841
Yes, you're right. So what?

50
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:15,510
It's because he fell on his right side.

51
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:17,679
-So what?
-It's not every day

52
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:20,932
that you see someone break their arms
and ribs just from falling off the table.

53
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:27,147
And I also found that his lowest right rib
had healed from a previous fracture.

54
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,482
And the same goes for his lower left rib.

55
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:32,319
Do you have prior convictions for assault?

56
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:43,913
We were notified that you're wanted
for child abuse. You're under arrest.

57
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:47,917
You have the right to an attorney
and the right to explain yourself.

58
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,795
You also have the right
to challenge your arrest or detention.

59
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:57,344
You. I'll remember your face.

60
00:04:57,969 --> 00:04:59,763
When we meet again, you'll pay for this.

61
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,723
Be careful. Okay?

62
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:03,391
-Let's go.
-Take him.

63
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:09,189
-You're the social worker, right?
-Yes.

64
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:11,399
The surgery will take two to three hours.

65
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,069
When he wakes up, he might be anxious.

66
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:15,945
So, please take good care of him.

67
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,781
-I will.
-Okay, then.

68
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:23,328
And his brother Jae-hun is at home.

69
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:26,164
He must be waiting for them, starving.

70
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:29,209
One of my colleagues should be there
by now. Don't worry.

71
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,336
Okay. Thank you.

72
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:35,674
Dr. Bae.

73
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:37,676
Good job.

74
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:40,845
I didn't think of checking
his brother's X-ray.

75
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:43,431
-Thank you.
-No problem.

76
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:47,227
See you, Gwang-hyeon.

77
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:49,437
Dr. Jang.

78
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:53,566
Hurry up and get ready for the surgery.

79
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,362
I've already called Anesthesiology.
When the surgery is approved,

80
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,489
send the patient to the OR.

81
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,283
Yes, Doctor.

82
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,470
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

83
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:22,137
I'm so hungry.

84
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,723
Let's go eat some barbeque.
I've already texted the others.

85
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:27,142
Oh, right. Did you take care of it?

86
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:28,351
Almost.

87
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:32,480
I never imagined this kind of thing
would happen.

88
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:34,357
God, I need some sweets. Do you have any?

89
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:35,692
Over there.

90
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:40,697
Then, the patient
Professor Kwon saw was fake?

91
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,199
Yes, they had me see the real son,

92
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:45,618
and had Professor Kwon see the fake one.

93
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:49,247
This punk... He's like a little kid.

94
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:52,625
We do two check-ups, a psychiatric test,

95
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,628
and a fingerprint registration.
It's really tight here.

96
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:58,757
-How did they think it was possible?
-Gosh.

97
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:01,050
The liver transplant
was the only way for Sim.

98
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:03,762
But since his son refused,
he had to take chances.

99
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:05,054
Jeez.

100
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:07,974
It was quite well-planned.

101
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,727
The real son went through
most of the check-ups,

102
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,145
and the fake one hid in the room

103
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:15,607
and showed his face
only to Professor Kwon and his nurse.

104
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:17,942
Since Professor Kwon is in charge
of the donor's surgery,

105
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:21,070
the fake son had to greet him
every time he came in.

106
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:24,699
On top of that, they've chosen
the fake son quite elaborately

107
00:07:24,783 --> 00:07:27,494
with a candidate who was checked up
for a year at another hospital.

108
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:30,914
They would've gotten caught
on the day of the surgery anyway.

109
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:32,624
Hey. Give me some too.

110
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,043
Here.

111
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,547
They knew that the donor and recipient
could have different medical teams.

112
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:41,049
That's what they were hoping for.

113
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:43,593
They knew I was in charge of Sim

114
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:46,137
and Professor Kwon was in charge
of his son.

115
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,015
They thought we might not know
about each other's patients.

116
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:52,018
Did they think the hospital
is that stupid?

117
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:53,603
And what about me?

118
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:55,688
Do they think that
all I do is perform surgery?

119
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:58,733
They don't know that I constantly
check up on all the patients.

120
00:07:58,817 --> 00:07:59,984
Hey.

121
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:02,946
Stop eating that.
Jun-wan is keeping count.

122
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,240
-That's his favorite.
-What a freak.

123
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:09,035
By the way, where the hell is he?

124
00:08:09,118 --> 00:08:10,912
-We have a tight schedule today.
-I don't know.

125
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,790
He took the day off.
I saw him go somewhere, all dressed up.

126
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:16,584
He said he'll meet us
at the barbecue place.

127
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,169
-He must be meeting a girl.
-Of course.

128
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:21,256
I knew it. He's been single for too long.

129
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,174
I'm guessing three months, as usual.

130
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:26,719
He's pretty good-looking,

131
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,305
but how come he can't date
longer than three months?

132
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:31,432
Hey, Ik-jun, did you see this?

133
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:32,809
What's that?

134
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:35,770
The donor disguised as the fake son

135
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:38,022
is an employee
at Seok-hyeong's dad's company.

136
00:08:41,109 --> 00:08:42,068
Where's Seok-hyeong?

137
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:45,280
I don't know. Maybe in the OR?

138
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:50,410
Good work, everyone.

139
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,245
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

140
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:02,755
CONGRESSMAN SIM CAUGHT
SWITCHING HIS LIVER DONOR

141
00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:20,732
You're renovating the place?

142
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,360
When?
Where are you going to be staying then?

143
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:26,112
It starts tomorrow.

144
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,364
Why can't he just leave the house be?

145
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,950
It's not like you're getting married.
Why all of a sudden?

146
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:33,202
How can you take a shower
in that bathroom?

147
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:35,413
I'm just renovating the bathroom.
It's old.

148
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:37,206
They'll be staying at my place
for a while.

149
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,375
But what about my cute U-ju?

150
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:42,003
He went to Changwon with Auntie Wang.

151
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:44,839
Seok-hyeong, aren't you drinking too much?

152
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:47,175
You should stop.
This is your third can of soda.

153
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:49,552
Just drink some beer, man.
They won't call you this late.

154
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:50,595
You're so frustrating.

155
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,723
Hey. You are just like my family.

156
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,435
Don't you think
this bean powder is like my family?

157
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:58,519
You're right.

158
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:01,230
It is like your family. Right, guys?

159
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:04,609
His family is in pieces
like the bean powder. Jeez.

160
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:06,486
Hey, your dad is really...

161
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,865
What's wrong with your dad?

162
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:12,867
He cheated on your mom

163
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:15,954
and coaxed his employee
into organ trafficking.

164
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,081
And he was charged
with tax evasion last year.

165
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,083
He paid 10 billion won
in penalty tax alone.

166
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:24,253
Hey, you got nothing?

167
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:26,089
-Me?
-Just tell me.

168
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:31,594
When I was a freshman,

169
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:34,639
I went down to the basement
for band practice.

170
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:38,309
I was the first to arrive,
so I was practicing the drums alone.

171
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,228
It was then that Seok-hyeong's dad came

172
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,606
and sent me on an errand
for a pack of cigarettes.

173
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:46,901
-What about it?
-Could it be?

174
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:50,822
He didn't give me the money for it.

175
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:54,033
He still hasn't paid me.

176
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:56,703
It was 1,100 won. 88 Light.
It was unbelievable.

177
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:59,789
Excuse me.
Two more servings of pork belly, please.

178
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,834
-And a miser bowl of soup, please.
-Okay.

179
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,168
-Seok-hyeong.
-Yes?

180
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:06,087
He's not arrested, though.

181
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,632
Can you believe that? I don't get it.

182
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:12,677
I bet he used his heart condition
to get off lightly.

183
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,803
What about your mom?

184
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:16,055
She doesn't really care.

185
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,099
But I think she actually wants him jailed.

186
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:20,393
-Here's the pork belly.
-She should get divorced like me.

187
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:24,981
We're so cool these days. We talk about
heavy topics like they're nothing.

188
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,900
-We're like grown-ups.
-What's wrong with divorce?

189
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:30,319
Is it a sin to be divorced?

190
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,196
Seok-hyeong, is it a sin to get a divorce?

191
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,198
-Yes, it's a sin.
-You jerk.

192
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:37,201
I still feel bad for my ex-wife.

193
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:41,748
She went through a lot of trouble
because of me and my family.

194
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:43,833
You did good, getting that divorce.

195
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:49,047
We are busy tonight. Hurry up and eat.

196
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:53,092
We should go practice and do other stuff.
We're busy.

197
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:55,011
Gosh, it's 9 p.m. already.

198
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:57,513
<i>The night is deep</i>

199
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:01,392
-<i>Lights that wander and dance</i>
-It's hot.

200
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:03,269
It's good.

201
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:05,396
<i>Intoxicated by the night</i>

202
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,981
<i>-And the alcohol
-And the alcohol</i>

203
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,401
<i>I'm stumbling</i>

204
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:14,489
<i>It's nearing dawn</i>

205
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:19,243
<i>But I'm still alone</i>

206
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:22,914
<i>This feeling</i>

207
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:27,877
<i>Isn't too bad</i>

208
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,089
<i>I want to stay</i>

209
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:36,052
<i>By your side forever</i>

210
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,846
<i>Intoxicated by the night</i>

211
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,306
<i>-And the alcohol
-And the alcohol</i>

212
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:44,060
<i>I want to get away</i>

213
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,855
<i>I don't know</i>

214
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:52,860
<i>If you can understand my sadness</i>

215
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:56,447
<i>My darling shoes</i>

216
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:02,036
<i>Please, don't leave me</i>

217
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,456
<i>-Watching the stars appear
-Watching the stars appear</i>

218
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,709
<i>-Blossoming like a fairy tale

00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:13,756
<i>-I get on the carriage, drunk

221
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,723

<i>-Don't go

223
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:26,769
<i>-If you could smile for me

00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:31,023
<i>-Don't leave me behind

<i>-Don't go

226
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:35,153
<i>I would pluck a star for you</i>

00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:39,448
<i>-Don't leave me behind

228

<i>-Don't go

229
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,494
<i>-Stars will disappear

00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:47,748
<i>-Don't leave me behind

231
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:49,458
<i>-Don't go
-Don't go</i>

232
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:54,422
<i>-I would rather you just leave me

<i>-Blossoming like a fairy tale

235
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,181
The patient is looking for me. I'm off.

236
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:06,893
<i>-I get on the carriage, drunk</i>
-No, I need you for something.

237
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,227
Hey!

238
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:11,689
Guys, a recipient is suddenly refusing
to go through with the transplant.

239
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:14,233
-I got to go.
<i>-Don't go</i>

240
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:17,820
<i>-Don't leave me behind
-Don't leave me behind</i>

241
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:22,909
<i>-Tonight I want to stay at your feet
-Tonight I want to stay at your feet</i>

242
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:27,538
<i>-Like bright red flower petals
-Like bright red flower petals</i>

243
00:14:33,294 --> 00:14:35,254
But the NST was fine in the afternoon.

244
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:38,925
<i>Yes, but the late deceleration suddenly
dropped to 70 and it won't recover.</i>

245
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:41,010
<i>Professor. Come straight to
the treatment room, okay?</i>

246
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,345
Okay.

247
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:51,896
How can a father

248
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:55,358
do this to his child?

249
00:14:58,819 --> 00:14:59,862
Doctor.

250
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:03,532
I can't have this surgery.

251
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:09,872
Bin has made an important decision.

252
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:12,625
She didn't visit you today on purpose,

253
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:16,879
so that you won't cry and maintain
the optimum condition for the surgery.

254
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:20,633
Sir, you're making it harder for Bin.

255
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:29,558
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt at all.

256
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,269
Okay?

257
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,272
It's not for you, but for Bin.

258
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:38,693
I will make sure that she
doesn't feel any pain.

259
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:40,736
Don't worry about it.

260
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:52,498
I heard you used to be a detective,
but you're such a crybaby.

261
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:05,386
-Happy birthday!
-Surprise!

262
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:09,140
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

263
00:16:09,223 --> 00:16:11,350
<i>-Dear Professor Yang
-Dear Professor Yang</i>

264
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:13,185
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

265
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:21,110
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

266
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:24,363
Professor.

267
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:31,620
I'm going home.

268
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,584
I'm going home.

269
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,004
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

270
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:39,589
-Hello.
-Hello.

271
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:42,801
Seok-hyeong was called to the hospital.

272
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,011
He already told me. Thank you.

273
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:46,972
Try these.

274
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:49,224
I bought them myself.

275
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:51,685
Thank you.

276
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:53,728
Why don't stay over tonight, Song-hwa?

277
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:55,105
Pardon?

278
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,440
It's late. Why don't you stay the night?

279
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,484
I've cleaned Seok-hyeong's room.

280
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:04,447
You should.

281
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,870
If something goes wrong with the donor,

282
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,123
it'll be hard on me too.

283
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,501
I'll do my best for Bin's surgery.

284
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:18,670
While I do that,

285
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:22,632
Dr. Jong Se-hyeok will remove
your husband's liver.

286
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,844
The surgeries will be performed
at the same time.

287
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:27,596
When your husband's liver is removed,

288
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,432
and the necessary
preparations are complete,

289
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:33,435
I'll transplant the liver to your husband.

290
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:34,686
It'll take...

291
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,233
around 10 to 12 hours
from anesthesia to surgery.

292
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:42,903
If I come out in the middle
of the surgery, it's bad.

293
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,615
But if I don't, you can be relieved
that the surgery is going well

294
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:49,492
even if it takes longer than expected.

295
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:53,580
Is my daughter's surgery a tough one?

296
00:17:54,664 --> 00:17:56,499
All surgeries are tough.

297
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,085
But since she's young and healthy,

298
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:02,005
and because of her determination,

299
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:05,133
I'm sure Bin will do just fine.

300
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:06,051
But

301
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:09,179
your husband's veins are dilated

302
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,348
from the severe cirrhosis he's suffered,

303
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:14,851
so it might be difficult to stop
the bleeding during the surgery.

304
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:18,229
I'm sure they've explained it in detail
when you signed the consent form...

305
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:20,398
Why aren't you asleep?

306
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:23,318
Don't worry, Mom.

307
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,655
I heard he performs
this surgery all the time.

308
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,323
I wouldn't say "all the time."

309
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,910
I guess you're right.
I do it "all the time."

310
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,287
You're braver than your dad.

311
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,957
She's better than I am.

312
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,252
Bin, let's sleep together tonight.

313
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,463
Gosh, forget it.

314
00:18:44,214 --> 00:18:46,717
Bye, doctor. See you.

315
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:51,054
 Sure. Tomorrow.

316
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:55,475
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

317
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,365
We're going to go slow.

318
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,371
You said that your husband was strong.
I guess he isn't.

319
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:20,792
What kind of father

320
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,379
takes his own daughter's liver to live?

321
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:30,385
I'm such a horrible father.

322
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:34,597
Sir, I'm sure the surgery will go well.

323
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,726
Try to think of it as
going into a deep sleep.

324
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:41,479
You need to calm down so that you
can be at optimum condition

325
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:43,690
for the surgery to be successful.

326
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,322
Be careful.

327
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:53,283
-Hello.
-Hi.

328
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:58,038
Lean against my back, honey.

329
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:00,623
God, I'm fine. Stop that.

330
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:06,880
Doctor, why is my baby not coming out yet?

331
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:09,841
-I don't think the baby wants to meet us.
-Don't say that.

332
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:12,302
Let's give it a few more days.
It's due soon.

333
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:15,847
There's nothing wrong with her, right?
Is she fine?

334
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,849
Yes, everything looks good.

335
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,392
Thank you.

336
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:22,854
The mother's been doing a great job,
so everything's good.

337
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,107
Leave the rest to me and try to relax.

338
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,485
Eat well and sleep well,

339
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:30,111
then you'll be fine.

340
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:34,282
-Well, I have a question.
-Okay.

341
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,451
Are you married, Doctor?

342
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,787
Yes. Pardon?

343
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,083
I've been thinking that
you're such a good person.

344
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,168
I'd like to set you up with someone.

345
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:49,089
It's okay. You don't have to do that.

346
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:51,174
I guess you have a girlfriend.

347
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,095
No, I don't. But still, it's fine.

348
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:58,348
You're 37 weeks pregnant.

349
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:01,309
So please come to the hospital right away
whenever your belly hurts, okay?

350
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,728
I have a question too.

351
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:06,231
When she gives birth,

352
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:09,567
is it okay for me to sing a song
in the delivery room?

353
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:12,862
Come on. I told you, don't do that.
We'll get going.

354
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:16,699
I've been singing the baby a song.
I'm sure my baby will love it.

355
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:18,827
I really want to--

356
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,870
Honey, I'm--

357
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,292
Gently.

358
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,671
That's too strong. Hold back a little.

359
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,549
You'll cut through it
if you put too much pressure.

360
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:33,967
Okay. I'm sorry.

361
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:36,511
-Didn't you get much sleep last night?
-No.

362
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:37,762
I mean, I did.

363
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,472
What? You were off yesterday.

364
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:42,058
Professor Cheon Myeong-tae asked him
to examine 200 people

365
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:45,061
to use as the data for his thesis
by today, so stayed up all night.

366
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,689
Who's Professor Cheon Myeong-tae?

367
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:50,066
A new professor who started last week.
Don't you know him?

368
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,193
No. Is he famous?

369
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,488
Yes, he's famous for being
hard on his patients.

370
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:04,747
I've done some research and read

371
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,750
that aortic valve replacement is
usually done

372
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,420
by minimally invasive method
in other countries.

373
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:12,172
-Are you a doctor?
-Sorry?

374
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:17,468
No, I'm just asking because I'm worried.

375
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:19,554
Then surgeries are fine.

376
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:21,764
Well, then.

377
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:26,019
Let's go, Dad.

378
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,106
I'll leave the rest to you, Dr. Do.

379
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,191
Professor.

380
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:35,278
Don't abandon me, okay?

381
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,117
If you abandon me,
I'll be sold to another hospital.

382
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:42,660
Focus!

383
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:50,543
Let's focus.

384
00:22:52,962 --> 00:22:54,047
Then who'll take Geon-hui?

385
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,548
Dr. Ahn will.

386
00:22:58,301 --> 00:22:59,969
Hong Geon-hui, a five-year-old boy.

387
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:02,764
He passed out while blowing a balloon
and was taken to the ER.

388
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:05,642
According to the CT angiography,
we suspect it may be Moyamoya disease.

389
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,977
And we've made the arrangements
for a TFCA this afternoon.

390
00:23:08,061 --> 00:23:11,314
He's currently on a ventilator
and is being hydrated.

391
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:12,941
His condition is quite stable.

392
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,400
What causes this disease?

393
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,195
I think it's genetic...

394
00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:20,615
There's a good chance

395
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:23,368
that children will get Moyamoya disease
if their parents have it.

396
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:24,953
However, not all of them do.

397
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,747
So it's not entirely genetic.

398
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:31,167
Chi-hong, what do we have
to watch out for the most?

399
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:33,169
We can't let him cry.

400
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,798
If he cries and yells, it'll constrict
the blood vessel in his brain

401
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:38,800
and lower the blood flow to his brain,

402
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:41,386
which will result
in a seizure or hemiplegia.

403
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:44,180
That's correct. You can't let him cry.

404
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:47,558
-That's so hard.
-Indeed, it's hard.

405
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:49,769
Be careful when you take his CT.

406
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,562
Calm him down before you take it.

407
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:54,232
If it doesn't work,
you might have to give him Pocral.

408
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,567
-It's safest to put him to sleep.
-Okay.

409
00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:59,237
Watch him closely and act accordingly.

410
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,281
I think that'll be enough.

411
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:03,950
What about lunch, Seok-min?

412
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:07,203
Dr. Do will buy lunch since
his installment savings matured today.

413
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:08,538
I can join, right?

414
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,166
Dr. Do, the infamous miser, is buying.
I have to be there.

415
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,960
Is he a miser?

416
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:16,587
Yes, totally.
He's like a legend at the hospital.

417
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:19,799
His monthly allowance is 100,000 won.
I heard he saves half of his monthly wage.

418
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:21,175
That's amazing.

419
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:24,929
All right, then. Have a nice lunch.

420
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:27,557
What about me? I'm available.

421
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:30,059
-What?
-I'm free for lunch.

422
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:31,352
Why aren't you going?

423
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,187
You're not? It's a historical moment.

424
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,857
No, I won't.
I'll just have lunch with you.

425
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:38,609
Okay. Let's go.

426
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,944
I'll buy you something fancy

427
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:42,405
-at the Professors' Cafeteria.
-Really? What about me?

428
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,741
-You should've said sooner.
-Too late.

429
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:48,161
I'm taking Chi-hong only. Let's go.

430
00:24:52,582 --> 00:24:55,376
-I'll hold the portal vein.
-Okay, the hemostat's ready.

431
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,426
-Is the perfusion ready?
-Yes.

432
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:05,011
I'll hold the hepatic artery.

433
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:09,974
It went well. It looks clean.

434
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,727
Dr. Kim, there's no bleeding, right?

435
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,812
Check for bleeding and wrap it up, please.

436
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,522
Good job, Doctor.

437
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,651
Go get some rest. You have to perform
the transplant surgery.

438
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:23,279
They're still doing hepatectomy.

439
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:24,572
Okay, I will.

440
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:29,619
Keep it up, people. You too, Gyeo-ul.

441
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:31,120
Sure.

442
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,250
-Give me the vascular clamp.
-What's the vital?

443
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,419
BP is 90-60 and the pulse rate is at 100.

444
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:39,879
Suction. I can't see.

445
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:42,006
More suction. And gauze.

446
00:25:42,215 --> 00:25:44,425
-I brought three bags of RBC.
-Wider.

447
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:46,094
A bit more. I can't see.

448
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,012
-Widen it more, please.
-Give me another lever.

449
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,306
-Get me a full dose of--
-Keep suctioning.

450
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:52,767
Gauze. There.

451
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,977
-Bring more blood.
-Wider, please.

452
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:58,564
Is he bleeding too much? Is he okay?

453
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:01,484
There's an opening in the IVC,
but I can't get to it.

454
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,152
Anesthesiology, are his vitals okay?

455
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:07,407
He's been bleeding quite a bit,
but his vitals are okay now.

456
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,075
Thank you. You want me to join?

457
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,035
I think you should.

458
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,453
Keep pressing on it. I'm going in.

459
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:21,045
Anesthesiology, we got the major bleeding.

460
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,132
The liver was surrounding the IVC,

461
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,884
so it started bleeding while we were
removing it. This is hard.

462
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:30,012
You know Professor Kwon,
the master of liver transplants, right?

463
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:32,849
-Yes.
-On his first surgery as a fellow,

464
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:36,561
his patient started bleeding
the moment he opened the chest.

465
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:40,440
He was removed after stopping the blood.
He didn't even get to see the liver.

466
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:41,691
I see.

467
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,318
It's okay. This happens a lot.

468
00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:47,280
And when this happens again,
you'll do better.

469
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,074
If you can't, call me again.

470
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:51,576
Okay. Thank you.

471
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,578
And we have to save him no matter what.

472
00:26:53,661 --> 00:26:55,496
If anything goes wrong, Bin will kill me.

473
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:57,915
Okay.

474
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:02,670
The specimen is coming out.

475
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,134
You've never failed
to make a single deposit.

476
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:11,304
It's hard enough to make 60 payments
over 5 years,

477
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:15,016
but you've never even been late once.
You're amazing.

478
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,310
So, how much is it in total?

479
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:18,853
You're withdrawing a mature saving.

480
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:22,773
Including the principal and interest
of the last five years excluding tax,

481
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,568
it's 100,128,480 won.

482
00:27:26,027 --> 00:27:28,863
It's been wired to your account.
Congratulations.

483
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,908
One, ten, a hundred...

484
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:36,037
And this is a gift
from the branch manager.

485
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:38,664
I get a gift too?

486
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:41,250
You've been our regular for five years.
This is nothing.

487
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:43,294
The manager also sent you
his congratulations.

488
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:45,171
This is enough to last me a year.

489
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:48,466
Sorry? You shouldn't be like that now.

490
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:49,759
Your wife must not like it.

491
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:53,012
She doesn't even turn the lights on
in the house before 8 p.m.

492
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:58,017
Honey.

493
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:00,186
We have 100 million now.

494
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:02,438
No, 100 million!

495
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:04,982
Bye.

496
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:08,694
I know. I felt bad since
I always mooched off them.

497
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:11,072
I'll treat them to something nice.

498
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,749
Seriously?

499
00:28:22,124 --> 00:28:24,335
I'm sorry.
I'll buy you pork belly next time.

500
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:26,045
Thanks for the food.

501
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,714
Come on. Eat already.

502
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:31,592
For him, it's like he's buying beef.

503
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:36,222
I'm sorry, Seok-min. I really am.

504
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:38,558
I've sent all the money
to my wife right away.

505
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:41,018
I wanted to show her that
we do have 100 million won.

506
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:44,146
Did you say 100 million?
How much did you deposit per month?

507
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,648
It was 1.6 million a month.

508
00:28:46,232 --> 00:28:47,149
Is that even possible?

509
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,944
Of course. He doesn't spend
any money at all.

510
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,239
Still, what about the maintenance fee
for the house,

511
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:55,700
the phone bill and other living costs?

512
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:57,785
My wife works full-time as well.

513
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,830
She's never taken a single day off
since we've married.

514
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,000
We've saved up for 10 years
and now it's exactly 100 million.

515
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,419
What will you do with that money?

516
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:07,670
Well...

517
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:09,964
I'm leasing a house tomorrow.

518
00:29:11,257 --> 00:29:12,466
Congrats!

519
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:16,345
I'm really happy right now.

520
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:20,266
I know it's a small apartment,
but it's on a deposit basis.

521
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,809
How much is it?

522
00:29:22,602 --> 00:29:26,522
With a loan and the money I've saved up,
it's 200 million won.

523
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:28,316
Read the contract carefully.

524
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,484
There's been a lot of scams
on the news lately.

525
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:33,696
Hey, I've studied for ten years
to be where I am.

526
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:34,947
I don't need your advice.

527
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:36,782
What about the landlord?

528
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:39,035
Mind your own business.

529
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:42,246
The real estate agencies
take care of everything now.

530
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,332
You should set aside
at least half a million.

531
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,293
You and your wife should go on a trip
on the weekend.

532
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:48,961
A trip?

533
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:51,297
-What's a trip?
-The weekend?

534
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,299
What's a weekend?

535
00:30:04,226 --> 00:30:07,480
It's so hot.

536
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:10,858
Why is it so hot?

537
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:12,151
Aren't I amazing?

538
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:15,112
I've grown all of them myself
just like how I've brought you up.

539
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,865
You have a bad back.
You shouldn't be farming.

540
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:21,243
And Mom, eating only vegetables
is not that healthy.

541
00:30:21,827 --> 00:30:25,331
These are organic. No pesticides.
It's healthy.

542
00:30:25,414 --> 00:30:28,626
It's more like you couldn't spray them
because of your bad back.

543
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,338
And you should have
a more balanced diet at your age.

544
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:34,548
Okay. Eat now, it's getting cold.

545
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:38,260
Protein, iron, omega-3, and calcium.

546
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:41,430
Your anemia and dizziness
come from lack of nutrition.

547
00:30:41,514 --> 00:30:42,932
I'm eating well,

548
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,600
-so worry about yourself.
-You're not.

549
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:47,395
Eat like this, and you'll suffer
from malnutrition.

550
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:49,313
Look over there.

551
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,696
See? I really am eating well.

552
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:59,156
If you have all of that,
then you're a drug addict.

553
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,326
I'll just live like this until I croak.
Be quiet and eat.

554
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,537
-Why...
-Hey, try this.

555
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,332
It's seasoned aster.
I made it myself, and it's divine.

556
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,711
Jeez, I can't argue with you.

557
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:16,632
It's good.

558
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:23,431
By the way, about the thing
I told you about last time...

559
00:31:23,806 --> 00:31:24,890
We need red pepper paste.

560
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,575
This is insane.
How can it be so delicious?

561
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:44,285
Right? It's divine, right?

562
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,954
-It's heavenly.
-Try this too.

563
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,756
I've talked to my brother,
asked my sisters,

564
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,966
and even asked
the Seoul Archdiocese about this.

565
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,762
It's difficult in Korea
because of the age limit,

566
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:05,806
but I can study to become
a priest in Italy.

567
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:10,603
I've sent the letter of recommendation
and I'm waiting to hear from them.

568
00:32:11,353 --> 00:32:14,106
I think I'll regret it
if I don't do it any sooner

569
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,525
Mom.

570
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,527
Mom.

571
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:21,572
You can't. Studying to become a priest?

572
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:23,783
Study to become a groom in Korea.

573
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:28,829
-You don't even have a girlfriend?
-Gosh...

574
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,081
Your brothers and sisters could,
but not you.

575
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:32,917
I'll get too lonely.

576
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:38,798
Jong-su and Seok-hyeong's moms
will be here soon. Hurry and eat.

577
00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:45,137
It's so hot.

578
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:54,271
Stronger.

579
00:32:58,567 --> 00:32:59,735
Mom.

580
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:07,243
You're good.

581
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:11,330
You must be dexterous
since you're a surgeon.

582
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:13,666
Delicacy is the most important
for a surgeon.

583
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:18,212
Don't just remove the heads.
Remove the wastes in the middle.

584
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:20,130
Goodness.

585
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:24,385
How are we supposed
to do all of this by hand?

586
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:30,266
You know the laparoscope, right?

587
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:32,142
Tell her we used that.

588
00:33:35,729 --> 00:33:37,231
Stop right there. Hands in the air.

589
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,236
Didn't I tell you to keep the head
because I'm going to use them?

590
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,737
You did, ma'am.

591
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,615
But you threw away the heads
and didn't even remove the wastes.

592
00:33:47,324 --> 00:33:48,909
I did.

593
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,537
It's just a few of them.

594
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:54,415
There isn't even 20.

595
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:56,458
Okay, let's see.

596
00:33:57,334 --> 00:34:00,546
I can't remember which is which.

597
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,715
I'll do it again.

598
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,633
I'll find them all.

599
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:06,677
Find every single one of them, okay?

600
00:34:07,303 --> 00:34:08,429
If there's even a single drop

601
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,098
that I find while cooking my broth,
I'm going to kill you.

602
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,933
Yes, ma'am.

603
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,313
Director, pass me the trimmed ones.

604
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:18,772
Sure, ma'am.

605
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:22,443
Hurry up. You have to trim
the spring onions after this.

606
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,779
Darn it. I came because
you said you'll cook us to noodles,

607
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,281
but I guess it was just a trap.

608
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,493
To be honest, how could the two of us
trim all of these?

609
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:34,622
Have you no conscience?

610
00:34:36,832 --> 00:34:40,377
God... How come every one of them
has the waste?

611
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:41,629
Here's one more.

612
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:49,345
So, that woman who's dressed
like Audrey Hepburn

613
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:52,514
from head to toe is

614
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:55,893
Professor Yang Seok-hyeong's mother?

615
00:34:55,976 --> 00:34:58,520
Yes. She's Dr. Yang's mother

616
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:00,689
and the wife of Chairman Yang Tae-yang

617
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:03,317
-of Taegeon Apparel.
-I see.

618
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:05,945
I should help you,

619
00:35:06,028 --> 00:35:08,113
but I'm not feeling well. I'm sorry.

620
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:11,784
It's okay. We're almost done.

621
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,454
Ma'am, would you like some coffee?
Iced? Hot?

622
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:16,580
Coffee?

623
00:35:17,456 --> 00:35:19,875
By the way, why are you not married?

624
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,543
Okay, iced it is.

625
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,338
I think I have enough now.

626
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,173
-Really?
-Yes.

627
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:29,259
Oh, my back.

628
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:34,264
Hey, my puppy.

629
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,768
You called me
because you missed your grandpa?

630
00:35:38,394 --> 00:35:40,646
-What game?
-What's the point of having

631
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:42,898
-children who are doctors and lawyers?
-You do what?

632
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:45,526
Their dad can't even
have proper meals on time.

633
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:48,320
I told you to dress casually.

634
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:50,364
You can be comfortable around them.

635
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:52,700
I am dressed casually.

636
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:00,040
Do what?

637
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,334
The mafia game.

638
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:04,169
-Is that it?
-Yes.

639
00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:08,257
My grandson is coming next weekend,

640
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:12,261
and he wants me to play the mafia game
with him. What do I do?

641
00:36:13,178 --> 00:36:16,265
You can do it.
A lot of young people play it. It's fun.

642
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:19,143
It must be fun since <i>The Godfather</i> is fun.

643
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:23,313
Yes. To put it simply,

644
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:26,400
one of you is chosen as the mafia.

645
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:29,319
And the rest of you
will be innocent civilians.

646
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:32,239
When you're chosen as the mafia,
you have to pretend to be a civilian

647
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:33,741
to not get caught by them.

648
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,827
The goal is to figure out
who the mafia is.

649
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,830
I see. That's easy.

650
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,791
We have to find out
which one of us is lying, then.

651
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:46,712
That's right. I'll lead the game.

652
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:50,174
Since there are four of you, if a civilian
dies in the first round, it's game over.

653
00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:52,051
The mafia will win.

654
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:53,969
Do you all understand the rules?

655
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:57,264
I'm good at fishing out people
who are hiding things.

656
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:59,183
-I think I can ace this game.
-Same here.

657
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:01,602
If we're playing a game,
there should be a prize.

658
00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:03,645
We don't win anything? No prizes?

659
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:05,731
Right. Hold on.

660
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:07,649
Here.

661
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,693
I got them from the hospital.

662
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:11,570
Those are the tickets I gave out.

663
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:15,282
Yes. These are recital tickets
I got from the hospital.

664
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:17,618
-How come I didn't get one?
-I didn't get one, either.

665
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:20,412
They only gave me ten tickets.

666
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:22,790
So I gave the tickets to the doctors
at the VIP Ward

667
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,333
to thank them for their hard work.

668
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:28,378
Besides, you don't know much
about classical music anyway.

669
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:32,257
You should've given me the tickets.
Why bring them out here?

670
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,343
You can win the game and take the tickets.

671
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,720
Besides, you're not even interested
in classical music.

672
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:38,013
Go with your girlfriend.

673
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:39,598
I don't have a girlfriend!

674
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:40,933
Why don't you have one?

675
00:37:41,016 --> 00:37:42,935
You're a handsome doctor
at a university hospital.

676
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:44,686
You should have a girlfriend.

677
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,105
He doesn't have one

678
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:48,482
because he hangs out with his friends
and plays in the band.

679
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:52,069
Seok-hyeong might not have a girlfriend
since he's divorced,

680
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:54,279
but why don't you have a girlfriend?

681
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:56,323
Is there anyone you're interested in?

682
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:58,450
-There is.
-Who?

683
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:00,494
The Lord.

684
00:38:02,204 --> 00:38:03,497
Mom!

685
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm leaving.

686
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:09,503
No. You can't leave yet.

687
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:11,213
Professor Ahn, sit down.

688
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:13,590
You need to teach us
how to play the game before you go.

689
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:16,135
You should let him eat in peace.

690
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:19,346
What's so bad about being religious?

691
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:22,224
-Right.
-You love Him a lot, too.

692
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:26,270
-Exactly.
-Seriously. You're so selfish.

693
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:27,855
What's that?

694
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:31,859
It's...

695
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:35,946
It's seaweed.

696
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,327
All right. We'll begin now.

697
00:38:42,411 --> 00:38:44,830
After I announce, "It is night,"

698
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:46,665
I will pick someone as the mafia.

699
00:38:46,748 --> 00:38:49,960
And when I say, "It is morning,"

700
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:54,089
that's when you start looking for
who is in the mafia.

701
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:56,049
We have to do this all night?

702
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,677
That must be why
only young people play this game.

703
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,345
I have an appointment in the afternoon.

704
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:02,556
Then you should leave early.

705
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:05,809
Since we're all here,
let's give it a go at least once.

706
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,104
You're all available
this afternoon, right?

707
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:10,981
Jeong-won, do you have any plans?

708
00:39:14,193 --> 00:39:16,778
All right. It is night.

709
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:19,740
Everyone. Close your eyes
and lower your head.

710
00:39:20,073 --> 00:39:23,869
Now, I'm going to choose someone
to be the mafia.

711
00:39:23,952 --> 00:39:25,746
All right.

712
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:29,833
Now, the mafia will--

713
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:32,836
It's me. I'm the mafia.

714
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,296
It's her.

715
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:36,048
I felt something go past me.

716
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:40,135
-It's me.
-Congrats.

717
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,431
All right. It's morning.

718
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:48,769
Now, you have to find out
who the mafia is.

719
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,979
Stop tapping the floor now.

720
00:39:52,522 --> 00:39:56,151
-It's not me.
-We didn't say anything.

721
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:58,320
I'm not a yakuza, either.

722
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:02,366
This game isn't called "Yakuza."
It's called "Mafia."

723
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:04,952
What about you?

724
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,872
You're stupid.
I'm not supposed to tell you.

725
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,833
Whatever you are,
you should say that you're a civilian.

726
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:13,293
Why won't you say that?

727
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,921
Really? I can say that?

728
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,340
I'm a civilian.

729
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:22,094
You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?

730
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:25,097
-Aren't you the mafia?
-Me? No, I'm not.

731
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,682
Hold on.

732
00:40:27,182 --> 00:40:31,353
Since it's advantageous for you
to suspect me as the mafia,

733
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:35,065
I should say that I am in the mafia.

734
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:37,442
I am the mafia. I'm not a civilian.

735
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:39,486
How do you run the foundation
with that brain?

736
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:40,404
Just retire soon.

737
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:42,781
-Don't run our hospital into the ground.
-What do you mean?

738
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:46,618
As soon as I took over the hospital,
our profit skyrocketed.

739
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:51,373
And thanks to her husband, our hospital
is covered by the press a lot these days.

740
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,833
Our hospital is doing very well.

741
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:56,461
Why is your face getting so red?

742
00:40:58,005 --> 00:40:59,256
-Me?
-Yes.

743
00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:02,634
-Are you the mafia?
-Your face is redder than his.

744
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:05,178
Aren't you in the mafia?
You've been quite chatty.

745
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,055
No, I'm not. How can I be the mafia?

746
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:11,143
No one in the mafia would openly say
that they are in the mafia.

747
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:12,519
It's really not me!

748
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:14,187
Jong-su, say something.

749
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:18,233
Rosa isn't the mafia.

750
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:19,609
How do you know that?

751
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,361
Because I'm the mafia.

752
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:23,905
What is he doing?

753
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:26,533
Did Jeong-won tap you
on your shoulder or not?

754
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:30,704
-He didn't.
-Jong-su, be quiet.

755
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,248
Seeing how you keep trying
to eliminate me,

756
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:34,791
I think you are the mafia.

757
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,376
-Shall we vote?
-Let's do it.

758
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,878
I think you're in the mafia.

759
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:39,254
I'm sure of it, too.

760
00:41:39,338 --> 00:41:40,839
Let's vote Rosa out.

761
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:42,966
My gosh. It's really not me!

762
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,218
I'm not in the mafia.

763
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,054
Jong-su, don't you believe me?

764
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,430
I do.

765
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:50,807
Everyone. I am the mafia.

766
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:52,517
Forget it. Just vote.

767
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:54,269
Professor Ahn, proceed.

768
00:41:54,436 --> 00:41:58,273
-Fine, let's vote. It's two against two.
-You can't vote if someone calls you out.

769
00:41:58,357 --> 00:42:00,233
Why are there so many rules?

770
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,277
Change the rule so I can vote
since it's my house.

771
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:03,779
Yes. Let her vote.

772
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:07,240
All right. The voting will take place.

773
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,952
If you believe Jeong Rosa is the mafia,

774
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:12,204
raise your thumb

775
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:14,122
-facing up.
-Yes.

776
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:18,502
Hey.

777
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:22,214
I'm sorry.

778
00:42:22,798 --> 00:42:24,758
How could you betray me like this?

779
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:27,302
And the votes are in.

780
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,809
Jeong Rosa,
an innocent civilian, has died.

781
00:42:33,892 --> 00:42:35,685
I told you that it wasn't me!

782
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:39,648
The person in the mafia was

783
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:42,401
Ju Jong-su.

784
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:45,028
What? You bastard!

785
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:48,782
Jeez. What the...

786
00:42:48,865 --> 00:42:51,993
I should have known.
You were always so sly.

787
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:55,455
You even look like a weasel. You fraud.

788
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,375
You lied in elementary school
saying that you went to feed the cows

789
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:01,420
when you went to the hill and
drank <i>makgeolli.</i> I should've known then.

790
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,755
This is just a game.

791
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,466
This is how you play this game.

792
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,343
Aren't I right, Professor Ahn?

793
00:43:08,427 --> 00:43:10,053
Totally.

794
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:14,307
Whether it is a game or gambling,

795
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,810
your true colors are bound to show
when you play.

796
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:18,770
Even if you had to betray someone,

797
00:43:18,854 --> 00:43:19,896
how could you betray

798
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,857
your best friend of 65 years?
How could you?

799
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,943
I was just playing the game
the best I could.

800
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,903
-Give me that. I'll do it.
-Forget it.

801
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:28,447
-Give me that.
-My gosh.

802
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,531
-Come here.
-Oh, no.

803
00:43:29,614 --> 00:43:31,908
-Wait.
-Stop it. My gosh.

804
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:34,619
-Hold on.
-Goodness!

805
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:35,871
-How could you?
-Hey.

806
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:44,337
Hey, Seok-hyeong.
Did you deliver the baby?

807
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,882
<i>Yes. Mom, how was it?</i>

808
00:43:47,466 --> 00:43:49,968
<i>Wasn't it uncomfortable
with strangers around?</i>

809
00:43:50,385 --> 00:43:52,512
<i>Let's go to a hot spring next weekend.</i>

810
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,973
<i>I found a good hot spring in Gangwon-do.</i>

811
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:58,226
I want to hang out with them
next weekend, too.

812
00:43:58,602 --> 00:43:59,603
<i>What?</i>

813
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,062
<i>Really?</i>

814
00:44:02,147 --> 00:44:05,484
I haven't laughed this much
since I got old.

815
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:09,029
I've never met people who are
as entertaining as they are my whole life.

816
00:44:09,905 --> 00:44:12,908
Thank you, son.

817
00:44:13,158 --> 00:44:16,661
Tell Jeong-won that I thanked him.

818
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:20,040
I had a lot of fun in a long while.

819
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,168
Okay.

820
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:35,847
You're back already?

821
00:44:37,265 --> 00:44:38,308
Why did you order so much?

822
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:40,185
I heard another nurse will be joining us.

823
00:44:40,268 --> 00:44:43,271
So there are only three of us.
We can't have all of that.

824
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:03,625
She eats so much,
but she doesn't gain weight.

825
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,586
I know. Gosh, it's so annoying.

826
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,340
Didn't you say you were going to a musical
with your boyfriend last weekend?

827
00:45:10,423 --> 00:45:12,384
-Was it good?
-We broke up.

828
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:13,552
Why?

829
00:45:13,802 --> 00:45:16,263
He suddenly asked me
how much my annual salary was.

830
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:19,307
I thought he might help me
with my investments, so I told him.

831
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:21,601
After that, he asked me
what my father does for a living.

832
00:45:22,936 --> 00:45:25,438
I thought his questions
were a bit childish.

833
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,440
I was slightly irritated,

834
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,943
and I began to question his intentions.

835
00:45:30,026 --> 00:45:32,904
I told him that my father ran
a guesthouse in Gangwon-do.

836
00:45:32,988 --> 00:45:34,114
And what happened?

837
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:36,491
In case he thought we ran a fancy resort,

838
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:39,077
I told him it was a small guesthouse
at the foot of Seoraksan.

839
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,454
His face turned grim all of a sudden.

840
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:42,789
He runs a guesthouse?

841
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,083
How nice. The view must be great.

842
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,751
Only the view is great.

843
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:48,545
Anyway, since I'm a doctor,

844
00:45:48,628 --> 00:45:51,881
he must have assumed I had
a lot of money and had a rich family.

845
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:53,967
My gosh, he's so materialistic.

846
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:56,303
Gosh, poor you, Min-ha.

847
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,554
You're in trouble now.

848
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,347
She has a wish, you know.

849
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:02,100
She wants to have her first kiss
on Christmas wearing matching rings.

850
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:05,145
Your first kiss?
I've never been kissed before, either.

851
00:46:05,979 --> 00:46:07,522
Are you mad?

852
00:46:07,606 --> 00:46:09,608
I meant the first kiss of this year. Okay?

853
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:10,692
I see.

854
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:12,193
You still have a lot of time.

855
00:46:12,277 --> 00:46:13,653
You should go on blind dates.

856
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:15,614
Actually,

857
00:46:15,697 --> 00:46:19,326
I'm going to stop going on blind dates.

858
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:22,704
I'm thinking of confessing my feelings.

859
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:25,999
You have a crush?

860
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:29,878
Well, you know...

861
00:46:33,548 --> 00:46:34,549
Yes?

862
00:46:35,216 --> 00:46:36,426
Okay. I got it.

863
00:46:37,302 --> 00:46:40,055
I just got a call saying Kim Jae-yeong
is experiencing a gross ROM.

864
00:46:40,138 --> 00:46:41,765
They sent her up to the delivery room.

865
00:46:41,848 --> 00:46:42,891
Who was that again?

866
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:45,560
I told you about her once.
The really affectionate couple.

867
00:46:45,644 --> 00:46:48,063
The husband said he'd sing,
so the wife smacked him.

868
00:46:48,146 --> 00:46:49,564
Right.

869
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,317
All right. You're doing very well.

870
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,027
Breathe quickly.

871
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,487
Push harder.

872
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,697
Push harder. Push.

873
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,450
Okay. Great.

874
00:47:00,742 --> 00:47:03,495
Honey, you're doing so well. So great.

875
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:12,420
<i>Cardiothoracic surgeon needed in the ER.</i>

876
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,177
The patient had a cardiac arrest
due to bradycardia.

877
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,595
I performed CPR for three minutes.

878
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,514
His cardiac activity has been
restored for now.

879
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,141
Let's check his ultrasound.

880
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:30,605
My gosh, his heart is in awful shape.

881
00:47:30,689 --> 00:47:33,566
Why didn't he come to the hospital sooner?

882
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,276
He probably didn't have the money.

883
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,154
According to his colleague,
he works in logistics during the day

884
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:40,115
and does deliveries
for fish markets at night.

885
00:47:40,198 --> 00:47:41,866
What about his guardian? Did anyone come?

886
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,576
I talked to his father a few minutes ago.

887
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,453
He's on his way right now
from the country.

888
00:47:46,037 --> 00:47:49,374
When I checked, his father is receiving
chemo at our hospital.

889
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:51,793
Why is he in the country
if he's doing chemo here?

890
00:47:51,876 --> 00:47:53,837
He works in construction.

891
00:47:56,131 --> 00:47:58,383
Both of them live
from paycheck to paycheck.

892
00:47:58,466 --> 00:48:00,635
His colleague is already worried
about the medical bill.

893
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:01,928
We'll think about that later.

894
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:03,430
Let's prep him for surgery first.

895
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,140
Call Anesthesiology and ask for an OR.

896
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:07,267
And, Hui-su. Give me a call

897
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,227
-as soon as his father gets here.
-Okay.

898
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:18,903
Don't tell me you're here to see me.

899
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,488
Do you think you're that important?

900
00:48:20,572 --> 00:48:22,323
Ma'am, did you eat?

901
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:23,783
I came here to see your mother.

902
00:48:27,662 --> 00:48:30,248
The guardians of Oh Jae-il
can come in now.

903
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,799
Let's take a deep breath first.

904
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,343
Lift your head towards your stomach.

905
00:48:42,427 --> 00:48:45,597
One, two, three.

906
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:51,811
Great job. One more push.

907
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,189
All right. Push. A little more.

908
00:48:54,272 --> 00:48:56,608
You're almost there. Push.

909
00:48:56,691 --> 00:48:57,692
Push.

910
00:49:01,321 --> 00:49:02,614
You got it.

911
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:07,327
My gosh, how beautiful. Congratulations.

912
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:08,953
It's 1:51 p.m.

913
00:49:09,078 --> 00:49:11,289
It's 1:51 p.m. Congratulations.

914
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:14,167
Great job, honey.

915
00:49:37,482 --> 00:49:40,568
Thank you for coming to us, my baby.

916
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:42,821
Mommy loves you.

917
00:49:42,904 --> 00:49:45,031
You've checked
all of her fingers and toes.

918
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:48,827
The baby will be in the nursery
to maintain the temperature.

919
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,788
Sir, if you come over here,
we'll let you hold the baby.

920
00:49:53,414 --> 00:49:57,126
<i>When the world was withering me away</i>

921
00:49:57,418 --> 00:50:00,839
<i>You came into my world</i>

922
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,094
<i>When my heart was dry in a drought of love</i>

923
00:50:06,177 --> 00:50:09,973
<i>You were my much-needed rain</i>

924
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:14,519
<i>The song of hope which I had forgotten</i>

925
00:50:14,894 --> 00:50:18,106
<i>Came back to me as new sprouts grow</i>

926
00:50:18,231 --> 00:50:19,440
Papa.

927
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:25,154
<i>Living my life as I yearn for you</i>

928
00:50:25,238 --> 00:50:29,534
<i>Is a dream come true</i>

929
00:50:30,451 --> 00:50:33,872
<i>You, my beautiful love</i>

930
00:50:34,622 --> 00:50:38,543
<i>My dream is as warm
As the ray of sunshine in May</i>

931
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:40,795
<i>-I spend my night
</i>-Doctor.

932
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:43,590
<i>-As I wait for you</i>
-Doctor.

933
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,592
-Please tell him to stop.
<i>-How slow the night goes</i>

934
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,886
Please? Please tell him to stop.

935
00:50:47,969 --> 00:50:50,013
Please. Gosh.

936
00:50:51,306 --> 00:50:54,893
<i>I cannot not even begin to understand</i>

937
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:58,646
<i>The burden you are shouldering</i>

938
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:03,651
<i>I am feeling lonely today</i>

939
00:51:03,735 --> 00:51:07,196
<i>Just like any other day</i>

940
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,535
<i>When the thorn bushes rustle</i>

941
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:16,247
<i>I want to give you my heart</i>

942
00:51:17,415 --> 00:51:20,752
<i>And give you a place of rest</i>

943
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:26,132
<i>My precious love</i>

944
00:51:30,595 --> 00:51:31,596
Honey.

945
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:37,018
Honey.

946
00:51:44,192 --> 00:51:45,568
Your daughter is here.

947
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,198
Dad. It's your daughter.

948
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:55,870
Does it hurt?

949
00:51:58,706 --> 00:51:59,874
My daughter.

950
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:02,877
Are you hurt?

951
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,383
It doesn't. It doesn't hurt at all, Dad.

952
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,596
Didn't it hurt a lot?

953
00:52:15,974 --> 00:52:17,475
I'm sorry.

954
00:52:18,476 --> 00:52:20,478
There's nothing to be sorry about.

955
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,897
Don't be sorry, Dad.

956
00:52:55,555 --> 00:52:58,433
<i>When the world was withering me away</i>

957
00:52:59,308 --> 00:53:01,144
<i>You came into my world...</i>

958
00:53:01,227 --> 00:53:03,312
Professor Kim,
this is Kim Tae-jin's father.

959
00:53:03,396 --> 00:53:04,439
Doctor.

960
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,275
Please take good care of my son.

961
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:10,486
Please save him.

962
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:11,863
We put him under 20 minutes ago.

963
00:53:11,946 --> 00:53:13,948
He has endocarditis.
His endocardium was infected,

964
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:15,783
so it's badly damaged now.

965
00:53:15,867 --> 00:53:18,119
As the damage is severe,
the endocardium can't be repaired.

966
00:53:18,202 --> 00:53:19,746
I will insert a prosthetic valve.

967
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,039
Oh, no.

968
00:53:21,873 --> 00:53:23,374
Oh, no.

969
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:25,543
The surgery will take about four hours.

970
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:28,046
It may take longer, or it may not.

971
00:53:28,463 --> 00:53:30,256
I'll do my best.

972
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:34,427
Doctor.

973
00:53:35,678 --> 00:53:36,554
Please give him

974
00:53:37,555 --> 00:53:40,683
the most expensive prosthetic valve.

975
00:53:43,144 --> 00:53:46,606
Please give him the most expensive one.

976
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:56,741
Don't worry, sir.

977
00:53:57,325 --> 00:53:59,619
I will give him the most expensive

978
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:03,081
and the best prosthetic valve
in this world.

979
00:54:03,831 --> 00:54:05,333
Thank you.

980
00:54:09,253 --> 00:54:10,546
Thank you.

981
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:12,715
Thank you.

982
00:54:20,264 --> 00:54:23,810
NAME: HONG GEON-HUI, NEUROSURGERY

983
00:54:33,152 --> 00:54:34,237
Honey.

984
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:50,962
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER,
PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

985
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:53,965
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

986
00:55:07,436 --> 00:55:08,771
Hey, aren't you going home?

987
00:55:09,355 --> 00:55:10,940
I have to hand this in by tomorrow.

988
00:55:11,023 --> 00:55:13,025
-What is it?
-An assignment for the KIHASA.

989
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,277
Make the residents do it.

990
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,696
I'm writing on how to improve
their medical work environment.

991
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:18,447
How can I make them do it?

992
00:55:18,531 --> 00:55:21,826
-I can finish it if I pull an all-nighter.
-Come on, take it easy.

993
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:23,578
Stop talking to me.

994
00:55:24,871 --> 00:55:26,164
Hey!

995
00:55:26,247 --> 00:55:27,331
Gosh.

996
00:55:45,266 --> 00:55:48,728
It's decaffeinated. I thought
you might have had a lot of coffee today.

997
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,316
Can I stay for a bit?

998
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:58,154
Yes. Sit over there for a moment.

999
00:56:02,575 --> 00:56:04,285
Did you have something to say to me?

1000
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,246
Do you need some help?

1001
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,956
I'm good at running errands.

1002
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:11,792
Do you

1003
00:56:12,418 --> 00:56:13,920
like me?

1004
00:56:25,097 --> 00:56:26,349
Yes.

1005
00:56:31,604 --> 00:56:33,105
I like you. Yes.

1006
00:56:36,108 --> 00:56:38,069
I was going to tell you,

1007
00:56:38,152 --> 00:56:39,528
but I couldn't find the right time.

1008
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:42,323
I'm sorry.

1009
00:56:44,075 --> 00:56:45,368
I'm sorry.

1010
00:56:49,413 --> 00:56:51,916
But my feelings for you are sincere.

1011
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,211
-I've had them for a while now--
-Hey.

1012
00:56:57,672 --> 00:56:59,215
Don't.

1013
00:56:59,882 --> 00:57:01,801
Hey. Stop talking.

1014
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:03,719
What's wrong with you?

1015
00:57:05,346 --> 00:57:07,098
I'll behave accordingly,

1016
00:57:07,723 --> 00:57:09,433
so you won't feel uncomfortable.

1017
00:57:09,517 --> 00:57:12,353
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1018
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:15,940
Hey, just don't.

1019
00:57:16,941 --> 00:57:18,317
Okay?

1020
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:21,779
Well, it's not something
I have control over.

1021
00:57:23,614 --> 00:57:27,285
I can't just stop because you told me to.

1022
00:57:40,381 --> 00:57:41,632
I'll get going.

1023
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,011
Bye.

1024
00:57:58,065 --> 00:58:00,234
-Will Jeong-won stay up all night again?
-Yes.

1025
00:58:00,943 --> 00:58:02,236
By the way, who's at your house?

1026
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,446
Ik-sun.

1027
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:07,116
She came to Seoul to attend
her friend's wedding.

1028
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:09,410
She'll stay over and go back
first thing tomorrow morning.

1029
00:58:09,493 --> 00:58:10,661
I'll sleep in the living room.

1030
00:58:10,745 --> 00:58:12,997
I will. I'm the one crashing there.

1031
00:58:13,581 --> 00:58:16,208
Which degree black belt was Ik-sun
in taekwondo again?

1032
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:17,793
-First degree.
-What about judo?

1033
00:58:18,711 --> 00:58:20,421
Judo? First degree.

1034
00:58:20,504 --> 00:58:21,797
Is she a real soldier?

1035
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:23,382
Well...

1036
00:58:25,676 --> 00:58:26,510
Go ahead.

1037
00:58:26,594 --> 00:58:28,346
<i>Yun Jeong-hui has an increased drainage</i>

1038
00:58:28,429 --> 00:58:30,806
<i>and there's a color change.
I suspect she's bleeding.</i>

1039
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:33,100
Check her vitals and do a CBC.
I'll be right there.

1040
00:58:33,184 --> 00:58:35,227
-I'll drop you off.
-No.

1041
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,520
Drop me off over there.

1042
00:58:36,604 --> 00:58:37,897
The subway is quicker.

1043
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:22,900
Jun-wan.

1044
00:59:25,486 --> 00:59:26,362
Jun-wan.

1045
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:30,324
Are you okay?

1046
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,540
The patients seem to get better

1047
00:59:37,623 --> 00:59:40,167
the moment I call for you.

1048
00:59:40,709 --> 00:59:43,212
-I'm sorry.
-No. It's all right.

1049
00:59:43,587 --> 00:59:47,007
It's not like I've got anything better
to do at home.

1050
00:59:47,633 --> 00:59:49,885
Oh, right. Jeong-won's been
staying at my house.

1051
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:52,430
Really? Invite me to your home.

1052
00:59:52,513 --> 00:59:54,098
Yes, let's pick a day. Today?

1053
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,560
Wait, I can't do it today.
My younger sister is staying over today.

1054
00:59:57,935 --> 01:00:00,271
I'll try to pick another date. Gosh.

1055
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:04,567
I heard that your younger sister
is in the military.

1056
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,026
Is she good at martial arts?

1057
01:00:08,028 --> 01:00:09,113
A total of 15 degrees.

1058
01:00:24,462 --> 01:00:26,297
Sixth degree in Muay Thai,
in the national team.

1059
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,257
Fourth degree in hapkido,
third degree in kendo,

1060
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,842
First degree in taekwondo and judo.

1061
01:00:29,925 --> 01:00:33,846
I heard that she's been
practicing jiu-jitsu lately.

1062
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:35,055
No way.

1063
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:39,226
My sister is really good at kicks.

1064
01:00:39,727 --> 01:00:42,396
Her kicks are amazing.
They really are something else.

1065
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,566
Guess how many kicks she can do
in a second. I'll exaggerate just a bit.

1066
01:00:45,649 --> 01:00:47,067
She can do 1,000 kicks. I'm serious.

1067
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:50,571
You know,

1068
01:00:51,405 --> 01:00:52,573
your kicks...

1069
01:00:54,074 --> 01:00:56,285
Your right kicks...

1070
01:00:57,536 --> 01:00:58,537
They're deadly.

1071
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:00,581
I thought you were a robber.

1072
01:01:00,664 --> 01:01:03,209
What kind of a robber punches in
the door code when entering?

1073
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,376
A new kind of robber?

1074
01:01:07,505 --> 01:01:08,923
Do you want more kimchi?

1075
01:01:26,065 --> 01:01:27,233
My goodness.

1076
01:01:35,783 --> 01:01:37,076
So you're leaving at dawn?

1077
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:39,954
Yes. I'm taking the first bus.
I have to be there by 8 a.m.

1078
01:01:40,913 --> 01:01:43,249
Have you ever gone on a blind date
with a celebrity?

1079
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:45,834
Where did that come from?

1080
01:01:45,918 --> 01:01:49,380
The groom at the wedding turned out
to be the CEO of an entertainment agency.

1081
01:01:49,463 --> 01:01:51,257
And his agency signed only one actress.

1082
01:01:51,423 --> 01:01:52,967
She even came to the wedding.

1083
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,719
She asked me
if I was Ik-jun's younger sister.

1084
01:01:57,027 --> 01:02:00,364
The groom at the wedding turned out
to be the CEO of an entertainment agency.

1085
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,241
And his agency signed only one actress.

1086
01:02:02,408 --> 01:02:03,951
She even came to the wedding.

1087
01:02:04,034 --> 01:02:06,704
She asked me
if I was Ik-jun's younger sister.

1088
01:02:07,788 --> 01:02:10,082
-Is this the actress?
-Yes, that's her.

1089
01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:12,668
She was gorgeous in person.

1090
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:14,211
And she had a good personality, too.

1091
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:17,631
Did you really go on a blind date
with an actress?

1092
01:02:17,715 --> 01:02:18,591
Should I tell her?

1093
01:02:23,012 --> 01:02:24,180
We used to date.

1094
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,850
Oh, my <i>gat</i> kimchi.

1095
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:29,143
You're not lying, right?

1096
01:02:29,226 --> 01:02:30,853
Weren't you a public health doctor, then?

1097
01:02:30,936 --> 01:02:32,938
I was in the fourth year of my residency.

1098
01:02:33,022 --> 01:02:34,982
After seeing me on <i>Good Doctors</i>
for five seconds,

1099
01:02:35,065 --> 01:02:36,775
she had a crush on me and called me.

1100
01:02:36,859 --> 01:02:38,527
I don't believe it.

1101
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:40,154
I used to be pretty popular back then.

1102
01:02:40,654 --> 01:02:41,655
Why did you break up?

1103
01:02:41,739 --> 01:02:44,074
If you had tied the knot,
you would've been happily married.

1104
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:47,119
-You wouldn't have met that ex of yours.
-Then, I wouldn't have U-ju.

1105
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:48,746
Goodness.

1106
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:50,873
But seriously,
why did you break up with her?

1107
01:02:50,956 --> 01:02:53,584
She even came to Changwon
when you were a public health doctor.

1108
01:02:55,794 --> 01:02:56,962
She wouldn't eat.

1109
01:02:57,296 --> 01:02:58,672
-What?
-What are you talking about?

1110
01:02:58,756 --> 01:03:00,716
When we met, she never ate.

1111
01:03:02,176 --> 01:03:05,221
And it looked like she was
addicted to sleeping pills.

1112
01:03:05,512 --> 01:03:07,306
When I woke up
to go to work in the morning,

1113
01:03:07,389 --> 01:03:09,225
she would go to sleep then.

1114
01:03:09,308 --> 01:03:13,103
It felt like she lived in
a different world from me.

1115
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,856
Of course, in the end, she dumped me.

1116
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,984
Are you serious? You really dated her?

1117
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:19,985
I'm serious.

1118
01:03:20,194 --> 01:03:22,404
You never believe me anything I say.

1119
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:24,156
Even if it's the most obvious truth.

1120
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,992
You should have earned my trust
when you had the time.

1121
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,828
Where am I sleeping tonight?

1122
01:03:30,037 --> 01:03:32,039
-Let me sleep in your room.
-No.

1123
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:34,375
-Sleep in Jun-wan's room.
-With him?

1124
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:35,876
Are you crazy?

1125
01:03:36,502 --> 01:03:38,295
Jun-wan will sleep on the sofa.

1126
01:03:39,713 --> 01:03:41,632
Oh, gosh.

1127
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:44,718
Sometimes, you're so fake.

1128
01:03:45,928 --> 01:03:47,012
You're spot-on.

1129
01:04:09,743 --> 01:04:11,287
Hello? Who is this?

1130
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:12,663
<i>Who is this?</i>

1131
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:14,581
Who is this?

1132
01:04:14,999 --> 01:04:16,000
<i>Is it you, Jun-wan?</i>

1133
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:18,419
Is this your phone, Ik-sun?

1134
01:04:18,502 --> 01:04:20,921
<i>I must have left it at home.
I thought I left it in the taxi.</i>

1135
01:04:21,005 --> 01:04:22,756
<i>My gosh. What a relief.</i>

1136
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,883
-Where are you now?
<i>-At the terminal.</i>

1137
01:04:24,967 --> 01:04:27,511
<i>I came early in case of a traffic jam,
but I'm too early.</i>

1138
01:04:27,928 --> 01:04:29,805
<i>I'm sorry to ask you this,</i>

1139
01:04:30,055 --> 01:04:32,599
<i>but can you please send
my phone to my base?</i>

1140
01:04:32,683 --> 01:04:34,393
<i>It takes only a day via courier
these days.</i>

1141
01:04:34,476 --> 01:04:36,186
I'll bring it to you myself. Stay there.

1142
01:04:37,187 --> 01:04:39,606
Okay. At the exit.

1143
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:40,733
The toast truck?

1144
01:04:41,317 --> 01:04:42,484
Okay.

1145
01:04:53,954 --> 01:04:55,914
What are you eating at this hour?

1146
01:04:57,833 --> 01:04:58,959
This is your phone, right?

1147
01:05:00,502 --> 01:05:02,546
Thank you.

1148
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:06,550
I have a present for you.

1149
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:20,814
I'm just kidding.

1150
01:05:21,482 --> 01:05:22,941
I have a real present.

1151
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,653
I heard you like chocolate.

1152
01:05:28,322 --> 01:05:29,448
This is the one, right?

1153
01:05:31,075 --> 01:05:32,326
Give me your hand.

1154
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:35,954
Here. Oh, no.

1155
01:05:37,831 --> 01:05:38,832
Oh, no.

1156
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:41,835
Sorry. Stop.

1157
01:05:42,044 --> 01:05:44,213
No. Put them back in.

1158
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,468
Oh, no.

1159
01:05:49,551 --> 01:05:50,928
No. Let me do it.

1160
01:05:51,136 --> 01:05:52,262
I have no choice.

1161
01:05:53,555 --> 01:05:56,308
Here. The rest is mine.

1162
01:05:56,809 --> 01:05:57,851
Okay.

1163
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:07,194
Have I told you that I like you?

1164
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:15,536
Go out with me.

1165
01:06:31,135 --> 01:06:32,344
My goodness.

1166
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:35,806
Mr. Go Yeong-min.

1167
01:06:37,015 --> 01:06:38,100
Hello.

1168
01:06:38,183 --> 01:06:39,768
Hi.

1169
01:06:39,935 --> 01:06:41,019
Hello.

1170
01:06:41,103 --> 01:06:42,396
How are you feeling?

1171
01:06:42,479 --> 01:06:43,897
I'm feeling great.

1172
01:06:44,148 --> 01:06:46,733
I guess money can
really buy you happiness.

1173
01:06:46,817 --> 01:06:48,610
My daughter is spoiling me
with this VIP room.

1174
01:06:51,363 --> 01:06:52,364
Who's his daughter?

1175
01:06:52,948 --> 01:06:53,991
Didn't you know?

1176
01:06:54,074 --> 01:06:55,701
I don't check who the patient's family is.

1177
01:06:57,578 --> 01:06:59,204
Hello.

1178
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,623
You should have hired a caregiver.

1179
01:07:01,707 --> 01:07:04,042
Professor Lee. This is
the patient's daughter, Ms. Go A-ra.

1180
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:09,840
Long time no see.

1181
01:07:10,924 --> 01:07:11,925
Hello.

1182
01:07:15,429 --> 01:07:16,555
Yes.

1183
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,856
Hello?

1184
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:29,151
Who is this again?

1185
01:07:29,234 --> 01:07:32,196
<i>I'm the person who's living
with Chairman Yang Tae-yang.</i>

1186
01:07:32,446 --> 01:07:34,490
<i>Right. I'm the adulterer.</i>

1187
01:07:34,781 --> 01:07:37,701
<i>That's what people call me. The adulterer.</i>

1188
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:39,328
Why did you call me?

1189
01:07:39,411 --> 01:07:41,413
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

1190
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:43,457
<i>I know it's uncomfortable for you,</i>

1191
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:45,375
<i>but could we meet in person for a moment?</i>

1192
01:07:45,834 --> 01:07:47,794
<i>There's a nice garden behind the hospital.</i>

1193
01:07:47,878 --> 01:07:49,338
<i>Let's meet there.</i>

1194
01:08:07,981 --> 01:08:08,941
I'll talk to you later.

1195
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:23,497
Hello. Two large cups
of iced Americano, please.

1196
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,290
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1197
01:08:27,501 --> 01:08:29,503
It's spilled milk.

1198
01:08:30,003 --> 01:08:31,421
I know she's thinking,

1199
01:08:31,505 --> 01:08:33,966
"Screw you. I won't let you be happy.
Over my dead body."

1200
01:08:34,466 --> 01:08:36,552
I do understand her

1201
01:08:37,636 --> 01:08:39,805
but refusing to divorce him isn't right.

1202
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,811
Could you persuade your mother?

1203
01:08:46,353 --> 01:08:48,230
I think she'd at least listen to her son.

1204
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:50,649
I don't want to.

1205
01:09:11,128 --> 01:09:12,254
I am...

1206
01:09:12,879 --> 01:09:14,673
pregnant.

1207
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:17,718
I'm three months pregnant already.

1208
01:09:18,969 --> 01:09:21,471
Let's not choose the difficult path
for all of us.

1209
01:09:22,389 --> 01:09:24,558
I know that she despises me,

1210
01:09:25,058 --> 01:09:27,352
but how long can she keep this up?
She's throwing a tantrum.

1211
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:30,355
I heard she's not well.

1212
01:09:32,608 --> 01:09:34,818
What's the point of hating a girl like me?

1213
01:09:38,196 --> 01:09:39,865
Let's be adults about this.

1214
01:09:39,948 --> 01:09:42,951
We should do what must be done
for both parties

1215
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:45,120
and settle things once and for all.

1216
01:09:45,996 --> 01:09:48,248
We have a long life ahead of us.

1217
01:09:51,543 --> 01:09:53,462
I trust that you'll talk to your mother.

1218
01:09:53,545 --> 01:09:55,505
You're a smart man.

1219
01:10:05,432 --> 01:10:08,018
If you didn't feel any lumps before

1220
01:10:08,101 --> 01:10:10,395
and you suddenly feel a big lump,

1221
01:10:10,896 --> 01:10:14,441
it could be a sign of bad news.

1222
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:18,153
From the way the lump felt,

1223
01:10:18,987 --> 01:10:20,947
it was quite firm.

1224
01:10:21,031 --> 01:10:23,533
And when you look at its shape,

1225
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,371
it's spiky as you can see here.

1226
01:10:27,704 --> 01:10:30,290
And there's a shadow in the back here.

1227
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,168
The shape is irregular.

1228
01:10:35,128 --> 01:10:36,296
In this case,

1229
01:10:36,755 --> 01:10:38,965
it's better to get a biopsy.

1230
01:10:39,758 --> 01:10:42,386
Why don't you get the biopsy today?

1231
01:10:45,722 --> 01:10:47,974
I have a job.

1232
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:49,351
How long will it take?

1233
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:51,061
About 20 minutes.

1234
01:10:51,937 --> 01:10:54,272
Okay. Let's do it right away.

1235
01:11:29,964 --> 01:11:36,226

<i>Hey, Jun-wan. Are you seeing someone?</i>

1237
01:11:54,499 --> 01:11:56,126
My gosh, that immature prick.

1238
01:11:56,209 --> 01:11:58,503
You know that you're the first, right?

1239
01:11:58,587 --> 01:12:01,423
I think my sister likes you.

1240
01:12:01,506 --> 01:12:03,175
I know that very well.

1241
01:12:03,258 --> 01:12:04,968
<i>The two of them are driving me nuts.</i>

1242
01:12:05,051 --> 01:12:07,304
<i>Have you ever seen Ik-jun
fall for a girl first?</i>

1243
01:12:07,387 --> 01:12:09,556
I should buy you a meal sometime.

1244
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:12,642
<i>She said she's not ready
to date someone yet.</i>

1245
01:12:12,726 --> 01:12:14,728
I think it will take her some time.

1246
01:12:14,811 --> 01:12:16,772
<i>Did you know you two had
a huge transformation?</i>

1247
01:12:16,855 --> 01:12:17,898
<i>Us two?</i>

1248
01:12:17,981 --> 01:12:19,816
It's the school entrance. Why take a bus?

1249
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:23,987
<i>Doesn't Dr. Jang like Professor Ahn?</i>

1250
01:12:24,112 --> 01:12:25,614
You're best friends with Dr. Jang, right?

1251
01:12:25,697 --> 01:12:27,115
Yes, I am. How do you know that?

1252
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,825
<i>Could he have feelings for me?</i>

1253
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,827
I have a question.

1254
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:32,913
<i>You can never know someone completely.</i>

1255
01:12:32,996 --> 01:12:34,539
<i>She acts as if everything is fine,</i>

1256
01:12:34,623 --> 01:12:36,750
<i>but I think something is up with her.</i>

1257
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,502
<i>Professor Chae is a good person.</i>

1258
01:12:38,585 --> 01:12:40,337
Something sounded off about her.

1259
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,296
Did something happen?

1260
01:12:41,379 --> 01:12:42,964
Go to the ER now.

1261
01:12:43,048 --> 01:12:44,299
<i>I'm not okay.</i>

1262
01:12:44,382 --> 01:12:47,052
<i>I think I would be in utter despair.</i>

1263
01:12:47,135 --> 01:12:50,180
<i>I want to live in a place
that's not too big or not too small</i>

1264
01:12:50,263 --> 01:12:51,097
just for a year.

1265
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:52,891
I can work at a hospital there, too.
