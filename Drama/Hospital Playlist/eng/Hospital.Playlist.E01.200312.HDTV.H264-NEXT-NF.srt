HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:09,886
You can get the lights
back up today, right?

3
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:13,223
Seok-hyeong, I'm holding a cup of coffee.

4
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:14,975
Sorry.

5
00:00:24,318 --> 00:00:25,819
How long has this place been empty?

6
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:27,904
Gosh, look at all this dust.

7
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:32,784
-About three to four years?
-Gosh.

8
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,374
I feel like I'm in a club.

9
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,377
That light will burn out soon.

10
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:44,588
Goodness.

11
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,138
Mom, the power went out again.

12
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:55,265
Can you get a technician quickly?

13
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:56,683
I see.

14
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:58,894
He'll be here shortly, then.

15
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:00,562
Okay.

16
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:05,025
Why didn't you also ask her
if it's okay for you to drink coffee?

17
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,568
She said one cup a day is okay.

18
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,949
You haven't thrown those out yet.

19
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:14,326
Why would I throw them out?

20
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,162
By the way,
are you really not going to do it?

21
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,956
Gosh, no. Of course not.

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,625
Then why are you here?

23
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,877
To see you. I was worried about you.

24
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:25,712
Then just do it.

25
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:27,756
You just need Ik-jun.

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,841
You don't need me.

27
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,052
He said no.

28
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,887
Seriously? He won't?

29
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:37,682
I won't do it either.

30
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:41,645
I don't have time anyway.
I need to help my guys with their thesis.

31
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,314
-Help me too.
-Why should I?

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,818
By the way, did you see Ji-eun today?

33
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,444
Yes.

34
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:51,905
Did you buy her things that she likes?

35
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,532
I bought her some food

36
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:57,077
and gave her a Bluetooth speaker
so that she can listen to music.

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,122
If only you were half as nice as that
to your friends.

38
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:02,749
Did the lights go out again?

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,837
Yes. This one was flickering
for a bit and burned out.

40
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,425
Gosh, it looks like
you probably should redo all the wiring.

41
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:13,635
We'll get this working temporarily,

42
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,679
-but call a bigger company if it reoccurs.
-Okay.

43
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:18,849
You could've worked on my room tomorrow.
You didn't have to work so late.

44
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:20,225
Thank you.

45
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,893
-All right.
-Oh, no.

46
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:24,354
Be careful, sir.

47
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:26,982
Sir, you should shut off the breaker
before you do that.

48
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,734
You're not even wearing gloves.
You'll get an electric shock.

49
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:35,073
Call an ambulance.

50
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,789
Are you all right? Are you in pain?

51
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,543
Hello? The address here
is 33-1 Jogang-dong.

52
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,211
A man collapsed due to an electric shock.

53
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:50,505
Get here quickly, please.
As soon as possible.

54
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:52,424
Are you having difficulty breathing?

55
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,429
My goodness. What's happening?

56
00:02:57,846 --> 00:02:58,722
Goodness.

57
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:03,810
Oh, no. What's happening to him?

58
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,278
Here!

59
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:15,155
We're here!

60
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:16,907
Here!

61
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:18,116
Sir.

62
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:20,660
Sir?

63
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,873
Sir, do you know where you are now?

64
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:33,507
Just leave him there, please.
You did great.

65
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,937
Hey, I'll be back soon.

66
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:52,108
He had an electric shock seven minutes ago
and got a mild burn on his right hand.

67
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,860
I performed CPR for two minutes.

68
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:56,488
His heart is pumping again,
but it's not stable yet.

69
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,198
-Are you a doctor?
-Yes.

70
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,743
His vitals seem unstable.

71
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:04,162
-Could you come with us?
-I got an emergency call.

72
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:06,289
Another doctor will accompany you.

73
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,085
That one.

74
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:14,172
Are you all right?

75
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,469
You were extremely lucky, man.

76
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:21,680
Both of them happened to be doctors.

77
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,015
You can hear me, right?

78
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:33,024
Both his BP and pulse are okay now.

79
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:34,401
I see.

80
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,738
Why is he shivering like this though?

81
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:42,075
Hey, are you okay?

82
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,960
He's just cold.

83
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:57,340
Excuse me.
Can you please turn up the heater?

84
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,261
Can you message him or something?

85
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,973
Tell him to jack up the heater.

86
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:19,202
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

87
00:05:20,572 --> 00:05:23,199
Seok-hyeong texted you, right?
I said I'd do it.

88
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,952
-My answer is no.
-So, you got his text?

89
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:27,829
No, that's what I'll say if he does.

90
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,956
I mean, aren't we too old for that?

91
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,251
I'd much rather go see my girlfriend.
Why would I see you guys?

92
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,754
Hey, are you getting engaged today
or something?

93
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,922
Why get all dressed up
just to see your girlfriend?

94
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:41,384
I made a reservation at a romantic place
in Busan with an ocean view.

95
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:45,096
Good for you. You're going on a date,
while I'm just going to work.

96
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:48,475
-By the way, how will you get there?
-By my girlfriend's car.

97
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,519
There she is. Pull over.

98
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,900
It looks like she's still drunk.

99
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:59,486
She pulled an all-nighter.
And we're leaving right away.

100
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,446
-Hey, you should drive.
-All right.

101
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,947
-Hey.
-Yes.

102
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:05,283
Work hard.

103
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,118
You prick.

104
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:08,787
<i>According to my research,</i>

105
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,664
Daeseong Hospital uses

106
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:15,377
a non-surgical procedure
to treat intussusception.

107
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:18,088
I've explained to you just now.

108
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:21,549
As for Bit-na, it's likely that necrosis
has already begun.

109
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:23,343
So surgery is the only option, ma'am.

110
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,721
You're sure, right?
Can she actually undergo the surgery?

111
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:29,140
She definitely needs the surgery, ma'am.

112
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:34,104
I read on the Internet that it stops kids
from growing taller after the surgery.

113
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,564
Don't believe things like that.

114
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:38,775
Just go to the reception
and have them book her surgery.

115
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,485
Okay.

116
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,530
-Then I'll trust you and--
-<i>According to my research,</i>

117
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:47,826
<i>Daeseong Hospital
uses a non-surgical procedure to treat...</i>

118
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:51,204
Do we have a room for Bit-na?
Call the ward again.

119
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:52,163
Yes, sir.

120
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,666
Please take good care of Bit-na.

121
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,418
-Thank you.
-No problem.

122
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:03,758
Dong-min, can we pull up your top
for a moment?

123
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,220
Just once, please.

124
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,934
My gosh, Teddy Bear.
You're here because of a stomachache?

125
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,644
Let me have a look.

126
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:19,232
Yes, doctor. My stomach hurts so much.

127
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:20,942
Let's see. What?

128
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:25,321
Wow, this took all the pain away.
You're totally fine now, right?

129
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,907
Yes, I'm fine now.

130
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:29,743
All right, then.

131
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:33,246
Let's check your mom's stomach now.

132
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:36,583
Doctor, I already feel much better.

133
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,168
I'm totally fine now.

134
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:42,922
All right. Then who's next?

135
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,551
-Dong-min, you want to try it?
-You want to go next?

136
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:50,388
Let's see. Good boy.
You're such a good boy.

137
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:58,563
Is this Busan?

138
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,899
I bet I got here before you did.

139
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:02,358
Let's have dinner together.

140
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,152
Okay. I just need to check
on a patient first.

141
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,488
-<i>Doors are closing.</i>
-Take it easy.

142
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:09,908
Who's in charge of Room 513?

143
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,495
Then who worked last night? You?

144
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:17,582
Who prescribed the fever reducer
to Kim Suk-hui in Room 513?

145
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,834
-It must've been you.
-No, it wasn't me.

146
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:21,961
Then was it you?

147
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,381
No, not a chance. I don't even know
what she looks like.

148
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:26,925
Right? You've never even seen her.

149
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,803
You prescribed it without even seeing her
because you wanted to sleep.

150
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:33,056
How dare you prescribe without seeing her?

151
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:35,225
Are you that confident as a doctor?

152
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:38,812
If you don't want to be a doctor,
just tell me. Don't waste my time.

153
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:40,647
Do you understand?

154
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:42,982
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

155
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:46,361
Hey.

156
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:48,738
Why all of a sudden?

157
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:50,532
Okay, I'll be right there.

158
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:54,786
Come on! Let's go.

159
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,254
Dr. Kim, the patient was hooked up
to the ECMO,

160
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:07,215
but she developed pulmonary edema,
so we intubated her.

161
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,676
We looked at the echo
but her heart was barely beating.

162
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,761
But Eun-a was okay up until yesterday.

163
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,972
We were going to remove ECMO
and move her to the ward.

164
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,391
-Does her family know?
-Yes.

165
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:28,653
Please spare us a moment, ma'am.

166
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:33,241
Eun-a has developed pulmonary edema
as her heart is not functioning well.

167
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,868
ECMO isn't enough anymore.

168
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,537
An artificial heart will be better

169
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,789
in reducing the pressure
on her left ventricle.

170
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:42,041
She needs surgery
either today or tomorrow.

171
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,751
My gosh, what should I do?

172
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:48,214
Doctor, we can't afford to pay
for the surgery at the moment.

173
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,341
It'll cost a fortune.

174
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,343
Where can I get the money?

175
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:55,054
Doctor, please give me a week.

176
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,849
Then I'll figure out a way
to get some money no matter what.

177
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,727
Please... My Eun-a...

178
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,313
Please save her.

179
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:06,524
We can't really wait though.
She needs surgery immediately.

180
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,067
If we wait, she may not make it.

181
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,903
What do I do, then?

182
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,157
Don't worry. We have many programs
to support our patients,

183
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,535
so I'm sure Eun-a can get the surgery.
And we can do it right away.

184
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,078
Hey, look into it.

185
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,294
-Hey, call them now.
-Yes, sir.

186
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,212
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY CHAT ROOM

187
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,048
5-YEAR-OLD GIRL, DCMP

188
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:32,008
WHERE SHOULD I CALL?

189
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:36,888
I have to do the surgery
and take care of this?

190
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,181
What do you do?

191
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:42,852
Hello? This is Kim Jun-wan
from Cardiothoracic Surgery.

192
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,813
Can we get some help
from the Daddy-Long-Legs Program?

193
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:48,441
Just a second, please.

194
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:53,488
SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE

195
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,534
Hello. I'm Lee Seok-hyeon,
a cardiothoracic surgery resident.

196
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:01,037
Could you help one of our patients
with her surgery costs?

197
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:04,457
We can't wait.
She needs surgery immediately.

198
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,544
Yes, can the Daddy-Long-Legs Program
help her finance it?

199
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,588
She's five.

200
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,132
It's for implanting
a ventricular assist device.

201
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,849
What did you order?
Did you order <i>tteokbokki</i> again?

202
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:23,184
When can we find out?

203
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:24,686
Go ahead and eat.

204
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,605
Hey, why didn't you order burgers instead?

205
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,899
I got level one, so it won't be spicy.
Just eat, will you?

206
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:31,317
You haven't texted them yet?

207
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,696
<i>We had to do some final checks.
We'll text them now.</i>

208
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:38,449
<i>If everything looks good,
you'll get the money in a couple of days.</i>

209
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:42,453
I see. Please let me know
as soon as you hear from them. Thank you.

210
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:44,789
It's not spicy, right?

211
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,375
You don't find this spicy?
You need to see a doctor.

212
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,710
No, that will cost me.

213
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,589
I'll probably get a call soon.

214
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:56,342
-See? <i>Tteokbokki</i> was a good call.
-Just answer that, prick.

215
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:58,720
Gosh, today's been a disaster.

216
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,641
Hey, I'm still at the hospital.

217
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,184
I'm going to leave now.

218
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:07,020
Yes, where are you?

219
00:12:09,856 --> 00:12:11,524
Why? I didn't eat anything. Right.

220
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:12,442
Of course.

221
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:14,485
-Where are you?
-<i>What do you think?</i>

222
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:16,362
What are you doing this weekend?

223
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:18,614
<i>I've got a date.
Professor Jang is free this weekend.</i>

224
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,075
Everyone's going on a date.

225
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,036
<i>Is Jun-wan still seeing that girl?</i>

226
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:24,746
<i>This one's lasting for a while.</i>

227
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,873
<i>Why did you call?
I bet it's about Seok-hyeong.</i>

228
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,374
<i>I already said no.</i>

229
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,668
No. As for that fool,
we can just ignore him.

230
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,379
I have a favor to ask.

231
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:36,174
-<i>Is everything okay?</i>
-Yes, everything's fine.

232
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:38,217
There's something I've been working on.

233
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,804
You know what? Let's talk in person.
You should go home.

234
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:43,681
I'm going home early for a change.

235
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:47,393
-What's up?
-Min-yeong's vitals aren't looking good.

236
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:48,644
I have to go.

237
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:50,813
-What's going on?
-Her BP keeps dropping.

238
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:53,357
It's not getting better
even after a full 100ml bag of saline.

239
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,903
-Has she gotten norepinephrine?
-Yes, but her vitals are still unstable.

240
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,908
It doesn't sound like
you can go home tonight.

241
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,796
YULJE'S CHAIRMAN AHN BYEONG-U
UNCONSCIOUS DUE TO BRAIN HEMORRHAGE

242
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:16,589
CHAIRMAN AHN HAS FALLEN INTO A COMA

243
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,470
WILL HIS THIRD SON TAKE OVER
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER?

244
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:28,351
ALL EYES ARE ON WHO WILL BE
THE NEXT LEADER OF YULJE FOUNDATION

245
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,189
Yes, sir.

246
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,442
I read the article.

247
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,820
<i>I have to stay
with the chairman all night.</i>

248
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:42,156
<i>So take care of the craniectomy
for the subdural hematoma patient,</i>

249
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,033
<i>as well as the VP shunt surgery tomorrow.</i>

250
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:45,493
Yes, sir.

251
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,912
But are you all right?

252
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:51,749
<i>No, everyone's getting ready
for the worst-case scenario. It's hard.</i>

253
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:12,311
-Hello, how are you?
-Not well, obviously.

254
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:15,022
My apologies, ma'am.

255
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:17,024
No need to apologize. It is what it is.

256
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,276
Don't worry about it.

257
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,736
He's the director of the hospital.

258
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:23,781
And he is in charge of the Brain Center.

259
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,741
Is that important now?

260
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,786
Right. It's nice to meet you anyway.

261
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,123
Will he not make it?

262
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,625
Frankly, it won't be easy.

263
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:36,377
But we'll do our very best.

264
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,045
Mr. Pyeon, you're here.

265
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:40,798
What on earth happened?

266
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,844
Ma'am, please spare me a moment.

267
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,979
Mr. Ju, why don't we have some coffee
in my office?

268
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,398
Don't worry about things here.

269
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,151
DIRECTOR JU JEON

270
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:07,408
-Hey, come and have some coffee.
-Oh, I was going to do it.

271
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,076
What's the point of saying that now?

272
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:11,829
Hey, come join us.

273
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:20,755
The night view is awesome.

274
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,925
Can you actually enjoy
the night view right now?

275
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:27,720
That punk who's still wet behind the ears
is about to inherit the hospital.

276
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:29,722
He's 40. He's not that young.

277
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,599
Will the hospital

278
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,602
fall into the hands
of his youngest son who's a doctor?

279
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,604
I bet he hasn't even written his will yet.

280
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,980
Even if he has one,

281
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:40,149
the board will have to vote
to make the decision.

282
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:43,444
But they may vote
to appoint Mr. Ju to the position.

283
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:47,573
I think you should call
the board members, ma'am.

284
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,201
Even better
if Andrea can call them himself.

285
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:56,874
I'm sure things will go smoothly,
but just in case. I mean, you never know.

286
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,795
I suggest you call Chairman Hwang
first thing tomorrow.

287
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,880
It's because of Mr. Ju, isn't it?

288
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:06,717
<i>All the board members
are Chairman Ahn's people.</i>

289
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:10,388
The other members tend to follow
Chairman Hwang's lead.

290
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,014
He's Chairman Ahn's friend for 30 years.

291
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:15,977
Chairman Ahn's wife just needs
to make one phone call to him.

292
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,561
Then it's game over.

293
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,857
Chairman Ahn is such a wonderful person.

294
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,778
But he, too, is a greedy man after all.

295
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,197
You can't call him greedy for this.

296
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,658
He's donated most of his assets.

297
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,870
Why did you pick the foundation
to begin with?

298
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,416
As for all the other subsidiaries,
they hired management specialists.

299
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,629
Jeez, I thought I'd ride on my cousin's
coattails for the first time ever.

300
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:48,426
We don't know yet.

301
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,265
I should do my best.

302
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,895
I called them a while ago.
Why aren't they here yet?

303
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,189
I taught my children wrong.

304
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,066
There he is.

305
00:17:09,989 --> 00:17:11,449
Where did Mr. Ju go?

306
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:13,492
He probably went to his wife's office.

307
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:18,539
What an eventful year
this has been for him.

308
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,126
By the way,

309
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:25,046
why would Chairman Ahn pass
the hospital down to his youngest son?

310
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,589
I heard he has three sons.

311
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,134
Did the elder ones cause trouble
or something?

312
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,969
Is next week your last week here?

313
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,971
-Yes.
-Back to your hometown?

314
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:37,892
I suppose you really have no interest
in worldly matters.

315
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,186
Even little kids would know
the answer to that.

316
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:42,563
As for his eldest son,

317
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,524
he's too busy with his current job.

318
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:50,071
Hello.

319
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,908
Hey, you came.

320
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:56,243
Hi.

321
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,789
Mom, are you all right?

322
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,834
-What about his second son?
-He assists someone who's very high up.

323
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,816
Doesn't he also have a daughter?

324
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,652
She's the same.

325
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,326
It's been a while.

326
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,038
Dad...

327
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:44,834
His second daughter too?

328
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:00,641
Is my youngest son coming or what?

329
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,894
At this rate, he'll get here
after your dad's funeral.

330
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:07,982
Mom, Andrea is in the elevator now.

331
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,152
Finally. Your brothers and sisters are
all here.

332
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,792
<i>My youngest son, please spare me a second.</i>

333
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:28,544
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

334
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,838
-You told him, right?
-Yes.

335
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,591
It would be a good idea to call him now.

336
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:36,510
I know it's late, but he'll answer
because he's a businessman.

337
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:38,179
I told him to call him right away.

338
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:41,223
He's the only one
that actually listens to my advice.

339
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,142
He's the most reasonable of them all.

340
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,770
<i>The number you've called is busy.
Please leave a message...</i>

341
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,315
He's been on the phone
for so long already.

342
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:54,111
You probably didn't get any sleep.
Go get some sleep.

343
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:01,243
Do you smoke?

344
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,078
Since when?

345
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,500
Jeez, you're a doctor.
You shouldn't be smoking. My goodness.

346
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,503
Good.

347
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,839
Mom, he smokes.

348
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,925
I taught him how to smoke 20 years ago.

349
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,095
Did you talk to him?

350
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,343
-Have a good day.
-Thanks, you too.

351
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:29,582

353
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,955

354

PROFESSOR OF NEUROSURGERY
CHAE SONG-HWA

362
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,900
All right. Open your mouth like this.

363
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,781
How does this feel?

364
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,074
Both your left and right sides.

365
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:47,451
-Both feel good.
-I see.

366
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:50,162
I was worried you might experience
facial palsy, but it looks good.

367
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:51,538
You're doing great.

368
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:55,876
As for your medication,
I'll keep you on the same routine.

369
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,795
You can come back in three months.

370
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,338
Thank you for coming all the way here.

371
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:00,923
Thank you.

372
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:04,134
Well, I have something for you.

373
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,053
It's just something small.

374
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,764
It's a great book, so I got one for you.

375
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,226
Isn't this book amazing? I have one.

376
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:13,727
You read it too, right?

377
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:16,271
Yes, I've read it too.

378
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:21,318
-My favorite.
-I see. You've already read it.

379
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:23,904
My husband told me to give it to you.

380
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,156
All right, then.
I'll see you in three months.

381
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,074
Okay.

382
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,456
-Hello, doctor.
-Hello, have a seat here.

383
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,167
Mom, sit here.

384
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,629
We have the results.

385
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:46,635
A lump was seen on your CT scan,
so you got an MRI done.

386
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:51,265
Unfortunately,
it looks like it might be cancerous,

387
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,975
so we'll have to do a biopsy.

388
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,855
You aren't young,

389
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:00,607
and the location of the tumor isn't ideal,

390
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:03,110
so it'll be quite difficult
to remove it surgically.

391
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:08,532
You must've been experiencing
severe headaches though.

392
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,451
How did you endure the pain?

393
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,913
Can it be treated by surgery, doctor?

394
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,501
No, she needs chemotherapy
or radiation therapy.

395
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:22,254
But before that, we need to do a biopsy
to confirm the diagnosis.

396
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,841
I'm suspecting that it's neuroglioma.
If I'm right,

397
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,718
and if it's not too bad
like grade one or two,

398
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,387
the survival rate will be high.
Even just with radiation therapy.

399
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:33,015
If it's grade three or four,

400
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,560
we'll have to combine chemotherapy
with radiation therapy.

401
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,395
But the recurrence rate

402
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:41,315
and the survival rate
will be substantially lower.

403
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:43,484
My gosh.

404
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:45,944
What do we do?

405
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,738
Mom.

406
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:49,656
Mom.

407
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,534
Gosh, my poor mom.

408
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,411
It's okay.

409
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:59,041
I've lived long enough, so I'm fine.

410
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,876
Gosh, I don't want to hear it.

411
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:06,256
Oh, Ma'am. It can be treated.

412
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,425
Please don't cry... Oh, my.

413
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:13,430
First, let's get her admitted
so that we can do a biopsy.

414
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:16,642
I'll explain the plan in more detail
when we have the results.

415
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,561
You need to stay strong for your mother.

416
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:23,065
I'm sorry, doctor.

417
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:24,858
Thank you.

418
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,361
Thank you.

419
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,495
I feel bad.

420
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:43,460
By the way, that patient's daughter.
Doesn't she look familiar?

421
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,421
I feel like I've seen her somewhere.

422
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,175
KANGWOON MEDICAL CENTER PEDIATRIC ICU

423
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:55,013
Gosh, another skin tear?

424
00:25:56,974 --> 00:26:00,435
Doctor, that last one
took a long time to heal.

425
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:01,728
My goodness.

426
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,940
Min-yeong, it must be stinging.

427
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,110
-I'll tell him off.
-Her skin is delicate,

428
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,903
and she had it on for too long.

429
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,572
My daughter can feel pain too, you know.

430
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:14,283
Right, I'll be careful from now on.

431
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,702
When will the Professor be here?

432
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:21,081
What he prescribed yesterday is so
different from what she got last month.

433
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:25,669
She takes Vitamin K and traces elements
every Thursday. Why doesn't she anymore?

434
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,380
And as for the blood tests,

435
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,550
you used to draw 30ml.
Why do you need 70ml now?

436
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,845
-She's already exhausted.
-I explained everything to you before.

437
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,807
-Min-yeong is no longer...
-Min-yeong.

438
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:44,521
Hi, Min-yeong.

439
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:49,276
Doctor, why did her prescription change?

440
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,696
And last month, she was
on the TPN drip for 16 hours last month.

441
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,197
Why is it shorter now?

442
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:59,745
And don't you think she looks like
she's having trouble breathing?

443
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:03,957
She keeps grimacing too.
Something must be bothering her.

444
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:09,588
Ma'am, Min-yeong doesn't have the strength
to hold out for much longer.

445
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,425
I'm sure Dr. Jo already told you,

446
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,679
but we should start mentally preparing--

447
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:20,057
What's the problem?
I did everything you told me to do.

448
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,434
She was doing great yesterday.

449
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,145
Were her vitals good yesterday?

450
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:29,149
-They were about the same as today.
-You doctors rarely see her.

451
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,817
I know much better than you.
I'm her mother.

452
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:33,904
Then I'll have Dr. Jo monitor her
all day today.

453
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,114
Call me right away if anything happens.

454
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:37,950
Yes, sir.

455
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:41,453
Min-yeong.

456
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,039
Min-yeong.

457
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,375
I'm so sorry.

458
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,418
I'm sorry, Min-yeong.

459
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,422
I'm so sorry
that you have to suffer like this.

460
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,008
I'm really sorry, Min-yeong.

461
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,095
My sweet daughter, I'm so sorry.

462
00:27:58,178 --> 00:27:59,888
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

463
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:02,933
Is BP low?
How much norepinephrine did you use?

464
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,268
-We're scaling it up.
-I'll do it!

465
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:48,395
<i>My son is waiting for a liver transplant.</i>

466
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:52,774
I see. That's why you looked familiar.

467
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,571
He was in and out of the hospital
all the time for six months.

468
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,823
He practically lived here.

469
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,034
Then three days ago,

470
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,620
his condition suddenly worsened.

471
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:08,832
My son...

472
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,670
I guess I should give up now.

473
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:15,297
No, don't say that.

474
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,300
Ma'am, he can get better.

475
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,345
I was so preoccupied with my son
and his illness

476
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:25,599
that I had no idea
that my mother was also ill.

477
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:27,225
It's all my fault.

478
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,021
What kind of mother would think
of something else

479
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,149
when her son is critically ill?

480
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,694
No one can blame you, ma'am.

481
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,870
DID YOU MAKE DINNER FOR MY MOM?
COME HOME NOW!

482
00:29:58,465 --> 00:29:59,299
Doctor.

483
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:04,387
I'm pretty sure I'm the unluckiest woman
in the whole wide world.

484
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,015
I put up with my in-laws for 40 years,

485
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,141
and my husband

486
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,646
spilled every last penny we had
into his darned business.

487
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,065
And my one and only son...

488
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:20,112
He has a heart of gold, so he's the one
that got me through everything.

489
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,157
I must be cursed or something.

490
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:27,119
I guess that's why both my mom
and my son ended up like that.

491
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:28,870
I'm telling you.

492
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,374
I've been so unlucky in life.

493
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,379
Seriously, I don't even want to live.

494
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,382
Not even one bit.

495
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,051
I just want to end my life.

496
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,018
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

497
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,189
Take the next one.

498
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:57,858
Okay.

499
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,069
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

500
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:32,184
I performed your mom's brain surgery.

501
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:34,728
Shouldn't you be buying me coffee,
not the other way around?

502
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:38,064
When your dad came to the ER at night
with a broken leg,

503
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:41,735
I ran to the ER even though I was off
that night. And what? Just iced Americano?

504
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,612
It should be good enough.

505
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,281
If I get you something better,
it'll make you uncomfortable.

506
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,074
You have such a way with words.

507
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,576
I guess the ER isn't busy today.

508
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,494
You had time
to go to the convenience store.

509
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,830
Watch what you say.
You should never say that.

510
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:56,082
<i>Near Bupyeong IC
on the Gyeongin Expressway,</i>

511
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,669
<i>four vehicles, including a one-ton truck,
have collided.</i>

512
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,297
<i>In total, six people,
including the 52-year-old truck driver,</i>

513
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,382
<i>got critically injured in the accident.</i>

514
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,052
-<i>They're being transferred...</i>
-They'll get here soon. I have to go.

515
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:10,263
<i>Two of them
are said to be fatally injured.</i>

516
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:12,599
<i>The Gyeongin Expressway
is partially restricted...</i>

517
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,485
He was found barely conscious.

518
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:26,696
When we got there, his BP was 60 over 30.
And his oxygen saturation was around 70.

519
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,078
He's bled a lot due to a scalp laceration.

520
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,207
Get him ready for an IV
and give him normal saline.

521
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:38,833
What?

522
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:51,471
Doctor.

523
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,181
Doctor.

524
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:57,394
My son can finally get the surgery.

525
00:32:57,978 --> 00:32:59,771
Is this a dream? I still can't believe it.

526
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:02,440
I almost gave up,
because he was only third in line.

527
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,818
My gosh, is this really happening?

528
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,904
I heard the patients before him
can't get the surgery anymore.

529
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:08,905
Thank you, God.

530
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:12,367
That's such amazing news.
I'm so happy for you, ma'am.

531
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:17,289
But I have to say, I feel so bad
for the ones who passed away.

532
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,460
I'm not sure if it's okay for me
to feel this happy.

533
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,840
I guess we're all selfish after all.

534
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:29,426
Who's your son's doctor?

535
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:32,220
He's very famous.

536
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:35,849
What's that show called?
<i>Good Doctors</i>. He was on that show.

537
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,518
-Dr. Kwon Sun-jeong?
-Yes, that's right.

538
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,271
He and I are close. He's a great doctor.

539
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:45,692
Wait. I think he's away today though.

540
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,068
He already heard the news.

541
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:49,946
He'll come back as soon as
he finishes the surgery in Milyang.

542
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,783
He also said he'll operate on my son
as soon as he returns.

543
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:57,203
But... Poor him. He'll be exhausted.

544
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:58,246
I see.

545
00:33:58,705 --> 00:33:59,748
Is that what's happening?

546
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,876
Doctor, there's another patient
over there.

547
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,878
This kid put super glue all over a helmet,

548
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:07,339
and his dad wore the helmet
because he had no idea.

549
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:10,091
Now, the helmet is stuck on his head.
He can't take it off.

550
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:13,553
He needs to be looked at immediately.
Can you take him in first?

551
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,973
But then I'm dealing with an emergency
case now. Please wait.

552
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,975
This is an emergency case too!

553
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:22,854
He's embarrassed to death right now.

554
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,564
Excuse me. Coming through!

555
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:31,529
Sir, shall we go to a different hospital?

556
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,908
Where are you going, sir?
They haven't called your name yet.

557
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,618
U-ju, stop your dad.

558
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:40,080
Daddy is fuming mad.
He said he'll knock them all down.

559
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:52,842
Professor Kwon, what happened?

560
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,678
I didn't dislocate my shoulder,
so don't worry too much.

561
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,640
I can't really move my fingers,

562
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:00,475
so it's probably a radius fracture.

563
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,727
Get an X-ray done and call Orthopedics.

564
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:04,854
-What about Neurosurgery?
-I'm here.

565
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:07,690
Hey, you.

566
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:16,783
This is bad.

567
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,245
Professor Kwon, what about the surgery?

568
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:21,454
How do you know about it?

569
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:24,624
You should call another professor at once.
The patient needs surgery immediately.

570
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:27,710
Had there been someone else, I wouldn't
have come here after an all-nighter.

571
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,213
There's no one.

572
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:32,632
Send the patient to another hospital.

573
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:36,177
If we say we can't do the surgery,
they'll just want to take the liver.

574
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,096
This is his last chance.

575
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:41,516
A long midline incision is required,
so it won't be an easy operation.

576
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:43,643
Gosh, this is nuts.

577
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,319
Let's do this.

578
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:36,029
How?

579
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,033
We have him.

580
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,745
Me? Hey.

581
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:45,914
I am double board-certified,

582
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:48,458
but I haven't dealt with any operations
for over five years.

583
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,710
Transplant surgery is no joke.

584
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:52,003
I'm not talking about you.

585
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,048
Gosh.

586
00:36:58,927 --> 00:36:59,761
Crap.

587
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,767
This is... Oh, right. U-ju, say hello.

588
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:07,894
They're Daddy's friends. Good boy.

589
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:19,531
But...

590
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,617
What if the director finds out?
Are we going to be okay?

591
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,369
Dr. Chae said she sorted everything out.

592
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:27,997
But we need to get his mother's consent
and explain everything to her.

593
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:31,584
Dr. Chae knows her well,
so she got her to sign it in five minutes.

594
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:35,630
Still, wouldn't this upset his doctor?
I mean, I would be.

595
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:38,466
Dr. Chae already talked to him
and got him on board.

596
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:41,970
What the heck?

597
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,931
She should get this off my head
if she has all that time.

598
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,270
Thank you all in advance.

599
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:53,773
Let's save this patient.

600
00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:00,530

605
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:10,767
Yes. Hello, sir.

606
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,019
<i>Dr. Chae,
you're still at the hospital, right?</i>

607
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:14,020
Yes.

608
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:15,438
<i>He didn't make it.</i>

609
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:18,274
Kim Dong-hyeok's surgery didn't go well?

610
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:21,444
<i>What are you talking about?
The chairman passed away.</i>

611
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,196
I see.

612
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:26,366
<i>His funeral will take place in Room 201.
You head over there first.</i>

613
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:29,369
<i>I came home to get changed.
I'll be there shortly.</i>

614
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:31,788
Yes, sir. Will do.

615
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:54,310
CHAIRMAN AHN BYEONG-U
HAS PASSED AWAY AT THE AGE OF 78.

616
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:01,609
Hello.

617
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:16,666
I'm so sorry for your loss, ma'am.

618
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:20,712
You know
that you were his favorite, right?

619
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:22,505
Yes, of course.

620
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:24,590
That's why...

621
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:26,759
I am completely...

622
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,470
heartbroken for him.

623
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:34,767
I guess we are not too old for tears.

624
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:06,966
We seem to meet a lot these days.

625
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,035
Aren't you Jeong-won's best friend
since little?

626
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:35,536
I thought you knew his family well.

627
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:37,288
Yes.

628
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:41,292
-You knew who he was, right?
-Yes.

629
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:44,045
-Why didn't you tell us?
-You didn't ask.

630
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:47,340
You knew Jeong-won's family was loaded.

631
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:49,050
I had no idea they were this rich.

632
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,844
Actually, I thought
his family went broke these days.

633
00:41:51,928 --> 00:41:53,763
He's been mooching off me for years now.

634
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:55,723
Seriously. Rich people are stingier.

635
00:41:58,184 --> 00:41:59,936
How could he keep it a secret
for 20 years?

636
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:02,271
So what if we knew?
Would we ask for jobs or money?

637
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:03,815
-That's possible.
-That's possible.

638
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,027
That's why that jerk didn't tell us.

639
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,821
Why isn't Ik-jun here?

640
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:12,323
He's still in surgery.
He's probably finishing up now.

641
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:14,242
It's a difficult one.
It'll take him some time.

642
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:16,285
What do you mean?
Why would he do surgery here?

643
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:18,913
Things just happened that way.
We needed him to do surgery.

644
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:22,542
-He knew about this.
-No, he didn't.

645
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,377
Wait. The director is here.

646
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:30,675
-Hello, sir.
-What brings you here?

647
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:34,595
Say hello. He had been
a student of mine long ago.

648
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:36,889
-I see. Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

649
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:39,350
Do you know the chairman's son,
Professor Ahn?

650
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:43,062
Yes. He's my closest friend.

651
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:57,085
-Thanks for coming.
-No need to thank us.

652
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:59,254
We ought to come
to our friend's father's funeral.

653
00:42:59,337 --> 00:43:00,547
Is the chairman your father?

654
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,091
Why didn't you tell us?
You thought we'd ask for money?

655
00:43:04,134 --> 00:43:07,220
I just couldn't find the right time
to tell you guys. I'm sorry.

656
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:09,306
I didn't try to hide it from you.

657
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:14,060
I mean, there's nothing to tell you.
I don't have any money. I swear.

658
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:15,687
That's more annoying.

659
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,814
What about the hospital?
Will you take charge of the hospital?

660
00:43:19,649 --> 00:43:21,067
The hospital?

661
00:43:23,945 --> 00:43:25,155
I thought I lost my unborn child.

662
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:27,365
-My heart almost exploded.
-We all know you're a doctor.

663
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:28,950
-Why that ringtone?
-Well...

664
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:31,620
Heart explosion sounds scary.
How can you say that so casually?

665
00:43:31,703 --> 00:43:34,956
Do you know how sad it is to lose
an unborn child? How can you say that?

666
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,583
You know what?

667
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:38,335
You don't have any paternal love.

668
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:41,171
Hey, guys. Stop arguing.
My head is about to crack.

669
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:44,049
Your head is about to crack?
Then, you'll die.

670
00:43:45,842 --> 00:43:47,052
Jeong-won.

671
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:49,221
Uncle is here.

672
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:50,847
He's here?

673
00:43:51,389 --> 00:43:52,974
Thank you for coming, guys.

674
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:55,936
Please take care of my brother, Jeong-won.

675
00:43:57,395 --> 00:43:59,689
I called you multiple times.
Why didn't you answer?

676
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:02,192
Sorry. I set my phone to vibrate.

677
00:44:04,694 --> 00:44:06,363
-Dr. Chae, I have the result.
-Okay.

678
00:44:11,076 --> 00:44:11,993
Thanks.

679
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:15,622
Hey, Ik-jun.

680
00:44:17,374 --> 00:44:19,376
All right. I'll be there soon.

681
00:44:21,211 --> 00:44:23,421
-Did the surgery go well?
-Yes.

682
00:44:23,672 --> 00:44:25,173
Tell him to come here right away.

683
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,176
I need to do something. I'll be back soon.

684
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,094
-Okay.
-Sure.

685
00:44:36,643 --> 00:44:39,354
You were the one who did the surgery.

686
00:44:39,437 --> 00:44:40,647
You should tell her.

687
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:43,525
Looking like this? Forget it.

688
00:44:44,776 --> 00:44:46,945
If she sees me,
she'd lose all of her confidence in me.

689
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:47,862
Gosh.

690
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,075
I thought about asking the resident
to inform his mother.

691
00:44:52,158 --> 00:44:54,995
But I thought hearing it from you
would be better. You should go now.

692
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:56,663
She must've waited for long.

693
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:59,291
Okay.

694
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:11,970
Ma'am.

695
00:45:13,346 --> 00:45:14,598
Goodness.

696
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:18,935
His surgery went really well.

697
00:45:21,479 --> 00:45:23,231
It was a difficult one.

698
00:45:23,356 --> 00:45:25,108
But there's almost no bleeding now,

699
00:45:25,191 --> 00:45:27,319
and the liver he received
seems very healthy.

700
00:45:27,402 --> 00:45:29,487
Right now, he's transferred to the ICU.

701
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,615
Thank you.

702
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:34,701
Oh, my. I mean it.

703
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:36,870
Thank you so much.

704
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:38,288
Thank you.

705
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,582
Thank you so much.

706
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:43,501
And I have your mother's biopsy result.

707
00:45:44,419 --> 00:45:46,004
It's only stage one cancer.

708
00:45:46,087 --> 00:45:49,341
With the radiation treatment,
she'll be healthy for another ten years.

709
00:45:56,598 --> 00:45:58,642
This is good news. Why are you crying?

710
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:01,227
My goodness.

711
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:03,271
Doctor.

712
00:46:03,938 --> 00:46:06,399
Thank you so much.

713
00:46:06,483 --> 00:46:09,694
Thank you for everything.
Thank you so much.

714
00:46:12,364 --> 00:46:13,615
Doctor.

715
00:46:14,282 --> 00:46:18,411
I am the luckiest woman in this world.

716
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:20,789
There's no other woman
who's as lucky as I am.

717
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:23,667
I am such a lucky person.

718
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,752
I am the happiest person in the world.

719
00:46:25,835 --> 00:46:28,338
That's why I was able to meet
a nice doctor like you

720
00:46:28,755 --> 00:46:30,924
and my mother will live now.

721
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,260
How can I not call myself lucky?

722
00:46:34,344 --> 00:46:36,930
My goodness. Oh, my.

723
00:46:39,974 --> 00:46:41,726
Doctor...

724
00:46:46,856 --> 00:46:49,234
OUR CONDOLENCES TO YOU

725
00:46:49,734 --> 00:46:51,236
Why on earth would he come here?

726
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:53,571
He must be out of his mind.

727
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:07,585
CHAIRMAN AHN BYEONG-U

728
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:15,009
Mom, should I put
our family photo in the box, too?

729
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:17,053
Put it in my bag over there.

730
00:47:30,734 --> 00:47:32,902
This is a lot of money for a medical bill.

731
00:47:33,445 --> 00:47:34,529
It's a VIP ward.

732
00:47:35,613 --> 00:47:37,115
Your father is a VIP, you know.

733
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:39,743
Is the funeral service fee included?

734
00:47:39,826 --> 00:47:41,286
No, that's only for the room.

735
00:47:42,036 --> 00:47:44,330
They completely overcharged us.

736
00:47:44,414 --> 00:47:46,499
The bill is over ten million won
for less than a week?

737
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,792
You're being absurd.

738
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:51,212
Compared to other hospitals,
our bill is considered not much.

739
00:47:52,338 --> 00:47:54,758
The cost isn't important
to these VIP patients.

740
00:47:56,259 --> 00:47:58,636
Even if it means they must pay
triple or quadruple the price,

741
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,847
as long as they can become healthy,

742
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:02,807
they would even pay tenfold.

743
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:06,394
Mom, do you have money for this?

744
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:07,520
Are you serious?

745
00:48:07,937 --> 00:48:10,815
You might've forgotten it,
but I married for convenience.

746
00:48:13,693 --> 00:48:17,614
It was a loveless marriage,
but I was happy in my own way.

747
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:19,741
Mom, TMI.

748
00:48:19,824 --> 00:48:23,077
-What?
-Don't worry. It's nothing.

749
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:24,913
Mr. Ju is here.

750
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:26,664
Okay. I'll be there.

751
00:48:29,584 --> 00:48:31,336
Gosh, Mom.

752
00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:32,420
Seriously.

753
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:38,092
My brother agreed.

754
00:48:38,676 --> 00:48:40,011
And I persuaded my mother, too.

755
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:45,683
Ma'am, you're coming
to the board meeting tomorrow, right?

756
00:48:46,976 --> 00:48:47,977
No, I'm not.

757
00:48:49,771 --> 00:48:51,481
Jeong-won will be disappointed.

758
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:58,196
I know how hard you have been working
all these years.

759
00:48:58,780 --> 00:48:59,906
I am sorry.

760
00:49:01,491 --> 00:49:03,243
I hope I can continue to count on you.

761
00:49:07,747 --> 00:49:08,873
Goodness.

762
00:49:09,707 --> 00:49:13,169
Your family is definitely not ordinary.

763
00:49:14,546 --> 00:49:16,339
So this is already a done deal.

764
00:49:16,422 --> 00:49:18,466
Yes. It's over.

765
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:20,134
The end.

766
00:49:21,928 --> 00:49:23,555
Did Chairman Hwang agree to that?

767
00:49:23,638 --> 00:49:25,598
Jeong-won went to him
and personally asked him

768
00:49:25,682 --> 00:49:27,851
to choose Mr. Ju over himself.

769
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:33,606
I told him to call Chairman Hwang to get
him on his side. Gosh, I raised him wrong.

770
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:36,693
All of my effort to raise my children
went to nothing.

771
00:49:38,444 --> 00:49:39,529
I understand.

772
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,782
But tomorrow is the board meeting.

773
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,743
How can I trust you?

774
00:49:48,454 --> 00:49:52,208
I have the agreement letters Chairman
Hwang got from the board of directors.

775
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:55,336
And I put in my mother
and my resignation letters as well.

776
00:50:00,842 --> 00:50:02,135
But...

777
00:50:02,844 --> 00:50:04,387
I have one condition.

778
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,393
YULJE FOUNDATION

779
00:50:10,476 --> 00:50:12,896
THE PROFIT FROM THE VIP WARDS
WILL GO TO PARTY A

780
00:50:12,979 --> 00:50:15,356
PARTY A HAS THE RIGHTS
TO USE AND MANAGE THE FUND

781
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,399
If you don't mind,

782
00:50:17,734 --> 00:50:21,946
can I ask you about
how you will use the money?

783
00:50:22,947 --> 00:50:25,033
I'm still a guy from a rich family.

784
00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:27,452
Everyone puts away some money.

785
00:50:31,664 --> 00:50:34,667
The concept of VIP wards is
fascinating, isn't it?

786
00:50:36,461 --> 00:50:38,129
There are only four wards.

787
00:50:38,755 --> 00:50:41,507
But we don't need more than those.

788
00:50:42,008 --> 00:50:46,346
The moment they become accessible,
no one will want them.

789
00:50:47,764 --> 00:50:49,515
We must set an astronomical price

790
00:50:50,141 --> 00:50:52,477
to attract astronomically rich patients.

791
00:50:54,062 --> 00:50:58,316
We just need to focus on
is staffing talented doctors.

792
00:51:00,276 --> 00:51:03,488
By the way, finding a good professor
will be difficult.

793
00:51:04,238 --> 00:51:09,410
I heard that our hospital
needs more professors.

794
00:51:10,745 --> 00:51:12,330
I'll take care of that.

795
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:16,084
Please prepare to pay handsomely
for their salaries.

796
00:51:26,052 --> 00:51:29,847
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
AS EXCLUSIVE MEDICAL STAFF FOR VIP WARDS

797
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:31,933
You'll do it, right?

798
00:51:32,016 --> 00:51:33,309
This is a long contract.

799
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:35,061
Can someone explain what it means?

800
00:51:35,144 --> 00:51:36,771
To sum it up,

801
00:51:37,146 --> 00:51:38,940
if Party A asks for surgery,

802
00:51:39,023 --> 00:51:41,526
we have to perform emergency surgery
even on weekends.

803
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:44,570
And we have to participate
in the surgery Party A assigns.

804
00:51:44,654 --> 00:51:46,739
-Who's Party A?
-Him.

805
00:51:46,864 --> 00:51:48,700
It must come with a crazy reward.

806
00:51:48,783 --> 00:51:51,619
-You're asking us to be your slaves.
-Twice the annual salary you get now.

807
00:51:52,412 --> 00:51:53,329
Hey!

808
00:51:53,913 --> 00:51:57,667
Next time,
write that on top of the contract.

809
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,961
He does come from a rich family.
He's very generous.

810
00:52:00,044 --> 00:52:01,838
I won't resign from my job anyway. I'm in.

811
00:52:01,921 --> 00:52:03,006
-Is there an ink pad?
-Here.

812
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:04,132
I should sign it with my thumbprint.

813
00:52:05,591 --> 00:52:07,176
Hey, what about you?

814
00:52:07,802 --> 00:52:08,970
I want to have more time off.

815
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:12,306
My goodness,
you sound like you're so well-off.

816
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,892
Hey, you came back to Korea
two months ago after your fellowship.

817
00:52:15,476 --> 00:52:16,519
Shouldn't you get a job?

818
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:18,354
I want to hang out with my mom more.

819
00:52:20,565 --> 00:52:22,859
Twice your annual salary
and an assigned parking spot.

820
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:24,944
-What about us?
-What about us?

821
00:52:25,028 --> 00:52:26,070
Hey, be quiet.

822
00:52:26,154 --> 00:52:27,280
I don't know.

823
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:33,036
On top of that, I'll throw in an exclusive
research lab and your own office.

824
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,664
-What about us? Who do you think we are?
-What? Do you think we're fools?

825
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:37,790
I don't want those things.

826
00:52:38,624 --> 00:52:41,377
I only have one condition.

827
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:43,379
What is it? I'll make it work.

828
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:46,005
-A band.
-What?

829
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:47,277
A band.

830
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,362
-What?
-What on earth is he jabbering about?

831
00:52:49,488 --> 00:52:50,947
You can barely manage to text.

832
00:52:52,532 --> 00:52:54,576
I won't do it. I said no.

833
00:52:55,035 --> 00:52:56,203
I'm in. I like it.

834
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:59,122
I'm busy. I don't have time for that.
I can't do it.

835
00:53:00,957 --> 00:53:02,375
Then, will you work here?

836
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:06,171
Sure. How can you run VIP wards
without an ob-gyn?

837
00:53:06,254 --> 00:53:08,590
I don't think that's possible at all.

838
00:53:09,007 --> 00:53:10,717
Goodness. I'm leaving now.

839
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,594
-Count me out from this.
-Hey.

840
00:53:12,677 --> 00:53:14,179
I'd rather work right now.

841
00:53:15,764 --> 00:53:18,600
-I don't have my ID. Help me go down.
-Okay. Let's go.

842
00:53:19,643 --> 00:53:23,897
My answer was clear.
I don't have time to be in a band.

843
00:53:24,689 --> 00:53:26,733
Hey, Song-hwa. You...

844
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,408
I just need Song-hwa to get on board.

845
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:37,077
It will be harder to persuade Jun-wan.

846
00:53:38,203 --> 00:53:39,162
Jun-wan?

847
00:53:39,746 --> 00:53:41,206
I can fix that with just a phone call.

848
00:53:46,336 --> 00:53:47,754
You really won't do it?

849
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,341
<i>I said no. I'm way too mature
for that kind of kiddie stuff.</i>

850
00:53:52,592 --> 00:53:54,844
I was going through
my old Cyworld account.

851
00:53:55,011 --> 00:53:57,430
I found a beautiful photo in the album.

852
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:01,935
-It was in Hawaii.
<i>-I'll do it.</i>

853
00:54:02,602 --> 00:54:03,520
Jun-wan is in.

854
00:54:06,273 --> 00:54:07,274
What?

855
00:54:08,275 --> 00:54:11,319
What on earth do you have on him?

856
00:54:11,403 --> 00:54:13,738
We just need to persuade Song-hwa.

857
00:54:13,822 --> 00:54:16,825
If she says no, she means it.
What should I do?

858
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:18,910
Hey, do you have anything on her?

859
00:54:18,994 --> 00:54:20,662
My gosh, is that your strategy?

860
00:54:20,787 --> 00:54:23,999
Why are you taking a negative approach
like finding people's weaknesses?

861
00:54:24,082 --> 00:54:28,420
Try to think of what Song-hwa
would want or want to do.

862
00:54:28,503 --> 00:54:30,630
-Take that approach.
-I know a way.

863
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:32,340
-What?
-What is it?

864
00:54:32,424 --> 00:54:34,843
-She'll do it if she's the vocalist.
-You lunatic.

865
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:37,178
A vocalist? Is she still hung up on that?

866
00:54:37,262 --> 00:54:40,640
I told her first. She said she'd be in it
if she's the vocalist.

867
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:44,477
I can't believe this. Song-hwa is
tone-deaf and has no sense of rhythm.

868
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:46,896
It took her five years to learn
to play the bass guitar.

869
00:54:49,649 --> 00:54:52,152
Seok-hyeong, do you want our band
to win a Grammy Award?

870
00:54:52,235 --> 00:54:53,153
What?

871
00:54:53,236 --> 00:54:55,405
-You don't want to perform at Wembley?
-I don't want to.

872
00:54:55,488 --> 00:54:56,448
Then...

873
00:54:57,991 --> 00:54:59,326
let Song-hwa sing.

874
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:00,452
Hey.

875
00:55:00,994 --> 00:55:01,828
I don't care.

876
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:05,332
I just want to do something together
with my friends.

877
00:55:05,415 --> 00:55:08,084
I thought that
Song-hwa had an attractive voice.

878
00:55:08,835 --> 00:55:10,295
My gosh, you're awful.

879
00:55:10,378 --> 00:55:11,630
She has a unique voice.

880
00:55:11,713 --> 00:55:13,757
My goodness. You're all going nuts!

881
00:55:14,132 --> 00:55:16,343
Don't be so mean to her.

882
00:55:16,426 --> 00:55:18,094
You ought to bring her to the right path.

883
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:20,472
If you care about her,
you can't do this to her.

884
00:55:21,473 --> 00:55:22,557
It's all good now.

885
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:26,019
Ik-jun, you're truly looking out for her.
Which means you should be okay with this.

886
00:55:26,102 --> 00:55:27,187
We'll start the band.

887
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,563
You're starting work next week.

888
00:55:28,647 --> 00:55:30,106
Nice to meet you, Dr. Yang.

889
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:33,693
My gosh, it's nice to meet you.

890
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:36,029
I've heard a lot about you.
People call you "Buddha".

891
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:37,113
I'm Catholic.

892
00:55:37,197 --> 00:55:38,782
I see.

893
00:55:47,415 --> 00:55:49,459
Hurry up, Song-hwa.
We might get called in any minute.

894
00:56:29,874 --> 00:56:30,875
Gosh.

895
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:34,087
Gosh, that stinks.

896
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,172
You're ridiculous.

897
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:39,676
-Which song should we start with?
-Seok-hyeong already picked out a song.

898
00:56:39,759 --> 00:56:41,261
You'll know as soon as you hear it.

899
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:13,710
<i>I miss you even more around this time</i>

900
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,339
<i>When I am all alone</i>

901
00:57:19,674 --> 00:57:23,136
<i>I know that you are gone now</i>

902
00:57:25,096 --> 00:57:27,891
<i>But I keep thinking of you</i>

903
00:57:30,185 --> 00:57:33,521
<i>Why did you leave me then?</i>

904
00:57:35,064 --> 00:57:39,611
<i>You told me that
Things were getting tough between us</i>

905
00:57:40,195 --> 00:57:43,114
<i>That could have been
The reason you left me</i>

906
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:48,411
<i>But I can't know for sure</i>

907
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:57,670
<i>I remember the night when you left me</i>

908
00:58:03,635 --> 00:58:07,597
<i>You in my memory</i>

909
00:58:17,774 --> 00:58:19,943
You really scared me just now.

910
00:58:23,863 --> 00:58:26,157
SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY
PRE-MED FRESHMEN ORIENTATION

911
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:30,370
<i>I remember the night when you left me</i>

912
00:58:45,009 --> 00:58:46,010
Give it up for him!

913
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:51,975
His singing gave me the chills
and his face gave me even more chills.

914
00:58:52,058 --> 00:58:53,852
All right. Who wants to go next?

915
00:58:53,935 --> 00:58:56,020
-Me!
-Give it up for him!

916
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:02,402
I will impersonate Nam Bo-won
on <i>Nam Bo-won's Show</i>.

917
00:59:03,194 --> 00:59:06,322
It's a mountain valley
in Gangwon Province in 1950.

918
00:59:06,406 --> 00:59:07,949
Frogs were croaking.

919
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:14,622
-The soldiers were having a rest.
-Hey, where are you going?

920
00:59:14,706 --> 00:59:16,624
I'd rather drop out of college
than do that.

921
00:59:18,376 --> 00:59:20,253
-Hey.
-Hey, Corporal Kim.

922
00:59:27,844 --> 00:59:28,887
Where are you going?

923
00:59:29,554 --> 00:59:31,681
We wanted to use the restroom.

924
00:59:32,765 --> 00:59:34,559
My friend is very drunk.

925
00:59:35,435 --> 00:59:36,603
Hey, are you okay?

926
00:59:41,941 --> 00:59:45,361
Damn it. Why aren't they going back in?
They are so annoying.

927
00:59:46,112 --> 00:59:48,948
It's cold out here.
Should we stay in the restroom?

928
00:59:49,032 --> 00:59:50,283
We'll smell like toilets.

929
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:52,368
Gosh, is there a place to hide?

930
01:00:19,437 --> 01:00:20,271
Why are they here?

931
01:00:20,855 --> 01:00:21,689
Why do you think?

932
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:26,027
Like us, when things were getting lame,
they lied to people and came to hide here.

933
01:00:26,945 --> 01:00:28,071
Are they Japanese?

934
01:00:28,696 --> 01:00:29,781
-He's ridiculous.
-My gosh.

935
01:00:31,115 --> 01:00:32,033
Can we come in?

936
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:37,121
His standard Korean accent is dope.

937
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,082
It's like listening to the radio.

938
01:00:39,832 --> 01:00:41,876
-"Can we come in?"
-"Can we come in?"

939
01:00:42,877 --> 01:00:44,212
Come on in.

940
01:00:45,296 --> 01:00:46,422
Hurry up.

941
01:00:46,714 --> 01:00:48,132
I know there's not much space here.

942
01:00:48,424 --> 01:00:51,344
Staying in here is a much better deal
than putting on a show over there.

943
01:00:59,143 --> 01:01:02,063
My name is An Jeong-won.
His name is Yang Seok-hyeong.

944
01:01:02,647 --> 01:01:04,440
-Nice to meet you.
-My name is Lee Ik-jun.

945
01:01:04,774 --> 01:01:06,067
You crazy punk.

946
01:01:07,235 --> 01:01:09,862
His name is Lee Ik-jun.
My name is Kim Jun-wan.

947
01:01:09,946 --> 01:01:11,364
We're both from Changwon.

948
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:14,826
We went to the same high school.
Did you two go to school together?

949
01:01:15,451 --> 01:01:17,662
We went to elementary
and middle school together.

950
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,376
-You won't die from it.
-You're such a crybaby.

951
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:27,171
How long do we need to stay here?
It's too cramped here.

952
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:29,382
At least it's just the four of us.

953
01:01:43,104 --> 01:01:47,316
I'm An Jeong-won. He's Yang Seok-hyeong.
They're Kim Jun-wan and Lee Ik-jun.

954
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,152
My name is Chae Song-hwa.

955
01:01:49,694 --> 01:01:51,195
Are you guys friends?

956
01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:53,197
-No, we are not.
-Are you crazy?

957
01:01:53,281 --> 01:01:54,907
-We met five minutes ago.
-What?

958
01:01:54,991 --> 01:01:56,367
No, we are not.

959
01:01:56,617 --> 01:01:58,703
You can just say no. What's all this fuss?

960
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:02,498
Hey, it's a fun coincidence
that we all met here.

961
01:02:02,915 --> 01:02:04,417
Do you want to take a photo together?

962
01:02:05,043 --> 01:02:06,586
Are you for real?

963
01:02:07,295 --> 01:02:08,379
I'm for real.

964
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,714
Sure.

965
01:02:11,174 --> 01:02:14,010
We can get the chair
and put the camera on top.

966
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:15,803
Okay.

967
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,263
Hold on.

968
01:02:17,346 --> 01:02:19,348
It will blink before taking the photo.

969
01:02:19,432 --> 01:02:21,059
Hey, it's starting.

970
01:02:35,698 --> 01:02:37,533
We're playing
"Love Over a Thousand Years" next.

971
01:02:38,409 --> 01:02:40,870
-You jerk.
-Hey.

972
01:02:40,953 --> 01:02:42,371
-Hey!
-Yes?

973
01:02:42,455 --> 01:02:44,874
-This is Chae Song-hwa. Go on.
-Hey, Jun-wan!

974
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,125
-I got it.
-Crazy jerk.

975
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:47,877
-Bring it back. Hey.
-Okay.

976
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:49,670
Open up. Hey. Damn it.

977
01:02:49,754 --> 01:02:51,172
Hey, Seok-hyeong.

978
01:02:52,006 --> 01:02:52,965
Hey, Jeong-won.

979
01:02:54,258 --> 01:02:57,470
Damn it. Come on, give it back!

980
01:03:03,518 --> 01:03:04,936
Let me see.

981
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:09,774
Here it is.

982
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:14,946
HELLO, MR. DADDY-LONG-LEGS.
EUN-A WAS DISCHARGED AS HEALTHY GIRL.

983
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:26,666
THANK YOU FOR THE MESSAGE.
I'LL BE ABLE TO HELP MORE PATIENTS.

984
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:33,464
Hey.

985
01:03:34,924 --> 01:03:36,425
I don't have any money.

986
01:03:36,509 --> 01:03:39,887
I barely got enough money to cover
the bills for a kid with heart disease.

987
01:03:40,596 --> 01:03:42,056
I'm completely broke.

988
01:03:43,683 --> 01:03:46,144
You're a priest.
Why do you always ask for wine?

989
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:48,020
-Have a life of non-possession!
-Hey, Jun-wan!

990
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:50,439
-You should be happy if you are
-Open up!

991
01:03:50,523 --> 01:03:53,025
-as respected as Bopjong.
-Hey, even you?

992
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:54,944
-Seriously?
-Whatever. I don't have money.

993
01:03:55,027 --> 01:03:56,946
You're a priest, not a sommelier.

994
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:10,209
How did you...

995
01:04:10,877 --> 01:04:14,005
Mr. Ju heard
about his wife's condition today.

996
01:04:14,422 --> 01:04:17,133
He would do anything
for his wife, you know.

997
01:04:17,842 --> 01:04:19,343
I'm very sorry for him.

998
01:04:20,553 --> 01:04:21,470
What do you mean?

999
01:04:21,554 --> 01:04:24,515
Jong-su is already having a hard time.
I made him run the foundation.

1000
01:04:25,391 --> 01:04:26,809
I don't know if I can face him.

1001
01:04:29,812 --> 01:04:31,522
Jong-su is Mr. Ju's first name.

1002
01:04:32,523 --> 01:04:34,358
-I see.
-We're old friends.

1003
01:04:35,902 --> 01:04:40,740
I told him not to come to my husband's
funeral since his wife is sick.

1004
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:42,366
No one can stop that stubborn man.

1005
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:44,535
Mr. Ju wouldn't be himself if he didn't.

1006
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:47,538
Goodness.

1007
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:51,125
He was always quiet
and didn't express any emotions.

1008
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:55,755
To be honest, I just thought that
I could never read his mind.

1009
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:58,925
So I was always cautious around him.

1010
01:05:00,218 --> 01:05:02,553
-But it turns out--
-He just doesn't have any schemes.

1011
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:03,512
Gosh.

1012
01:05:04,388 --> 01:05:06,265
He was just like that
when he was five years old.

1013
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:08,017
And even on his wedding day.

1014
01:05:08,768 --> 01:05:12,188
He looks sulky so people get
the wrong idea that he's hiding something.

1015
01:05:12,897 --> 01:05:15,399
-He doesn't have any ulterior motives.
-Right.

1016
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:18,236
That reminds me. About two days
before your husband passed away,

1017
01:05:18,402 --> 01:05:19,737
he came to see me at my house.

1018
01:05:20,613 --> 01:05:23,115
He came to my house at a late hour.

1019
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:28,204
I just assumed that he came to ask me
to vote for him at the board meeting.

1020
01:05:28,621 --> 01:05:31,082
Well, I was irritated
that he came to see me.

1021
01:05:31,332 --> 01:05:34,585
But since your son asked me for a favor,

1022
01:05:34,794 --> 01:05:38,214
-I thought I'd give him what he wants.
-What did he say?

1023
01:05:38,297 --> 01:05:39,465
Goodness.

1024
01:05:39,966 --> 01:05:41,217
I think I already know.

1025
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:43,135
Yes.

1026
01:05:44,637 --> 01:05:46,264
He didn't say anything to me.

1027
01:05:47,098 --> 01:05:50,601
He stared at the flower tree
in my garden for a long time.

1028
01:05:50,977 --> 01:05:54,772
Then he asked me for the tree
because his wife likes flowers.

1029
01:05:54,981 --> 01:05:56,732
He can never ask for favors.

1030
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,859
He's frustrating.

1031
01:05:59,485 --> 01:06:00,945
That fool.

1032
01:06:01,445 --> 01:06:02,446
Gosh.

1033
01:06:03,864 --> 01:06:06,659
Goodness, it's already past 8 p.m.

1034
01:06:06,742 --> 01:06:08,035
You should go now.

1035
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:11,622
I think he's waiting for you.

1036
01:06:11,706 --> 01:06:13,040
He asked me to cook for him.

1037
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:18,129
It's been 30 years
since I last packed a dinner.

1038
01:06:18,504 --> 01:06:20,047
-Bye.
-Bye.

1039
01:07:01,005 --> 01:07:03,591
<i>Code Blue, third floor.</i>

1040
01:07:04,508 --> 01:07:06,469
<i>CPR in the ICU.</i>

1041
01:07:06,594 --> 01:07:08,763
<i>Third floor of the main building.</i>

1042
01:07:22,276 --> 01:07:23,986
Min-yeong, hang in there.

1043
01:07:24,236 --> 01:07:26,322
Hang in there, Min-yeong.

1044
01:07:26,405 --> 01:07:28,824
-How long?
-Ten minutes. I can't get her sinus back.

1045
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:30,701
No way. Please do it one more time.

1046
01:07:30,785 --> 01:07:32,745
You brought her back last time!

1047
01:07:32,828 --> 01:07:35,456
Ma'am, you should let Min-yeong go now...

1048
01:07:35,539 --> 01:07:38,084
Just try it one more time, please. Please.

1049
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:40,294
I'll do it. I'll keep trying.

1050
01:07:45,716 --> 01:07:46,550
Min-yeong.

1051
01:07:47,885 --> 01:07:49,595
Min-yeong.

1052
01:07:52,431 --> 01:07:54,392
Min-yeong, hang in there, please.

1053
01:07:54,475 --> 01:07:56,727
Hang in there, Min-yeong.

1054
01:07:57,645 --> 01:07:58,771
Min-yeong.

1055
01:08:02,691 --> 01:08:06,779
Min-yeong, please.
Hang in there. Min-yeong!

1056
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:28,884
Ma'am, she must be in a lot of pain.

1057
01:08:32,096 --> 01:08:33,806
We should let her rest now.

1058
01:08:50,114 --> 01:08:51,282
My sweet Min-yeong,

1059
01:08:52,783 --> 01:08:54,243
do you want to go now?

1060
01:08:55,995 --> 01:08:57,163
But I don't want you to.

1061
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:01,250
If you stay here a little longer,

1062
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:03,627
would that be too painful for you?

1063
01:09:05,045 --> 01:09:07,506
I would like to see you a bit more.

1064
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:12,136
I'm sorry, Min-yeong.

1065
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:18,100
I am so sorry
for making you go through this pain.

1066
01:09:21,187 --> 01:09:22,521
Min-yeong.

1067
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:26,901
I love you so much.

1068
01:09:27,985 --> 01:09:29,195
My daughter.

1069
01:09:33,824 --> 01:09:35,034
I love you.

1070
01:09:41,832 --> 01:09:45,586
March 26, 2019. At 2:29 p.m.

1071
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:50,257
I pronounce Kim Min-yeong dead.

1072
01:09:57,431 --> 01:09:58,432
Min-yeong.

1073
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,685
Min-yeong.

1074
01:10:04,438 --> 01:10:05,731
Min-yeong.

1075
01:10:12,988 --> 01:10:14,323
Min-yeong.

1076
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,377
Did she want to see all of us?

1077
01:10:29,088 --> 01:10:30,673
I bet she'll just complain.

1078
01:10:30,881 --> 01:10:33,300
You're right. Her face changed completely.

1079
01:10:35,344 --> 01:10:36,637
What choice do we have?

1080
01:10:37,054 --> 01:10:39,431
Whatever she says,
we should try to understand her.

1081
01:10:40,015 --> 01:10:41,141
I can understand her.

1082
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:44,478
I understand her, but we did our best.

1083
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:48,232
Professor Ahn didn't get a day off
for three months because of Min-yeong.

1084
01:10:49,275 --> 01:10:50,818
There he comes.

1085
01:10:59,034 --> 01:11:01,954
Thank you so much for your hard work.

1086
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:04,123
You should get back to work.

1087
01:11:05,874 --> 01:11:07,710
-Pardon?
-I can meet with her alone.

1088
01:11:07,793 --> 01:11:09,128
You should go.

1089
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:11,046
You have a lot of work.

1090
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:48,417
Doctor.

1091
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:52,004
Thank you so much for everything.

1092
01:11:54,465 --> 01:11:55,716
Min-yeong...

1093
01:11:59,511 --> 01:12:03,265
was in so much pain
because I wanted to see her more.

1094
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:07,770
But thanks to great doctors
and nurses she had,

1095
01:12:09,104 --> 01:12:11,774
she had three years of a happy life.

1096
01:12:14,526 --> 01:12:16,320
Thank you for your hard work.

1097
01:12:19,657 --> 01:12:21,033
Thank you for loving my daughter

1098
01:12:21,575 --> 01:12:22,868
and treating her

1099
01:12:24,286 --> 01:12:25,537
the best you could.

1100
01:12:27,373 --> 01:12:28,540
Thank you so much.

1101
01:12:49,978 --> 01:12:53,816
<i>Father, a girl went to heaven today.</i>

1102
01:12:55,526 --> 01:12:57,152
I was at her 100th-day celebration.

1103
01:12:57,861 --> 01:13:02,408
Every year, we celebrated her birthday
together. We made so many memories.

1104
01:13:07,788 --> 01:13:08,914
Just three years...

1105
01:13:10,124 --> 01:13:12,584
After only three years,

1106
01:13:14,253 --> 01:13:15,629
Min-yeong left this world.

1107
01:13:20,551 --> 01:13:21,969
I'm his child,

1108
01:13:25,264 --> 01:13:26,807
but I can't stop resenting God.

1109
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:32,813
I hate him.

1110
01:13:33,814 --> 01:13:35,065
And I resent him, too.

1111
01:13:36,817 --> 01:13:39,445
It's so hard to move on
with my life, Father.

1112
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:43,407
What should I do?

1113
01:13:52,082 --> 01:13:54,376
TO THE FRIED CHICKEN RESTAURANT
ON THE POLICE STATION ALLEY

1114
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,463
That's why I told you
I wasn't going to be a doctor.

1115
01:13:57,546 --> 01:14:00,966
I told you I was going
to be a priest, too, didn't I?

1116
01:14:01,049 --> 01:14:02,301
Remember what you guys told me?

1117
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:05,012
That I could be a priest
whenever I wanted,

1118
01:14:05,095 --> 01:14:07,973
but that's not the case for a doctor.

1119
01:14:08,056 --> 01:14:10,517
I worked all these years as a doctor
because of you guys.

1120
01:14:10,601 --> 01:14:14,271
Starting now, I'm going to do
what I want with my life. Okay?

1121
01:14:14,354 --> 01:14:15,773
Did you get that?

1122
01:14:16,899 --> 01:14:17,775
I don't...

1123
01:14:18,776 --> 01:14:20,402
deserve to be a doctor.

1124
01:14:20,736 --> 01:14:21,779
I can't...

1125
01:14:22,696 --> 01:14:24,615
I can't control my emotions.

1126
01:14:26,116 --> 01:14:27,993
I empathize too easily.

1127
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:30,454
Other doctors tell me

1128
01:14:31,246 --> 01:14:34,333
that once time passes,
it becomes like nothing.

1129
01:14:36,126 --> 01:14:37,711
You know what?

1130
01:14:38,253 --> 01:14:42,216
I care too much about all my patients.

1131
01:14:42,299 --> 01:14:46,345
I completely go nuts for them, you know?

1132
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:50,516
I didn't cry
even when our father passed away.

1133
01:14:52,768 --> 01:14:55,521
My father recently passed away, you know.

1134
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,231
Is that so?

1135
01:14:57,689 --> 01:14:58,899
But...

1136
01:14:59,858 --> 01:15:02,861
when Min-yeong's mother

1137
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:06,490
thanked me...

1138
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:09,076
for treating her today.

1139
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:12,454
Damn it.

1140
01:15:13,539 --> 01:15:16,792
My patient's mother comforted me.
But I'm the doctor!

1141
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,089
But then,

1142
01:15:23,507 --> 01:15:24,842
to tell you the truth,

1143
01:15:25,968 --> 01:15:27,553
it was the most wonderful feeling...

1144
01:15:28,387 --> 01:15:31,056
It was a kind of feeling

1145
01:15:31,139 --> 01:15:33,809
that I couldn't experience in this world.

1146
01:15:34,643 --> 01:15:37,938
I was so grateful,
but I was sorry at the same time.

1147
01:15:41,108 --> 01:15:42,276
Anyway,

1148
01:15:42,776 --> 01:15:44,528
I don't deserve to be a doctor.

1149
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:49,283
No. It's too hard.

1150
01:15:51,618 --> 01:15:55,038
I won't do it. I'll quit being a doctor!

1151
01:15:56,206 --> 01:15:58,709
As a matter of fact,
I was going to quit after this year.

1152
01:15:59,209 --> 01:16:02,045
I was planning to hand off
things I do to my friend anyway.

1153
01:16:03,422 --> 01:16:04,464
It's over now.

1154
01:16:05,007 --> 01:16:08,302
I'll quit my job tomorrow. Damn it.

1155
01:16:10,637 --> 01:16:13,390
Andrea, if that's how you feel,

1156
01:16:13,473 --> 01:16:15,517
I'll tell you to quit later.

1157
01:16:15,684 --> 01:16:18,020
So why don't you hang in there
one more year?

1158
01:16:19,646 --> 01:16:20,856
Seriously.

1159
01:16:24,484 --> 01:16:26,486
1 YEAR AGO

1160
01:16:33,744 --> 01:16:35,537
Hey, Min-u...

1161
01:16:45,339 --> 01:16:46,423
Min-u...

1162
01:16:48,467 --> 01:16:50,886
wrote me a letter.

1163
01:16:52,471 --> 01:16:54,973
He couldn't even read Korean.

1164
01:16:59,144 --> 01:17:02,814
But he wrote me a letter before he died.

1165
01:17:06,401 --> 01:17:07,402
I...

1166
01:17:08,111 --> 01:17:10,072
don't deserve to be a doctor.

1167
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:13,075
I'm not good enough
and I've got nothing to show for!

1168
01:17:14,076 --> 01:17:15,661
I'm going to quit being a doctor.

1169
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,081
I'm going to quit tomorrow!

1170
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,416
Andrea.

1171
01:17:22,167 --> 01:17:23,460
Hang in there for one more year.

1172
01:17:26,463 --> 01:17:27,714
Seriously.

1173
01:17:27,798 --> 01:17:29,341
2 YEARS AGO

1174
01:17:30,133 --> 01:17:31,760
You know, my patient, Min-ji?

1175
01:17:32,427 --> 01:17:35,055
Min-ji woke up today.

1176
01:17:36,348 --> 01:17:40,143
She was even able to breathe on her own.

1177
01:17:40,519 --> 01:17:44,147
She looked at me
and winked at me like this.

1178
01:17:45,023 --> 01:17:46,566
Just like this.

1179
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:50,696
She looked at me and winked at me.

1180
01:17:51,863 --> 01:17:54,574
Okay. Cheers.

1181
01:17:54,908 --> 01:17:58,120
It's the happiest day of my life. Cheers!

1182
01:17:58,453 --> 01:17:59,705
Cheers!

1183
01:17:59,788 --> 01:18:02,332
3 YEARS AGO

1184
01:18:06,628 --> 01:18:07,838
I'm going to quit.

1185
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:10,757
I'm not a doctor.

1186
01:18:11,299 --> 01:18:13,343
I'm a fraud!

1187
01:18:14,386 --> 01:18:16,638
Die! I should die!

1188
01:18:18,557 --> 01:18:19,599
Andrea.

1189
01:18:20,726 --> 01:18:22,728
Let's try this for one more year. Okay?

1190
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:27,399
My gosh, how adorable.

1191
01:18:35,407 --> 01:18:37,534
Yes, come in.

1192
01:18:39,411 --> 01:18:41,747
What's a good menu in the cafeteria?

1193
01:18:42,789 --> 01:18:45,876
-Look at you. You came to work early.
-I didn't go home last night.

1194
01:18:46,835 --> 01:18:48,170
I'll have breakfast before I go.

1195
01:18:48,837 --> 01:18:50,630
Should you drive after an all-nighter?

1196
01:18:50,714 --> 01:18:52,257
I'll grab a cab. Bye.

1197
01:18:52,841 --> 01:18:55,761
Do you have a symposium this weekend?
Was it at J Hotel?

1198
01:18:55,844 --> 01:18:57,554
How do you know about it?

1199
01:18:59,389 --> 01:19:00,766
Right. Professor Jang?

1200
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,685
I'll send him your regards. I'm leaving.

1201
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,020
Bye.

1202
01:19:14,237 --> 01:19:15,155
Hey.

1203
01:19:20,535 --> 01:19:21,453
Get off now.

1204
01:19:23,955 --> 01:19:25,332
Listen to me.

1205
01:19:25,415 --> 01:19:27,918
I'm sober now. I swear.

1206
01:19:28,668 --> 01:19:30,295
I'm completely sober.

1207
01:19:30,545 --> 01:19:31,588
Are you kidding me?

1208
01:19:31,671 --> 01:19:35,926
-I smell alcohol whenever you talk.
-No way. It's been hours.

1209
01:19:36,009 --> 01:19:38,512
I just smell like alcohol.

1210
01:19:38,595 --> 01:19:41,890
When we talked on the phone earlier,
you were still drinking at the wrap party.

1211
01:19:42,557 --> 01:19:45,102
That was five hours ago.
You were totally drunk then.

1212
01:19:45,185 --> 01:19:48,063
-This is a crime.
-I'm completely fine now.

1213
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,773
Forget it. Let's just go.

1214
01:19:49,898 --> 01:19:52,400
No one will know anyway.
What's your problem?

1215
01:19:53,068 --> 01:19:55,320
Do you see the sauna over there?
Get some sleep there.

1216
01:19:59,032 --> 01:20:00,700
That's enough.

1217
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,203
Stop making a big deal out of nothing!

1218
01:20:04,913 --> 01:20:08,291
I'll drop off your car at your house.
Let's talk later.

1219
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,960
And we should...

1220
01:20:11,628 --> 01:20:12,587
end it then.

1221
01:20:31,606 --> 01:20:35,360
SYMPOSIUM FOR CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

1222
01:20:36,027 --> 01:20:37,529

<i>Her nickname is "ghost."
She teaches and does surgery.</i>

1226
01:21:32,876 --> 01:21:36,838
<i>She helps write a thesis. Then she goes
hiking and camping on weekends.</i>

1227
01:21:36,922 --> 01:21:41,051
<i>She's never late for work though.
Only ghosts can do that.</i>

1228
01:21:41,259 --> 01:21:44,429
I knew it was you. You're famous.
Your name is on the Internet.

1229
01:21:44,512 --> 01:21:46,598
<i>Gosh, Chae Song-hwa. She's amazing.</i>

1230
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:48,183
Are you going to watch the patient die?

1231
01:21:48,266 --> 01:21:51,144
-Hey!
-We can't do that to a patient.

1232
01:21:51,228 --> 01:21:55,148
I was told that it's not that serious.
I want that surgery.

1233
01:21:55,232 --> 01:21:58,526
<i>Reporters have their eyes on us.</i>

1234
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:00,612
<i>It's a good opportunity for you.</i>

1235
01:22:00,695 --> 01:22:04,741
<i>-People are too interested in me.
-I want to die alone.</i>

1236
01:22:04,824 --> 01:22:07,619
<i>Can I live until then?</i>

1237
01:22:07,702 --> 01:22:10,789
-Iced Americano and...
-One hot cafe latte.

1238
01:22:10,872 --> 01:22:14,084
-And mine too.
-Jeong-won, do you know Daddy-Long-Legs?

1239
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:16,378
-What?
-He's quite famous at your last hospital.

1240
01:22:16,461 --> 01:22:18,838
You can't trust rich people.
They lie all the time.

1241
01:22:18,922 --> 01:22:19,756
Jerk.

1242
01:22:19,839 --> 01:22:21,466
<i>This patient will get a liver transplant.</i>

1243
01:22:21,549 --> 01:22:25,178
I'm in charge of the liver transplant.
Do you want to be there?

1244
01:22:26,137 --> 01:22:28,932
<i>You're all good-looking.
How did nothing happen between you guys?</i>

1245
01:22:29,057 --> 01:22:31,059
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

1246
01:22:31,142 --> 01:22:32,519
<i>Why disturb the calm water?</i>
