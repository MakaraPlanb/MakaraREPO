HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:12,773
Thank you.

3
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:17,194
I'm looking forward to your involvement
at the Neuroscience Center,

4
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:18,696
-Chief Min.
-Goodness.

5
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:20,781
Yes. I'm looking forward to it, too.

6
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:23,784
It's only been a few days,
but I can see you have a great system

7
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:25,160
and talented medical staff here.

8
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:27,371
I should thank you
for allowing me to join.

9
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:29,623
Professor Chae,
I'm looking forward to working with you.

10
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:33,043
Why don't we all have a meal together?
The cafeteria serves good food.

11
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:34,336
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

12
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:36,797
Don't be so formal.
You can talk to me casually.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,881
Okay.

14
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:41,051
Professor Min looks much better
in person than on TV.

15
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:42,803
He's on a lot of TV shows,

16
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:45,097
but he performs
all of his surgeries himself.

17
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,562
I want you to take
Gong Hyeong-u's surgery.

18
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:54,356
He's not in critical condition.
But this surgery is tricky.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,650
Reporters have their eyes on us,

20
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:58,444
so his surgery must go well,
no matter what.

21
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:02,114
We can use this surgery
to get your name out there.

22
00:01:02,197 --> 00:01:05,784
My surgery schedule for next week is full.
I don't have time for it.

23
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:08,704
Come on.

24
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:11,707
Min-sik, I heard you have
a third baby on the way.

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,625
What? How did you know?

26
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:14,877
I heard you guys talking.

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,337
You should go home.

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,758
I can handle your emergency calls.
I can take two or three calls a month.

29
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:23,344
-Thank you. It's a nice gesture.
-It's not just a gesture.

30
00:01:23,427 --> 00:01:24,845
You're breaking my heart.

31
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:26,221
Thank you.

32
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:31,685
By the way,
how much longer are they going to film us?

33
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:34,104
Gosh, working as a TV director
must be so hard.

34
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:35,981
Goodness, nothing is easy in this world.

35
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:37,649
Sir.

36
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:39,485
You should just eat comfortably.

37
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:40,819
I won't go anywhere.

38
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:43,030
I'll do everything you ask.
Just enjoy your meal.

39
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:44,114
Thank you.

40
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:49,661
Dr. Yong.

41
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:51,455
Han Seung-hyeok needs a lumbar drain.

42
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:52,664
Have you done it?

43
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,876
Who?

44
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,211
Han Seung-hyeok in Room 7104.

45
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,505
Isn't that Professor Min Gi-jun's patient?

46
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:00,798
Yes.

47
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:07,346
This is Park Jeong-su. I took a look
at his CT angiography scan this morning.

48
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:10,307
I saw an unruptured cerebral aneurysm,
so he was admitted today.

49
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:11,975
His surgery is scheduled next week.

50
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:15,896
You look more handsome
in the patient gown.

51
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:19,525
Dr. Min, this surgery
isn't difficult, is it?

52
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:22,236
I have performed this surgery
hundreds of times.

53
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,737
You don't have to worry.

54
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:26,281
Where's the location of his aneurysm?

55
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:28,534
The right paraclinoid aneurysm
is on the cerebral artery.

56
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:30,911
-But its neck seemed narrow.
-I see.

57
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:34,164
There won't be any problems.
It's a simple surgery.

58
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,376
Do you have a girlfriend?

59
00:02:37,793 --> 00:02:38,794
Yes.

60
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:40,921
Wait, no.

61
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,257
What? Do you think I'd be
against you having a girlfriend?

62
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:46,218
Gosh, he's making me look bad.

63
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:48,929
-All right, then.
-Thank you, Doctor.

64
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:50,013
Sure.

65
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:57,020
Hello. How do you feel today?

66
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:02,192
Whatever.

67
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,154
What? What are you going to do?

68
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:07,698
-Is that so?
-They only ran a blood test

69
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:08,991
and gave him an IV drip.

70
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:11,034
And no one came to check on him!

71
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:13,829
We still haven't heard
about his surgery date.

72
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:15,038
No one gave us an update.

73
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:17,624
Do you just want him to die? Is that it?

74
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,335
I am truly sorry.

75
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:23,213
I believe my resident missed it
as he was busy.

76
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:26,049
I will apologize on his behalf.

77
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:27,885
I am very sorry.

78
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:33,599
Who's in charge?

79
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:35,934
Should I just do it myself?

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,104
Han Seung-hyeok really needs
to get a lumbar drain today.

81
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:40,564
You can't just do it yourself.

82
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:43,400
Professor Min told you
to check everything with him.

83
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,569
Don't you remember
the colossal disaster last week?

84
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:49,156
Professor Min should
at least give you orders.

85
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,492
He didn't give any orders
after the patient got admitted.

86
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:55,162
He seems nice in front of patients,
but he doesn't care about them at all.

87
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,831
Seok-min, I moved up
Lee Myeong-gi's surgery.

88
00:03:57,915 --> 00:03:59,082
Get his guardian's consent.

89
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay.

90
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,878
It's not that urgent.
Finish your <i>ramyeon</i> and take a breather.

91
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:04,296
I'm done.

92
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,173
Take your time.

93
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:07,257
You!

94
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:09,718
How can you be eating right now?

95
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:11,470
How can you eat now?

96
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:14,973
Why didn't you do a lumbar drain
for Han Seung-hyeok?

97
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:16,767
-Why didn't you do it?
-Sir.

98
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:20,103
Do you call yourself a doctor?

99
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:21,688
How can you call yourself a doctor?

100
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:24,107
What if the hydrocephalus gets worse
and puts him in danger?

101
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,610
Will you take responsibility for that?
Will you?

102
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:29,238
You didn't give me any orders.
Why are you blaming me?

103
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,572
Are you out of your mind?

104
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:33,867
How dare you talk back to me?

105
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:35,536
Hey.

106
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:37,120
Hey.

107
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:39,456
You call yourself a chief resident?

108
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,335
You can't even make a judgment call.
You shouldn't be a chief resident.

109
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:45,170
Seriously?

110
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:46,672
Look at you.

111
00:04:47,714 --> 00:04:49,049
Are you glaring at me?

112
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,425
Stop glaring.

113
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,636
Stop glaring at me, you bastard!

114
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:56,348
Stop glaring!

115
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:05,348
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

116
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:15,367
Lastly, the complications.

117
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,828
One percent of patients experience
altered consciousness,

118
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:20,581
convulsion, dyskinesia, and so on.
Sequelae are infectious diseases,

119
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:23,208
encephalitis, meningitis,
and brain abscess. Any questions?

120
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,460
I doubt you have any.

121
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,214
All right, then.

122
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,636
Okay.

123
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:38,181
Lastly, due to the lack
of oxygen in the organs,

124
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:40,976
one percent of patients suffer
organ failure, brain damage, and--

125
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:42,311
"Brain damage"?

126
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:45,480
How did you not know Mother was this sick?

127
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:49,610
Doctor, is my mom's surgery that serious?

128
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:51,153
No, they're just the possibilities.

129
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:53,655
I'm only informing you
of the possibilities.

130
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:56,241
Her heart muscles may be damaged
during the surgery.

131
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:57,826
In severe cases, she may die.

132
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,286
"Die"?

133
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:02,706
She was fine just a few minutes ago.

134
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,499
I'm not saying that she will die.

135
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,126
I'm saying that could happen.

136
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,377
Oh, Mom.

137
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:09,630
What if Mom dies during the surgery?

138
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:12,090
I feel so bad for her!

139
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:16,678
I won't be able to live!
I'm going to miss her so much!

140
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:18,639
I can't live without her.

141
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:21,725
Mom. You!

142
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:25,020
Mom!

143
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:29,066
Poor Mom!

144
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,736
Excuse me. She's still alive.

145
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,655
Mom.

146
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:36,865
Mom.

147
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,494
Mom.

148
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,543
Did you just get here?
Are you on the night shift again?

149
00:06:48,627 --> 00:06:50,837
-No, I'm not.
-Are you going home now?

150
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:51,922
I have the morning shift.

151
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:53,465
Then why are you here at seven?

152
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:54,883
This is when my shift starts.

153
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,802
-It's night.
-It's morning.

154
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:58,720
What?

155
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:07,813
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

156
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:25,372
Tell me about the patient.

157
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:29,501
He had a stomachache and was constipated,
so I performed an enema. He's fine now.

158
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:30,836
I'm sorry, sir.

159
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:33,964
My intern was so scared
that they called you directly.

160
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:35,382
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:36,425
No, that's okay.

162
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:38,719
You must have been scared, too.

163
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:41,972
You were scared, weren't you?

164
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,935
This happens to kids often,
so you don't need to worry too much.

165
00:07:47,102 --> 00:07:50,605
A lot of kids around Jeong-hu's age
come to the ER because of constipation.

166
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,108
-Isn't he your first son?
-Yes.

167
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:55,694
Moms get scared for their first children
and come to the ER a lot.

168
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:59,656
Moms with second or third children
are like experts.

169
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,826
They come here, ask for the meds,
chat a little, and leave.

170
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:04,035
Really?

171
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:08,331
I was so scared that something
would happen to my son.

172
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,793
My gosh, I still have
a long way to go as a mother.

173
00:08:11,877 --> 00:08:14,838
Even experienced mothers get scared
for their first children.

174
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:17,424
It's natural to be scared.
Don't beat yourself up.

175
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:20,677
It looks like he fell asleep.

176
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:23,346
We should let him sleep.
Do you want to get some coffee?

177
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,056
-Sounds great.
-Let's go.

178
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:27,517
Is the café open?

179
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:09,976
<i>Professor Lee, I noticed that the date</i>
<i>for my returning flight is next week,</i>

180
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,394
<i>not this week.</i>

181
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:15,106
<i>I'm grateful that you paid for my flight.</i>

182
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:18,652
<i>But what about U-ju? Who will watch U-ju?</i>

183
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,780
U-ju?
My parents are coming this afternoon.

184
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:25,075
They will watch him for me.
You have nothing to worry about.

185
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,495
Okay. Go sightseeing with your daughter.

186
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,956
You know, China is a big country.

187
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:33,750
U-ju, that's spicy.

188
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:34,960
It's really spicy.

189
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:36,878
You should eat your soup. Eat your food.

190
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:39,089
Okay. Bye.

191
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:41,967
Hi, Mom.

192
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:47,389
Why would I go there with Professor Jang?

193
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:50,559
Gosh. I can't go there for a reason.

194
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:53,812
I broke up with him.

195
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:57,816
I broke up with Professor Jang.

196
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:59,734
<i>What? Why?</i>

197
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:01,486
He cheated on me.

198
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:03,530
He cheated on...

199
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:07,158
That jerk, Professor Jang, cheated on me.

200
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:09,369
Last week, when I was tired after surgery,

201
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:12,330
he came to my office himself
and confessed everything.

202
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:14,207
He said he was seeing someone else.

203
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,253
My gosh. I'm not in my 20s.
Of course, I'm fine.

204
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:20,547
I'm really busy these days.
Maybe it's better this way.

205
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,675
I can live without him.
Or I can get a new boyfriend.

206
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:27,095
Mom, I'm going into surgery. Bye.

207
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,472
You startled me.

208
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:37,689
Are you trying to look funny?

209
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:39,524
That, too.

210
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:40,692
Stay ten steps away from me.

211
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:42,277
It's embarrassing to be seen with you.

212
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:44,654
Did Professor Jang cheat on you?

213
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:45,947
Did you hear that?

214
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:48,158
If I didn't, I should go to an ENT doctor.

215
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:49,868
Hey, by the way,

216
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:52,370
your vocalization is really nice.

217
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:54,039
You have perfect pitch.

218
00:10:54,372 --> 00:10:56,374
I'm the band's vocalist for a reason.

219
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:02,255
That... Gosh.

220
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,141
A cold cup of iced Americano, please.

221
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:15,060
Iced Americano is already cold.

222
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:18,313
-They mean the same thing.
-Yes, they do. So just pick one.

223
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:20,857
You pay for this. Bye.

224
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:24,402
Gosh, that rude jerk.

225
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:25,779
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:30,825
A cold cup of iced Americano
and that jerk's chocolate milk.

227
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,536
And the scone, too.

228
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:35,288
<i>I came to the hospital, so I could live.</i>

229
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,332
<i>Did you think I came here to die?</i>

230
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:41,461
You know what? When someone is in pain,
you should give them painkillers

231
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:44,297
or check if everything's okay
with the surgical wound.

232
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:46,675
You just come here once or twice a day.
Is that all you do?

233
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:47,842
Is that all?

234
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:49,386
Excuse me. When you scream like this,

235
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:51,513
you make other patients
uncomfortable.

236
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:54,349
I'm in pain! I said I'm in severe pain!

237
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:57,936
If a patient is in so much pain,
shouldn't you do something about it?

238
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:00,647
Dr. Chae.

239
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:04,025
They need to dress the wound
three times a day.

240
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,528
Dressing it twice won't disinfect
the wound enough.

241
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:09,531
I'll tell them to take better care of you.
Please don't be upset.

242
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,951
If you say so.

243
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:16,579
It would've been great if you'd done
a better job from the start.

244
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:19,749
Do you have urination problems?

245
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,584
No. It's all good.

246
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:23,503
I pee just the right amount.

247
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:25,005
Okay, then.

248
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:31,511
Discharge the patient.

249
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:32,595
Pardon?

250
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:34,222
Didn't you hear her voice just now?

251
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:35,640
She's full of energy.

252
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:37,851
She's all better now. Let's discharge her.

253
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:38,768
Okay.

254
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:42,439
The patient's INR is off the charts!
What were you doing?

255
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:43,773
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:44,983
Is that all?

257
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,943
Didn't I tell you to check his INR

258
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:49,112
and give him two FFPs
if his INR went over two?

259
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:52,449
I even told you the number of FFPs
because you can't do that yourself.

260
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:54,034
You should've followed my orders.

261
00:12:54,117 --> 00:12:55,410
Doctor.

262
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:58,538
I came here because my heart is not well.

263
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:02,167
But my heart is about
to explode right now.

264
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:03,752
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:05,420
Do your job, please.

266
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:11,384
Doctor, are you all right?

267
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:13,636
Yes.

268
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,056
Is there anything else?

269
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,141
No. I'm fine.

270
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:20,643
I'm sorry. You got scolded because of me.

271
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:22,896
My gosh,
I got scolded because I messed up.

272
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:24,898
Sorry?

273
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:27,692
I'll come back after my meal.

274
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:38,495
Is Dr. Yong here?

275
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:41,289
What brings you
all the way to NS, Jae-hak?

276
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:44,334
Say hello to the chief resident for CS.
It's Dr. Do Jae-hak.

277
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,460
-Hello.
-Hello.

278
00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:48,922
-Are these the med students?
-Yes. Guys, sit down.

279
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:49,839
-Okay.
-Okay.

280
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:52,383
They are med students.
Our department has them this week.

281
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:55,095
He looks pretty old, doesn't he?

282
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,930
He started college before some professors.

283
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:57,847
No, I didn't.

284
00:13:57,931 --> 00:13:59,891
I took the CSAT four times
and the bar exam six times.

285
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:02,102
Memorize that. Let's go eat.

286
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:04,062
Eat? What's that?

287
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,314
I must attend the conference
for Gong Hyeong-u's surgery.

288
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:08,441
I know him.
The good Samaritan, Gong Hyeong-u.

289
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:09,984
He was a subway homeless guy.

290
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:12,529
He's a hero who saved
a pregnant lady from the tracks.

291
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:15,365
I don't get why Chief Min
is suddenly leading this surgery.

292
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:17,283
This patient needs
transsphenoidal surgery.

293
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,953
Dr. Chae is the specialist for it.
How could he steal that?

294
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:22,539
An endoscope is inserted into the nose.

295
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:25,708
I gathered all of his data, too.

296
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,586
It will be perfect
if I do this with Dr. Chae.

297
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,588
My gosh. Aren't you going to eat?

298
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:33,174
I told you I have a conference.

299
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,510
Dr. Heo Seon-bin. Dr. Ahn Chi-hong.

300
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:36,970
They are three-year residents.

301
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,471
-Hello.
-Hello.

302
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:41,307
I've got a question for you.
Are you guys a thing, too?

303
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,685
-No, we are not.
-We are not a thing, either.

304
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:46,688
Why are you always together?
Captain Ahn is older than you.

305
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:49,107
He's from the military academy.
People are fascinating.

306
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,942
We're close.
We went to the same med school.

307
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:52,277
But your genders...

308
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,863
-My gosh. He's so old-fashioned.
-Oh, Father.

309
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:57,198
That's what I should say.

310
00:14:57,282 --> 00:14:58,825
What am I going to do with this surgery?

311
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:01,286
Dr. Heo, take the med students with you.

312
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:03,580
Dr. Ahn, come with me to the conference.

313
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:04,497
Okay.

314
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:09,043
It's a large pituitary tumor.

315
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:13,089
I don't think I can remove the tumor
completely through the TSA.

316
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:16,634
So I'll take the pterional approach
to resect the tumor.

317
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:20,430
If you do,
there will be a lot of bleeding.

318
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:22,140
Won't that cause a brain injury?

319
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:24,267
It's an unusually big tumor.

320
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,436
It's deeply expanded
into the suprasellar region.

321
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,313
It's better
if I take the pterional approach.

322
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:30,690
But I still believe
the TSA is a better approach.

323
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:32,400
He'll need radiation therapy later,

324
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:35,028
but given that he has diabetes
and his wounds will heal slowly,

325
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:36,529
performing a craniotomy is too much.

326
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:39,032
We must remove the tumor completely.

327
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:42,577
The first thing the press asks will be
the result of the surgery.

328
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,456
If we say some of the tumor remains
and he might undergo radiation therapy,

329
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,750
what do you think
those reporters will write?

330
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:51,169
It will only ruin
the hospital's reputation.

331
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:54,797
Saving the patient and removing the tumor
completely is important.

332
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:56,090
But if you take that approach,

333
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:59,969
his optic nerves or his pituitary stalk
might be damaged.

334
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:03,765
I don't think you guys have
much experience with this surgery.

335
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:06,017
I've performed this surgery
hundreds of times.

336
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,603
The quality of his life is important,

337
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:10,396
but seeing the tumor myself

338
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,690
and removing it completely
will be much better for him.

339
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:16,069
I've had a very low percentage
of sequelae among my patients.

340
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:17,862
Their recoveries weren't that bad.

341
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:20,490
It's got to be more than
a low chance of suffering from sequelae.

342
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,701
Even if our reputation gets ruined
for a while,

343
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:27,789
the patient's quality of life
must be taken into account.

344
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,544
Wait here. I'm going to the bank.

345
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:35,964
Hey, Old-timer.

346
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:40,009
Share your wisdom with the med students.
You've lived twice as long as them.

347
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:43,012
"Old-timer"? I'm still in my 30s.

348
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:44,681
But you turn 40 next year.

349
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:52,313
All right. First off, what are your names?

350
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:54,107
My name is Jang Hong-do.

351
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:57,235
I bet you were good at <i>ssireum</i>
at your school.

352
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:00,238
What do you do for fun? Calligraphy?

353
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:04,075
No, I play the guitar.
I'm in a band at my church.

354
00:17:04,158 --> 00:17:05,743
Not a traditional instrument?

355
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:09,664
Sorry.

356
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:11,249
What's your name?

357
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,917
It's Yun-bok.

358
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:17,422
Don't joke around.

359
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:20,633
You informed Dr. Chae, right?

360
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:22,593
Her phone was off, so I sent a text.

361
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:24,554
Okay. She has a lecture today.

362
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:25,972
She will respond soon.

363
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:27,598
-Does she give lectures?
-Yes.

364
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:31,185
She teaches and does a lot of surgery.

365
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:33,438
And she checks
residents' papers thoroughly.

366
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:36,774
And she attends symposiums.
She goes hiking and camping on weekends.

367
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:40,695
But she still manages to come
to work at 7 a.m. She's never late.

368
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:42,613
Is that even possible?

369
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:45,658
That's why her nickname is Ghost.
I gave her that nickname.

370
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:49,120
She's in the lobby.
She's coming with Ms. Hwang.

371
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:50,038
See?

372
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:54,500
There's no other explanation of how she
can do everything unless she's a ghost.

373
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:55,543
Let's go in.

374
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:01,758
You're known as the Ghost.
And yet, your shoes are worn out.

375
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:04,218
-I'm the Ghost?
-Yes, that's your nickname.

376
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:06,387
-Why is that?
-Because you can't be human.

377
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:08,556
It's post-op day seven for Kim Ju-chan.
How is he?

378
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:11,351
His wound is clean.
We can take his stitches out.

379
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:13,603
By the way, your birthday is next week.

380
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:15,146
I'll buy you a pair of shoes.

381
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,106
This pair can last me ten more years.

382
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,150
It's been about ten years
since I first saw them.

383
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,194
You got them when you were a resident.

384
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:22,987
You should bid farewell to your shoes.

385
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:24,697
Who was it?

386
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,366
Who nicknamed me?

387
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:27,617
Yong Seok-min did.

388
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,743
Got it.

389
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:34,832
My gosh.

390
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:40,088
You still have a long way to go,

391
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:43,299
but make sure you choose GS for your field
when you become residents.

392
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:48,679
Don't say,
"You mean the GS convenience store?"

393
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,349
It's not
the GS home-shopping network either.

394
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:54,310
I see. You mean, general surgery?

395
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:56,437
That's right.

396
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:59,816
I know there aren't a lot of residents
for other fields either.

397
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:03,986
But there are only
a handful of GS residents in Korea.

398
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,279
You know what?

399
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:09,909
There has been a new dynamic to this.

400
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:16,249
<i>Listen up, Jang-hwa and Hong-ryeon.</i>

401
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:19,085
<i>Our names are Hong-do and Yun-bok.</i>

402
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:22,004
<i>Okay. Hong-do and Yun-bok.</i>
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

403
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:26,968
<i>Here in our hospital,</i>
<i>there are 13 general surgeons.</i>

404
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:30,012
<i>But there is only one resident.</i>

405
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:32,265
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul, what are you doing?

406
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:36,060
<i>She's like the only daughter of 13 dads.</i>

407
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,479
<i>Then, who do you think has the upper hand?</i>

408
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:42,358
<i>Guys, general surgery isn't so bad.</i>

409
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,694
Dr. Jang, why did you come
to work so early?

410
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:45,987
I told you to take today off.

411
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,364
She prepared the materials
for a colorectal surgery meeting.

412
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,283
Don't talk to her. She's busy.

413
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,367
And get lost.

414
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:53,578
Go.

415
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:07,467
My goodness. Dr. Jang, have you eaten?

416
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,218
I had pot noodles here earlier.

417
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:10,219
Pot noodles?

418
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:13,097
That's not real food. Come on.

419
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:15,057
Let's go. I'll buy you a meal. Come.

420
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:19,353
If you collapse,
General Surgery will collapse, too. Come.

421
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:21,272
-I'm fine.
-Really?

422
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:25,735
You were reading Lee Yong-chan's chart.

423
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:28,112
This patient will get
a liver transplant tomorrow morning.

424
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,658
Liver transplant.
And I'm leading the surgery.

425
00:20:33,284 --> 00:20:34,786
Do you want to join me?

426
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,427
Liver transplant.
And I'm leading the surgery.

427
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:41,555
Do you want to join me?

428
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:46,852
He's an HCC patient.

429
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,773
Dr. Jang, I'm doing my rounds.

430
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,066
Can you come with me?

431
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,485
-No, she can't. No.
-Hey, hold on.

432
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:58,989
You'll join me, right?

433
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:01,909
I still can't turn my head because
I had to do surgery alone yesterday.

434
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,745
I can do it if it's in the morning.

435
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:06,872
Really?

436
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:08,707
Really?

437
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:12,294
There you are, Dr. Jang.

438
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:17,716
Can you help me with my breast cancer
surgery tomorrow morning?

439
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,888
Yes, I will.

440
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:24,056
Okay.

441
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:26,684
Hey, you.

442
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:29,186
Dr. Lee Ik-jun.

443
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:30,479
Hello, sir.

444
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,566
You know what?

445
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:38,195
How are you such a great dancer? How?

446
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:42,700
I have never seen anyone who's
as good at singing and dancing as you

447
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:46,579
and who knows how to have fun
as much as you.

448
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:48,122
I'm flattered, sir.

449
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll see you at the next gathering.

450
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,334
-Okay.
-Have a good day.

451
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:03,470
Dr. Jang, that means that you won't be
joining me tomorrow morning, right?

452
00:22:04,513 --> 00:22:06,015
I'm sorry.

453
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,225
I'll disinfect everything tomorrow,

454
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:10,978
open the patient up,
and close him up by myself.

455
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:12,980
But next time,

456
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:14,899
please...

457
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:19,195
<i>Pick me, pick me, pick me up</i>

458
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:23,574
-<i>Pick me, pick me, pick me up</i>
-Yes?

459
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:25,451
I'll be right there.

460
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,828
-Where? Eat the sausage.
-It's the ER.

461
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:29,747
Should I call Jeong-won?
I heard he's not busy.

462
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,415
It was a personal call to me.

463
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:38,464
Hello, ma'am.

464
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:43,886
What? Okay. I'll be there.

465
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:45,429
Don't worry. Just go.

466
00:22:45,512 --> 00:22:47,598
I'll take care of it. Yes.

467
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:51,268
That's the Blood Collection Room,
CT Scan Room,

468
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:52,770
X-Ray Room and MRI Room.

469
00:22:52,853 --> 00:22:54,647
If you go straight,
there's the PET Scan Room.

470
00:22:55,231 --> 00:22:56,815
You've heard of PET, right?

471
00:22:57,107 --> 00:22:58,734
PET? Like a plastic bottle?

472
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:00,986
Positron emission tomography?

473
00:23:01,237 --> 00:23:02,112
What is that used for?

474
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:05,241
I don't know that much yet.

475
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:07,117
We just got into med school.

476
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:09,161
You guys are soulmates, aren't you?

477
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,664
-Yes.
-I knew it.

478
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:16,168
Dr. Heo, will we be going
to the operating rooms?

479
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:17,628
Someday.

480
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,131
Hui-su, I saw your Instagram post.
You had a soufflé pancake yesterday.

481
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:23,008
-Was that any good?
-Totally.

482
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:25,552
I went to the cafe at 3 p.m. after work.
I didn't have to wait.

483
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:27,721
You should go and try it, too.

484
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:29,556
If only I had time.

485
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:31,308
Can you come with me, then?

486
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:34,103
Actually, I should treat you to a meal
for looking after my interns.

487
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:37,690
You always treat me. It's on me next time.

488
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:43,529
Dr. Jang, have some cookies.

489
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:45,864
No, I don't like sweets.

490
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,658
I see. Okay.

491
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,618
How old is the patient?

492
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:51,787
He's a seven-year-old
and was in a traffic accident.

493
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,664
And he shows signs of stupor.

494
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:55,040
That's why I called the GS.

495
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:56,542
I see.

496
00:23:58,585 --> 00:23:59,586
Hello.

497
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,256
Okay.

498
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:04,633
It will take 20 more minutes.

499
00:24:05,384 --> 00:24:07,678
-Then, I'll come back after my meal.
-Okay.

500
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:15,686
Guys, this isn't free.
It's coming out of my paycheck.

501
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:17,521
We had pot noodles just now.

502
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:19,231
Thank you for the meal.

503
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:21,150
Let's go.

504
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:30,492
Sir, a lot of sausages, please.

505
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:32,411
-Are you a resident?
-Pardon?

506
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,206
-Yes.
-Okay. Then, you can have three sausages.

507
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,292
She told me not to give more than two,

508
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,794
but I gave you three
since you're a resident. Next.

509
00:24:42,755 --> 00:24:44,631
-Are you an intern?
-No, I'm a med student.

510
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,258
My gosh. I'll give you five sausages.

511
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:48,093
Here.

512
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:49,470
There you go.

513
00:24:50,637 --> 00:24:51,847
-You, too?
-Yes.

514
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,224
Okay. Here. There you go.

515
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,519
What are you doing here?

516
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:58,854
You're a professor.

517
00:24:58,937 --> 00:25:00,230
You get one sausage.

518
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,571
That way, I can even out the sausages.

519
00:25:07,654 --> 00:25:10,449
I gave a lot of sausages
to the people in front of you.

520
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:12,951
The higher your position is,
the fewer sausages you get.

521
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:14,578
Don't stand there. Keep moving.

522
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:20,667
The cafeteria lady and I are best friends.

523
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:23,253
Her son suddenly ended up
at the police station.

524
00:25:26,673 --> 00:25:28,634
I'm wearing gloves and a mask.

525
00:25:28,717 --> 00:25:30,052
Give me one more.

526
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:33,138
-Just one more.
-Get lost. Next.

527
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:34,223
Okay.

528
00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:45,317
Seriously?

529
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:47,986
Darn it.

530
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:50,197
Gosh.

531
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:51,782
Here.

532
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:56,620
This way, I can balance
supply and demand.

533
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:58,831
I gave a lot of sausages
to the people in front of you.

534
00:25:58,914 --> 00:26:01,083
You should make a small sacrifice, sir.

535
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,251
Next.

536
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,341
Hi.

537
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:20,769
You know how much I care, right?

538
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:23,188
Thank you.

539
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:24,898
Wait.

540
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:32,322
They prepare everything

541
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:35,492
from breakfast, lunch, dinner, late-night
snacks to boxed meals during surgery.

542
00:26:35,576 --> 00:26:36,702
Even boxed meals?

543
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:38,662
They send meal boxes upstairs.

544
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:40,831
We can't come down to eat during surgery.

545
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:45,627
After eating this meal,
will we go to the operating rooms?

546
00:26:46,462 --> 00:26:47,421
I don't know.

547
00:26:48,714 --> 00:26:49,715
Okay.

548
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:16,116
A seven-year-old boy
from a traffic accident.

549
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,119
He was out with his mom.
He was trying to pick up a toy on the road

550
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:21,914
when a speeding truck crashed into him.
His BP is 60/40.

551
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:23,874
I think his pelvis
and chest bone are broken.

552
00:27:24,374 --> 00:27:26,168
Ju-hwan.

553
00:27:33,926 --> 00:27:35,886
I see intraperitoneal bleeding
and thoracic injury.

554
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:37,763
From the X-ray,
he has a cervical spine injury.

555
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:39,973
And it seems
he has a pelvic fracture, too.

556
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:42,893
What should we do?

557
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,020
What do you mean?
We should try to save him.

558
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:46,396
Get a CT scan now.

559
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,358
He might have a brain injury,
so call Dr. Chae.

560
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:50,317
Okay.

561
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,777
Where's Dr. Ahn Jeong-won?

562
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,363
He was working outside today,
but he's almost here.

563
00:27:54,988 --> 00:27:57,699
This will be a tough case
even with Jeong-won's help. Goodness.

564
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:01,161
He's losing consciousness.

565
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,539
And we can't get his pulse,
and his breathing is weak.

566
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:05,874
We only checked his ultrasound
and X-ray scan.

567
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:07,209
He has hemoperitoneum,

568
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:09,127
cervical spine injury,
and a pelvic fracture.

569
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:11,713
We'll know more once we take his brain CT.

570
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:14,758
There's a high chance that
his brain might be swelling as well.

571
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:16,802
We can operate, but even if we do,

572
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:18,804
it may be hard for him
to regain consciousness.

573
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,891
What are you doing? Go.

574
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:25,477
His guardian must be waiting.
Go talk to her now.

575
00:28:25,978 --> 00:28:27,187
Yes, Doctor.

576
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:29,731
We have our conference rooms here.

577
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:32,901
When a patient needs surgery, the surgeon
doesn't make all the decisions.

578
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:34,653
All the professors
in the department gather,

579
00:28:34,736 --> 00:28:36,905
discuss the best approach for the patient,

580
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:38,323
and advise each other.

581
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:40,867
Let's see if this room is open.

582
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,167
They are cute.

583
00:28:49,918 --> 00:28:51,712
I used to be young like them.

584
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:56,049
I'm sorry.

585
00:28:56,717 --> 00:28:59,094
Anyway, we have our precious med students.

586
00:28:59,177 --> 00:29:00,971
Let's listen to why
they applied to med school.

587
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:03,432
What's wrong with him? Just let them go.

588
00:29:03,682 --> 00:29:05,976
Right? You don't like that, either.

589
00:29:07,603 --> 00:29:09,438
-Pardon?
-I'm sorry.

590
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:11,773
I won't talk to you.

591
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:16,737
Both of my parents are doctors,
so I didn't have much choice--

592
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,364
Hey, Seon-bin.
We're not interested in your story.

593
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:23,910
Let's start with you, first.

594
00:29:24,244 --> 00:29:26,663
Why did you decide to study medicine?

595
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:28,206
Well...

596
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,752
my mother had major surgery ten years ago.

597
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:34,671
I was moved by the devoted doctor
who treated my mom.

598
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:36,173
So I decided to study medicine.

599
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:37,591
Gosh, that's great.

600
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:39,509
Next.

601
00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:41,345
Well...

602
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:46,767
my mother had major surgery ten years ago.

603
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:49,603
I was moved by her passionate doctor--

604
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:51,271
She already said that.

605
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:53,482
Your friend just said that.

606
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:56,360
I'm sorry. We'll get going now.

607
00:29:56,443 --> 00:29:57,527
-Let's go.
-Bye.

608
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:58,945
Bye.

609
00:29:59,237 --> 00:30:00,405
Bye.

610
00:30:01,782 --> 00:30:03,742
-Let's go that way.
-Thank you.

611
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:05,369
TELL THEM YOU'LL DO IT, PROFESSOR

612
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:06,286
Thank you.

613
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,875
Yes. This is Chae Song-hwa speaking.

614
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:17,047
I called you at the perfect time, right?

615
00:30:17,297 --> 00:30:18,799
Yes. Nicely done.

616
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:22,678
Who is it? Come in.

617
00:30:26,181 --> 00:30:27,808
You should volunteer to do it.

618
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:29,226
Unbelievable.

619
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:31,895
Do you think doing surgery
is like booking a hotel room?

620
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:34,189
Changing the lead surgeon
isn't that simple.

621
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:36,400
Are you going to watch the patient die?

622
00:30:36,483 --> 00:30:37,317
Hey!

623
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:43,240
Professor Min said he won't do
a craniotomy. He'll do the TSA.

624
00:30:43,323 --> 00:30:44,366
What's the problem here?

625
00:30:45,117 --> 00:30:48,662
He's only performed a TSA
once in his career.

626
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:51,123
And his fellow doctor

627
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:53,542
did most of the work
while he just stood in the OR.

628
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,086
The tumor expanded
into the suprasellar region.

629
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:58,755
Executing the TSA will be
especially difficult for this case.

630
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:01,007
I'm sure he can handle it.

631
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:03,385
At his previous hospital,
his fellow doctor

632
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:05,345
did the TSA for him. But what about us?

633
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:07,681
We have you. You can assist him.

634
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:09,349
I don't know anything!

635
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:11,893
You startled me. Keep your voice down.

636
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:13,770
Professor Chae.

637
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:17,816
Will you let Professor Min
operate on Gong Hyeong-u?

638
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:20,485
That's not right.
We can't do that to a patient.

639
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,613
You should talk to the hospital director.

640
00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:24,906
Tell him you'll do it.

641
00:31:25,532 --> 00:31:26,575
Isn't that in two days?

642
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:30,746
I have skull base tumor surgery
tomorrow afternoon.

643
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:31,955
It won't have ended by then.

644
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:33,582
I just don't have time for it.

645
00:31:34,082 --> 00:31:37,043
You can ask the anesthesiologist
to buy you some time.

646
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,129
I'll set up everything.

647
00:31:39,212 --> 00:31:41,089
I don't know.
Gosh, I'm getting a headache.

648
00:31:41,173 --> 00:31:43,008
Jun-wan, do you have anything
for headaches?

649
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:45,302
You're a neurosurgeon.
Don't you have anything?

650
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,428
Let's go to my office.

651
00:31:47,137 --> 00:31:48,889
Professor Chae. Please.

652
00:31:48,972 --> 00:31:50,807
-Professor Chae.
-Stop it.

653
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:52,726
That's enough whining.

654
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:04,946
-What did I just say?
-You saw Professor Jang with his junior.

655
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:11,077
-You knew it, didn't you?
-It was a coincidence.

656
00:32:11,787 --> 00:32:15,081
-Hey.
-It's a day or two before he came clean.

657
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:16,541
I was going to tell you.

658
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:17,959
You should've told me right away.

659
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:19,920
I can't assume anything
about relationships.

660
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:21,963
If you see something,
just tell me as it is.

661
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:23,673
Your concern doesn't matter.

662
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:26,259
Hey, it's not that easy to do.
You think you could've told me?

663
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:28,261
Yes. I would tell you right away.

664
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:31,515
I would tell you your girlfriend was
cheating on you the second I saw it.

665
00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:35,393
-What is it?
-It's time for your outpatients.

666
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:38,563
-I don't have outpatients today.
-I was talking to Professor Chae.

667
00:32:39,272 --> 00:32:40,315
Right.

668
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,318
We're not done.

669
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:52,244
Dr. Ahn Chi-hong from NS
was waiting by the door.

670
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:53,286
Okay.

671
00:32:54,788 --> 00:32:57,582
Good. This is the best thing
you've done this year.

672
00:33:12,764 --> 00:33:15,308
It's highly likely
that he's having hemorrhagic shock.

673
00:33:15,851 --> 00:33:17,686
Then, what should we do?

674
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:19,229
His pulse is weak.

675
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:21,606
We believe he may have
a thoracic and brain injury.

676
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,483
We took him up for CT.

677
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:25,986
But we're not sure if he will last.

678
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,238
There's a slim chance we can save him.

679
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,448
There's no hope for him.

680
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:36,371
Doctor, please save Ju-hwan.

681
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,707
If he's gone,

682
00:33:39,124 --> 00:33:41,042
I won't be able to live.

683
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:46,172
Did you perform CPR?

684
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:48,341
Pardon?

685
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:50,176
Did you do chest compressions?

686
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:52,470
No.

687
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:56,016
He could have lived if you had done that.

688
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,268
-What?
-Dr. Jang.

689
00:33:58,351 --> 00:34:00,395
-Yes?
-A word, please.

690
00:34:09,988 --> 00:34:11,740
I'm Professor Ahn from Pediatric Surgery.

691
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,409
It is true that things
aren't good for your son,

692
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:16,912
but we will do everything
we can to save him.

693
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:20,165
I'll talk to you once we get the CT scan.

694
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:24,711
Ma'am, it's too early to be sure
about anything.

695
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,976
Dr. Jang, how long
have you been a resident?

696
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,437
-Three years.
-Is that how you talk to guardians?

697
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:45,065
He could've lived if she did CPR?

698
00:34:45,357 --> 00:34:46,733
How could you say that?

699
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:50,320
Did you think about how guilty
she would feel for the rest of her life?

700
00:34:50,904 --> 00:34:53,615
And how can you be certain
if he has no hope or a slim chance?

701
00:34:55,116 --> 00:34:56,952
I've observed him since he got here.

702
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:58,036
I only told her the facts

703
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:00,121
after reading his chart
and observing his condition.

704
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:04,459
But what I told her is true.

705
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:07,629
He indeed has a slim chance.

706
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:11,591
I told her the truth because I believed
she needed to know her son's condition.

707
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,348
Telling her that
she should have performed CPR...

708
00:35:19,474 --> 00:35:22,227
It was my mistake. I am sorry.

709
00:35:24,312 --> 00:35:25,730
What are you doing here?

710
00:35:25,814 --> 00:35:27,399
Come out. We need this bed.

711
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:29,442
How's the kid? Did you call Song-hwa?

712
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:31,569
I don't have to.

713
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:33,029
What?

714
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,824
There's no brain damage from the CT scan.

715
00:35:36,408 --> 00:35:38,702
We can save him if we focus
on stopping the bleeding.

716
00:35:39,035 --> 00:35:41,287
My gosh. That was a close one.

717
00:35:41,621 --> 00:35:43,748
I need to treat a patient
with a stomachache.

718
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:45,333
And I'm taking Dr. Bae Jun-hui.

719
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:47,419
Dr. Jang, talk to the guardian for me.

720
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:51,756
Dr. Jang.

721
00:35:55,176 --> 00:35:58,221
Do you know why doctors only give vague
answers such as "We can't be sure yet,"

722
00:35:58,304 --> 00:35:59,889
"We don't know yet,"

723
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:02,475
and "We need to observe a bit more"?

724
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:06,688
Doctors must take
responsibility for their words.

725
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:08,982
So we must be careful with our words.

726
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:14,154
There's only one thing we, doctors,
can tell our patients with certainty.

727
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:17,157
"We will do our best."

728
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,659
That's the only thing.

729
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:24,998
Go.

730
00:36:25,498 --> 00:36:27,208
His mother will be so happy to hear that.

731
00:36:33,548 --> 00:36:35,258
Okay. Bye.

732
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:40,013
I looked at this patient's chart
this morning.

733
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,308
The patient had breast cancer surgery
at our hospital a month ago.

734
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:47,020
I do see a 3cm-metastatic tumor
in the parietal lobe.

735
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:50,648
From her record,
after the breast cancer surgery,

736
00:36:50,732 --> 00:36:52,442
she was also treated for depression.

737
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:54,694
Was that why she didn't do chemotherapy?

738
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:57,739
Bring her in. What's her name?

739
00:36:57,822 --> 00:36:58,740
It's Ba-ram.

740
00:36:59,866 --> 00:37:01,034
Her name is Ba-ram.

741
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:05,747
I went to high school
with a girl who had the same name.

742
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:07,415
We were quite close.

743
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,250
I still remember her number.

744
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:11,211
She's the same age as you.

745
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:13,713
-My gosh.
-No.

746
00:37:14,255 --> 00:37:15,882
She has a unique last name.

747
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:17,592
-It's Gal.
-Yes.

748
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:19,135
So her attendance number was...

749
00:37:21,387 --> 00:37:22,514
My gosh.

750
00:37:22,597 --> 00:37:24,182
I knew it was you.

751
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:27,393
You're famous.
Your name pops up on search engines.

752
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:30,814
That's enough.
Why didn't you do chemotherapy?

753
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:33,024
If you had, you could've stopped it
from spreading.

754
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:35,151
It would have spread even if I did.

755
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,321
I will die in the end no matter what.
What's the point?

756
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:43,535
Is my surgery difficult?

757
00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:46,704
No. It's on the layer
that wraps around your head.

758
00:37:46,788 --> 00:37:49,290
So it's not hard. You don't have to worry.

759
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:51,084
I'm not worried...

760
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:52,836
since my doctor is you.

761
00:37:54,045 --> 00:37:55,755
Do I need to get admitted today?

762
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,508
Well, we're not pressed for time
to do the surgery.

763
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:00,677
But still, it's best to do it
as soon as possible.

764
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,263
I'm available this weekend.
Let's do it then.

765
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:05,932
You should get admitted today
and get all the tests.

766
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:07,308
Thank you.

767
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,271
You can thank me at our school reunion
after you get discharged.

768
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:14,816
Will I live until then?

769
00:38:14,899 --> 00:38:16,109
Hey.

770
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:26,995
What a long day.

771
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:29,581
Professor Chae, didn't you drive today?

772
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:33,001
I did. But I don't have energy
to drive now.

773
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:36,087
And I'm hungry, too.

774
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:44,846
Dr. Chae, I'm hungry.
Let's get some <i>kalguksu.</i>

775
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:46,222
Sounds great.

776
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,807
Should I call the others?

777
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,475
-I'm here.
-God, you're so loud.

778
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,436
-I'm here. Get in.
-I'm right here!

779
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,104
-Hey, pull up your seat.
-Wait.

780
00:38:53,188 --> 00:38:54,189
-Hurry.
-Pull up. Come on.

781
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:56,399
-Hey, pull up your seat, too.
-This is it.

782
00:38:56,482 --> 00:38:58,193
-You should drive yourselves!
-Hey, hold on.

783
00:38:58,276 --> 00:39:00,111
-What about your car?
-Okay. Hold on.

784
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:01,613
-Come on.
-There are five of us!

785
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:03,406
MAMA'S HOMEMADE <i>KALGUKSU, </i>24 HOURS

786
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:14,125
Want a pain relief patch?

787
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,127
You carry all sorts of stuff there.

788
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:17,253
Ma'am.

789
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:21,174
My mother likes<i> kalguksu.</i>
Should I take some home?

790
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:23,092
-Jeong-won, give me your cup.
-Okay.

791
00:39:24,302 --> 00:39:26,095
Do you know what your nickname is?

792
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:28,181
What is it? Is it Angel?

793
00:39:28,473 --> 00:39:30,308
-It's Buddha.
-I see.

794
00:39:30,808 --> 00:39:34,145
That makes no sense, right?
His family has two priests and two nuns.

795
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:35,688
I love Buddha, too.

796
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:39,150
My goodness. Jeong-won is my ideal friend.

797
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:42,487
Gosh, if I had a younger sister,
I would set you up with her.

798
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:45,198
-You do have a sister.
-Oh, right. I do.

799
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:48,076
Mom. Do you want me
to bring home some<i> kalguksu?</i>

800
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,203
Why are you asking her that?
Just buy some for her.

801
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:51,621
<i>Kalguksu.</i>

802
00:39:52,372 --> 00:39:54,290
I'll be home soon after this meal.

803
00:39:54,374 --> 00:39:55,875
Is something bothering you?

804
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,293
What? No.

805
00:39:57,377 --> 00:39:58,836
I bet it's because of Gong Hyeong-u.

806
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,547
The good Samaritan from the subway?
What about him?

807
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:04,592
I heard the new chief
will be performing the surgery.

808
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:06,261
What does she have to do with it?

809
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:10,139
I heard Professor Min doesn't have
much experience with TSA.

810
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:12,934
And given the location
of the tumor and sequelae,

811
00:40:13,017 --> 00:40:15,520
going with TSA is a much better choice
than a craniotomy.

812
00:40:15,937 --> 00:40:17,730
Since he was originally my patient,

813
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:20,441
I'm thinking of telling him
that I'll take the patient.

814
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,568
But that might be a bit awkward.

815
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:24,404
He's Professor Min's patient now
after all.

816
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:26,114
My mom wants to talk to you.

817
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:28,283
Hello, Mother. It's Ik-jun, your stepson,

818
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:30,702
who's cheerful and bubbly
unlike your biological son.

819
00:40:30,785 --> 00:40:32,203
-Yes.
-Right?

820
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:35,081
My gosh. How am I going
to take the surgery from him?

821
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,708
I would just tell him.

822
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,960
-Of course, you would.
-Yes.

823
00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:41,087
If that's a better option
for the patient, I ought to.

824
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,131
"I can perform that surgery
better than you.

825
00:40:43,214 --> 00:40:44,882
And it's better for the patient."

826
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:46,509
I'd tell him exactly that.

827
00:40:47,093 --> 00:40:50,513
I couldn't do it. Every doctor
has their methods and stories.

828
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:52,140
It's crossing the line.

829
00:40:52,223 --> 00:40:54,475
No, it is not. We must stick to the facts.

830
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:56,561
If you're so inclined to stick to facts,

831
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:59,272
why didn't you tell me the fact
that my ex was cheating on me?

832
00:40:59,355 --> 00:41:01,482
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

833
00:41:02,108 --> 00:41:03,151
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

834
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:04,360
Okay.

835
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:06,779
Is that so? Okay.

836
00:41:07,822 --> 00:41:09,991
Okay. Thank you.
Anyway, I'll get it checked out.

837
00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:11,492
I know a few clinics.

838
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:15,288
Okay. Thank you. Take care.

839
00:41:16,497 --> 00:41:17,707
-Seok-hyeong.
-Yes?

840
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,460
I don't want your mom to know
about my prostate problems.

841
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:24,714
I told my mom that you're going
to the bathroom too often these days,

842
00:41:24,797 --> 00:41:27,050
due to frequent urination
and urinary retention.

843
00:41:27,133 --> 00:41:29,427
Professor Min's case
is different from your ex's.

844
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,220
He has nothing to do with me.

845
00:41:31,304 --> 00:41:33,056
It's strictly work,
whereas you're a couple.

846
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:34,349
I can't tell you what to do.

847
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:35,850
I never told you to.

848
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:37,894
I'm saying
you should've told me what you saw.

849
00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:39,437
-Could you have done it?
-Yes, totally.

850
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,439
-Liar.
-Hey.

851
00:41:42,106 --> 00:41:43,566
The <i>kalguksu</i> is ready.

852
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,401
Fight later. Let's eat first.

853
00:41:46,652 --> 00:41:51,282
If I saw your girlfriend with another guy,
I'd call you right away.

854
00:41:51,366 --> 00:41:52,950
Goodness, it's easier said than done.

855
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:59,165
I never liked Professor Jang
to begin with.

856
00:41:59,248 --> 00:42:01,250
-Pass me the chili powder.
-Okay.

857
00:42:04,212 --> 00:42:06,381
Excuse me. Can we get another spoon?

858
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,892
Hey, U-ju. Daddy will be home soon.

859
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:19,685
Why are you still up?

860
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:21,437
U-ju is still awake?

861
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,524
Hey, I heard you bought a big-ass TV.

862
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:26,359
I'll see you in your dreams. Bye.

863
00:42:27,902 --> 00:42:29,695
Seok-hyeong's TV is like his girlfriend.

864
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:30,988
It was pretty expensive.

865
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:37,829
I want to see it when we meet up
for our next band practice session.

866
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:40,540
Right, when should we meet up for that?

867
00:42:41,165 --> 00:42:42,417
How about this weekend?

868
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,502
I have surgery booked this weekend.

869
00:42:44,627 --> 00:42:46,170
How many bowls of rice would you like?

870
00:42:46,254 --> 00:42:48,089
-Two?
-Just one.

871
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:50,258
-Two will be too many, right?
-Yes, I'm getting full.

872
00:42:50,466 --> 00:42:52,552
-Just one, please.
-Jeez!

873
00:42:53,344 --> 00:42:55,805
We want five.
Please stir-fry five bowls of rice.

874
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,016
-I knew Jeong-won would get this angry.
-Hey, aren't you full?

875
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:01,269
-Hey, what the--
-He didn't eat much.

876
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:04,397
And us, too. We just started eating.

877
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,692
Guys, no one would eat that fast
even during a war. Why eat so quickly?

878
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:10,736
Okay. Why are you getting so worked up?
Order five servings.

879
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,613
You're so self-centered.

880
00:43:12,697 --> 00:43:15,199
What a weird thing to hear
in the middle of eating <i>kalguksu.</i>

881
00:43:15,283 --> 00:43:16,576
Why don't you try to eat faster?

882
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:19,495
Why don't you try to slow down a little?

883
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:20,413
Hi, Mom.

884
00:43:21,372 --> 00:43:22,582
Oh, fresh kimchi?

885
00:43:22,665 --> 00:43:25,042
Excuse me. I'll take some fresh kimchi
to go as well.

886
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:27,211
Why must I control my pace
when I'm paying for my food?

887
00:43:27,295 --> 00:43:29,672
No, you're not.
The hospital's paying for this.

888
00:43:29,755 --> 00:43:32,592
And it's my dad's hospital.
So strictly speaking, it is my money.

889
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:33,801
Jeez, you petty prick.

890
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:35,928
Fine. I'll pay for what I ate.
How much do I owe you?

891
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:37,805
-Pay me.
-Okay, so how much?

892
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,348
Guys, stop. Enough!

893
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:41,559
Gosh, seriously.

894
00:43:41,642 --> 00:43:43,561
You guys are acting like
you're around U-ju's age.

895
00:43:43,644 --> 00:43:45,688
You're 40. Must you fight over fried rice?

896
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:47,398
Hey, you have no idea what they did to me.

897
00:43:47,482 --> 00:43:49,817
When we had <i>cheonggukjang</i> last time,
I only ate tofu.

898
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:52,361
-These two ate all the beef.
-Jeez.

899
00:43:52,445 --> 00:43:56,365
Okay, I heard you.
Jeez, the things this prick remembers.

900
00:43:56,616 --> 00:43:58,284
So how many bowls of rice?

901
00:43:58,367 --> 00:43:59,827
-Five, please!
-Just two!

902
00:44:01,245 --> 00:44:02,705
Give us 3.5 bowls, please.

903
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:14,175
DID I REALLY HURT YOUR FEELINGS?

904
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:28,022
NO, I UNDERSTAND.
I WAS JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

905
00:44:28,105 --> 00:44:29,649
OKAY

906
00:44:40,576 --> 00:44:43,371
-<i>Hello, Professor.</i>
-You haven't given up yet?

907
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:46,791
<i>Of course not. How could I?</i>
<i>It's important for the patient.</i>

908
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:49,919
<i>Professor, I'm begging you</i>
<i>for the last time.</i>

909
00:44:50,419 --> 00:44:51,671
<i>Please perform the surgery.</i>

910
00:44:51,754 --> 00:44:54,298
I can't.
I'd be overstepping the bounds if I did.

911
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:57,927
Unless the patient requests me.

912
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:02,723
It's getting late,
so don't bring it up today.

913
00:45:03,307 --> 00:45:06,394
Speak with the patient tomorrow morning.

914
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:08,563
Explain the situation well.

915
00:45:16,362 --> 00:45:17,697
How are you feeling?

916
00:45:18,155 --> 00:45:19,907
Well, you know.

917
00:45:20,324 --> 00:45:22,660
-Where's your husband?
-I have my caregiver, so it's fine.

918
00:45:23,578 --> 00:45:26,956
If he were here, he'd just
get on my nerves, so this is better.

919
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,376
I get it, but he needs to sign
the consent for your surgery.

920
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:33,129
-Did you e-mail him?
-Yes, I did.

921
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:37,049
He read it but hasn't replied yet.

922
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:39,927
Who cares about a reply?
He should come here right away.

923
00:45:40,011 --> 00:45:43,514
It takes him two days to just
get out of there. He's in Indonesia.

924
00:45:44,557 --> 00:45:45,683
What was the place called?

925
00:45:46,517 --> 00:45:48,060
I can never remember the name.

926
00:45:48,644 --> 00:45:50,271
He's probably busy cutting down the trees.

927
00:45:51,647 --> 00:45:53,524
Was he around
for your breast cancer surgery?

928
00:45:54,108 --> 00:45:55,818
I never told him. He has no idea.

929
00:45:56,027 --> 00:45:58,362
-Hey.
-Nothing changes even if he knows.

930
00:45:59,697 --> 00:46:02,158
I don't want to think about my husband
and everything else.

931
00:46:06,203 --> 00:46:08,289
I'll just suffer and die alone.

932
00:46:08,914 --> 00:46:10,541
What are you talking about?

933
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:13,753
And what's with the curtains?
Don't you feel stuffy?

934
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:15,921
This ward is filled with elderly ladies.

935
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:18,716
They're all so nosy.

936
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:21,427
A breast cancer patient fascinates them.

937
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,430
I think they want to know whether
one of my breasts is fake or not.

938
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:27,058
They keep looking at me.

939
00:46:28,601 --> 00:46:29,894
That's why I closed the curtains.

940
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,063
Have some rice cake.

941
00:46:33,564 --> 00:46:34,398
No, thanks.

942
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:37,276
Are you fasting right now?

943
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,070
No, I don't want to eat.

944
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:46,410
My gosh, you're here too.

945
00:46:47,078 --> 00:46:48,996
Doctor, try some rice cake.

946
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,706
Sure, I'll try one.

947
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,708
You can urinate
without any problems, right?

948
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:56,253
Yes, of course.
I'm doing great these days.

949
00:46:56,337 --> 00:46:59,924
It's all because you took
such good care of me.

950
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:02,093
-I'm totally fine now.
-I see.

951
00:47:02,677 --> 00:47:06,764
My head used to turn to one side like this
for no reason,

952
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:10,935
and my lips used to twitch
as if someone was trying to pull them.

953
00:47:11,018 --> 00:47:14,730
-Like this. It used to twitch like this.
-Right, I see.

954
00:47:14,814 --> 00:47:17,900
You should still take it easy.
And make sure you eat well.

955
00:47:17,983 --> 00:47:19,610
-I will.
-See you.

956
00:47:28,703 --> 00:47:29,745
-Chi-hong.
-Yes.

957
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:31,122
Go get ready for the surgery.

958
00:47:31,372 --> 00:47:33,916
I'll take care of the positioning.
Just set up the Wilson frame.

959
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:35,710
-Call me when everything's ready.
-Will do.

960
00:47:40,256 --> 00:47:41,716
Thank you, Doctor.

961
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:46,887
Gosh, you're really not understanding
what I'm trying to say.

962
00:47:47,638 --> 00:47:51,559
Your tumor is located behind your nose,
near the center of the brain,

963
00:47:51,642 --> 00:47:53,269
which isn't ideal at all.

964
00:47:53,853 --> 00:47:56,439
It'd be dangerous to open the skull
to get to the cranial base,

965
00:47:56,522 --> 00:47:57,898
so we'll do a procedure called TSA,

966
00:47:57,982 --> 00:48:00,401
where an endoscope is inserted
in the nose to remove the tumor,

967
00:48:00,484 --> 00:48:03,362
but Professor Min Gi-jun
does not specialize in that surgery.

968
00:48:03,946 --> 00:48:07,575
Dr. Min said it won't be
such a dangerous procedure.

969
00:48:07,825 --> 00:48:08,951
He told me to trust him.

970
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:12,830
I just like Dr. Min.

971
00:48:13,414 --> 00:48:14,582
I want to stick with him.

972
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,668
It's your life that's on the line.

973
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,549
I'd never suggest you do
something that is bad for you.

974
00:48:24,175 --> 00:48:28,262
I've explained it to you multiple times.
What can I do if you just don't get it?

975
00:48:28,846 --> 00:48:30,431
Please just do as I say, okay?

976
00:48:31,098 --> 00:48:33,017
Just do as you're told
if you don't know anything.

977
00:48:33,684 --> 00:48:35,311
Your guardian doesn't get it either.

978
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:38,397
I've already put it
in layman's terms for you.

979
00:48:48,073 --> 00:48:50,117
-Hey.
-<i>Professor, we're ready.</i>

980
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:51,952
Okay.

981
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,834
PROFESSOR OF NEUROSURGERY

982
00:49:08,093 --> 00:49:10,971
Aren't you performing
occipital lobe surgery today?

983
00:49:11,055 --> 00:49:12,807
Yes, I have to go to the OR now.

984
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,726
Gosh, you'll probably be done
tomorrow morning.

985
00:49:16,644 --> 00:49:17,978
Anyway, what brought you here?

986
00:49:18,813 --> 00:49:21,649
Sir, about the patient Gong Hyeong-u...

987
00:49:22,274 --> 00:49:24,068
Jeez, these punks...

988
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:25,736
I'll assist you.

989
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,783
I still don't feel confident
with the TSA surgery.

990
00:49:31,992 --> 00:49:34,662
I'd love the opportunity
to learn from you.

991
00:49:43,879 --> 00:49:45,089
Thank you. I have to go.

992
00:49:46,674 --> 00:49:48,342
Hey, I'm on my way now.

993
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,221
Professor Chae
got the patient's permission,

994
00:49:52,304 --> 00:49:54,431
-so you should thank her later.
-Okay.

995
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:59,812
The surgery is for a skull base tumor,
so it'll take 10 to 13 hours.

996
00:49:59,895 --> 00:50:02,231
You can observe the beginning
and just go home.

997
00:50:02,356 --> 00:50:03,732
It can take up to 13 hours?

998
00:50:03,816 --> 00:50:05,568
Most neurosurgery procedures
take many hours.

999
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:07,736
The skull base surgery
especially takes a long time.

1000
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,697
It takes an hour
just to position the patient.

1001
00:50:10,489 --> 00:50:12,032
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1002
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,785
The earliest I'll be done is 6 a.m.

1003
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:17,329
Call Anesthesiology
and ask them to push Gong by an hour.

1004
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:19,832
You go in first and drape the patient.

1005
00:50:19,915 --> 00:50:22,626
-And call the ENT professor.
-<i>Professor, I love you--</i>

1006
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:36,223
They're still positioning the patient.

1007
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:39,184
Let's wait for a few minutes. Follow me.

1008
00:50:39,602 --> 00:50:40,686
-Okay.
-Okay.

1009
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:42,271
Let's go.

1010
00:50:51,697 --> 00:50:54,450
Yun-bok, why did you decide
to go to med school?

1011
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:56,201
Did you get good grades like I did?

1012
00:50:56,285 --> 00:50:57,953
-Thank you for this.
-Thank you.

1013
00:50:58,412 --> 00:51:00,789
My mom had major surgery ten years ago,

1014
00:51:00,873 --> 00:51:03,584
and I was so inspired by her doctor
back then.

1015
00:51:04,126 --> 00:51:05,210
What? Seriously?

1016
00:51:05,294 --> 00:51:09,673
Yes, my mom was very ill
when I was in seventh grade.

1017
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:12,176
Her surgery took over ten hours.

1018
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:14,720
They kept her in the ICU
for a week after the surgery...

1019
00:51:15,304 --> 00:51:17,056
but she never woke up. She passed away.

1020
00:51:17,765 --> 00:51:20,142
-Gosh, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1021
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:23,228
Looking back now,

1022
00:51:23,312 --> 00:51:26,273
I think she was either an intern
or a resident.

1023
00:51:26,857 --> 00:51:30,235
But back then, I thought
everyone in the white coat was a doctor.

1024
00:51:30,945 --> 00:51:33,280
The doctor bawled her eyes out

1025
00:51:33,364 --> 00:51:35,908
and apologized to me
for not being able to save my mom.

1026
00:51:37,368 --> 00:51:39,620
I was only a seventh grader,
but I still knew

1027
00:51:39,954 --> 00:51:41,789
that my mom was in
a very serious condition.

1028
00:51:41,872 --> 00:51:45,042
And all the doctors in the ICU
worked so hard to save her.

1029
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:47,336
I saw it with my own two eyes.

1030
00:51:48,629 --> 00:51:51,006
I was actually
pretty calm about it at first.

1031
00:51:51,215 --> 00:51:53,092
I was okay

1032
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:57,221
until an old doctor came
and told me that my mom passed away.

1033
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:01,850
But that doctor started bawling
as soon as she saw us.

1034
00:52:02,726 --> 00:52:03,978
And she apologized.

1035
00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:09,608
"Your mom will watch over you from heaven,
so grow into a wonderful woman."

1036
00:52:09,692 --> 00:52:12,945
Then she said she'd be a better doctor.

1037
00:52:13,404 --> 00:52:15,823
She said that in tears
to a seventh grader.

1038
00:52:17,074 --> 00:52:20,786
That's when it really hit us,
both me and Hong-do.

1039
00:52:23,622 --> 00:52:25,416
"We don't have a mom anymore.

1040
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,586
Everyone else has a mom, but we don't."

1041
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,673
I cried my eyes out.

1042
00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:35,843
But what do you mean by "we"?

1043
00:52:38,846 --> 00:52:42,558
Hong-do and I are twins.

1044
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:48,022
Hey, don't cry.

1045
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:51,275
He still cries his eyes out
whenever we talk about Mom.

1046
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:53,694
You should've told me.
Why didn't you tell me?

1047
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:55,446
It's fun to keep it a secret.

1048
00:52:55,946 --> 00:52:59,450
All our teachers and friends
asked us about it all the time,

1049
00:52:59,533 --> 00:53:02,828
which felt like such a hassle.
So we've decided to just have fun.

1050
00:53:03,495 --> 00:53:05,706
Please don't tell anyone. Sorry.

1051
00:53:06,707 --> 00:53:07,833
We're sorry.

1052
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:11,211
I won't tell anyone for the time being.

1053
00:53:12,087 --> 00:53:14,673
Yun-bok, do you know the doctor's name?

1054
00:53:15,007 --> 00:53:17,009
You should find her.
She'd be happy to see you.

1055
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:18,927
And tell her
that you're now a doctor, too.

1056
00:53:19,595 --> 00:53:22,222
-I don't know her name.
-Do you remember her face?

1057
00:53:22,806 --> 00:53:25,059
No, barely.

1058
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:27,895
Her shoes are the only thing we remember.

1059
00:53:27,978 --> 00:53:29,021
Shoes?

1060
00:53:29,104 --> 00:53:31,774
Yes, our eyes were glued to the floor
because we kept crying.

1061
00:53:31,857 --> 00:53:34,359
I think the doctor was wearing
a new pair of shoes that day,

1062
00:53:34,443 --> 00:53:37,071
but she forgot to take off
the size sticker because she was too busy.

1063
00:53:38,197 --> 00:53:41,408
It was 225 mm. That's all I remember.

1064
00:53:41,492 --> 00:53:43,577
Gosh, you can't find her with that alone.

1065
00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:46,288
Hey, okay.

1066
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:49,124
-Let's go. They're starting.
-Okay.

1067
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,043
Let's go.

1068
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:54,963
The adhesion is pretty bad, so it'll
take a while to separate the tumor.

1069
00:53:55,214 --> 00:53:56,381
Let's all do our best.

1070
00:54:01,095 --> 00:54:03,639
-Vitals?
-The BP is 120.

1071
00:54:03,722 --> 00:54:06,266
The heart rate is stable,
hovering between 70 and 80.

1072
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,267
Good.

1073
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,902
Professor, the med students are here
to observe.

1074
00:54:16,985 --> 00:54:19,446
Okay, tell them to come closer.

1075
00:54:21,406 --> 00:54:22,533
You may come closer.

1076
00:54:23,117 --> 00:54:24,076
Thank you.

1077
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:25,410
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1078
00:54:26,245 --> 00:54:27,913
Please stay out of this line.

1079
00:54:27,996 --> 00:54:29,915
And be careful
not to bump into the equipment.

1080
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,208
-Okay.
-Okay.

1081
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,210
Observe carefully.

1082
00:54:33,585 --> 00:54:35,963
And don't hesitate to ask me
if you have any questions.

1083
00:54:36,672 --> 00:54:37,548
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1084
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:42,636
This way, more of them
will apply to Neurosurgery.

1085
00:54:46,682 --> 00:54:48,976
-It's for a skull base tumor, right?
-Yes.

1086
00:54:49,143 --> 00:54:50,686
How long do you think it'll take?

1087
00:54:51,395 --> 00:54:54,940
Since our ace Professor Chae is doing it,

1088
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,819
-I think it'll take about 13 hours.
-That's very fast.

1090
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:07,619
Hello, everyone.

1091
00:55:09,913 --> 00:55:11,039
I'm doing this alone again,

1092
00:55:11,123 --> 00:55:15,085
but a competent fellow is here
to assist me.

1093
00:55:15,502 --> 00:55:16,712
What's that word?

1094
00:55:17,504 --> 00:55:19,548
Right, "honor." I'm honored.

1095
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:23,427
Seriously, thanks.
You're the best, Dr. Jong.

1096
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:28,807
Treat yourself to some expensive pastries
when we're done.

1097
00:55:31,977 --> 00:55:35,856
Let's save another precious life today.

1098
00:55:35,939 --> 00:55:36,899
-Okay.
-Okay.

1099
00:55:36,982 --> 00:55:38,692
Let's begin. Scalpel.

1100
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:41,653
PROFESSOR KIM JUN-WAN

1101
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:43,530
Mr. No Jin-hyeok!

1102
00:55:44,364 --> 00:55:45,699
No Jin-hyeok?

1103
00:55:45,782 --> 00:55:47,534
He had surgery in 2015.

1104
00:55:48,535 --> 00:55:49,912
What? Why is he back?

1105
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:53,081
Isn't he the college student who got
the ASD surgery from me four years ago?

1106
00:55:53,165 --> 00:55:55,834
Yes, the one you treated
at Kangwoon Medical Center.

1107
00:55:57,502 --> 00:55:59,296
He looks like a different person
in a suit.

1108
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,632
What's going on? I'm worried.

1109
00:56:02,216 --> 00:56:03,175
Anyway, let him in.

1110
00:56:08,388 --> 00:56:11,141
CREDIT CARD APPLICATION

1111
00:56:12,142 --> 00:56:13,268
Doctor.

1112
00:56:14,478 --> 00:56:16,605
You fixed the hole in my heart.

1113
00:56:18,649 --> 00:56:19,775
Please help me out...

1114
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:23,737
just once more.

1115
00:56:26,865 --> 00:56:32,037
KIM JUN-WAN

1116
00:56:34,414 --> 00:56:35,540
Thank you!

1117
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:39,878
Thank you.

1118
00:56:52,432 --> 00:56:53,517
I hope all goes well.

1119
00:56:57,813 --> 00:57:01,858
You see, I just want to be able to buy
clothes for my baby in advance.

1120
00:57:02,567 --> 00:57:07,072
Will my baby become BTS or Blackpink?

1121
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,243
Sharp.

1122
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:14,413
Pardon me? Who?

1123
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:16,123
Let's say Sharp.

1124
00:57:16,832 --> 00:57:18,709
Sharp? Who's that?

1125
00:57:18,792 --> 00:57:20,460
Oh, you don't know Sharp.

1126
00:57:20,544 --> 00:57:21,586
Then...

1127
00:57:22,587 --> 00:57:23,463
How about ZAM?

1128
00:57:25,048 --> 00:57:27,926
Let's say Akdong Musician, AKMU.

1129
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:30,971
All right.

1130
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:35,058
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1131
00:57:38,812 --> 00:57:41,106
Hey, shall we pick up something
on the way?

1132
00:57:41,606 --> 00:57:43,191
Let's just order in. It's a hassle.

SURGERY DURATION

1134
00:57:58,749 --> 00:58:01,585
-I hope all goes well.
-Thanks, bye. Get some rest.

1135
00:58:07,674 --> 00:58:09,676
A cold cup of iced Americano, please.

1136
00:58:10,344 --> 00:58:12,554
I'd like a warm cup of hot latte.

1137
00:58:13,847 --> 00:58:14,931
Pay for mine, please.

SURGERY DURATION

1139
00:58:21,355 --> 00:58:22,481
We're done.

1140
00:58:24,983 --> 00:58:26,401
It went well, right?

1141
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:28,111
Excellent work, Professor Chae.

1142
00:58:28,904 --> 00:58:30,238
You, too.

1143
00:58:31,323 --> 00:58:32,574
Wrap it up for me.

1144
00:58:40,874 --> 00:58:42,417
You guys are still here?

1145
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:43,835
-Yes.
-Yes.

1146
00:58:43,919 --> 00:58:45,545
-Gosh.
-I told you several times

1147
00:58:45,629 --> 00:58:48,632
that you could leave and go home.
I'm impressed.

1148
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:52,052
-What's your name?
-I'm Jang Yun-bok.

1149
00:58:52,135 --> 00:58:53,303
I'm Jang Hong-do.

1150
00:58:54,304 --> 00:58:56,556
-What's your relationship?
-We're twins.

1151
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,141
Fraternal twins.

1152
00:58:59,142 --> 00:59:01,978
-Professor.
-Yes?

1153
00:59:02,562 --> 00:59:03,688
By any chance...

1154
00:59:08,443 --> 00:59:10,404
Do you go to Myeongjin Church
in Sanggye-dong?

1155
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:12,239
I do.

1156
00:59:12,322 --> 00:59:14,449
You're the <i>prima donna</i>
of the choir, right?

1157
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:17,077
-I'm known as the <i>prima donna?</i>
-Yes.

1158
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,662
We're in the church band.

1159
00:59:18,745 --> 00:59:21,248
You're so famous.

1160
00:59:21,331 --> 00:59:22,582
What's she famous for?

1161
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:25,127
She dances so passionately
while singing hymns.

1162
00:59:25,669 --> 00:59:27,796
People say it's because
she's stressed out from work--

1163
00:59:27,879 --> 00:59:30,966
Get going, guys. Go home.
It's time to go home.

1164
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:32,759
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

1165
00:59:33,427 --> 00:59:35,429
-Take care.
-Take care.

1166
00:59:45,188 --> 00:59:46,106
Well done, Professor.

1167
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:50,152
And I'm sorry. You have to operate
on two patients in a row because of me.

1168
00:59:51,278 --> 00:59:52,737
I'm really sorry.

1169
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:55,115
No worries. I have some time
before the next one.

1170
00:59:55,532 --> 00:59:57,075
We're getting ready for the surgery.

1171
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:59,995
Professor Min said he'll come down
when we're ready.

1172
01:00:00,704 --> 01:00:04,416
I'll call you when we start
working on the sphenoid sinus.

1173
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,334
You should get some sleep.

1174
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,464
-Seok-min.
-Yes.

1175
01:00:10,797 --> 01:00:12,883
Before you go into the OR,

1176
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:14,926
you should go apologize to him.

1177
01:00:19,055 --> 01:00:20,390
Go apologize to him first.

1178
01:00:23,435 --> 01:00:24,394
Okay.

1179
01:00:24,769 --> 01:00:28,148
I'll go upstairs right now
and apologize to Professor Min.

1180
01:00:28,231 --> 01:00:29,399
Not Professor Min.

1181
01:00:30,442 --> 01:00:32,110
Go apologize to the patient...

1182
01:00:34,529 --> 01:00:36,156
or I won't let you into the OR.

1183
01:00:41,286 --> 01:00:42,120
Okay.

1184
01:01:12,025 --> 01:01:13,068
I'm sorry.

1185
01:01:15,403 --> 01:01:17,239
I sincerely apologize.

1186
01:01:49,854 --> 01:01:51,064
I hope the rest goes well.

1187
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:56,903
The tumor's been removed,

1188
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,115
and it looks like we managed
to preserve the pituitary stalk as well.

1189
01:02:00,323 --> 01:02:01,408
Seok-min.

1190
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:04,119
Come here.

1191
01:02:04,703 --> 01:02:05,745
Yes.

1192
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:09,291
-Dr. Yong.
-Yes, Professor Chae.

1193
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:11,710
Do not talk like that.

1194
01:02:13,336 --> 01:02:14,170
Okay.

1195
01:02:14,254 --> 01:02:16,256
Wasn't it because of your thesis?

1196
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,427
Why did you talk like it was
for the patient?

1197
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,642
If you talk to any patient
in that tone again,

1198
01:02:28,393 --> 01:02:29,603
I will not forgive you.

1199
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:33,231
-Okay.
-Do you understand?

1200
01:02:35,817 --> 01:02:39,029
Yes, understood. I'm sorry.

1201
01:02:46,453 --> 01:02:48,121
Why isn't Seok-hyeong answering his phone?

1202
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:50,206
Song-hwa, too.

1203
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:52,500
Seok-hyeong is seeing outpatients,

1204
01:02:52,584 --> 01:02:53,877
and Song-hwa has surgery.

1205
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,212
Gosh, Chae Song-hwa. She's amazing.

1206
01:02:56,296 --> 01:02:59,633
That's right.
She's not like you lazy-ass quacks.

1207
01:02:59,716 --> 01:03:01,509
Ik-jun and I don't belong
to the same category.

1208
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,428
You sure do.

1209
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:06,723
You can't trust rich people.
They lie all the time.

1210
01:03:06,806 --> 01:03:10,852
He's not rich. He's dirt poor.
He still lives at your place.

1211
01:03:10,935 --> 01:03:12,687
-You promised me my own office.
-Prick.

1212
01:03:12,771 --> 01:03:14,356
-Prick.
-Total prick.

1213
01:03:15,315 --> 01:03:17,317
Hey, my office mate is a pro gamer.

1214
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,319
Professor Ban plays FreeCell all day.

1215
01:03:20,111 --> 01:03:21,738
Actually, forget it.

1216
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:24,282
Seok-hyeong has the worst one.

1217
01:03:24,741 --> 01:03:25,825
Have you seen his office?

1218
01:03:45,345 --> 01:03:47,305
Professor Ban plays FreeCell
all day anyway.

1219
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:49,224
He's practically invisible,

1220
01:03:49,307 --> 01:03:51,226
so you do have
the whole office to yourself.

1221
01:03:51,309 --> 01:03:53,687
-I can't believe people call him Buddha.
-What about me?

1222
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:56,856
Hey, you and I are like soul mates.

1223
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,025
Soul mates, my ass.

1224
01:04:01,236 --> 01:04:02,320
Hey, what's up?

1225
01:04:03,697 --> 01:04:04,906
What's the systolic pressure?

1226
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:07,367
What about norepinephrine?

1227
01:04:07,575 --> 01:04:08,827
Use vasopressin.

1228
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:11,579
If you still can't get it back up,
call me. I'll come right away.

1229
01:04:11,663 --> 01:04:13,498
Good for you. You have a resident.

1230
01:04:14,207 --> 01:04:15,291
You guys do, too.

1231
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:18,086
Right, I do. Dr. Long Winter.

1232
01:04:19,754 --> 01:04:22,966
When will I get to work
with the high and lofty Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul?

1233
01:04:23,842 --> 01:04:26,302
You've never worked with Dr. Jang, right?

1234
01:04:27,846 --> 01:04:29,055
You have?

1235
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:32,559
Yes, I've dealt with her a few times as
there have been many emergency cases.

1236
01:04:33,351 --> 01:04:35,395
-She's not my cup of tea.
-Really?

1237
01:04:37,272 --> 01:04:40,024
She seems like the quiet type,
but she's hardworking.

1238
01:04:43,653 --> 01:04:44,881
What's wrong with the patient?

1239
01:04:48,502 --> 01:04:49,920
What's wrong with the patient?

1240
01:04:50,546 --> 01:04:52,465
He's a homeless man,
found at a construction site,

1241
01:04:52,548 --> 01:04:54,008
and got frostbite.

1242
01:04:55,342 --> 01:04:56,677
His leg is rotting.

1243
01:04:57,762 --> 01:04:59,221
119 RESCUE SERVICES

1244
01:05:00,765 --> 01:05:02,850
I have to take your temperature.
Hold on, please.

1245
01:05:15,321 --> 01:05:16,363
Hui-su.

1246
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:21,535
Stay still, please.

1247
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:26,999
Of course, she's hardworking.
Every resident works hard.

1248
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:28,626
Jeong-won.

1249
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,295
Oh, everyone's here.

1250
01:05:32,379 --> 01:05:33,631
What's up?

1251
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:35,424
Do you know Daddy-Long-Legs?

1252
01:05:36,175 --> 01:05:37,343
What?

1253
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:39,720
-Not sure.
-You don't know?

1254
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:41,931
He's famous at the hospital
you used to work at.

1255
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:43,933
Really?

1256
01:05:44,016 --> 01:05:45,643
What about him?

1257
01:05:45,726 --> 01:05:48,896
Oh, my friend who's a TV show director
wants to interview him.

1258
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:49,897
No, thanks.

1259
01:05:50,481 --> 01:05:52,525
What? What do you mean?
Who are you to say no?

1260
01:05:54,068 --> 01:05:55,486
I mean, he'll say no.

1261
01:05:55,569 --> 01:05:57,238
You said you didn't know him.

1262
01:05:57,321 --> 01:06:00,324
Well, I do know him.
Anyway, he won't do it. No way.

1263
01:06:00,407 --> 01:06:01,534
All right.

1264
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,702
Hey.

1265
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,871
Yes.

1266
01:06:07,623 --> 01:06:09,041
Really? I'll be right there.

1267
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:12,336
Wait, call Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul as well
just in case.

1268
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:14,505
What's going on?

1269
01:06:15,131 --> 01:06:16,423
It was Dr. Bae.

1270
01:06:16,507 --> 01:06:19,760
A homeless man just came in
with a severely frostbitten leg.

1271
01:06:19,844 --> 01:06:22,263
He stayed at a construction site
with that leg for months.

1272
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:25,057
The leg is rotting
due to edema caused by frostbite.

1273
01:06:25,141 --> 01:06:26,433
But the leg is totally...

1274
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:28,185
What?

1275
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:30,187
Apparently, it's covered with maggots.

1276
01:06:36,152 --> 01:06:37,319
What do we do?

1277
01:06:37,987 --> 01:06:39,446
How will we take them off his leg?

1278
01:06:42,658 --> 01:06:43,909
You're here.

1279
01:06:46,078 --> 01:06:47,621
He got injured at a construction site.

1280
01:06:47,705 --> 01:06:50,791
The skin started rotting due to frostbite.
It's infested with maggots now.

1281
01:06:52,334 --> 01:06:54,128
I've never seen so many maggots.

1282
01:06:55,171 --> 01:06:58,090
We have to remove them
to be able to disinfect the skin.

1283
01:06:58,465 --> 01:07:00,676
-Where's the suction unit?
-I'll go find it.

1284
01:07:11,854 --> 01:07:14,481
Dr. Bae, let's use tweezers...

1285
01:07:28,746 --> 01:07:30,289
She's quite something.

1286
01:07:37,755 --> 01:07:39,840
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1287
01:07:42,468 --> 01:07:44,720
-You're staying late?
-Yes.

1288
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:49,516
My high school friend's surgery
for her metastatic tumor is tomorrow.

1289
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,060
I want to read up on it.

1290
01:07:53,812 --> 01:07:54,897
Get going.

1291
01:07:55,648 --> 01:07:56,607
Bye.

1292
01:07:57,399 --> 01:07:58,692
Take it easy.

1293
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:00,694
All right.

1294
01:08:02,529 --> 01:08:04,240
Is the day shift better
than the night shift?

1295
01:08:04,323 --> 01:08:06,116
No, the night shift is better.

1296
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,453
Seok-min, do we have the consent
for Gal Ba-ram's surgery?

1297
01:08:09,536 --> 01:08:12,373
-Your high school friend, right?
-Yes.

1298
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:14,208
No, her husband is not here yet.

1299
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,876
The surgery's tomorrow. What do we do?

1300
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:38,524
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

1301
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:43,195
Are you that fascinated by me?

1302
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:45,614
What?

1303
01:08:45,698 --> 01:08:48,659
It must be fascinating
to see a woman with a fake breast.

1304
01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:52,788
No, I don't think that way.

1305
01:08:53,372 --> 01:08:55,374
How could you say that?

1306
01:08:58,002 --> 01:08:59,878
But you're always peeping at me.

1307
01:09:01,505 --> 01:09:02,965
Am I a monkey in the zoo or what?

1308
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:04,758
Is it fun for you?

1309
01:09:10,055 --> 01:09:11,473
It's because you're pretty.

1310
01:09:17,604 --> 01:09:20,024
I think you're very pretty.

1311
01:09:23,652 --> 01:09:25,696
But I only have one breast.

1312
01:09:27,031 --> 01:09:28,574
I'm not pretty at all.

1313
01:09:28,657 --> 01:09:30,409
You're still pretty.

1314
01:09:31,076 --> 01:09:32,619
Like a beautiful flower.

1315
01:09:33,787 --> 01:09:35,456
Who cares about only having one breast?

1316
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:38,042
You're beautiful because you're young.

1317
01:09:38,334 --> 01:09:39,626
She's right.

1318
01:09:40,002 --> 01:09:43,797
As for old people like us, even if
we get surgery and walk out of here

1319
01:09:43,881 --> 01:09:45,466
feeling completely healthy,

1320
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:47,509
we'll never look pretty.

1321
01:09:47,593 --> 01:09:49,011
That's right.

1322
01:09:49,345 --> 01:09:52,348
I'd gladly lose both my breasts

1323
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:54,433
if I could go back to 20 years ago

1324
01:09:54,516 --> 01:09:57,811
and look as young as you do.

1325
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:00,731
No, don't say that.

1326
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:02,941
I'm not young.

1327
01:10:03,484 --> 01:10:04,610
You are young.

1328
01:10:04,985 --> 01:10:08,739
If I were your age,
I'd divorce my husband.

1329
01:10:08,822 --> 01:10:12,242
I'd just travel the world
and do everything I want to do

1330
01:10:12,743 --> 01:10:14,661
while living my life to the fullest.

1331
01:10:16,747 --> 01:10:20,167
Gosh, I'm just way too old for that now.

1332
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:23,587
My legs hurt, and I can't see well.

1333
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:25,005
Even my head hurts.

1334
01:10:29,968 --> 01:10:33,597
My gosh, you look even prettier
when you smile.

1335
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,310
Everyone who is young looks so beautiful.

1336
01:10:39,019 --> 01:10:41,897
When you're that young,
you just naturally radiate beauty.

1337
01:10:51,698 --> 01:10:52,699
Honey...

1338
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:57,621
Honey.

1339
01:10:58,789 --> 01:11:01,333
-Honey.
-Honey...

1340
01:11:03,544 --> 01:11:05,212
Honey, what do I do?

1341
01:11:06,588 --> 01:11:09,133
What if I die?

1342
01:11:10,217 --> 01:11:14,138
What do I do? I don't want to die.

1343
01:11:15,097 --> 01:11:17,599
You won't. You won't die, honey.

1344
01:11:17,683 --> 01:11:20,853
I will...
I absolutely won't let that happen.

1345
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:25,065
I'm sorry, honey. I'm so sorry.

1346
01:11:25,149 --> 01:11:26,650
I'm really sorry.

1347
01:11:28,527 --> 01:11:30,028
Honey, I'm sorry.

1348
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:44,084
Are you envious?

1349
01:11:45,169 --> 01:11:47,337
-You should date.
-I'm sorry, honey.

1350
01:11:47,421 --> 01:11:49,798
No, I don't want to. I like being single.

1351
01:11:51,758 --> 01:11:54,761
Her husband is here,
so we can have him sign the consent.

1352
01:11:54,845 --> 01:11:56,096
Okay.

1353
01:11:56,555 --> 01:11:59,766
Later, not now. Goodness.

1354
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:07,983
FUNERAL NOTICE
FOR THE DEATH OF JU JONG-SU'S WIFE

1355
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:10,194
We go to funerals fairly often these days.

1356
01:12:10,277 --> 01:12:13,113
It means that we're at that age now.

1357
01:12:13,489 --> 01:12:14,573
Mr. Ju...

1358
01:12:14,656 --> 01:12:17,784
I mean, Director Ju.
He must be devastated.

1359
01:12:17,868 --> 01:12:20,287
-They had a happy marriage, right?
-Yes, a very happy one.

1360
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,789
I heard he didn't leave his wife alone
even for a minute

1361
01:12:22,915 --> 01:12:25,000
for two to three weeks before her death.

1362
01:12:26,168 --> 01:12:29,421
FUNERAL HOME

1363
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:35,719
All of you must be busy.
You should get back to work.

1364
01:12:36,011 --> 01:12:37,888
No, it's okay.
Did you get some sleep, sir?

1365
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:40,224
He didn't.
He's been greeting the guests all day.

1366
01:12:40,307 --> 01:12:43,393
I dragged him here.
Jong-su, you need to eat something.

1367
01:12:43,477 --> 01:12:46,230
I'm fine. I can't really eat anything
right now.

1368
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,899
Let me know if there's anything you need.

1369
01:12:49,525 --> 01:12:50,609
Are you not drinking?

1370
01:12:50,692 --> 01:12:53,529
No, we're good. Don't worry about us, sir.

1371
01:12:53,612 --> 01:12:57,074
You saw Jeong-won many times
when he was little. Just talk casually.

1372
01:12:57,157 --> 01:12:59,076
Exactly. Please talk casually to me, sir.

1373
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:01,286
Gosh, how could I?

1374
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,997
Our hospital can stay afloat
thanks to these doctors here.

1375
01:13:04,081 --> 01:13:05,749
Maybe at the hospital,

1376
01:13:05,832 --> 01:13:09,169
but you're his mom's friend here,
so please talk casually.

1377
01:13:09,253 --> 01:13:10,754
It'll make us more comfortable.

1378
01:13:13,715 --> 01:13:15,592
-Shall I?
-Yes, please.

1379
01:13:17,261 --> 01:13:21,807
So the five of you are best friends?

1380
01:13:22,099 --> 01:13:23,892
Yes, we went to school together.

1381
01:13:23,976 --> 01:13:27,062
We were all in different classes
but somehow ended up becoming friends.

1382
01:13:27,145 --> 01:13:30,023
-My gosh, how adorable.
-Adorable, my foot.

1383
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:33,860
They're all still single because they want
their parents to worry about them.

1384
01:13:33,944 --> 01:13:36,154
-I'm divorced.
-And I'm married.

1385
01:13:36,363 --> 01:13:37,864
Okay, I like you two.

1386
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,495
You're all good-looking.
How did nothing happen between you guys?

1387
01:13:44,913 --> 01:13:46,081
Pardon?

1388
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:50,419
Why would you do that?

1389
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:54,172
Why disturb the calm water?

1390
01:13:55,882 --> 01:13:56,967
Did I?

1391
01:13:57,884 --> 01:13:59,886
Oh, romance?

1392
01:14:00,596 --> 01:14:01,597
Has there been any?

1393
01:14:06,852 --> 01:14:08,979
I told Song-hwa I had feelings for her
but got rejected.

1394
01:14:10,272 --> 01:14:11,440
Seriously?

1395
01:14:12,024 --> 01:14:13,233
-When?
-When?

1396
01:14:13,317 --> 01:14:14,818
I don't even remember yesterday.

1397
01:14:14,901 --> 01:14:16,653
On her birthday in our freshman year.

1398
01:14:16,737 --> 01:14:18,989
I told her I had feelings for her
only to be rejected.

1399
01:14:19,573 --> 01:14:21,783
-How did she reject you?
-She said she liked someone else.

1400
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:25,662
Gosh, that's such a cookie-cutter answer.

1401
01:14:25,746 --> 01:14:28,165
We hear that all the time.
"I like someone else."

1402
01:14:28,874 --> 01:14:31,710
-No, I really did.
-It was like that back in my day too.

1403
01:14:31,793 --> 01:14:34,630
It's hard to say to the person's face
that you just don't like him.

1404
01:14:34,713 --> 01:14:36,632
-That's right.
-Totally.

1405
01:14:36,715 --> 01:14:38,592
-That's true, but...
-Let's change the topic.

1406
01:14:43,096 --> 01:14:44,139
Hey, I'm sorry.

1407
01:14:44,389 --> 01:14:46,099
No, I mean... Never mind.

1408
01:14:47,309 --> 01:14:50,145
I still want to be friends with you.

1409
01:14:50,687 --> 01:14:53,357
I don't want things to get awkward
between us because of this.

1410
01:14:58,654 --> 01:15:01,615
Come on. Say something.

1411
01:15:02,491 --> 01:15:03,784
I'm okay.

1412
01:15:04,868 --> 01:15:07,621
Song-hwa, I'm sorry for bringing up
such nonsense.

1413
01:15:07,704 --> 01:15:10,457
Gosh, it wasn't nonsense.

1414
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:13,502
Anyway, let's forget about it.

1415
01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:15,212
It's my birthday today, right?

1416
01:15:16,213 --> 01:15:18,715
That's great.
Let's cause some trouble today.

1417
01:15:18,799 --> 01:15:21,593
Hey, let's go. Come on.

1418
01:15:22,094 --> 01:15:24,012
Come on. Hurry.

1419
01:15:27,099 --> 01:15:30,519
Just today, okay? I'll make an exception
because it's your birthday.

1420
01:15:30,602 --> 01:15:31,978
Okay!

1421
01:15:35,607 --> 01:15:40,237
<i>Is it because of the cold weather?</i>

1422
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,825
<i>Why do couples with their arms locked</i>

1423
01:15:44,908 --> 01:15:47,953
<i>Make me teary-eyed?</i>

1424
01:15:48,036 --> 01:15:52,624
<i>Do they remind me of the good old days?</i>

1425
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:57,254
<i>Do I want to meet someone new?</i>

1426
01:15:57,337 --> 01:16:02,509
<i>Or do I just miss my ex?</i>

1427
01:16:05,387 --> 01:16:09,933
<i>If you know someone nice</i>
<i>Set me up with them</i>

1428
01:16:10,517 --> 01:16:14,396
<i>Someone who's like water and fire </i>

1429
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:19,401
<i>Someone who will truly love me, only me</i>

1430
01:16:19,484 --> 01:16:24,865
<i>I want someone who's mature and faithful</i>

1431
01:16:25,365 --> 01:16:29,661
<i>If you know someone nice</i>
<i>Set me up with them</i>

1432
01:16:29,745 --> 01:16:34,124
<i>Even love requires practice</i>

1433
01:16:34,207 --> 01:16:39,379
<i>I want someone caring</i>
<i>Who notices even small details</i>

1434
01:16:39,463 --> 01:16:45,010
<i>Someone with a lot of</i>
<i>Relationship experience</i>

1435
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:49,556
<i>I have wounds and scars</i>

1436
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:55,395
<i>So I don't feel comfortable dating someone</i>
<i>With no past whatsoever</i>

1437
01:16:57,230 --> 01:17:01,902
<i>I want to be consoled in the arms</i>

1438
01:17:01,985 --> 01:17:06,531
<i>Of someone with pretty eyes who has cried</i>

1439
01:17:06,615 --> 01:17:09,618
<i>Because of a breakup at least once</i>

1440
01:17:09,701 --> 01:17:14,247
<i>If only I could lean on the shoulder</i>

1441
01:17:14,331 --> 01:17:18,919
<i>Of someone with beautiful hands</i>

1442
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:24,299
<i>And forget my loneliness</i>

1443
01:17:31,807 --> 01:17:37,521
<i>Someone with beautiful hands</i>

1444
01:17:37,604 --> 01:17:42,317
<i>And forget my loneliness</i>

1445
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,693
MOM

1446
01:17:43,777 --> 01:17:46,613
-Hi, Mom.
-<i>Happy birthday, sweetheart.</i>

1447
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:48,782
Thanks for bringing me into this world.

1448
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:52,869
<i>Had I known it'd be this lovely to have</i>
<i>a daughter, I would've had another one.</i>

1449
01:17:53,161 --> 01:17:55,914
It's not too late. I wouldn't mind
a sibling who's 40 years my junior.

1450
01:17:55,997 --> 01:17:57,791
<i>Your dad's running away.</i>

1451
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:00,752
<i>Get back here. Talk with your daughter.</i>

1452
01:18:00,836 --> 01:18:03,713
Mom, I'm driving now.
I'll call you when I get to the hospital.

1453
01:18:03,797 --> 01:18:04,840
<i>All right.</i>

1454
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:11,888
<i>If you know someone nice</i>
<i>Set me up with them</i>

1455
01:18:13,849 --> 01:18:18,979
<i>I want someone who...</i>

1456
01:18:56,349 --> 01:18:59,394
TWO WEEKS AGO

1457
01:19:15,327 --> 01:19:17,495
-Let's talk outside.
-Let's just talk here.

1458
01:19:19,331 --> 01:19:22,292
Believe me.
It was just that day, only once.

1459
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:25,086
Whether it was just that day or not,
I don't care.

1460
01:19:25,503 --> 01:19:26,880
Just tell Song-hwa.

1461
01:19:29,257 --> 01:19:30,759
I said, tell Song-hwa.

1462
01:19:30,842 --> 01:19:33,345
Whether it's just a fling
or a serious affair,

1463
01:19:33,428 --> 01:19:35,639
she needs to know. Am I wrong?

1464
01:19:36,932 --> 01:19:39,643
Don't make a fool of her. Call her now.

1465
01:19:39,726 --> 01:19:41,144
Okay, I'll sort it out by myself.

1466
01:19:41,227 --> 01:19:43,313
-Shall I tell her for you?
-I said, I'll do it.

1467
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:48,443
You're going overboard.

1468
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:52,989
This is between me and Song-hwa.

1469
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:56,034
Who are you to tell me what to do?

1470
01:19:59,496 --> 01:20:00,830
Do you have feelings for her?

1471
01:20:04,626 --> 01:20:06,878
I know you two are close,

1472
01:20:07,629 --> 01:20:09,089
but this is too much.

1473
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:15,929
-I bet you have no friends.
-I have friends, of course.

1474
01:20:16,012 --> 01:20:17,514
But you're a guy, and she's a girl.

1475
01:20:17,597 --> 01:20:18,807
So what?

1476
01:20:23,687 --> 01:20:25,438
You're so old-fashioned.

1477
01:20:28,608 --> 01:20:30,777
Seriously, Song-hwa is too good for you.

1481
01:21:20,744 --> 01:21:22,912
<i>May is the perfect month for that.</i>

1482

<i>Dr. Jang, who's that? Your boyfriend?</i>

1483

-Yes, it does.

<i>He's not authoritative,</i>

1486
01:21:33,673 --> 01:21:35,091
I like him.

1490

-What?
-What?

1491
01:21:44,851 --> 01:21:46,895
Professor Yang, why didn't you tell us?

1492
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:49,147
About what?

1493
01:21:50,148 --> 01:21:52,358
Professor,
why didn't you answer your phone?

1494
01:21:52,442 --> 01:21:54,861
-Go check in on Ik-jun.
-Why?

1495
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,905
<i>I think something's up,</i>

01:22:02,786 --> 01:22:04,412
<i>He has no feelings.</i>

1499
