00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:05,891
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:09,691
<i>Ik-jun?</i>

3
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:11,276
He went all the way to Inje?

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,028
<i>Yes, he just left.</i>

5
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:15,906
-<i>He even gave me money.</i>
-What's gotten into him?

6
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:17,115
That's so unlike him.

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,201
<i>I almost burst into tears.</i>

8
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:22,537
<i>We never say things like
"thanks" or "sorry"</i>

9
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:24,039
<i>to each other.</i>

10
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:26,792
I know that, of course.
My family is the same way.

11
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:30,504
Oh, boy. I guess he's getting old too.

12
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:33,799
-<i>By the way, have you left yet?</i>
-Yes, just now.

13
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:37,052
I'll call you when I get to the rest stop.
See you soon.

14
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:52,442
Everything looks good.
What should we order?

15
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:55,654
What are you doing?

16
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:57,322
There's a strand of hair on your jacket.

17
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:04,788
Do you have to keep
taking your medication?

18
00:01:04,913 --> 00:01:08,166
Yes, it's a pain reliever.
Just one tablet a day.

19
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:10,544
You're one tough cookie.

20
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:13,046
You've been holding out like this
for years?

21
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,464
But I'm okay now.

22
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:17,426
Like Ik-sun, I have to refrain
from strenuous exercise,

23
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:19,011
but daily activities are fine.

24
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:22,222
The medication is for my chronic pain.

25
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:23,932
The pain isn't too bad though.

26
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:26,184
Hold out for just another year.

27
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:28,478
You've been working hard
to build experience.

28
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:31,356
You should wrap it up well
and pass your board exam.

29
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:33,525
Yes.

30
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,944
I'll stay right by your side, Professor.

31
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:39,740
What do you recommend?

32
00:01:40,323 --> 00:01:42,534
Meat lovers like
our creamy pasta with tenderloin.

33
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:45,120
Those who like oil pasta
usually order the pollack roe pasta.

34
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:46,288
Why must he be so punctual?

35
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:49,541
Over here.

36
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,882
Professor, you've slowed down
your eating pace.

37
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,259
At your old pace,
you'd be eating your dessert now.

38
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:01,428
No, I eat even faster now.

39
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:03,847
I'm trying very hard to pace myself.

40
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:06,975
The food here is good.
And it's nice to eat out for a change.

41
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:11,563
Seok-min, isn't it time for you to
to start studying? The exam is coming up.

42
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:13,231
Yes, I'm going to start from next week.

43
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,777
Professor, what will you do without me?
You'll be so bored.

44
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:19,321
-I'll visit you often.
-Where is the study room?

45
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:21,823
-Can we visit you?
-Hey, it's called a study room.

46
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,825
Why would you visit someone
who has to study?

47
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:26,036
I'll visit you guys. Goodness.

48
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:29,831
My dear Seon-bin. When I'm gone,
you won't have anyone to mess with you.

49
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,291
You'll be so bored.

50
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:32,667
"My dear Seon-bin"?

51
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:35,253
Did you just call her "my dear Seon-bin"?

52
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,881
My dear Ahn Chi-hong.

53
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:40,050
My dear Heo Seon-bin
and my dear Professor Chae.

54
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:43,220
What else... Yes, my dear pasta.

55
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:47,349
Your strong denial seems suspicious.
Are you sure there is nothing?

56
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:49,267
What are you talking about?
Nothing's going on.

57
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:50,894
Professor, shall we order desserts?

58
00:02:50,977 --> 00:02:53,313
My gosh, look at her
trying to change the topic.

59
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,775
Seriously, nothing's going on.
What do you take me for?

60
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:59,569
Hey, what's wrong with me?

61
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:01,905
My dear Dr. Yong, you're such a catch.

62
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:03,532
How dare I even dream of dating you?

63
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:04,699
My dear Dr. Yong.

64
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:08,411
They say that sneezing and love
can't be hidden.

65
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:09,579
You obviously can't hide it.

66
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:11,039
Something must be going on.

67
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,960
Guys, what's wrong with dating?

68
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,463
Professor, are we not allowed
to date our co-workers?

69
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:20,966
Why not? I'm all for it.

70
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:23,802
It's nice if you can rely on each other.

71
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:24,845
Right.

72
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:28,390
Seon-bin and I are seeing each other.

73
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:31,143
Hey, Seon-bin. We're dating, right?

74
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:33,103
We got busted.

75
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:35,689
As if anyone would buy that.

76
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:38,233
Who would believe that?

77
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:44,447
Dr. Yong, what are we supposed to do
in this situation?

78
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:47,200
What do you think?
Let's just order some desserts.

79
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:49,286
Excuse me!

80
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,007
What is this social club called again?
"I Am a <i>Gosu</i>" like master?

81
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:04,467
<i>That's right. I Am a</i> Gosu.

82
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:06,678
<i>I see them at least once a month,</i>

83
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,930
<i>but I can't hold out anymore.</i>

84
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:12,017
<i>They said I must bring you today.
They really want to meet you.</i>

85
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:15,145
<i>We'll just stop by
and have dinner with them, okay?</i>

86
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,063
Don't do this to me, Ik-sun.

87
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:20,150
I guess you really want to see
the end of me.

88
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:24,696
<i>No. They're all nice people.
They're so naive and innocent.</i>

89
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,616
But I'm sure they're all
fourth or fifth-degree holders.

90
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:30,452
Ik-sun. Even for taekwondo,
I'm only an orange belt in rank.

91
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm on the same level as U-ju.

92
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:37,167
Okay. We'll go together.

93
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,960
I have to go
if my girlfriend wants me to go.

94
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:46,801
What is this?

95
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:49,554
Is this another thing you don't eat?

96
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:05,862
-Hello.
-Hello.

97
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:07,155
Hello.

98
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:10,033
Hello, Professor Kim.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

99
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:12,285
The pleasure is mine.
Thank you for inviting me.

100
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,079
This is Captain Hong, the troublemaker.

101
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:18,208
I totally turned over a new leaf
after that day.

102
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,419
That night,
Major Lee kicked me in the shin nonstop--

103
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:22,587
-Well--
-Hey!

104
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,968
Oh, I have something for you.

105
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:31,930
Please accept this gift
as a token of apology.

106
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:34,808
What is this?

107
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:36,643
It's <i>gosu</i>. Cilantro.

108
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:50,865
Oh, my.

109
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:53,118
Look at you.

110
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:55,370
Here.

111
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:58,498
Drink up. Good boy.

112
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:02,335
You said you wanted <i>tonkatsu</i>.
This was what you were actually craving?

113
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:06,506
U-ju, can I have a bite of
the pollack roe mayo sandwich?

114
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:08,258
No, just eat yours.

115
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:15,265
-Do you want a bite of mine?
-I had it yesterday.

116
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:18,768
You were here yesterday? With who?

117
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:20,437
I didn't know.

118
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:23,523
I'm a regular here.

119
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:25,025
"A regular"?

120
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:28,528
Oh, my. You and your fancy vocabulary.

121
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:31,740
-Who did you come here with?
-Mo-ne and my mother-in-law.

122
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:35,744
Your mother-in-law?

123
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,413
-U-ju, do you know what that word means?
-Yes.

124
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,081
A wife's mother.

125
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,548
I brought a genius into this world.

126
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:50,759
Father.

127
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:55,889
I would like another sandwich.

128
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:58,683
But you still have
half of that sandwich left.

129
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,810
Buy me another one, please.

130
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,313
Show me something cute.

131
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:08,485
Oh, my heart...

132
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:21,732
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

133
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:29,464
Then <i>tonkatsu</i>, udon,

134
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,966
rice bowl with fish roe,
and cold soba noodles?

135
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:36,888
The other guys might join us, you know.

136
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:38,848
I didn't say anything.
Go ahead and order them.

137
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:41,393
-Why are you standing there? Come in.
-One second.

138
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:45,647
Were you sleeping?
You sound like you're losing your voice.

139
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:47,857
Do you have a cold?

140
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,778
Do you have a stuffy nose?

141
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:55,115
Be careful, especially during
in-between seasons like now.

142
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:56,491
Did you have lunch?

143
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:01,996
Okay, I'll make sure I eat well.

144
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:04,040
Bye.

145
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,042
Yes, I love you.

146
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:07,502
Jun-wan!

147
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:12,465
-Dude! Can't you knock?
-I knocked, dude!

148
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:14,843
Really? What? What do you want?

149
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:16,177
I didn't knock, you prick.

150
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,971
Why should I knock
to come into your office?

151
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:21,266
Do you have Daddy-Long-Legs' contact
number from Kangwoon Medical Center?

152
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,643
Does he help other hospitals too?

153
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:26,146
Yes, I reached out to him
for help recently.

154
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:29,399
He must have a surplus cash flow now.
He sent money right away.

155
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,025
I just sent you the number.

156
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:33,486
Hyeon Jeong-mi in Social Services
at Kangwoon Medical Center.

157
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,656
Only she can reach him. She'll put you
in touch with Daddy-Long-Legs.

158
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:38,700
-Is it an emergency?
-No.

159
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:40,160
It's for a long-term patient.

160
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:42,787
He's stuck here
because he can't pay the bills.

161
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:44,914
I think he's trying
to take out high-interest loans.

162
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:46,875
He's an old man with no family or friends.

163
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,836
But he owns the bachelor apartment
where he lives,

164
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,380
so he doesn't meet Social Services'
criteria. It's complicated.

165
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:54,757
First, I want to contact them
and see if it's feasible.

166
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,885
-Did you have lunch?
-I have surgery. I have to go.

167
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:58,803
Take it easy.

168
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:02,891
That's right.
The patient is a 78-year-old male.

169
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:05,727
He underwent a right hemihepatectomy

170
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,395
due to HCC.

171
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:10,190
He's been here for a while
because his liver hasn't recovered.

172
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:14,110
<i>Okay. I'll summarize it
and send it to Daddy-Long-Legs.</i>

173
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:16,571
<i>He usually texts back right away.</i>

174
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:19,407
-<i>Give me about half an hour.</i>
-Okay, thank you.

175
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:23,661
Wait, is he a doctor?

176
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:26,122
He's asking detailed questions
about the patient.

177
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:27,707
<i>That I don't know.</i>

178
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,543
<i>I think he's well versed
in medical knowledge.</i>

179
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,714
<i>He always asks detailed questions about
the patient's situation and condition.</i>

180
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:36,799
<i>Anyway, I'll call you right back.</i>

181
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,176
Thank you.

182
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:14,754
29TH
DEPARTURE

183
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:24,264
Hi, Mom.

184
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:26,849
What's my sweet, adorable baby doing?

185
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:29,143
-<i>I'm going to have lunch with Song-hwa.</i>
-Song-hwa?

186
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:32,480
Good. That's great. Shall I join you guys?

187
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:35,441
We're just ordering in.

188
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:39,070
And it's not Song-hwa.
You got it all wrong.

189
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:42,490
"It's not Song-hwa"?
That means you are seeing someone.

190
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:45,201
Who is it? Marry her. Get married at once.

191
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:48,079
My first pick is Song-hwa,
but I'm fine with whomever you choose.

192
00:10:48,162 --> 00:10:50,123
Gosh, my bad. I'm not seeing anyone.

193
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:51,833
It was a slip of the tongue.

194
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,544
Mom, I'll be in Yangpyeong this weekend.
Make me some noodles.

195
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:57,547
Jong-su and I are going to see
the fall foliage this weekend.

196
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,965
Come next weekend.

197
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:02,552
But I don't want to see you if you are
going to talk about that. Don't come.

198
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,347
Let's talk in person.

199
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,058
Enjoy your lunch with Mr. Ju.

200
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:10,852
All right.

201
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:25,617
-Did you call everyone?
-Seok-hyeong has patients.

202
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,327
Jun-wan has surgery,
and Jeong-won needs a minute.

203
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,496
Hey, I heard Seok-hyeong is
very popular among moms-to-be.

204
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,749
Gosh, cut the nonsense.

205
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,043
He's like that with just us.

206
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:38,630
My friend's sister-in-law is his patient,

207
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,715
and she said
he's the sweetest guy on earth.

208
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:42,717
Gosh, I find that very hard to believe.

209
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:47,805
Jeez! I get so anxious when you do that.

210
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:49,724
Why you... I wish I could just punch you.

211
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,143
Just use this.

212
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:54,646
You're so all over the place.
Who do you take after?

213
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:58,524
I take after U-ju. It's all from him.

214
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:02,236
All right. Gosh, that hurt.

215
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:05,323
There.

216
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:10,370
-Wait.
-What? What is it?

217
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:12,705
Three, two, one.

218
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:13,930
Open.

219
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:16,571
-Wait.
-What? What is it?

220
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,906
Three, two, one.

221
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,365
Open.

222
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,952
The food is already here?

223
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:25,288
You guys ordered a lot.

224
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:28,708
You came in exactly one minute.
You give me the heebie-jeebies.

225
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,127
You're more impressive.
Are you the Bionic Woman?

226
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:34,297
-What about the other guys?
-Seok-hyeong has patients.

227
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,466
Jun-wan has surgery,
and you took a minute.

228
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:43,056
Hello.

229
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,976
It's been a month, right?
Please have a seat.

230
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,145
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello.

231
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:54,359
The blood stagnation is gone.

232
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:57,320
You had a complete ultrasound
this morning, right?

233
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:59,155
Yes.

234
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,409
The normal cervical length is 3cm
on average.

235
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:08,414
For where you're at, anything
under 2.5cm is considered too short.

236
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:13,086
But yours is under 1cm,
which is very short.

237
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:14,671
And I can see

238
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:18,257
that your cervix is slightly open.

239
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:20,468
In cases like this,

240
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:24,722
it's highly likely
that the baby will be born prematurely.

241
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,767
Then what do I do?

242
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:31,270
Don't worry. You're okay.

243
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,773
Yes, he's right.

244
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:36,484
Thankfully, you can undergo surgery now.

245
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,985
Don't worry too much.

246
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,905
Cervical cerclage...

247
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,241
It's commonly called
the McDonald cerclage.

248
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,910
It's a procedure where
we tie the cervical opening

249
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,870
so that the cervix won't open.

250
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,832
Let's get you checked in
for surgery right away.

251
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:53,710
The entire procedure
will take about 30 minutes.

252
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:57,672
If there's no infection inside the uterus
after the surgery,

253
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:59,757
you'll be discharged in about two days.

254
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:03,928
The nurse here
will walk you through the steps.

255
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,978
I see this from time to time.

256
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:16,899
You're not the only one,
so don't worry too much.

257
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,654
Doctor, please don't tell me
that I might have another miscarriage.

258
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:24,115
What should we do, honey?

259
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:28,119
-Stop it with the nonsense.
-Yes, don't say that.

260
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:32,999
I'll do my very best.

261
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,210
We must protect the baby

262
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,546
this time no matter what.

263
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,093
Let's go ahead with the surgery today

264
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:47,221
and make sure you get
enough rest at home for a while.

265
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:51,392
As for your next appointment, I'll see you
a week after you get discharged.

266
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:52,977
I'll have to check and see

267
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,730
if your cervical length
is being maintained.

268
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:57,273
My gosh.

269
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,234
Don't worry.

270
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,322
Try to think positive, happy thoughts.

271
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:05,907
It'll help the baby.

272
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:08,993
Okay.

273
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,751
Professor Cheon's engagement
got called off.

274
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,085
Yes.

275
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:22,006
Mr. Ju told me. The daughter was
totally against her mom marrying him.

276
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,383
Her daughter is her savior.

277
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:28,429
Hey.

278
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,182
Please.

279
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,101
Okay, I'll slow down.

280
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,896
I eat fast because I have three brothers.

281
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:41,859
He was diagnosed with DCMP
and is waiting for a heart transplant.

282
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:43,027
I know that.

283
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,280
He's been here for over two months.
Cut the wordy explanation.

284
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,158
What was his IO yesterday?

285
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,494
The urine output was 600 yesterday.

286
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,870
-Potassium?
-Six.

287
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:55,915
Then give him Lasix.
Keep checking and give him RI if needed.

288
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:57,834
Lasix?

289
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,837
Can you not use a diuretic?

290
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,632
I'll be in pain anyway.

291
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,427
Sir. If you have trouble urinating,

292
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:10,721
the heart may stretch
and cause shortness of breath.

293
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:13,057
The potassium level from this morning
was quite high,

294
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,392
so we have to use a diuretic.

295
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:17,895
Either way, I won't be able to live.

296
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:19,564
Just leave me in peace, please.

297
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:22,024
I don't want Lasix.

298
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:27,071
Sure, if that's what you want.

299
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,498
I've heard all sorts of bad things
about Professor Cheon.

300
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,584
How come no one complains about him?

301
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:40,835
Isn't it obvious?

302
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,299
All he cares about is money.

303
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:48,634
Why do you think he manages CS
when he's so busy?

304
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,511
The answer is obvious.

305
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:13,492
MY RIDICULOUS APPOINTMENT
WITH PROFESSOR CHEON MYEONG-TAE

306
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,458
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS POST?

307
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,500
POST DELETED

308
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,351
Is your headache that bad?

309
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,811
No, a mild one.

310
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:43,272
But you should take one right away.

311
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:44,523
Right, Doctor?

312
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,281
Why did it go to the medical office?

313
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:56,077
Jeong-won, can you come with me?
This package is quite big.

314
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,036
Sure.

315
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,163
Go. I'll clean up.

316
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:01,499
Hey, what did you buy this time?

317
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,417
A wood stove.

318
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:05,252
A wood stove?

319
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:08,464
Good choice.

320
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:10,466
Do everything you want to do
to stay healthy.

321
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,511
Great purchase. Well done.

322
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,763
See? The doctor said the same thing.

323
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,848
Don't keep it all inside. Let it out.

324
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:21,519
Don't let your thoughts
overload your mind. Just say it.

325
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:24,438
Just say whatever you're thinking.

326
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,273
Okay? Got it?

327
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:30,027
Okay. I heard you,
so please look straight ahead

328
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:31,737
and keep your hands on the steering wheel.

329
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,490
I don't want to die
on the same day as you.

330
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,410
Okay, I'll focus and just drive.

331
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:38,869
-Jeez.
-Hey.

332
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:42,540
It's so nice to hear you just blurt
things out. Even I feel much better now.

333
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:48,671
By the way, does Jeong-won really want
to quit being a doctor?

334
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:52,508
Don't tell me he wants
to become a priest as well.

335
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:53,926
Yes, he does.

336
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,430
He said he also wants to live
as a child of God now.

337
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:58,431
Oh, dear.

338
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,267
He'll work until the end of the year

339
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,644
and move to Italy to go to the seminary.

340
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:05,104
The ones in Korea have age limits.

341
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,857
They already accepted
his recommendation letters.

342
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,942
After an in-person meeting,
all will be set.

343
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,819
Gosh, I'm so upset.

344
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:13,320
My goodness.

345
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:17,116
What's up with your kids?

346
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:20,745
I mean, this is pretty crazy. Goodness.

347
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,913
You're laughing?

348
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:25,166
What, then? Should I be crying?

349
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,878
Rosa.

350
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:32,631
I have to say,

351
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:35,885
this is much better than having children
who are selfish troublemakers.

352
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,554
You raised wonderful, responsible kids.

353
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,057
They all have such kind hearts.

354
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:44,977
Just seeing them puts me in a happy mood.

355
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:46,604
They left their aging mother alone

356
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,482
and went on to become children of God.
If that's not being selfish,

357
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,233
what is?

358
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:53,069
They put you in a happy mood?

359
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,571
My blood boils whenever I see them.

360
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:58,991
I won't comment on other things,

361
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,038
but it'd be a shame for Jeong-won
to quit his job as a doctor.

362
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,250
There aren't a lot of doctors like him.

363
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,377
He has a strong sense of duty,

364
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:13,714
and the way he treats patients
is exemplary.

365
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,634
Jeong-won is the kindest one
out of all my kids.

366
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:21,138
He's always been very empathetic
and affectionate since he was little.

367
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,224
He's emotionally sensitive.

368
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:27,394
That's why I thought
he picked the best department for himself

369
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,731
when he told me he wanted
to become a pediatric surgeon.

370
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:32,983
Then I told myself,

371
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,778
"I can finally put my worries to rest."

372
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:38,948
He always talked about wanting
to be a priest even as a little boy.

373
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:43,786
So I thought I could finally stop
worrying about it, but...

374
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:45,704
Oh, boy.

375
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:49,875
Buddha wasn't on my side.

376
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:54,213
Tell me. What's your religion?

377
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,675
I'll dabble in all of them before I die.

378
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,343
Who knows, right?

379
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:02,304
So you're building a religion portfolio?

380
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:05,724
Anyway, what are you going to do?

381
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:08,435
Once he sets his mind to something,
he'll do it.

382
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,479
Right, there's no stopping him.

383
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,231
He takes after me.

384
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:16,152
What should I do?
He said he'll visit me next weekend.

385
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,737
I'm afraid he'll end up persuading me
this time.

386
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,991
You should travel abroad.

387
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:22,908
What?

388
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:26,162
Just don't see him.

389
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:27,913
Don't give him a chance to talk.

390
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:29,290
Are you kidding me?

391
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,376
Should I move to a different country?
I can't avoid him forever.

392
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,962
Hey,
you're the chairman of the foundation.

393
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,298
How do you even run the foundation
with such a mindset?

394
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,841
This is how I do things.

395
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,885
Look ahead.

396
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:44,930
Time is key.

397
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:48,017
Time is the solution to some problems.

398
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:50,519
If you can't find a solution now

399
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:54,023
no matter how hard you rack your brain,

400
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,483
just avoid the problem for now.

401
00:21:58,027 --> 00:22:01,113
If you avoid the problem
for as long as possible,

402
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,909
things could change with time.
Oftentimes, that's what happens.

403
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,914
So for now, give him whatever excuse
you can think of and just avoid him.

404
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,207
Okay?

405
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,835
-What are we eating by the way?
-<i>Jajangmyeon.</i>

406
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:20,299
I don't know why, but I've been craving
<i>jajangmyeon</i> since this morning.

407
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,426
<i>Jajangmyeon</i>?

408
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,557
I guess you don't want <i>jajangmyeon</i>.
What do you want?

409
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,269
Just say it.

410
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:33,938
Never mind.

411
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,735
Rosa, don't keep it all inside.
Let it out.

412
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,862
Just say whatever you're thinking.

413
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:43,822
What do you feel like eating?

414
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:45,866
I want a drink.

415
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,078
Let's grab a drink.

416
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:52,998
All right.

417
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:00,172
Nothing abnormal with electrolytes, right?

418
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,009
That's good. The patient can be discharged
around Friday

419
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:05,427
and come back next week.

420
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,518
Ji-won, are you upset
because you couldn't go camping?

421
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,981
Then I'll skip the painful shot today.

422
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:18,983
-Really?
-Yes.

423
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,943
-Promise.
-Promise.

424
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,530
Promise sealed.

425
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,450
He actually doesn't need any shots
from today on.

426
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,244
He'll be discharged tomorrow.

427
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:33,539
Oh, that kid's older brother is Ji-ho.

428
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:36,417
He comes by often,
and he's so adorable too.

429
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,962
Jeong-won, get married.

430
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,676
Find yourself a nice lady
and get married soon.

431
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,261
Or have a baby first.

432
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:50,055
Think about how adorable
your own kids will be.

433
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:53,058
You hurry up and get married.
You love kids too.

434
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,227
I don't love kids that much.

435
00:23:56,312 --> 00:23:58,772
But I love my nieces and nephews.
U-ju is so cute.

436
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:01,066
I haven't seen U-ju in a while.

437
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:04,486
Oh, Ik-jun is gone.

438
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,281
He got a call from the ICU.
He messaged me.

439
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,325
He's busy today.

440
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:11,827
When is that prick not busy?

441
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:15,873
Did I leave this here?

442
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:20,294
Song-hwa, come have a seat.
I have something to tell you.

443
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:24,006
-Say it.
-Come and sit here.

444
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,008
It's something important.

445
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:32,931
-Come again?
-I'm Daddy-Long-Legs.

446
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,809
You're Grandpa-Long-Legs?

447
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,064
That's right. I am Grandpa-Long-Legs.

448
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,148
Hey.

449
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:45,235
You're really something.

450
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:49,823
That's why you're always broke.

451
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,494
Gosh, how can you live like that?

452
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:55,913
You're impressive.

453
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:00,084
I have to say, I have big respect for you.

454
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:01,752
I'm impressed.

455
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,588
Don't be. I started doing it by chance,

456
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:06,965
but it just became this big.

457
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,718
Song-hwa, the thing is...

458
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,012
I want you

459
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,640
to be Daddy-Long-Legs from now on.

460
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,228
I've been meaning to ask you
since the spring,

461
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,772
but it's been quite hectic
since I moved to this hospital,

462
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,899
so I couldn't tell you sooner.

463
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,486
If you're okay with it,

464
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:32,032
I'd like you to be Daddy-Long-Legs
in my place.

465
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:38,122
But how? I don't have that kind of money.

466
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,706
Unlike you, I don't come from money.

467
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,501
I've already figured out a way.

468
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:44,086
How?

469
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,713
I was given management of all the profits

470
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:49,633
from the VIP Ward after I renounced
the inheritance of the foundation.

471
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,427
Mr. Ju has agreed to it as well.

472
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,887
But he has no idea
where it's used, of course.

473
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,348
So that money will support the program?

474
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,270
Then why can't you keep doing it?

475
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,189
I'll do it just until the end of the year.

476
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,527
I'll leave the hospital after that.

477
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,033
Later.

478
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:18,495
I'll tell you guys at once
when we're all together.

479
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,293
So you'll do it, right?

480
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:25,961
Can I take that as a yes?

481
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,425
Thanks.

482
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,343
No problem.

483
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:41,351
-Jeong-won, are you really--
-Later.

484
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,521
I'll tell you everything later on.

485
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,694
But the VIP Ward...

486
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,530
Aren't the numbers up and down?

487
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:57,743
There are only a handful of rooms.
I know they get packed at times,

488
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,162
but the rooms can be empty for months
when it's quiet.

489
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,500
Shall I look into other ways
to fund the program?

490
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:06,710
No, there's no need.

491
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,172
Someone's pulling in
a lot of money for us at the moment.

492
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:15,969
Ik-jun, right?

493
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,098
Yes, the word has spread.

494
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:23,769
High-ranking officials and celebrities are
recommending us to their acquaintances,

495
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:25,854
so we keep getting new patients.

496
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:30,359
-That patient will be discharged tomorrow.
-Who?

497
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:31,360
The Prince.

498
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,197
The Prince of Dubai.

499
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,282
You heard about tomorrow, right?

500
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:40,392
You heard that your mother
is being discharged tomorrow, right?

501
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:42,102
Yes, I heard from Dr. Lee.

502
00:27:42,185 --> 00:27:43,603
Thank you very much.

503
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:46,398
I never thought that my mom
would be able to go home this soon.

504
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:48,400
She and I are trutly grateful for the care

505
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:50,527
that the staff of Yulje Medical Center

506
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,612
and Dr. Lee have provided.

507
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,509
He said he heard about it from Dr. Lee
and that he's very grateful.

508
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:59,054
He never thought his mother
would be able to go home this soon.

509
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,806
Both he and his mother are very grateful

510
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:04,059
for the care that the staff
and Dr. Lee Ik-jun have provided.

511
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:08,230
This is the balance
after deducting the prepayment.

512
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,857
The bill includes fees for your mother’s
hospitalization,

513
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:12,484
surgical procedure, and medical tests.

514
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:16,154
Since she does not have health insurance,
the bill is quite large.

515
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,658
You can pay with a credit card
or in installments,

516
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,535
whichever way you prefer.

517
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:24,311
...or in installments,
whichever way you prefer.

518
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:26,646
I will pay fully in cash today.

519
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,752
He'd like to pay in full in cash today.

520
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:58,947
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

521
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,159
What are those roses for?

522
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,036
Are you seeing someone?

523
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:06,079
Hello.

524
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:07,748
Someone gave you roses?

525
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:09,583
Yes.

526
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:16,632
What's up? What's going on?

527
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,885
Hey, Gyeo-ul. Did someone propose to you?

528
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:23,096
-Well...
-My gosh, seriously?

529
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:25,724
Is everyone here?

530
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,935
Hey, Gyeo-ul. Can you scrub in today?

531
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,189
Professor, it looks like

532
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:35,359
our dear Gyeo-ul must be dating someone.
My gosh!

533
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,152
What? Really?

534
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:41,198
That means we've proved to the world
that surgeons can date too!

535
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,199
That's right.

536
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:45,744
She's the living proof
that shows the world we can date too.

537
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:50,624
Im Chang-min!

538
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,876
-Gyeo-ul is seeing someone.
-Really?

539
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:54,878
Congratulations.

540
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,798
See that? Look!

541
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,549
Those of us in GS can date too!

542
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,302
Seriously, dude!
Just look at the living proof.

543
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:05,138
We can have
a healthy work-life balance too.

544
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:06,765
Go tell everyone in your department.

545
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,266
A GS resident can see someone,

546
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,185
and get roses and do all kinds of things.

547
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,771
This can happen to everyone in GS.

548
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:13,939
-Okay?
-Gyeo-ul.

549
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,857
-Never give up.
-Thank you.

550
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,902
You must make this relationship last.

551
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:20,904
The future of GS depends on you.

552
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:22,656
All right. Let's calm down.

553
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,992
Let's congratulate her no matter
which surgery she picks today, okay?

554
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:26,910
Yes.

555
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,121
We'll have a ton of
new GS residents soon, you know.

556
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,707
We can suck it up a little, right?

557
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,791
All right.

558
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,751
Guys, let's all raise our glasses.

559
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,294
-Great idea.
-Here, guys.

560
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:37,963
-Hey, take this.
-Let's do this.

561
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,257
-My gosh, we should celebrate...
-Hey!

562
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,301
What are you doing? That's not champagne!

563
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:45,679
-Goodness. Here, guys.
-I opened it.

564
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:48,181
-It almost exploded.
-Hang on.

565
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:49,933
Jeong-won! Come and join us.

566
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,727
Celebrate with us.

567
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,062
Gyeo-ul's boyfriend proposed to her today.

568
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,568
I see.

569
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:03,488
What's with him?

570
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:06,241
-Cheers, everyone!
-Cheers!

571
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:07,993
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

572
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:11,455
Hey, Gyeo-ul.

573
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:15,876
So what's the verdict?
Which surgery will you assist with?

574
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,169
Have you decided?

575
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,006
Yes, I will...

576
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:27,220
I'll assist
with the thoracoscopic EA repair.

577
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:29,514
THORACOSCOPIC ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA REPAIR
PEDIATRIC SURGERY

578
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,481
I've only assisted
with esophageal atresia surgery once,

579
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,484
so I want to observe the procedure
one more time.

580
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:47,532
Hey, how could you do this to me?
After everything I've done...

581
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,327
I hate you.

582
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,040
Thank you.

583
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:56,833
No problem.

584
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:04,966
What? You sold your car?

585
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:09,137
Yes, I sold it
because I don't need it anymore.

586
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:10,597
You made money off that clunker?

587
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,185
You have no conscience.

588
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,978
Hey, I sold it for 200,000 won.

589
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,397
Whatever. Anyway, can you try
calling Seok-hyeong again?

590
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,358
-Ask him which song we're practicing.
-Okay.

591
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,529
<i>The person you're trying to reach</i>

592
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,030
-<i>is unavailable.</i>
-He's not answering.

593
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,990
Does he have an emergency patient
at this hour?

594
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:32,994
His mother is doing
much better now, right?

595
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:35,413
Yes, I've been checking in on her often.

596
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,669
Lee Seung-hwan's song.
Oh, I love this song.

597
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:43,672
He didn't answer when you called
but texted you back?

598
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:44,840
Yes, right away.

599
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,092
I really don't understand him.

600
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:50,220
I honestly have no idea
what goes through that prick's head.

601
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:51,930
We never see eye to eye.

602
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,265
I'd say the same about Ik-jun.

603
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:56,434
He's my friend, but I can't
figure him out at all sometimes.

604
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,103
Ik-jun? Don't try to understand him.

605
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:00,772
He's just a nutjob.

606
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,443
Gosh, that nutcase.

607
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,071
"L'ESTRO ARMONICO" BY VIVALDI

608
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:24,778
-Good morning!
-Jeez, you scared me.

609
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:27,966
-You're already here?
-I have a liver transplant.

610
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:30,135
-What's the song for this week?
-Lee Seung-hwan.

611
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:33,889
-That song?
-Yes.

612
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:36,391
What are you listening to now?

613
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:38,727
You don't know this? It's a famous song.

614
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,814
-I do know this song.
-What is it?

615
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,360
"This stop is Wangsimni.

616
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,237
Wangsimni Station.

617
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:51,531
The doors are on your right.

618
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:55,744
Passengers heading
to City Hall, Sincheon, Seongsu, Jamsil,

619
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:58,872
Oksu, Yongsan, Cheongnyangni,

620
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:01,207
and Seongbuk,

621
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,252
please transfer at this station."

622
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,198
"This stop is, Wangsimni Station.

623
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,282
Wangsimni Station.

624
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,201
The doors are on your right...

625
00:34:15,328 --> 00:34:17,413
You can transfer to Line Number Two.

626
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,626
Gyeongui-Jungang Line.

627
00:34:22,544 --> 00:34:23,670
Gyeongui-Jungang Line."

628
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,231
He's crazy.

629
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:29,945
The potassium level is 6.5.

630
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:36,284
Listen. Your potassium level is 6.5.

631
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,496
This is very serious.
It may cause an arrhythmia. Okay?

632
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,124
You must get an enema.

633
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,086
I won't do it. I don't want to get one.

634
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:49,297
Even if you don't want it,
it would be very dangerous if you don't.

635
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:52,008
Worst-case scenario, you may die from it.

636
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:55,053
I'd rather die than get an enema.

637
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:56,513
Pardon?

638
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:58,598
I really hate getting an enema.

639
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:02,686
It's too painful and exhausting.

640
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:03,728
It's

641
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:06,856
humiliating.

642
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,651
Look.

643
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:13,989
Your potassium level yesterday was 6.
And it's 6.5 today.

644
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:17,826
If it reaches 7 or 8, it'd be high
enough to cause a cardiac arrest.

645
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:22,122
You must get an enema now
to keep yourself alive!

646
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:24,749
I won't do it.
I won't do it even if it means I die.

647
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,127
I'm telling you I don't want to.

648
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:31,214
Don't do it if you don't want to.
I've told you though.

649
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,889
Once Ji-hu discharges gas, he can eat.

650
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,641
So let me know as soon as he does.

651
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,184
-Okay. Thank you.
-Sure.

652
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,982
Hello, Yeong-ji.

653
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,276
Hi, mister.

654
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,237
She's Post-op Day Four.

655
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,823
Her CRP is still pretty high,
so she's still on antibiotics.

656
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,535
Can I take a look?

657
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,078
All right.

658
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:06,166
Yeong-ji is getting

659
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:08,793
a new one today, right?

660
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:10,962
Pardon? Oh, her drip.

661
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:13,298
Yes, she's getting a new one today.

662
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:20,388
I don't want a shot today.

663
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:21,598
No, no.

664
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:23,683
-I don't want to get shots.
-It's not a shot.

665
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:25,894
-I won't get the shots today.
-You won't get it today.

666
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:28,146
Don't cry.

667
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,747
Did you succeed?

668
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,124
I'm sorry.

669
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,251
It's okay.

670
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:54,005
It's Yeong-ji's nap time soon.

671
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:55,090
I'll try again then.

672
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,676
I'm sorry, Professor Ahn.

673
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,304
You don't have to be sorry.
It's all right.

674
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,973
You have a hard job.

675
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,683
This is harder on her mom, probably.

676
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:08,228
-Bye.
-Bye.

677
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:16,444
I have ten minutes until my surgery.

678
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:19,531
That's enough time to eat <i>nurungji</i>,
brush your teeth, and drink your coffee.

679
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,616
I'm just saying I have time.

680
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:26,871
-What's this about?
-Hello.

681
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,499
Can I talk to you for a second?

682
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:35,046
What should I do? I don't know what to do.

683
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:40,552
He was diagnosed with DCMP
and waiting for a heart donor.

684
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:42,053
His potassium level is seven,

685
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:44,973
so he needs to get an enema now,
but he refused to get one.

686
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:47,767
Right. It went up to 7 from 6.5
only over a few hours.

687
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:50,145
Without an enema,
he really might be in critical condition.

688
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:51,104
What should I do?

689
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:55,191
The patient says no,

690
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:57,068
and Professor Cheon says to follow it.

691
00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:00,196
Professor Kim,
what should I do in this situation?

692
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:04,576
Should I

693
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,161
just let him be?

694
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,288
Do you want him to die?

695
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,790
Just go and give him an enema now.

696
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:14,669
Use all of your vocabulary, intelligence,
emotional intelligence, or superpower

697
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,754
to convince the patient
and give him an enema.

698
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:18,756
If the doctor gives up on the patient,

699
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:20,800
he isn't a doctor anymore.

700
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:25,471
Don't just stand there. Go.

701
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:27,682
Okay.

702
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:36,357
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

703
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,120
So tell me.

704
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:53,124
Did you give an enema
to the strawberry farmer?

705
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,293
Does he keep refusing it?

706
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:57,795
What now?

707
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:03,301
I did it.

708
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:04,928
That's great.

709
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:07,055
What a relief. How did you convince him?

710
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:09,641
He said he'd rather die than get one.

711
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:12,435
I begged him.

712
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,187
-What?
-What?

713
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,440
I kneeled and begged.

714
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:22,737
I racked my brain,
but I couldn't think of anything else.

715
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,074
So I kneeled in front of him and begged.

716
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,955
I told him he would die today
if he didn't get an enema.

717
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:35,083
And I said, if he does,
Professor Cheon wouldn't be affected,

718
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,545
but I would probably lose my job.

719
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:45,260
I begged him to get an enema,
so I don't get fired.

720
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:49,430
I kneeled and begged.

721
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:56,479
Aren't I really pathetic?

722
00:39:57,522 --> 00:39:59,857
No. That's freaking cool, Jae-hak.

723
00:40:04,654 --> 00:40:05,738
What a relief.

724
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:08,700
Did you just call me by my name?

725
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:11,494
Yes.

726
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:16,708
What?

727
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:22,588
See you tomorrow.

728
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,425
RESTRICTED AREA

729
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:27,635
This is Lee Ik-jun.

730
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,472
The one who got paracentesis
this afternoon?

731
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:33,641
Okay. I'm on my way.

732
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:39,939
His BP went down,
so I induced some fluids.

733
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,607
I was worried, so I called you.

734
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:43,943
Good job. You did well, Dr. Jang.

735
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,362
This happens
when you drain out the ascites.

736
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,072
His BP is rising, so let's observe him.

737
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:49,282
I'm sure he'll pull through.

738
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,992
-Are you on the call today again?
-Yes.

739
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:53,703
-Two days in a row?
-Three days in a row.

740
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:57,623
Why did you choose GS, seriously?

741
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,586
Let's watch him for an hour or two.
I'll be in my office.

742
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:04,172
Jeong-won hasn't gone home yet.

743
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:05,715
Do you want to get Coke all together?

744
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,385
I have to see a patient. I'll stay here.

745
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:10,970
Okay.

746
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:12,930
By the way, where is he?

747
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:16,100
On the 4th floor in Room 4103
at the main building's Pediatric Ward.

748
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,563
Did you put a tracker on Jeong-won?

749
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:41,459
You're still up, Yeong-ji?

750
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,340
You should be sleeping right now.

751
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,135
-Doctor.
-Yes?

752
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:54,180
I got a shot today.

753
00:41:55,223 --> 00:41:56,265
Really?

754
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:58,643
My gosh, you really got one.

755
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:01,437
Look at this big, brave girl.

756
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:05,691
Goodness.

757
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:11,572
How are you so kind and pretty, Yeong-ji?

758
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:14,075
I can't even get one because it's scary.

759
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:17,829
Gosh, you're so brave.

760
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:20,540
Good job. Well done.

761
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:21,749
Great girl.

762
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:35,012
Kids don't lie.

763
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:38,558
Of course, not.
They are not like us, adults.

764
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:42,687
When it hurts, they say so.
When they are fine, they say so.

765
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,105
They are always honest.

766
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:48,025
But adults pretend
that they are not sick when they are.

767
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:50,111
Even if they are recovered,
they fake their sickness,

768
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:51,904
so they can stay a bit longer.

769
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:54,449
-What about you?
-What?

770
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,118
So you don't lie?

771
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:01,581
I'm not sure. Sometimes, I lie.
Sometimes, I don't.

772
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:02,707
What is it?

773
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:05,710
What?

774
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:07,587
Don't you like Gyeo-ul?

775
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:14,677
To the point that makes you
question about becoming a priest.

776
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:24,187
If you like her, say so.
I'll keep it a secret.

777
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,897
It's not that. What are you talking about?

778
00:43:27,815 --> 00:43:29,066
Are you her spokesperson?

779
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,444
Yes, I'm her agent.

780
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:35,239
She's been handling all the tasks

781
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:37,325
including the chief resident's
since her first year.

782
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:38,951
But she never shows how hard it is.

783
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:41,913
We would understand
if she complains or gets annoyed.

784
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:43,748
She might sulk,

785
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:46,417
but she doesn't give up or complain.

786
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:50,796
It's just that she has a hard time
sympathizing with people,

787
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,758
but it looks like
she's trying to correct it these days.

788
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:56,552
Anyway, even in the OR, I've never seen

789
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:58,596
a resident in her year
tie as well as she does.

790
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:01,349
She's been practicing that by herself.

791
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:03,935
She cares about the patients
and tries to learn.

792
00:44:04,852 --> 00:44:06,729
I love her mindset as a surgeon.
It's impressive.

793
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:08,731
-I know that, too.
-I'm not done.

794
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:12,109
That's why I want her to be happy

795
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:18,407
with my friend, Jeong-won.

796
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:28,084
I want her to be happy with my friend.

797
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:29,961
Gosh, get away from me.
What's wrong with you?

798
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:34,549
Hey, Gyeo-ul. Is he okay?

799
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:37,385
That's great news. I'll be there. Okay.

800
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:40,471
I'll get going. Gyeo-ul is looking for me.

801
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:42,807
Okay. Bye.

802
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,941
Jeong-won, I'm sure He will understand.

803
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:54,610
Besides, when your brain and heart
are saying two different things,

804
00:44:56,529 --> 00:44:57,780
your heart is right.

805
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:03,828
Hey. Come on.

806
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:07,415
Just follow your heart,
then you won't regret it.

807
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,626
Don't make your decisions rashly
and end up like me.

808
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,586
Think carefully.

809
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:14,839
Thinking that you'll be fine
is asking for luck.

810
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:16,674
And that kind of luck doesn't happen.

811
00:45:16,757 --> 00:45:19,135
I'll stop nagging for today. Bye.

812
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,372
<i>I gave you</i>

813
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:33,793
<i>A beautiful bouquet of flowers once</i>

814
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:39,924
<i>The radiating flowers and fragrance</i>

815
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:43,511
<i>Sadly withered away</i>

816
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:48,099
<i>Your beauty now
Is more radiating than the flowers</i>

817
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:53,145
<i>But your beauty will also wither away</i>

818
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:58,275
<i>But unlike the flowers</i>

819
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:01,987
<i>We will have love for each other</i>

820
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:09,787
<i>You're my loved one</i>

821
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:14,125
<i>I will make a silent promise</i>

822
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:19,672
<i>That I will protect you</i>

823
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:22,675
<i>Until your tears run dry</i>

824
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:26,929
<i>In the distant future</i>

825
00:47:28,723 --> 00:47:33,352
<i>When we reminisce about this day</i>

826
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:40,109
<i>If we can give each other a kiss</i>

827
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:47,575
<i>In the whole wide world</i>

828
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:51,996
<i>For a very long time</i>

829
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,709
<i>Out of all the people</i>

830
00:47:56,792 --> 00:48:01,714
<i>I will only love you</i>

831
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:21,692
What does your boyfriend do?

832
00:48:23,152 --> 00:48:25,946
What does he do for a living?
How can he drive different cars every day?

833
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:28,699
Is he a car dealer?
Does he sell imported cars?

834
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:32,828
You only got half right.
The other half is wrong.

835
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:38,584
Not a car dealer. Is he rich?

836
00:48:39,043 --> 00:48:40,753
-The other way around.
-Is he a car dealer?

837
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:41,879
Not that.

838
00:48:44,632 --> 00:48:47,009
He's a car dealer,
but he's not your boyfriend.

839
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:48,636
Yes, he's my younger brother.

840
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:53,390
He sells imported cars,
but he just got a job at the dealership.

841
00:48:54,058 --> 00:48:55,518
He said he can't be late for work,

842
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:57,770
so he's staying at my house
for the time being.

843
00:48:57,853 --> 00:48:59,855
His work is not far from my place.

844
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:03,734
He's dropping me off
because he has to test drive the cars.

845
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:06,946
But he's such a bother.
Taking the subway is more comfortable.

846
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:09,740
-But why do you ask?
-Hey,

847
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:13,994
you still like Jeong-won, don't you?

848
00:49:17,414 --> 00:49:20,084
Goodness.
You'll never make a good con artist.

849
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:22,086
I can see right through you.

850
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:26,841
He lies to you
and never says anything nice to you.

851
00:49:27,633 --> 00:49:28,551
Do you still like him?

852
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,185
Gyeo-ul.

853
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,147
Let people think he's your boyfriend.

854
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:43,691
What?

855
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,029
Let's gamble just this once.

856
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:00,708
Will he buy it?

857
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:03,210
To pull off a good con,
you must fool yourself first.

858
00:50:04,128 --> 00:50:07,214
Pretend you didn't get dealt a bad hand.
It's a straight flush.

859
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:10,009
I don't know much about poker.

860
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:15,389
Pretend that you have a boyfriend,
not a younger brother.

861
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:18,350
Convince yourself the one who gave you
these roses is your boyfriend.

862
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:21,937
They should be here soon. Go inside.

863
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:25,274
Thank you.

864
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:27,067
If you want to thank me,

865
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:29,653
you can pick my surgery today.

866
00:50:29,737 --> 00:50:31,030
MEDICAL OFFICE 1, GENERAL SURGERY

867
00:50:39,288 --> 00:50:40,623
Go inside now.

868
00:50:55,846 --> 00:51:00,517
<i>You're my loved one</i>

869
00:51:00,601 --> 00:51:05,314
<i>I will make a silent promise</i>

870
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:10,235
<i>That I will protect you</i>

871
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:14,156
<i>Until your tears run dry</i>

872
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:19,203
<i>In the distant future</i>

873
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:23,666
<i>When we reminisce about this day</i>

874
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:31,215
<i>If we can give each other a kiss</i>

875
00:51:34,176 --> 00:51:38,514
<i>In the whole wide world</i>

876
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:43,018
<i>For a very long time</i>

877
00:51:43,102 --> 00:51:47,690
<i>Out of all the people</i>

878
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:52,945
<i>I will only love you</i>

879
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:57,157
<i>In the whole wide world</i>

880
00:51:57,241 --> 00:52:01,662
<i>For a very long time</i>

881
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:06,250
<i>Out of all the people</i>

882
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:09,169
<i>I am grateful</i>

883
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:14,383
<i>That I met you</i>

884
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:26,270
Song-hwa.

885
00:52:26,854 --> 00:52:28,313
Let's eat lunch.

886
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:30,691
You didn't have lunch yet?

887
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:32,192
Do you know what time it is?

888
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:34,778
I just finished seeing my outpatients.
Did you eat?

889
00:52:34,862 --> 00:52:35,863
Yes.

890
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:38,365
But I can eat again.

891
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:40,784
-Let's go!
-Can Chi-hong join?

892
00:52:40,868 --> 00:52:41,952
He has some questions.

893
00:52:42,036 --> 00:52:43,370
Of course.

894
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:45,456
Chi-hong is great.

895
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:48,584
He's kind and studies a lot.

896
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:51,670
He would've been successful
even if he stayed in the army.

897
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:53,756
What?

898
00:52:54,757 --> 00:52:55,883
I'm hungry.

899
00:52:56,592 --> 00:52:57,551
Right.

900
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:05,392
Recite your spell.

901
00:53:08,729 --> 00:53:10,314
This is all for me.

902
00:53:10,898 --> 00:53:12,649
No one will take my food.

903
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:14,401
Say the last sentence.

904
00:53:17,905 --> 00:53:18,864
I am

905
00:53:19,698 --> 00:53:21,366
-an intellectual.
-Let's eat.

906
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:26,914
Chi-hong, right here. There he is.

907
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:31,585
Professor Chae,

908
00:53:32,086 --> 00:53:33,629
I'm trying to write my thesis paper.

909
00:53:33,712 --> 00:53:36,632
Which part should I tackle first?
The introduction or the method?

910
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:40,219
Draw a conclusion first
if you're done with your research.

911
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:43,388
Use statistics to make tables
and find figures for the thesis paper.

912
00:53:43,472 --> 00:53:45,099
I can help you with the statistics.

913
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:48,102
-Thank you.
-You didn't have lunch yet?

914
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:50,062
No. I just finished my surgery.

915
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:53,690
Hello, Dr. Ahn. Everything is good, right?

916
00:53:53,774 --> 00:53:54,817
You're having a late lunch.

917
00:53:55,484 --> 00:53:56,401
Yes.

918
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:58,987
You didn't get a tangerine? Here you go.

919
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:00,489
Thank you.

920
00:54:01,073 --> 00:54:02,950
-One more thing, Chi-hong.
-Yes.

921
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:04,243
Is Seong-yeong doing well?

922
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:07,788
-Yes, of course.
-Don't bully him, okay?

923
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:09,957
I know that you guys wouldn't do that,

924
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,334
but try to be more considerate of him.
Do it openly, okay?

925
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:14,044
Okay. Of course.

926
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:18,132
It doesn't bother us,
but I think it bothers him a lot.

927
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:29,434
Seong-yeong, did you have lunch?

928
00:54:29,518 --> 00:54:30,894
Yes. I did.

929
00:54:34,148 --> 00:54:36,984
I'll say this one last time.
And I'll stop saying it.

930
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:38,235
Don't do it.

931
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:42,573
Professor Chae was scolded
at the meeting with other professors.

932
00:54:42,656 --> 00:54:45,117
No, she wasn't scolded.
She was disrespected.

933
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,536
It was disrespectful on another level.

934
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:49,204
They said NS residents were such tools.

935
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,624
If it weren't for Professor Chae,

936
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:54,793
you would've been crushed to pieces.

937
00:54:55,669 --> 00:54:57,087
I'm sorry.

938
00:54:57,171 --> 00:54:58,922
Dr. Yong, please stop.

939
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:00,007
That's enough.

940
00:55:03,135 --> 00:55:04,553
Is the intern here?

941
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:06,722
Hello, I'm the intern.

942
00:55:07,848 --> 00:55:08,891
I need to talk to you.

943
00:55:10,017 --> 00:55:10,851
Okay.

944
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:15,564
Hey.

945
00:55:16,148 --> 00:55:18,775
Don't be scared. Okay?
Just show him what you've got.

946
00:55:18,859 --> 00:55:21,236
What are you saying?
You must be out of your mind.

947
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,738
Are you a kid?

948
00:55:24,698 --> 00:55:27,784
Seong-yeong, it was your fault.
Apologize to him and say you're sorry.

949
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:29,745
That's the right thing to do.

950
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:31,413
Okay.

951
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:34,291
Go to him. I'll buy you a beer next time.

952
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:35,792
Okay.

953
00:55:37,002 --> 00:55:38,086
Thank you.

954
00:55:41,924 --> 00:55:42,925
Gosh.

955
00:55:44,218 --> 00:55:45,093
Goodness.

956
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:50,098
Hey, Ik-jun.

957
00:55:50,474 --> 00:55:51,808
What is it, Jun-wan?

958
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:54,269
Your legs.

959
00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:56,104
What?

960
00:55:56,939 --> 00:55:57,981
How about a drink with me tonight?

961
00:55:58,649 --> 00:55:59,650
I have surgery later.

962
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:01,985
What surgery? You have
a lot of surgeries these days.

963
00:56:02,486 --> 00:56:05,155
I'm doing
Professor Kwon Sun-jeong a favor.

964
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:06,740
I'm doing a total hepatectomy
on the recipient.

965
00:56:06,823 --> 00:56:08,575
-At this hour?
-Why all of a sudden?

966
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:10,744
The recipient's blood pressure went down
this morning.

967
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:13,455
Cardiology had to look at the ultrasound,
so the surgery got pushed.

968
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:15,832
There was a brain-dead patient,
so Se-hyeok went there.

969
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:16,792
What is it?

970
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:18,835
It's nothing.

971
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:21,380
I just wanted us to talk about stuff.

972
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:22,631
How about after surgery?

973
00:56:22,714 --> 00:56:23,882
I have a lecture today.

974
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,928
All right. I'll go over to
your house later. later. I miss U-ju, too.

975
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:32,099
My babysitter's daughter
came to Korea today,

976
00:56:32,683 --> 00:56:34,518
so I gave her a day off
to be with her daughter.

977
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:36,019
So I'm putting U-ju to sleep today.

978
00:56:36,103 --> 00:56:37,980
What? What's going on?

979
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:40,065
I'm dying to find out, too.

980
00:56:42,526 --> 00:56:43,902
It's nothing. I just

981
00:56:45,237 --> 00:56:46,863
wanted to talk about life.

982
00:56:46,947 --> 00:56:49,366
Then, it's a load of nonsense.

983
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,369
Just text me. Leave me messages.

984
00:56:54,121 --> 00:56:54,997
Dr. Ahn.

985
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:58,292
Have you been talking to Ik-sun lately?

986
00:56:58,375 --> 00:56:59,376
Is she doing well?

987
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:01,336
Yes, we talked yesterday, too.

988
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,423
Around midnight?
Or was it early in the morning?

989
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:07,843
Really? You guys are really close.

990
00:57:07,926 --> 00:57:09,386
You guys talk late at night.

991
00:57:10,053 --> 00:57:11,680
We are both night owls.

992
00:57:12,306 --> 00:57:13,724
So we talk about a lot of things.

993
00:57:14,308 --> 00:57:15,475
Isn't midnight

994
00:57:16,143 --> 00:57:17,811
too late

995
00:57:18,562 --> 00:57:20,022
to talk to your friend?

996
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,402
That's a load of crap.

997
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:27,571
Are you a geezer?

998
00:57:27,654 --> 00:57:28,822
It's okay.

999
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:31,575
But we always talk on the phone
around that time.

1000
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,035
"We"?

1001
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:35,787
All right, then.
Is my younger sister doing okay?

1002
00:57:36,455 --> 00:57:38,457
Yes. She's doing well.

1003
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:40,250
You probably don't know.

1004
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:43,420
-She got it.
-Got what?

1005
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:45,047
The doctorate program she applied to.

1006
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,757
She was the only one who got in.

1007
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:50,052
Did you know she was preparing
to get a doctorate?

1008
00:57:50,427 --> 00:57:51,386
I guess she was.

1009
00:57:52,262 --> 00:57:54,723
Go on. What happens now that she got in?

1010
00:57:55,307 --> 00:57:56,767
It's a three-year program in England.

1011
00:57:57,684 --> 00:58:01,521
-Really?
-Will she be in England for three years?

1012
00:58:01,605 --> 00:58:03,815
Yes. There was only one spot,
and she got it.

1013
00:58:03,899 --> 00:58:06,777
Gosh. Seriously. She's so smart.

1014
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,446
Does it mean I can't see
my sister for three years?

1015
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:12,699
Gosh. Come on.

1016
00:58:12,783 --> 00:58:15,952
If she was planning something like this,
she should have told me.

1017
00:58:16,036 --> 00:58:18,205
We're strangers.
No, even strangers know more about her.

1018
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:19,122
I've got to go.

1019
00:58:22,334 --> 00:58:23,502
Enjoy your meal.

1020
00:58:43,855 --> 00:58:45,357
What's wrong with this guy?

1021
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:49,569
This is Professor Jeon Jun-woo.
He's a psychiatrist.

1022
00:58:51,196 --> 00:58:53,698
He's two years older than me.
We went to the same college.

1023
00:58:55,242 --> 00:58:58,453
I'm used to his mess,
so it doesn't really bother me.

1024
00:59:00,622 --> 00:59:02,916
This way. Come take a seat.

1025
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,459
Where's coffee?

1026
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:08,004
My gosh.

1027
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:11,508
Talk to Jeong-won and get a new office.

1028
00:59:11,842 --> 00:59:13,427
Clearly, this guy needs help.

1029
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,264
Mom, this is why I said
we should drink coffee in the lobby.

1030
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:20,434
It's nice to see your office.

1031
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:23,603
I don't want coffee.
I drank a lot of coffee today.

1032
00:59:23,687 --> 00:59:24,604
I want some water.

1033
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:30,152
Everything will be over tomorrow.

1034
00:59:30,235 --> 00:59:33,071
Yes. I'm scheduled to be
at court tomorrow at 5 p.m.

1035
00:59:33,155 --> 00:59:36,032
And you won't be attending,
so I will proceed as we talked about.

1036
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,994
If there are no changes from both parties,

1037
00:59:39,578 --> 00:59:41,872
your divorce will be finalized tomorrow.

1038
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:43,540
And it will be official.

1039
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:45,250
Thank you for your help.

1040
00:59:45,584 --> 00:59:47,043
I know you're busy with the hospital.

1041
00:59:47,127 --> 00:59:50,505
Don't mention it.
I'm getting paid for this, too.

1042
00:59:51,882 --> 00:59:53,675
I really like you.

1043
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:56,470
You're honest.
You remind me of myself a lot.

1044
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,390
Will you be at home tomorrow morning?

1045
01:00:00,474 --> 01:00:02,225
I'll visit you tomorrow morning.

1046
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:04,227
Why is that?

1047
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:07,105
Before I head to court,

1048
01:00:07,189 --> 01:00:10,442
I ought to ask her if she had
a change of heart one last time.

1049
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:12,569
No. You don't have to do that.

1050
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:14,404
You can just head to court right away.

1051
01:00:14,488 --> 01:00:17,949
My gosh. You still don't trust me.

1052
01:00:18,492 --> 01:00:22,162
I still want the divorce,
and I won't change my mind.

1053
01:00:22,245 --> 01:00:25,332
You must be busy in the morning, too.
Focus your energy on another case.

1054
01:00:25,457 --> 01:00:28,251
When you walk out of the courthouse,

1055
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,128
just give me a call.

1056
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:32,088
Okay. I'll do that, then.

1057
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:34,799
Thank you. Please do that.

1058
01:00:35,884 --> 01:00:39,095
By the way, why aren't you married?

1059
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:41,389
Are we talking about me now?

1060
01:00:41,473 --> 01:00:45,227
Well, I mean, you are a fine young man.

1061
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,562
Why won't you get married? You should.

1062
01:00:47,646 --> 01:00:50,649
Mom, are you here to represent
the Marriage Support Committee?

1063
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:53,944
You tell that to everyone you see.

1064
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:57,697
Marriage is overrated. Why do you
keep telling people to get married?

1065
01:00:58,281 --> 01:01:00,825
Marriage can be a pain in the ass,

1066
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:04,746
but I have a handsome
and awesome son like you.

1067
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,374
That's a blessing. Truly.

1068
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,503
So you should get married soon, too.

1069
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:14,673
I have a girlfriend.

1070
01:01:15,882 --> 01:01:18,677
Right? Of course, you do.

1071
01:01:19,302 --> 01:01:21,263
What does she do?

1072
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,098
She's a prison guard.

1073
01:01:28,228 --> 01:01:30,647
Who? The wife of
the Minister of Education?

1074
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:35,819
Didn't she get a liver transplant
two years ago at Kangwoon Medical Center?

1075
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:39,573
Yes, she did.
But I guess she needs another surgery.

1076
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:42,409
It's completely confidential.

1077
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:43,326
Oh, dear.

1078
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,955
Minister Son is my junior alumnus
from high school.

1079
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:51,960
I think this time, he's planning
to donate a piece of liver to his wife.

1080
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:57,591
Come to think of it,
I should call him a former minister now.

1081
01:01:58,341 --> 01:01:59,926
He resigned today.

1082
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,470
He said he wanted to be with his wife.

1083
01:02:02,554 --> 01:02:04,681
Her liver must be failing

1084
01:02:05,265 --> 01:02:07,726
seeing she's getting another surgery
just in two years.

1085
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:09,769
Her body is rejecting the liver.

1086
01:02:10,145 --> 01:02:11,896
Her face is turning yellow again,

1087
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:15,650
and her health has gotten worse
than before the transplant.

1088
01:02:16,735 --> 01:02:19,279
On the phone, he asked me to call him

1089
01:02:20,655 --> 01:02:23,199
once we had discussed this
and made a decision.

1090
01:02:24,743 --> 01:02:27,537
But right before he hung up,
he asked me to help him.

1091
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:29,789
It sounded like he was crying.

1092
01:02:34,544 --> 01:02:35,795
Gosh.

1093
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:39,215
Why do people get sick when they get old?

1094
01:02:40,175 --> 01:02:41,676
Why? Why is that?

1095
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,638
If I know the answer to that,
I would have won the Nobel Prize.

1096
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:47,474
Gosh. What should we do?

1097
01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:49,893
I don't know much about her case,

1098
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,771
but as it's her second time,
the adhesion will be severe.

1099
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:54,898
Performing the surgery itself
will be hard.

1100
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:56,608
And I'm worried about complications, too.

1101
01:02:57,192 --> 01:03:00,195
That's why Kangwoon Medical Center
is hesitant to accept her.

1102
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:03,406
Of course. Performing surgery on
a high-profile patient would be hard.

1103
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:05,200
It's a given to do well.

1104
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:07,661
If not, it'll harm
the hospital's reputation.

1105
01:03:09,162 --> 01:03:11,498
If I had an excuse,

1106
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:13,875
I don't want to proceed
with a high-risk operation.

1107
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,377
Are you the surgeon?

1108
01:03:15,877 --> 01:03:17,295
It's not up to you.

1109
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:20,173
It's up to the doctor.

1110
01:03:20,256 --> 01:03:22,342
Who's going to do the surgery?
It'll be burdensome.

1111
01:03:22,425 --> 01:03:23,927
Minister Son's wife

1112
01:03:24,928 --> 01:03:28,098
wants Professor Lee
to perform surgery on her.

1113
01:03:29,224 --> 01:03:30,308
Really?

1114
01:03:30,392 --> 01:03:32,769
I guess she must have heard about him

1115
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:36,064
through a VIP patient
who was admitted to our hospital.

1116
01:03:36,147 --> 01:03:38,400
They are saying that Professor Lee

1117
01:03:38,483 --> 01:03:40,944
is the best surgeon
for a liver transplant.

1118
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:43,279
He is, but...

1119
01:03:44,823 --> 01:03:46,991
My gosh, it's too risky, though.

1120
01:03:47,784 --> 01:03:51,079
The success rate for a second transplant
won't be as high as the first one.

1121
01:03:52,414 --> 01:03:55,542
Should I ask Jeong-won first?

1122
01:03:57,544 --> 01:04:01,131
If you think Professor Lee
would be uncomfortable with this,

1123
01:04:01,214 --> 01:04:03,967
I don't even want
to bring this up with him.

1124
01:04:04,968 --> 01:04:08,388
We still have a chance to decide

1125
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:10,682
if we want to take this case or not.

1126
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:11,891
Uncomfortable?

1127
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:15,228
That's not like him.

1128
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:18,356
But I'll ask him first.

1129
01:04:19,983 --> 01:04:21,818
Let's see.

1130
01:04:27,073 --> 01:04:28,158
ELAPSED TIME

1131
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,370
How is it going with the recipient?

1132
01:04:33,288 --> 01:04:35,331
Can you check how far he got?

1133
01:04:35,415 --> 01:04:36,416
Yes.

1134
01:04:41,421 --> 01:04:43,965
Sir, he got the liver out 30 minutes ago.

1135
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:47,218
He finished controlling the bleeding,
and is working on the blood vessels now.

1136
01:04:48,303 --> 01:04:49,679
He's almost ready.

1137
01:04:49,763 --> 01:04:51,431
-Already?
-Yes.

1138
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:54,225
We saved at least two hours
in the OR today.

1139
01:05:03,568 --> 01:05:05,069
You're still here.

1140
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:07,363
I'll check out reperfusion before I leave.

1141
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:09,783
You're done. Why don't you get some food?

1142
01:05:09,866 --> 01:05:13,912
I have to go to the ICU
to check if the donor is doing okay.

1143
01:05:19,042 --> 01:05:20,752
I'm so touched.

1144
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:22,962
Give me your hands.

1145
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:28,176
Eat up. And if you want more,
just let me know.

1146
01:05:28,259 --> 01:05:30,053
There are boxes of these
in Jun-wan's office.

1147
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:31,846
Thank you.

1148
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:38,603
I feel awake now.

1149
01:05:42,023 --> 01:05:43,024
Why are you still here?

1150
01:05:45,151 --> 01:05:46,194
Hi, Gyeo-ul.

1151
01:05:46,778 --> 01:05:48,655
Hi. I'm leaving now.

1152
01:05:52,492 --> 01:05:54,160
Do you have a minute?

1153
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:57,372
Yes. What is it? Hold on.

1154
01:05:58,122 --> 01:05:59,666
You know, you just said hi to her.

1155
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,252
-I did?
-Yes.

1156
01:06:02,335 --> 01:06:03,586
-No.
-Yes, you did.

1157
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:05,672
-I didn't.
-You even called her name.

1158
01:06:05,755 --> 01:06:07,423
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

1159
01:06:07,507 --> 01:06:08,800
No! When? What time?

1160
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:09,884
When did I say that?

1161
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:16,099
You didn't. Sure. You didn't do that.

1162
01:06:16,933 --> 01:06:17,767
What do you need?

1163
01:06:18,476 --> 01:06:19,310
Right.

1164
01:06:20,353 --> 01:06:24,440
Two years ago, she got
the living-donor transplant from her son.

1165
01:06:24,524 --> 01:06:27,151
Her condition is really bad
due to chronic rejection.

1166
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:30,113
She has a severe case of jaundice
and will get CRRT, too.

1167
01:06:30,822 --> 01:06:31,823
She's not well at all.

1168
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:34,701
Let me check my schedule. Wait.

1169
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:36,327
You'll do it, right?

1170
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:40,874
I'll try to schedule it at the earliest
as soon as the donor is ready.

1171
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:43,418
I might have to do it on the weekend.

1172
01:06:45,795 --> 01:06:48,798
But doesn't
Minister Son Tae-hwan own a building?

1173
01:06:48,882 --> 01:06:50,091
I heard he has one in Gangnam.

1174
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:52,302
He's from a rich family.

1175
01:06:52,969 --> 01:06:55,513
If his wife gets the surgery
at our hospital,

1176
01:06:55,597 --> 01:06:58,641
he already promised the chairman
that he will make a donation.

1177
01:06:59,893 --> 01:07:02,061
He'll pay a lot of money
for the medical bills.

1178
01:07:02,145 --> 01:07:04,188
And he'll donate a lot of money, too.

1179
01:07:04,939 --> 01:07:07,066
It'll help
with your Daddy-Long-Legs Program.

1180
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:10,236
You bet. These days, you're the one
making all the money for...

1181
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:12,030
That's for me.

1182
01:07:14,824 --> 01:07:15,658
Hello?

1183
01:07:16,326 --> 01:07:17,869
Okay. I'm on my way. Okay.

1184
01:07:18,494 --> 01:07:19,329
Bye.

1185
01:07:20,455 --> 01:07:21,289
Right.

1186
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:24,042
Hey, it's about the CUSA.

1187
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:25,960
Can he donate two or three of those?

1188
01:07:26,628 --> 01:07:28,546
It's a device for dissecting livers.

1189
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:29,839
The one we have sucks.

1190
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:31,799
I like his donations,

1191
01:07:31,883 --> 01:07:33,593
but ask him if he could buy
a few of those.

1192
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:35,720
Slide that in, will you?

1193
01:07:47,607 --> 01:07:48,983
<i>Go. I'll clean up.</i>

1194
01:07:49,609 --> 01:07:50,944
Hey, what did you buy this time?

1195
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:53,446
A wood stove.

1196
01:07:53,529 --> 01:07:55,281
A wood stove.

1197
01:07:56,991 --> 01:07:57,825
Good choice.

1198
01:07:57,909 --> 01:07:59,661
Do everything you want to do
to stay healthy.

1199
01:07:59,744 --> 01:08:02,455
Great purchase. Well done.

1200
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,836
Goodness. A wood stove? Oh, dear.

1201
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:12,423
That startled me.

1202
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:31,025
HYEON JEONG-MI OF SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE

1203
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:33,569
YULJE MEDICAL HOSPITAL, 78 YEARS OLD, MALE
DETAILS IN YOUR EMAIL

1204
01:08:45,248 --> 01:08:47,417
Ahn Jeong-won, my gosh. This guy.

1205
01:08:48,001 --> 01:08:50,795
This wicked, deceitful guy.

1206
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:55,133
What? Look at the time.

1207
01:08:55,216 --> 01:08:56,676
I have a dinner appointment.

1208
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:58,761
Let's call it a day here.
See you tomorrow.

1209
01:08:58,845 --> 01:09:00,013
-Okay.
-Okay.

1210
01:09:00,346 --> 01:09:01,222
Professor Chae.

1211
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:04,726
Professor Min Gi-jun
talked to Seong-yeong earlier.

1212
01:09:05,393 --> 01:09:08,730
Professor Min called him
and gave him an earful.

1213
01:09:08,813 --> 01:09:10,773
When I saw him afterward,
he was out of it.

1214
01:09:10,857 --> 01:09:14,694
Given his position at the hospital,
he could teach him a lesson.

1215
01:09:15,361 --> 01:09:17,196
Gosh, Professor Chae.

1216
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,198
Can you curse for us just once?

1217
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:22,035
Hey, I can be foul-mouthed if I wanted.

1218
01:09:22,702 --> 01:09:24,495
I've never heard you use foul language.

1219
01:09:24,579 --> 01:09:26,247
Can you curse just this once?

1220
01:09:34,547 --> 01:09:35,381
Motherfucker.

1221
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,218
You did swear at us,
but it didn't sound like that.

1222
01:09:39,302 --> 01:09:42,138
That was completely therapeutic for me.
I've been blessed.

1223
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:50,354
By the way, I offered to buy him dinner.

1224
01:09:50,438 --> 01:09:52,190
But he said he had plans.

1225
01:09:52,273 --> 01:09:53,733
He's still cheerful, you know.

1226
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:55,318
He was depressed until the afternoon,

1227
01:09:55,401 --> 01:09:57,820
but I guess he was meeting his girlfriend.
He lit up.

1228
01:09:57,904 --> 01:10:00,156
That's me. His dinner date.

1229
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:03,367
I offered to buy him dinner.

1230
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:05,286
Professor Chae.

1231
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:07,246
You even care for interns?

1232
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:08,372
Can you buy us dinner, too?

1233
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:10,166
Sure. Why don't we all go?

1234
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,085
-Yes!
-Nice!

1235
01:10:19,175 --> 01:10:20,176
What about dinner?

1236
01:10:20,593 --> 01:10:22,762
I have a lecture. I'm late.
Enjoy your dinner.

1237
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:26,766
I heard this from Dr. Jang.

1238
01:10:26,849 --> 01:10:29,769
She said Professor Lee did
eight liver transplants just this month.

1239
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:31,521
He does a lot of surgeries, to begin with.

1240
01:10:31,938 --> 01:10:35,316
He did ten of those all by himself
at his previous hospital, too.

1241
01:10:40,613 --> 01:10:42,365
Is it already the fifteenth?

1242
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:43,366
It's a full moon.

1243
01:10:44,659 --> 01:10:46,536
Yes, it is.
It's the 15th on the lunar calendar.

1244
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:47,745
We should make a wish.

1245
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:49,789
What wish?

1246
01:10:50,915 --> 01:10:54,585
Please help Seong-yeong not get hurt
and become a good surgeon.

1247
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:57,755
-Professor Chae.
-Please.

1248
01:10:57,964 --> 01:11:01,092
Do you have
a selfish or materialistic wish?

1249
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:05,263
I'm going camping this weekend.

1250
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:06,722
Should I wish for a good deck?

1251
01:11:06,806 --> 01:11:07,890
Something else.

1252
01:11:09,142 --> 01:11:10,268
Well...

1253
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:12,728
None.

1254
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:14,230
Professor Chae,

1255
01:11:15,523 --> 01:11:16,774
do you want to run for office?

1256
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,781
Aren't you going home?

1257
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:27,451
You go without me. I have some work left.

1258
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:29,495
Good work.

1259
01:12:08,618 --> 01:12:10,328
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1260
01:12:10,411 --> 01:12:12,830
-Are you Dr. Do Jae-hak?
-Yes.

1261
01:12:12,914 --> 01:12:16,709
I see. I'm Kim Hae-beom's aunt.
He's the patient in Room 6303.

1262
01:12:16,792 --> 01:12:18,169
I see. Hello.

1263
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:21,339
I just arrived in Seoul.
I'm finally meeting you.

1264
01:12:22,465 --> 01:12:24,217
Please hold on.

1265
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,054
Hae-beom wanted me to bring this now.
But please wait here.

1266
01:12:47,323 --> 01:12:49,700
My gosh, why isn't he going home?

1267
01:12:50,368 --> 01:12:53,120
Come on, just go home.

1268
01:12:54,997 --> 01:12:56,499
You're still here?

1269
01:12:56,582 --> 01:12:57,792
Yes, I'm about to head out.

1270
01:12:58,376 --> 01:13:02,380
Ms. Oh Hye-jun's baby had
a late deceleration.

1271
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,215
But the baby is doing fine now.

1272
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,841
Keep an eye on the baby.

1273
01:13:05,925 --> 01:13:07,843
Notify me
if there's another late deceleration.

1274
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:08,970
Okay.

1275
01:13:13,808 --> 01:13:14,976
Good work.

1276
01:13:15,059 --> 01:13:16,310
Good work, doctor.

1277
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:26,112
Professor Yang, are you just getting off?

1278
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:27,446
Didn't you leave earlier?

1279
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:29,782
I forgot something.

1280
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:33,494
Can you give me a ride
to the subway station?

1281
01:13:35,204 --> 01:13:36,622
Well, that's...

1282
01:13:36,706 --> 01:13:37,790
Thank you.

1283
01:13:58,227 --> 01:13:59,312
What are you doing?

1284
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,902
I'm just about
to get off work, too. Ik-sun.

1285
01:14:07,903 --> 01:14:10,239
I just heard it from Dr. Ahn Chi-hong.

1286
01:14:10,531 --> 01:14:11,532
So you got in.

1287
01:14:13,117 --> 01:14:16,162
It's all right.
It doesn't matter how I found out.

1288
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:19,707
I bet you couldn't call me
because you were sorry.

1289
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:22,168
Let's talk over the weekend.

1290
01:14:23,002 --> 01:14:24,879
Let's find a way.

1291
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:27,506
Okay.

1292
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:31,719
Okay. Let's talk in person. Goodnight.

1293
01:14:32,803 --> 01:14:33,763
Me, too.

1294
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:37,284
<i>Thank you for not giving up on me.</i>

1295
01:15:38,285 --> 01:15:40,955
<i>I will remember your kindness
for the rest of my life.</i>

1296
01:15:55,511 --> 01:15:56,929
Jae-hak, let's grab drinks.

1297
01:16:19,034 --> 01:16:20,995
Your car is so clean.

1298
01:16:21,579 --> 01:16:23,456
There's nothing in the car.

1299
01:16:23,998 --> 01:16:26,834
Anyway, you're full of surprises.

1300
01:16:28,335 --> 01:16:30,546
Did I look like I would have a messy car?

1301
01:16:30,629 --> 01:16:32,506
No. I know that you're neat,

1302
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:34,467
but I didn't know
your car would be this clean.

1303
01:16:35,926 --> 01:16:37,636
I bet your house is spotless, too.

1304
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,888
I'm not neat.

1305
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:41,390
I don't do anything because
I don't want to clean up.

1306
01:16:41,974 --> 01:16:43,434
I don't have a lot of stuff at home.

1307
01:16:44,143 --> 01:16:45,519
Excuse me.

1308
01:16:47,062 --> 01:16:48,147
What is it?

1309
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:52,151
I'm hanging up. I'm busy. Yes.

1310
01:16:53,319 --> 01:16:55,029
No, go ahead. Why did you hang up?

1311
01:16:55,112 --> 01:16:56,489
It's just a guy I know.

1312
01:16:56,572 --> 01:16:58,073
He calls me more than ten times a day.

1313
01:16:58,157 --> 01:16:59,867
Ten times? Goodness.

1314
01:17:00,826 --> 01:17:01,827
That's too much.

1315
01:17:07,124 --> 01:17:08,250
Professor, by any chance...

1316
01:17:08,918 --> 01:17:11,378
You're not being jealous, are you?

1317
01:17:12,505 --> 01:17:14,798
What? Jealous?

1318
01:17:17,968 --> 01:17:19,512
Do you like me?

1319
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,641
Do I like you?

1320
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:26,435
My goodness, no.

1321
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:28,145
But I like you.

1322
01:17:34,485 --> 01:17:37,530
That's the station.
Can you drop me off over there?

1323
01:17:37,613 --> 01:17:38,572
Right there.

1324
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:46,539
Thank you.

1325
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:07,977
Professor Yang.

1326
01:18:10,729 --> 01:18:12,481
Don't pretend
this never happened tomorrow.

1327
01:18:14,275 --> 01:18:16,485
I told you how I feel about you today.

1328
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:20,114
Don't pretend it never happened tomorrow.

1329
01:18:22,074 --> 01:18:24,910
But you don't have to give me an answer.

1330
01:18:24,994 --> 01:18:26,745
That's not why I told you.

1331
01:18:29,206 --> 01:18:30,207
I just

1332
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:33,127
wanted to share how I feel.

1333
01:18:35,796 --> 01:18:37,590
I won't make it obvious at the hospital.

1334
01:18:39,049 --> 01:18:40,050
I just

1335
01:18:41,135 --> 01:18:43,929
want you to know how I feel. Okay?

1336
01:18:48,517 --> 01:18:51,270
Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

1337
01:19:31,769 --> 01:19:32,770
Thirty-eight point two.

1338
01:19:37,733 --> 01:19:38,734
There.

1339
01:19:44,907 --> 01:19:46,116
There you go.

1340
01:19:50,162 --> 01:19:51,163
Come here.

1341
01:20:08,514 --> 01:20:09,556
-Yes?
<i>-Professor Lee.</i>

1342
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,141
<i>Yu Sang-jun's BP is going down again.</i>

1343
01:20:11,225 --> 01:20:13,102
<i>So I'm giving him fluids
and norepinephrine now.</i>

1344
01:20:13,185 --> 01:20:16,105
Increase norepinephrine
and keep checking if he's stabilizing.

1345
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:17,815
You're giving him antibiotics, right?

1346
01:20:18,482 --> 01:20:19,566
I'm on my way.

1347
01:20:27,616 --> 01:20:29,201
His fever isn't going down quickly.

1348
01:20:32,037 --> 01:20:33,288
Did you fly here?

1349
01:21:36,477 --> 01:21:37,895
When did you get here?

1350
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:40,898
Ten minutes ago. Let's eat breakfast.

1351
01:21:41,482 --> 01:21:42,399
Did you get some sleep?

1352
01:21:44,234 --> 01:21:46,320
-No.
-Then, get some sleep.

1353
01:21:46,904 --> 01:21:48,489
I won't be able to wake up if I sleep now.

1354
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:50,949
You like <i>nurungji</i>, right?

1355
01:21:52,242 --> 01:21:53,619
That's the perfect breakfast.

1356
01:22:02,544 --> 01:22:03,754
Give me that.

1357
01:22:04,338 --> 01:22:05,672
-Can you carry them?
-Yes.

1358
01:22:10,427 --> 01:22:12,137
Gosh, this is nice.

1359
01:22:12,471 --> 01:22:14,348
-Do you want more?
-After I finish this one.

1360
01:22:15,849 --> 01:22:17,226
Did you make <i>jangjorim</i>?

1361
01:22:17,309 --> 01:22:18,477
My mom sent me that.

1362
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,020
Didn't I cook the eggs perfectly?

1363
01:22:20,103 --> 01:22:22,231
You added just the right amount of salt.
Nicely done.

1364
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:24,525
Ik-jun, you should get some sleep.

1365
01:22:25,067 --> 01:22:25,984
I'll be fine.

1366
01:22:27,027 --> 01:22:28,153
His fever went down, right?

1367
01:22:28,237 --> 01:22:30,656
Yes. I checked his temperature
before I came out. It was 36.8.

1368
01:22:30,739 --> 01:22:32,199
His fever is almost gone.

1369
01:22:32,866 --> 01:22:35,160
My gosh. During the night,

1370
01:22:36,453 --> 01:22:38,956
his fever wouldn't go down,
so I got so scared.

1371
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,833
I even asked my mom what to do.

1372
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,962
She told me to take off his clothes
and wipe him with lukewarm water.

1373
01:22:45,379 --> 01:22:47,756
When I did that,
his fever was gone right away.

1374
01:22:48,715 --> 01:22:51,969
She's better than a doctor.
Moms are better than doctors.

1375
01:22:52,052 --> 01:22:53,762
I have so much respect for moms.

1376
01:22:53,846 --> 01:22:55,556
Did you call your mom that late?

1377
01:22:55,639 --> 01:22:57,933
What choice did I have? He was sick.

1378
01:22:58,016 --> 01:22:59,017
Goodness.

1379
01:23:00,853 --> 01:23:02,062
You should sleep.

1380
01:23:02,896 --> 01:23:05,774
Okay, fine. Jeez.

1381
01:23:06,358 --> 01:23:08,861
I have an hour.
I'll sleep after breakfast.

1382
01:23:08,944 --> 01:23:10,320
You can wake me up.

1383
01:23:10,404 --> 01:23:12,239
Of course. Go to sleep now.

1384
01:23:12,322 --> 01:23:13,323
Okay.

1385
01:23:16,535 --> 01:23:18,370
-Ik-jun.
-Yes.

1386
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:21,790
What have you done for yourself lately?

1387
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:26,169
-For me?
-Yes, you.

1388
01:23:26,253 --> 01:23:27,421
What about you?

1389
01:23:33,927 --> 01:23:34,803
I bought this.

1390
01:23:35,554 --> 01:23:36,471
What's that?

1391
01:23:37,139 --> 01:23:38,015
A rack for the logs.

1392
01:23:38,682 --> 01:23:39,808
Why do you need that?

1393
01:23:40,893 --> 01:23:42,936
I need to put logs in the wood stove.

1394
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,646
And this is where I keep the logs.

1395
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:47,608
You can just put them on the ground.

1396
01:23:47,691 --> 01:23:48,734
Why did you buy that?

1397
01:23:49,318 --> 01:23:50,777
I bought it for myself.

1398
01:23:52,571 --> 01:23:54,698
I just treated myself with that.

1399
01:23:54,781 --> 01:23:56,450
I was so happy when I bought that.

1400
01:23:57,951 --> 01:24:00,329
Okay. Good job.

1401
01:24:02,372 --> 01:24:05,208
What about you?
What do you do for yourself?

1402
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:08,128
What's a treat for you?

1403
01:24:12,591 --> 01:24:14,426
Having a meal with you like this.

1404
01:24:19,222 --> 01:24:20,349
Eating with you

1405
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:23,393
and drinking coffee together.

1406
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:27,648
That's a treat I give myself.

1407
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:41,286
Eat up.

1408
01:24:42,746 --> 01:24:44,831
It's raining outside.
Can't you hear the raindrops?

1409
01:24:45,874 --> 01:24:46,708
Really?

1410
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:48,961
How can you not know?
You turned out to see.

1411
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:51,922
-Should I open the window?
-Sure.

1412
01:25:12,526 --> 01:25:13,944
Just leave them there. I'll clean up.

1413
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:14,987
It's okay.

1414
01:25:16,488 --> 01:25:17,447
You want coffee, right?

1415
01:25:17,531 --> 01:25:18,532
Yes, I'll make it.

1416
01:25:24,663 --> 01:25:26,081
Did they say it will rain today?

1417
01:25:26,415 --> 01:25:29,668
I don't know. Why?
Did the forecast say it would rain today?

1418
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:31,503
I'm asking because I don't know.

1419
01:25:31,586 --> 01:25:32,587
Right.

1420
01:25:35,716 --> 01:25:37,300
This is non-recyclable trash.

1421
01:25:39,928 --> 01:25:41,680
What time does U-ju usually wake up?

1422
01:25:41,763 --> 01:25:42,848
Whenever.

1423
01:25:43,098 --> 01:25:45,058
He wakes up when he wants to.

1424
01:25:45,434 --> 01:25:47,019
-What about this? Where?
-Give me that.

1425
01:25:47,102 --> 01:25:48,562
-I'll put that away.
-Okay.

1426
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:50,063
This is food waste, right?

1427
01:25:50,147 --> 01:25:51,815
Yes. Put it in there.

1428
01:25:51,898 --> 01:25:52,899
Okay.

1429
01:25:53,567 --> 01:25:55,986
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1430
01:25:58,780 --> 01:25:59,823
Hello.

1431
01:25:59,906 --> 01:26:02,117
Aren't you Ms. Song Su-bin?
Ik-jun's bestie?

1432
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,619
Yes, I am. Hello, Professor Chae.

1433
01:26:06,038 --> 01:26:07,581
-Come sit down.
-Okay.

1434
01:26:08,582 --> 01:26:10,250
I didn't know you had a grown-up daughter.

1435
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:12,502
She's in eighth grade.

1436
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:15,047
I didn't see this coming at all.

1437
01:26:15,714 --> 01:26:18,091
All of a sudden, she said
her peripheral vision was gone,

1438
01:26:18,175 --> 01:26:20,052
so I took her to an ophthalmologist.

1439
01:26:21,178 --> 01:26:23,180
The doctor told me to see a neurosurgeon.

1440
01:26:24,306 --> 01:26:26,391
But So-mi is okay, right?

1441
01:26:32,314 --> 01:26:34,608
She hasn't had her first period yet?

1442
01:26:36,443 --> 01:26:40,113
No. Is that a problem?

1443
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:43,867
I see.

1444
01:26:47,037 --> 01:26:49,289
-Today is D-Day, right?
-Yes.

1445
01:26:49,748 --> 01:26:51,041
Once Mr. Pyeon goes to court

1446
01:26:51,124 --> 01:26:54,169
and delivers the final decision
this afternoon,

1447
01:26:54,252 --> 01:26:55,879
we can put this behind us for good.

1448
01:26:56,213 --> 01:26:58,715
Goodness, we should get a drink tonight.

1449
01:26:58,799 --> 01:27:00,592
Does Jun-wan have a symposium today?

1450
01:27:00,842 --> 01:27:03,261
Yes. He said he was
at some hotel in Gangwon Province.

1451
01:27:03,345 --> 01:27:04,846
He must have left by now.

1452
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:09,351
Are you going to get that?

1453
01:27:09,434 --> 01:27:10,310
HEAD SECRETARY

1454
01:27:10,393 --> 01:27:12,562
Why is the head secretary calling me?

1455
01:27:12,938 --> 01:27:14,022
Whose head secretary is it?

1456
01:27:15,565 --> 01:27:16,566
Chairman Yang's.

1457
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:43,848
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1458
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,353
-Where is he?
-It's an aortic dissection

1459
01:27:48,436 --> 01:27:50,104
with DeBakey Type One.
His BP is 70 over 40.

1460
01:27:50,188 --> 01:27:51,898
I'm arranging an OR now.

1461
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:54,609
Shit.

1462
01:28:13,211 --> 01:28:14,379
I'll tell her.

1463
01:28:19,717 --> 01:28:20,635
Ma'am,

1464
01:28:21,219 --> 01:28:23,137
I did perform the surgery.

1465
01:28:24,013 --> 01:28:25,640
But his aorta ruptured,

1466
01:28:25,723 --> 01:28:27,892
so I proceeded with the surgery
while performing CPR.

1467
01:28:29,185 --> 01:28:31,020
But his heart stopped beating for a while,

1468
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:33,481
so I'm not sure if he'll wake up.

1469
01:28:34,732 --> 01:28:36,359
Let's keep an eye on him for a few days.

1470
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:38,820
And if he still doesn't wake up by then,

1471
01:28:42,323 --> 01:28:44,284
he might not be able to wake up at all.

1472
01:28:47,412 --> 01:28:48,663
I'm sorry.

1473
01:29:06,723 --> 01:29:09,434
Come here and sit down.
Your legs must hurt.

1474
01:29:09,517 --> 01:29:10,351
I'm okay.

1475
01:29:11,019 --> 01:29:12,687
I have something to tell you.

1476
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:13,813
Please sit.

1477
01:29:18,109 --> 01:29:19,068
Mom.

1478
01:29:21,863 --> 01:29:23,281
Do you mean it?

1479
01:29:25,825 --> 01:29:26,868
Yes.

1480
01:29:27,452 --> 01:29:29,996
I will not divorce him.

1481
01:29:33,624 --> 01:29:36,878
Don't go to court to mediate the divorce.

1482
01:29:37,462 --> 01:29:40,923
Tell the court
that I do not wish to divorce him.

1483
01:29:42,258 --> 01:29:43,634
I still

1484
01:29:46,929 --> 01:29:47,889
love him.

1485
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:13,631
Subtitle translation by Won-hyang Son

1486
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,891
Professor Chae, it's my birthday today.

1487
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:33,518
<i>There's a present I want.</i>

1488
01:30:33,601 --> 01:30:36,187
<i>Song-hwa, I don't know
how I'm supposed to feel.</i>

1489
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:38,398
I don't know if I'm sad or relieved.

1490
01:30:38,481 --> 01:30:40,441
<i>I already talked to the chairman.</i>

1491
01:30:40,525 --> 01:30:43,403
Why did you decide something
like that without talking to us first?

1492
01:30:43,486 --> 01:30:45,154
<i>I like you a lot.</i>

1493
01:30:45,238 --> 01:30:47,365
So I want to make
only good memories with me.

1494
01:30:47,448 --> 01:30:49,158
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1495
01:30:49,242 --> 01:30:51,536
<i>This is your last year here?
Did something happen?</i>

1496
01:30:51,619 --> 01:30:53,996
Does it mean
this is Gyeo-ul's first solo surgery?

1497
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,916
<i>I'm a nobody to Professor Ahn.</i>

1498
01:30:56,999 --> 01:30:59,460
<i>Professor Chae, do you remember that day?</i>

1499
01:30:59,544 --> 01:31:01,003
<i>My first day here as an intern.</i>

1500
01:31:01,087 --> 01:31:03,423
<i>I saw you on my first day of work.</i>

1501
01:31:05,216 --> 01:31:06,634
Ask me anything you want.

1502
01:31:06,717 --> 01:31:09,262
Has there been a moment
when you considered

1503
01:31:09,345 --> 01:31:12,890
Professor Chae
to be more than just your friend?

1504
01:31:12,974 --> 01:31:14,976
<i>In Hawaii? Were you crazy?</i>

1505
01:31:15,059 --> 01:31:15,977
<i>It's a secret.</i>

1506
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:17,979
<i>Especially,
your brother can never find out.</i>

1507
01:31:18,062 --> 01:31:21,399
You're dating her quite long this time.
She must be a catch.

1508
01:31:21,482 --> 01:31:23,025
<i>What I want isn't getting married.</i>

1509
01:31:23,109 --> 01:31:24,986
<i>It's to be with you for a long time.</i>

1510
01:31:25,069 --> 01:31:27,238
Give me your hand.
I have something to give you.
