368
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,320
is specially invented for putting out a fire
at a high altitude.

369
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,040
What a useless thing!

370
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,240

And our firefighters can climb the stairs too.

373

What's the point of using that?

374
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,400
There are time and height restrictions

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,280
We can do that now too!

384
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,760
So what? Did I say we can't?

385
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Are you looking down at our drone?

386
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,240
(Chief Huo! Chief Huo! There is a mission for you.)

387
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,640
(You need to bring Doctor Yan out
for an operation.)

388
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,480
Did I say I'm looking down on you?

389
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,400
Got it. I'll be right there.

390
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,240
Are you looking down on our training?

391
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,600
Did I say I am looking down on our training?

392
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,000
If I am looking down on our training,

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,960
what's the point of me being here?

394
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,200
Huo... Chief Huo has left!

395
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,880
So what?

396
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,680
Are you still going to argue with me?

397
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,200
Come on!

398
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,920
-Come on!
-Come on!

399
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
I'm not arguing with you!

400
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,480
I don't even want to argue with you.

401
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,750
[Jiangsu Fire and Rescue]
[Nanjing Team]

402
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,640
[Luo Jie]

403
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,200
Luo Jie. What's wrong?

404
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,400
My meeting just ended.

405
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,200
What are you doing?

406
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,280
I am applying my mask.

407
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,040
Is everything okay after joining our team?

408
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,840
Not bad.

409
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,840
No one angered you, right?

410
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,560
Tell me if someone makes you unhappy.

411
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,680
I'll make them apologize to you one by one.

412
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,000
In that case, I really want him to apologize to me.

413
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,680
Who?

414
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,640
Who bullied you?

415
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,000
(No.)

416
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,400
I was kidding. It's fine.

417
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
I shall end our call here.

418
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,240
I need to wash my face.

419
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,000
See you...

420
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,400
Tomorrow.

421
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,800
Have a seat.

422
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,320
Thank you.

423
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,200
Have a seat.

424
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,520
You're so pretty today.

425
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
You look younger.

426
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,600
Did Auntie buy this for you?

427
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,000
My mother forced me to wear this.

428
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,000
You look good on it.

429
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,720
Don't you tell anyone else.

430
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,880
Hey! Stop drinking.

431
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,600
You have high blood pressure recently.

432
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,200
What are you doing?

433
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Let me take a picture.

434
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,400
No way!

435
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,680
Just one picture.

436
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Quite strong.

437
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,640
Hey!

438
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,680
Brother.

439
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,280
Move aside.

440
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,040
I want to sit with Sister Yan Lan.

441
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,440
Okay.

442
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,520
You shall sit here.

443
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,400
My little sister wants to sit in the middle.

444
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,920
She wants to sit with you.

445
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,400
Yes. She wants to sit with her sister.

446
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,600
Luo Jie is so much older than her,

447
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,720
but he always takes care of her.

448
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,760
Yes.

449
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,400
My son only looks cold outside.

450
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,600
He's very caring inside.

451
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,840
His occupation is the only thing
that I am worried about.

452
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,320
Look! His father's having some health issues.

453
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
It's hard to maintain his business.

454
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,560
He doesn't even offer to come back
and help his father.

455
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,840
Oh, right!

456
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,640
Lan!

457
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,680
Why don't you help me to talk to him?

458
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,680
Jie listens to you since young.

459
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,080
Mom.

460
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,240
Look how suitable Luo Xiao Yan is
to be the heir of our family business!

461
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,800
Look!

462
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,720
She is so smart and willing to
take over our dad's position.

463
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,120
You should train her instead.

464
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
You lost the older one.

465
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,480
So don't you lose the younger one too!

466
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,000
What are you saying?

467
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,040
Auntie.

468
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,400
I think firefighters are very good.

469
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,200
They are heroes who risk themselves.

470
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,040
Many people admire firefighters.

471
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,240
You should be proud of him instead.

472
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,440
Come on!

473
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,520
Having one of you

474
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,560
as a hero who rescues people is enough.

475
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,960
When you get married,

476
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,920
one of you needs to take care of your family.

477
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,680
Yes.

478
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,080
Hey! Lan.

479
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,680
My son isn't smarter than you
since he was young.

480
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,080
He shall take care

481
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,160
of the family instead.

482
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,800
Mom.

483
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,680
Auntie. I'm just...

484
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,120
We haven't planned so far ahead yet.

485
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,080
Mainly, Yan Lan...

486
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,960
She isn't ready to date yet.

487
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,080
You're making us awkward.

488
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,880
Look at you, Luo Jie.

489
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,800
Both of you grew up together.

490
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,040
You are childhood sweethearts.

491
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,560
Moreover...

492
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,880
Our families... Four of us are good friends.

493
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,640
We are so close.

494
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,640
What a destiny.

495
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,240
Yes!

496
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,440
Yes.

497
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:16,920
Lan.

498
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,920
I have pre-approved you

499
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,360
as my daughter-in-law.

500
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,480
Yes.

501
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,800
I have pre-approved you as my son-in-law too.

502
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,040
Au... Auntie.

503
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,840
Luo Jie and I are good friends.

504
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,720
We are best friends. Am I right?

505
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,680
Yes. Forever.

506
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,040
Lan.

507
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,080
-Come on!
-Let's eat!

508
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,600
Cheers!

509
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,160
Come on! Cheers!

510
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,640
Come on!

511
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,320
Come on!

512
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,560
Since you are firefighters who just
graduated from universities...

513
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,400
Since you know nothing...

514
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,680
Sir!

515
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,920
I shall explain it to you one last time.

516
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,080
I wasn't scared.

517
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,760
I just didn't want to

518
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,240
fool around with you, immature people!

519
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,120
You never do a proper job!

520
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,320
But you always fool around!

521
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,000
Who taught you this posture?

522
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,000
Why isn't learning to fly a drone a proper job?

523
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,000
Squad Leader!

524
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,760
You should be more open-minded.

525
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,520
Who said that learning to fly a drone
isn't a proper job?

526
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,800
You can learn to fly a drone privately.

527
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,520
Why do you have to do it publicly?

528
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,440
You distracted our usual training.

529
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,840
You can't do that!

530
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,240
Aren't they the same thing?

531
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,160
In this new generation,

532
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,080
learning to use new firefighting
and rescue technologies

533
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,560
should be part of our training in the first place.

534
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:37,960
Am I right?

535
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,920
Yes.

536
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Who allowed you to talk?

537
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Did you make a request?

538
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,960
I request!

539
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Can't I correct you?

540
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,800
You always talk back.

541
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,480
Are we chattering here?

542
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,520
Jiang Tong!

543
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,560
Come out!

544
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,840
Get ready for push-ups!

545
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,040
What are you looking for?

546
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,560
How boring are push-ups!

547
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,680
Let's do that instead!

548
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,480
What? Which one?

549
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,640
This one.

550
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,600
That one?

551
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
Stop joking around, okay?

552
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,280
When that is spun around,

553
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,640
you need to support yourself solely
by your arms.

554
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,920
If you fail to support yourself and fall,

555
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,520
your dream to be a firefighter will be doomed...

556
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,760
Make a request before you speak next time!

557
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,680
Yes!

558
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,720
The passing mark for a gyroscope at Nanjing

559
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,200
is 20 rounds in two minutes.

560
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,440
If I am able to complete that,

561
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,600
please take back

562
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,520
your words about us fooling around.

563
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,760
Learning new technologies isn't a foolish thing.

564
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,200
Stop having prejudice.

565
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,600
You should be more open to new things.

566
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,640
You're still so stubborn.

567
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,600
Alright.

568
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,920
Alright!

569
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,040
I shall fulfill your dream.

570
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,200
Come on!

571
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,640
Are you sure? Don't overexert yourself.

572
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,320
Stop your nonsense.

573
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,520
Why are you rushing?

574
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,240
I'm not done yet.

575
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,160
It's not too late to regret now.

576
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,480
It's not too late to regret now.

577
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,560
I am not regretting it.

578
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,880
Start!

579
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,320
Are you stupid?

580
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,720
One!

581
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,640
You can't spin it like this!

582
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Are you treating it as a dryer?

583
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:17,920
I'll do it.

584
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,200
Continue!

585
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,520
Two!

586
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,840
Three! Faster!

587
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,520
Four!

588
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,120
Five!

589
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,800
Six!

590
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,640
Seven!

591
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,800
Eight!

592
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,080
Nine!

593
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,040
It's enough, okay?

594
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,680
Ten!

595
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,240
Stop!

596
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,720
Enough!

597
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,280
Enough!

598
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,440
Come... Come down.

599
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,840
Time's not up yet.

600
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,840
Before time's up,

601
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,320
you will be killed instead.

602
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,320
Come...

603
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,960
I don't need you to tell me these.

604
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,280
-Impressive, university graduates.
-Continue!

605
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,680
Continue!

606
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,600
Hold tighter.

607
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,200
Twelve!

608
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,920
Thirteen!

609
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,200
Fourteen!

610
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,280
Move aside!

611
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,760
Can't you be quick-witted?

612
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,840
Useless men! What did you learn?

613
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,640
Yes!

614
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,520
Didn't you say...

615
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,760
Here!

616
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,680
Xiao Lin.

617
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,600
Boss!

618
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,880
You always take care of my business.

619
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,000
Here are some ice jellies for free.

620
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,680
Thank you!

621
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,320
I'll do it.

622
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,880
Okay. Give it to her first.

623
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,440
Thank you.

624
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,200
Thank you, Boss.

625
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,840
Enjoy!

626
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,080
Are you giving us a discount?

627
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,760
Of course!

628
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,720
Senior.

629
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,480
Aren't you staying in the fire station?

630
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,280
Did you sneak out today?

631
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,920
What's wrong?

632
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,960
Can't I do that?

633
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,480
Hey!

634
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,400
Eat first.

635
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,360
I need to go to the washroom.

636
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,600
Save some for me.

637
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:19,800
Humph!

638
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,240
Miss.

639
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,040
Are you calling me?

640
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,120
This doll is so pretty.

641
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,160
Where did you buy it?

642
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,400
Huh?

643
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,960
You're saying that this doll is pretty, right?

644
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,440
Yes.

645
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,040
I... I didn't buy this.

646
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,480
My son gave it to me.

647
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,160
Oh!

648
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,880
Your son is so nice.

649
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,080
Miss, my...

650
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,480
friends are waiting for me.

651
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
I shall leave first.

652
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,440
Not bad.

653
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,960
You saved some for me.

654
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,080
This ice jelly is really good.

655
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,760
Try it.

656
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,600
Okay.

657
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,280
Wow!

658
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,120
Yes! It's nice!

659
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,120
Yan Lan?

660
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,160
Long time no see.

661
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,040
Hey!

662
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,040
What a coincidence.

663
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,640
What a coincidence.

664
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,840
Who is he?

665
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,560
Her ex-boyfriend.

666
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,840
This is the case.

667
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,600
I am getting married next week.

668
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,800
I will send you an invitation.

669
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,160
You will come, right?

670
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,720
I am quite busy in the hospital recently.

671
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,280
I can't promise.

672
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,600
Are you too busy to date?

673
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,360
If it weren't for Luo Jie,

674
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,200
maybe you would be my bride.

675
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,680
Do you have anything else to say?

676
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,160
When are you getting married to Luo Jie?

677
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,640
A qualified ex

678
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,720
should act like a dead man.

679
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,200
This is a basic manner of a man.

680
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,360
Do you know?

681
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,000
Wait. Who are you?

682
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,680
Who do you think I am?

683
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,240
He is Yan Lan's boyfriend.

684
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,920
Oh, right!

685
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,080
Thanks for your invitation.

686
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,440
We will attend it.

687
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,120
Anything else?

688
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,080
Enjoy your meal then.

689
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,560
Aww!

690
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,920
I am sorry.

691
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,960
Join us for this meal!

692
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,360
Let's eat together!

693
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,840
No thanks.

694
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,080
Enjoy your meal.

695
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,600
My mom is in there.

696
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,520
Ask your mom to join us then.

697
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,360
-Let's eat together!
-No thanks.

698
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,560
Aww!

699
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,040
I... I am really...

700
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:33,760
I...

701
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
I saw a girl

702
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,680
in the bathroom earlier.

703
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,840
She is really cute and likable.

704
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,040
You...

705
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Go out and check

706
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,280
which table she's at

707
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,840
and who she's eating with.

708
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,560
Okay?

709
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,960
The way she looked at me...

710
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Listen to me.

711
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,960
She seemed very friendly.

712
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,360
Her gaze was very kind.

713
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,600
She had a ponytail

714
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,200
and was wearing a blue dress

715
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,120
with flowers on it.

716
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,880
She had big eyes and pale skin.

717
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,760
The moment you saw her,

718
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,480
she stood out.

719
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,480
Stop.

720
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,160
Are you starting again?

721
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,760
Let's eat.

722
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,400
Director Li.

723
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,720
Let's meet another day.

724
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,920
Okay.

725
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,680
Mr. Han.

726
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,840
Sorry to keep you waiting.

727
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,200
Mr. Luo.

728
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,720
Director Li

729
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,400
from the drug testing center just called.

730
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,720
He was asking

731
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,680
when we will send the next batch of medicine

732
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,160
for clinical trials.

733
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,800
After all these years of running
a business in Nanjing,

734
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,720
these sources all trust us very much.

735
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,640
See?

736
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,560
As soon as news of the next batch came out,

737
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,040
my phone hasn't stopped ringing.

738
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,400
Director Li and I

739
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,520
are also very close.

740
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,440
He was asking

741
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,240
about the PD-1 monoclonal antibody

742
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,760
just a few days ago.

743
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,440
It must be tough for him.

744
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,080
But compared to the normal medicine

745
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,200
out on the market already,

746
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,360
my clinical trials are harder to conduct.

747
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,000
The market needs

748
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,920
safe and effective patents.

749
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,640
Especially for a new type

750
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,240
of DNA-based medicine like mine.

751
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,920
Am I right, Mr. Luo?

752
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,360
Yes.

753
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,040
But creating medicine

754
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,040
isn't easy.

755
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,040
You need a lot of...

756
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,160
What's most important

757
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,760
are large, organized factories

758
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,200
like yours

759
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,000
to ensure the consistency
and stability of the product.

760
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,040
This is also

761
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,840
why I came here today.

762
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,520
I think

763
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,640
that if we can work together,

764
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,640
then it would be the joining

765
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,040
of two strong teams.

766
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,960
You really are young and promising.

767
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,120
Younger people like you have the
creativity to create new medicine.

768
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,160
But you can't do production and sales

769
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,440
without tens of years

770
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,360
of experience.

771
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,040
Of course.

772
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,400
Look.

773
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
The Luo brand

774
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,080
was built on 20 years of my effort.

775
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,080
There are many companies

776
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,280
that want to work with us

777
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,240
and use our name.

778
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,320
But our standards are very high.

779
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,080
You need to be both genuine

780
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,080
and talented.

781
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,120
Mr. Luo.

782
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,960
After hearing you say that,

783
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,160
I feel even better.

784
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,120
Don't just think about how young I am.

785
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm not exaggerating,

786
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,360
but I am fully confident

787
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,120
in my skills and my product.

788
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,960
That's why in the past,

789
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,040
I've never bothered with companies

790
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,760
that don't have standards.

791
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,520
What is a corporation?

792
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,640
I think it's all about

793
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,680
using our strengths to win together.

794
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,840
Look.

795
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,160
Your medicine factory is an
established corporation.

796
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,000
Your strength

797
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,120
is your production experience
after all these years,

798
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,560
as well as your sales avenues.

799
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,080
As for my strengths,

800
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,040
it's new product development

801
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,440
and creativity.

802
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,000
Those who match well

803
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,800
will take what we each need

804
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,320
to be successful together.

805
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,680
That's the most important.

806
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,680
A successful partnership
is built on winning together.

807
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,600
Mr. Han.

808
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,760
I heard that your father used to
work in chemical engineering.

809
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,200
Right.

810
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,120
Then are you able to get
certain lead compounds?

811
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,440
That's easy.

812
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,720
Just let me know.

813
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,840
That makes things easy.

814
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,440
Here.

815
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,920
Today,

816
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,640
Dongshan Station and Dongnan Hospital

817
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,480
will train in the field together

818
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,520
to increase the efficiency of our
firefighting and hospital teams.

819
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,480
Attention!

820
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,240
Count off!

821
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,200
One, two, three...

822
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,640
One, two, three, four, five,

823
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,000
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

824
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,240
eleven, twelve, thirteen,

825
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,040
fourteen, fifteen.

826
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,180
[Firefighting and Medical Field Training]

827
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,440
Chief.

828
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,120
The training team has assembled.

829
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,960
Please give orders.

830
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,600
Back in line.

831
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,360
Yes, sir.

832
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,760
Ye.

833
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,880
Today is our hospital and

834
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,240
Dongshan Station's Blue Eagle Rope Rescue Team's

835
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,280
first time training in the field together.

836
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,600
I hope that my colleagues

837
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,760
and our firefighters

838
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,280
will successfully complete
this mission together.

839
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,320
Thank you!

840
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,240
Sweat more on the daily,
bleed less during battle.

841
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,640
I hope that

842
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,240
[Firefighting and Medical Field Training]
everyone participating

843
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,160
[China Fire and Rescue]
will become one with their team

844
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,640
so that our teams

845
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,160
can become a solid foundation for the people.

846
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,680
Huo Yan, Luo Jie.

847
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,440
Here!

848
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,880
Split into a red and a blue team.

849
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,800
Begin.

850
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,240
Red team, count off.

851
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,520
Chief Huo, we need to go faster.

852
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
They're already leaving.

853
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,840
Preparation doesn't delay your task.

854
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,480
Everyone, carefully check your gear.

855
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,880
Don't forget anything.

856
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,520
The route isn't easy.

857
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,320
Firefighters, make sure

858
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
to take care of the medical team.

859
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,040
I'll give everyone one minute

860
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,840
to organize your gear.

861
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,000
Brother Wu, you lead the team today.

862
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,800
Hey.

863
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,670
Car King is leading?

864
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,080
Oh, man.

865
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,320
How are we going to win now?

866
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,600
Get ready to cook.

867
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,320
Chief Huo.

868
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,080
Why are you so unlucky?

869
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,000
The other team has all the aces.

870
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,440
Our Wu is a Car King while driving

871
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,920
and a wolf on the ground.

872
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,280
Alright, stop kidding around.

873
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,040
Red Team, get ready to leave.

874
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,880
Yes!

875
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,320
Wu, good luck.

876
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,480
Don't let us catch up with you.

877
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,480
Be careful.

878
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:43,800
Ji Yuan.

879
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,440
You go first.

880
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,400
I'll catch up.

881
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,230
Little Mole.

882
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,600
I'll carry your bag.

883
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,560
It's fine, I can do it.

884
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,630
Chief Luo.

885
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,920
We're not on the same team right now.

886
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,880
Who knows who will win?

887
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,880
If we're not on the same team,
we need to be aligned together.

888
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,840
Besides,

889
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,080
your team might not be able to protect you.

890
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,080
Brothers in my team,

891
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,800
take care of the girls on our team.

892
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,840
We don't need others to get involved.

893
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,720
Chief Huo, don't get too excited.

894
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
I used to let you off easy.

895
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,640
Be careful not to lose too badly.

896
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,560
Good luck.

897
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,120
How about this?

898
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,640
What?

899
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,640
I switched it to channel three.

900
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,120
Our walkie-talkies

901
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,000
also have GPS signals.

902
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,880
Contact me if anything happens.

903
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:30,880
Take it.

904
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,800
I'm leaving now. Good luck!

905
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,360
Chief Huo.

906
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,320
These two routes are equally difficult,

907
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,880
but this one is longer.

908
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,040
Choose the shorter one.

909
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,800
Look carefully.

910
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,640
Both of these routes go through the valley.

911
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,320
They chose the shorter one.

912
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
The contour lines are dense.

913
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,440
It'll get steep.

914
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,560
Instead of being forced to change routes,

915
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,400
we might as well get a head start.

916
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,280
Hurry and check your gear.

917
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,240
Prepare to leave.

918
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,680
Let's go!

919
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,800
Be careful, Darling.

920
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,800
Be careful.

921
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,160
Everyone stop.

922
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,200
Chief Luo.

923
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,720
Chief Luo.

924
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,960
Chief Luo.

925
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,160
This obstacle is to test

926
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,680
our ability to rescue by rope.

927
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,000
But the valley is too deep.

928
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,800
I think it'll be very difficult.

929
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,360
If we use a line thrower to deploy
a line and grapple across...

930
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,800
There's someone over there, right?

931
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
If the line can't get across,

932
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,760
he will raise his flag.

933
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,680
Let's do it your way.

934
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
You're in command today.

935
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,160
Chief Luo.

936
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,720
You should guide us on the side.

937
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,480
What if something goes wrong?

938
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,600
What could go wrong?

939
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,320
I trust you, Brother Wu.

940
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,000
Okay.

941
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,880
Ma, let's go.

942
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,520
Don't rush. Take it slow.

943
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,680
Chief Luo.

944
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,240
The distance is too far.

945
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,800
Our rope lines aren't long enough.

946
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,240
Wu, do you have any other ideas?

947
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,680
Chief Luo.

948
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,320
What about we let Ma try with a drone?

949
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,040
Let him check if there's a better place
to shoot the line.

950
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Good idea, let's do it.

951
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,600
