Ack!

193
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,480
I can't.

194
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,480
The window is sundries.

195
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,000
There should be a door next to you,

196
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,920
leading to the bedroom.

197
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,520
(Open it.)

198
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,160
(We will get you out from the bedroom window.)

199
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,520
There's a door here.

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,800
I can't. This door is locked.

201
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,520
(Break it open.)

202
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,120
(I know you can do it!)

203
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,400
(I believe in you!)

204
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay.

205
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,640
I'll try.

206

Thank you.

207

Don't rush. Stand still.

Be careful.

225
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,280
Be careful.

226
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,720
It's alright. You stay still and don't move.

227
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,040
Pull the rope around you.

228
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,840
Don't worry.

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,720
You be careful.

230
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,440

Okay.

Here, hold onto me.

233
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,000
Hold on.

234

Where's the little girl?

235
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,400
Don't worry.

236
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,720

Careful.

245
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,600
Slowly.

246
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,280
You hold onto her.

247
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,600
Okay.

As long as you're alright.

251
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,960
Are you sure you're not hurt?

252
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,680
I'm really fine.

253
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,480
Then I won't worry about you.

254
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,080
Go back first.

255
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,920
Okay, I'm going first.

256
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,320
Be careful.

257
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,160
Be careful on your way back.

258
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,480
Okay.

259
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,560

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,280
Yeah?

261
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,680
You're awake?

262
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,320
Yeah.

263
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,000
Still dizzy?

264
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm fine.

265
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,280

It's part of my job.

269
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,800
Your face really looks like a mole.

270
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,280
Is it really dirty?

271
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

272
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,720
Be careful from now on.

273
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,320
Hmm.

274
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,520
Don't always charge in first.

275
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,440
Got it.

276
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,560
You're alright?

277
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,120
Of course.

Roger that.

284
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,800

291
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,880

Him?

Anyway, she kept complimenting you.

00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,560
He's not just a firefighter.

344
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,840
He's also a chief.

345
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,800
Chief Luo?

You guys are nice, aren't you?

351
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,640
I'm having a clear soup hot pot,

352
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,480
but you're all enjoying the spicy broth.

353
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,120
That's harsh.

354
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,000
If you can't eat it, smelling it is good too.

355
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,600
You shouldn't eat spicy after getting hurt.

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,960

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,880
I have an actual question.

362
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,760
Do you know who Professor Li chose

363
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,720
to help with his research?

364
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,680
I heard about it,

365
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,880
but they haven't decided yet, right?

366
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,440
Right.

367
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,840
Did you not apply for it?

368
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,880
I did.

369
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,000
But they haven't decided yet.

370
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,240
That's good.

371
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,480
You're all here?

372
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,000
Do you want to eat hotpot with us?

373
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,040
No, I'm fine.

374
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,920
I just chatted with Professor Li.

375
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,480
What do you have to discuss with him?

376
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,760
I need to work hard and learn from him

377
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,600
so that I can contribute to his research.

378
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,080
What?

379
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,920
You got picked?

380
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
It's a party here.

381
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,720
Professor Ye.

382
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,600
Why aren't you home yet?

383
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,200
Wait.

384
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,760
Professor, you should join us too.

385
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,600
I'll get chopsticks for you.

386
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:16,920
Right!

387
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,400
It's alright.

388
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,320
I have something to tell you.

389
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,600
Yes?

390
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,960
I have a new study.

391
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,560
It's a study by our hospital and Dongshan Station

392
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,280
on the best practices for cooperation
between medical and firefighting teams.

393
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,200
This study is very important

394
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,800
to see how we can improve

395
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,120
in this area.

396
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,280
You go with me.

397
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,160
Alright.

398
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,720
You're being picky?

399
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,560
I'm looking forward to working together

400
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,080
and presenting a viable plan

401
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,240
in the next few months.

402
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,200
Yes.

403
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,400
Alright, you guys enjoy it.

404
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,120
I'm leaving.

405
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,000
Professor Ye. Will you often

406
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,400
stay in Dongshan Station for this study?

407
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,320
Yes, the Dongshan Station we're working with.

408
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,040
Alright, bye.

409
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,960
Goodbye, Professor.

410
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,680
Bye-bye.

411
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,360
Director Li,

412
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,160
you must understand.

413
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,720
The car accident in the tunnel

414
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,280
affected Han's Pharmaceuticals greatly.

415
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,200
The samples of our monoclonal
antibodies were destroyed.

416
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,400
But please give us the test results

417
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,280
according to our asks first.

418
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,040
This is a hard thing for me too.

419
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,920
We can only give you the results

420
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
for the new samples after clinical trials.

421
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,600
Director Li.

422
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,320
Don't worry about things
you shouldn't worry about.

423
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,000
I will give you the new samples soon. Rest assured.

424
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,200
Darling.

425
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,360
Check the group message

426
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,520
[Work hard today too]
and reply.

427
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,200
Mmm.

428
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,320
Why are you mmm-ing?

429
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,800
Check the group message.

430
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,280
Hurry.

431
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,400
Okay.

432
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,720
Look at how great of a friend I am.

433
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,600
How about it?

434
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,640
He's a gentle and comforting long-legged uncle.

435
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,240
Long-legged uncle?

436
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,200
But Luo Jie was right.

437
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,280
This person talks in a strange way.

438
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,640
You just remembered Luo Jie?

439
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
I'm telling you.

440
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,240
Even though Wu isn't as handsome as Luo Jie,

441
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,920
he wins by looking more loyal.

442
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,200
I'm telling you, he definitely knows
how to spoil others.

443
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,560
I know you the best.

444
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,680
I know you're not shallow like that.

445
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
But you're wrong.

446
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,680
I really am shallow.

447
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,080
I like people who are handsome.

448
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,560
If you like the handsome type,

449
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,280
why aren't you dating Luo Jie?

450
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,320
You... you asked him to have dinner with me?

451
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,280
Right.

452
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,160
I just wanted to thank him.

453
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,640
You're making it into a blind date.

454
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,040
I'm not going.

455
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,120
Or else, you go with me.

456
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,360
Why would I go?

457
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,960
Then I'm not going.

458
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,320
It's not that I can't go.

459
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,600
How about this?

460
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,680
Sunday night,

461
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,160
EN SPACE Restaurant

462
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,880
at the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.

463
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
I already made a reservation for you.

464
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,160
Let me have some of your good luck in love.

465
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,800
What good luck in love?

466
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,360
I got lucky because of my job.

467
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,120
The doctor noticed me.

468
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,920
Doctor?

469
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,560
Doctor?

470
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,880
I mean... we all went on the rescue mission

471
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,000
and wore the same uniform.

472
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,800
Why were you the only lucky one?

473
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,080
You have to be more confident.

474
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,400
I saw it.

475
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,120
He was chatting with her on WeChat
talking about dinner.

476
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,520
Wait, I have to rub his head too.

477
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,280
Alright.

478
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,640
Let me ask you two.

479
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,240
What?

480
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,800
Is it good

481
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,960
for the girl to pay for the dinner?

482
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,000
You really asked her out?

483
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,440
Wait, you really did?

484
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,080
Yeah.

485
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,040
I mean, Wu.

486
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,000
If the girl says she'll treat,

487
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,440
then she's just being polite.

488
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,240
Don't fall into the trap.

489
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,440
Pay attention closely.

490
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,040
I don't think so.

491
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,280
Based on my dating experience,

492
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,800
those who like

493
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,280
people in uniform like us

494
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,160
might be

495
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,000
a rich heiress

496
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,840
or a daughter of a fund.

497
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,960
Just let her pay if she wants to.

498
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,480
Stop kidding around.

499
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Which drama are you watching now?

500
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Please come back to reality.

501
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,440
Comrade Da Yin.

502
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,600
You don't have much dating experience,

503
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,080
so I won't blame you for not understanding.

504
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,400
Wu, it's not embarrassing to marry
into the girl's family.

505
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,200
Stop arguing.

506
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,800
You guys arguing makes me nervous

507
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,160
and anxious.

508
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,480
Don't be nervous or anxious.

509
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,120
Go shower with me.

510
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,400
Wait, Wu.

511
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,120
You can't shower with him.

512
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,400
Why not?

513
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,360
It's not safe.

514
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,960
Li Yan Liang!

515
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,520
You just have to bring that up, right?

516
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:13,960
No.

517
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,840
Right?

518
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,440
No, no.

519
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,920
Why are you so mean?

520
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm going on my own.

521
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,320
I need a minute to cool down.

522
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm very angry right now!

523
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,880
I'm sorry, sorry.

524
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,680
Da Yin.

525
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,480
Hello?

526
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,600
[Nurse's Station]
I just came out of Yan's room.

527
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,960
You're not at the hospital?

528
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,560
I bought brown sugar milk tea for you.

529
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,440
It's on your desk.

530
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,240
You just recovered.

531
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
Make sure you're getting rest.

532
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,120
Take care of yourself when I'm not around.

533
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Alright, you go then.

534
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,760
I'm hanging up.

535
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,120
Chief Luo.

536
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,600
Me?

537
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,680
Of course you.

538
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,240
Is there another Chief Luo here?

539
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,400
Do we know each other?

540
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,920
Don't you come to our hospital often?

541
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,400
You're also the chief of
our partner organization,

542
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,360
Dongshan Station.

543
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,640
I'm deputy chief.

544
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,120
That's not important.

545
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,240
Let's add each other on WeChat.

546
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,400
That way if something comes up at work,

547
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,440
we can discuss it together.

548
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,000
Or we can also discuss things
that are not about work too.

549
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,080
Come on.

550
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,680
How about this?

551
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,840
You can also ask me about Yan Lan

552
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,000
and what she's up to.

553
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,360
Okay, thank you.

554
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,440
I'll scan your code.

555
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,200
I added you.

556
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,280
Okay.

557
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,080
Let's grab dinner later, Chief Luo.

558
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,640
Okay.

559
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,600
[Be loyal to the party, be disciplined.]
Reply 1988,

560
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,880
episode 8, scene 26.

561
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,240
You're here?

562
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,120
Right!

563
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,720
Just like that!

564
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,800
Are you feeling numb?

565
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,920
Like your whole body is going soft, right?

566
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,520
This is called

567
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,480
the head pat.

568
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,520
During the first date,

569
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,880
you have to listen more and talk less.

570
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,200
Don't expose your shortcomings to the girl.

571
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,760
What's the most important thing

572
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,040
when having your first date?

573
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,400
It's to show

574
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,880
how different you're treating her from others.

575
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,680
Don't ever treat her differently.

576
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,600
You want the girl to feel

577
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,960
[Must be polite ]
that we're polite and well-educated

578
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,800
[Gentlemen]
like a gentleman.

579
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,440
You need to

580
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,040
keep your distance and be polite

581
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,440
to others.

582
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,400
Towards her?

583
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Be gentle, caring, enthusiastic,
and take initiative.

584
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,440
If you can use actions, then don't use words.

585
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,880
If you can stay silent, then don't use actions.

586
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,680
Just act like this.

587
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,120
Wu, look at me.

588
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,520
Yes.

589
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,400
Yes.

590
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,240
Yes?

591
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,720
Yes?

592
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,760
Yes.

593
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,240
Yes what?

594
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,120
The biggest pet peeve on a date
is only answering with sounds.

595
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,680
She'll feel like you're just skimping.

596
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,400
Chief Huo. Chief Huo.

597
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,080
Wu.

598
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,240
Chief Huo.

599
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,200
I already told you.

600
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,360
I feel like

601
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,440
Da Yin and Yan Liang aren't reliable.

602
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,960
Wu.

603
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,200
I'm not very good at this either.

604
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,240
Chief Huo, don't be so humble.

605
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,960
No matter what, you're more
dependable than those two.

606
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,560
Right?

607
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,080
How about this?

608
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,640
Pretend that you're on a date with me.

609
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,240
Oh.

610
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,400
Let's have a chat.

611
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,480
Hello, Wu Zheng.

612
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,200
Nice to meet you.

613
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,120
Nice to meet you.

614
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,280
What are we eating?

615
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,760
I'm asking you, what are we eating?

616
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,600
Any... anything's fine.

617
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,360
Anything.

618
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,760
Wait, Chief Huo.

619
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,440
I... I'm really nervous.

620
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,040
As soon as you got me into the mood,

621
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,880
I got really nervous.

622
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,120
I... I don't know how to chat.

623
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,240
Do you know what I mean?

624
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,160
Hello?

625
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,840
Chief Chen?

626
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Yes, I'm with Huo Yan.

627
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,520
Chief Chen said

628
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,640
he called you and you didn't pick up.

629
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,200
Oh.

630
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,560
There's a research study he wants
to discuss with you.

631
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,120
Oh, oh.

632
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,360
You can come to the squadron to find me.

633
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,160
I mean, to find him.

634
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,520
Okay.

635
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,480
Bye.

636
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,920
I got it.

637
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,080
Here.

638
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,560
Can you hear me?

639
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,760
Yes.

640
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,080
When the girl talks,

641
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,920
tilt to your side.

642
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,440
The sound will be clearer.

643
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,240
When you answer her questions,

644
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,200
don't rush.

645
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,120
Say what I say.

646
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,120
Got it?

647
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,280
Got it.

648
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,520
You got this.

649
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,560
You got this!

650
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,120
Why isn't he here yet?

651
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,760
Hello, Bai?

652
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,400
Where are you?

653
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,840
Yan Lan.

654
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,640
Something urgent came up.

655
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,320
I can't make it today.

656
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,200
I'm so sorry.

657
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,200
You and him...

658
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,440
Have fun!

659
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,680
Alright, I'm hanging up.

660
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,600
What a true friend.

661
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,800
Brother Wu.

662
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,320
I'm so sorry.

663
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,680
I'm late.

664
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Sorry, I'm late.

665
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,560
No worries, I just got here.

666
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,160
Very nice to meet you.

667
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,320
It's nice to meet you.

668
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,200
Brother Wu, you don't need to do that.

669
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,920
I'm very happy to have met you
through the rescue mission.

670
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,440
I'm very happy to have met you
through the rescue mission.

671
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,800
We were fated to meet.

672
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,000
But the fire was really scary.

673
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,320
Hello, are you ready to order?

674
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,280
(Just a glass of sparkling water.)

675
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,080
Brother Wu?

676
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,440
Just a glass of sparkling water.

677
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,230
Brother Wu, do you want to order?

678
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,560
That line wasn't for you.

679
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,960
That line wasn't for you.

680
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,710
You said

681
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,190
you would tell me more

682
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,320
about Yan Lan at the hospital, okay?

683
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,000
No problem.

684
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,960
[EN SPACE]
This is the place.

685
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,360
I brought my coworkers here before too.

686
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,960
I promise you'll like it.

687
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,520
Does Yan Lan really like this place too?

688
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,920
I don't know.

689
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,080
But...

690
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,480
Chief Luo, what kind of girls do you like?

691
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,120
Do you need to ask?

692
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,120
Besides her, I've never liked anyone else.

693
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,560
Then if the girl you like

694
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,400
is with someone other guys,

695
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,560
will you give up on her?

696
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,480
Impossible!

697
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,880
Besides, giving up is up to me.

698
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,120
It has nothing to do with what she does.

699
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,600
You say that now,

700
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,880
but your actions might speak for themselves.

701
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:12,920
Let's go.

702
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,360
We'd like to order.

703
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,080
What can I get you?

704
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,000
Brother Wu, what would you like?

705
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,360
The ribeye.

706
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,480
The ribeye. Make it medium, please.

707
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,080
Okay.

708
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,280
I want that too.

709
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
We'll have two then.

710
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,600
Alright.

711
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,640
Wait a second.

712
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,400
We'd like to have two too.

713
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,400
Oh, alright.

714
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,600
Please wait.

715
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,560
Little Mole?

716
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,320
Luo Jie?

717
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,320
Chief Luo?

718
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,840
Wu?

719
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,120
Yeah.

720
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,120
You... you are...

721
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,760
Since we all know each other,

722
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,920
let's sit together.

723
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,280
Alright, together.

724
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,160
Here, together.

725
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,760
I'll sit here.

726
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,560
Relax, it's alright. Don't say anything.

727
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,880
You know each other?

728
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,280
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

729
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,400
We just met.

730
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,880
Brother Wu saved me last time.

731
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,520
I'm here to thank him.

732
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,680
Doctor Yan, don't be shy.

733
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,800
If this isn't a date,

734
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,000
would Brother Wu dress like this?

735
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,200
But someone experienced like Brother Wu

736
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,080
is a good choice.

737
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,080
I don't think Brother Wu is experienced.

738
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,080
He's capable.

739
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,880
Don't joke around.

740
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Being experienced isn't a bad thing.

741
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,320
Little Mole.

742
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,160
Yes?

743
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,040
If you want to thank Wu,

744
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,880
you should have told me.

745
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,360
Wu and I are very close.

746
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,880
I could have thanked him for you.

747
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,960
I can thank him on my own.

748
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,400
(It's fine.)

749
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,640
Oh right. You two are here...

750
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,400
On a date.

751
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,760
To eat.

752
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,120
Isn't that the same thing?

753
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,640
It's not.

754
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

755
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,560
It's rare

756
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,920
that we're all here today.

757
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:07,960
It's on me.

758
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,560
This steak is pretty hot.

759
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,400
I'll help you cut it.

760
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,920
It's fine, I can do it.

761
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,280
I got it.

762
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,200
Brother Wu, do you need help?

763
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,200
I can help you.

764
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,800
No need, no need.

765
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,800
That's sweet.

766
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,800
It's done.

767
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,120
Thank you.

768
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,400
Wu, I'll help you cut it.

769

Luo Jie.

770
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,120
Luo Jie.

771
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,680
I want mine cut too.

772
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,160
A girl should learn how to take care of herself.

773
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,200
Then what about her?

774
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,280
She's an animal.

775
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,040
Oh right, Brother Wu.

776
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,400
I asked you to have dinner tonight

777
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,720
to express my gratitude to you.

778
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,720
You risked your life to save me.

779
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,360
Well not just me,

780
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,760
but lots of other people.

781
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,200
This is our duty.

782
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,240
As a firefighter...

783
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,920
Rescuing and protecting the safety
of the people and their possessions

784
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,440
is every firefighter's

785
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,800
responsibility and duty.

786
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,080
I should thank you instead.

787
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
As a doctor, you're on the front lines...

788
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Rescuing people.

789
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,120
Only by us working together,

790
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,840
can we help save

791
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,480
and protect the public.

792
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,760
Doctor Yan.

793
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,200
Yeah?

794
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,160
Don't forget to thank yourself.

795
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,600
Wu.

796
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,200
Why do you sound like a veteran today?

797
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,440
Ahh.

798
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,120
Brother Wu,

799
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,240
you're making me feel embarrassed.

800
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,600
Wu.

801
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,400
Yeah?

802
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,000
You're trying very hard.

803
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,400
Okay, eat your steak.

804
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,120
It's getting cold.

805
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,800
Brother Wu.

806
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,520
Do you remember when we rescued
the pregnant lady in the tunnel?

807
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,960
I was totally flustered.

808
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,360
Thankfully you were there.

809
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,440
Do you remember?

810
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,640
Ahh...

811
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,120
The tunnel...

812
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,920
Yeah.

813
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,360
I remember at the time...

814
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
At the time, he showed the abilities

815
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,680
of a very skilled firefighter.

816
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,640
Back then, Brother Wu also...

817
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,400
He was also very brave,

818
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,440
so we should focus

819
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,640
and finish this dinner with him.

820
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,360
You mean the tunnel?

821
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,760
Right!

822
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,400
Actually, at the time...

823
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,800
Actually...

824
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,920
You didn't think that much.

825
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,200
That's what you should have done.

826
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,240
Luo Jie, stop interrupting.

827
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,680
Yan Lan wants to listen.

828
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,840
Brother Wu, tell us

829
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,400
about how brave you were.

830
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,440
That event

831
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,960
had... had nothing to do with me.

832
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,200
Actually...

833
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,000
The tunnel rescue

834
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
was mostly done

835
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,440
by Chief Luo and Deputy Chief Huo.

836
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,160
At the time, Deputy Chief Huo

837
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,280
suggested the plan.

838
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,920
That's why we could save all those people.

839
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,000

840
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,760
Brother Wu.

841
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,040
I know the chiefs contributed a lot.

842
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,480
But to me,

843
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,800
you helped me twice.

844
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,720
During the tunnel rescue,

845
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,320
I was at a complete loss.

846
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,960
You helped me calm down.

847
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,400
And during the fire,

848
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,600
when I almost gave up all hope,

849
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,960
your voice in the walkie-talkie

850
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,080
gave me hope.

852
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,160
No.
