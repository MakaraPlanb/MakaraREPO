193
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,440
Attention, everyone!

194
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,760
Stop training immediately!

195
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,120
It's a state of emergency.

196
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,800
(Comrades,)

197
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,080
(we've received an alarm message
from Doctor Yan Lan.)

198
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,800
(A nearby villager)

199
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,640
(entered the mountains last night
and hasn't returned.)

200
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,840
We will conduct search and rescue
in the mountains right now.

201
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,800
(Huo Yan's team)

202
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,120
(is closest to the incident site.)

203
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Contact Doctor Yan Lan immediately.

204
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,400
(Rush to the site to conduct search and rescue!)

205
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,480
Roger that.

206
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,720
Chief Chen, we can also do it.

207
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,320
Luo Jie's team,

208
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,800
seize the time now.

209
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,280
Lead the team back to the base camp

210
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,960
as fast as possible

211
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,800
(to prepare for the reception.)

212
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
(110 and 120 are on the way.)

213
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,720
(Get moving, everybody!)

214
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
Chief Chen, roger.

215
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,960
Return to base camp!

216
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,160
Hey!

217
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,720
Can you move?

218
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,120
I'll help you turn over.

219
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,960
Here, careful.

220
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,960
Be careful.

221
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,320
Here.

222
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,440
Lie flat.

223
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,000
Save me!

224
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,600
Let me take a check.

225
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,480
You have a femur fracture.

226
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,880
I have to fix it in place.

227
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,160
Help me.

228
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,720
Okay!

229
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,120
Sir.

230
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,080
You'll be alright. Just bear with it for a while.

231
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,840
(Yan Lan, Yan Lan! I'm Huo Yan.)

232
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,760
(Do you copy?)

233
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,720
I am!

234
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,560
I am Yan Lan.

235
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
I've found the person.

236
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,680
I'm fixing his wound now.

237
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,960
(I need a stretcher and first aid supplies.)

238
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,920
The sooner the better.

239
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,320
We're on our way to your location.

240
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,320
(Stay put and wait for us.)

241
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,400
Don't be afraid.

242
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,200
Okay!

243
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,760
Li Yan Liang!

244
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,640
Present!

245
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,960
Check the equipment. Set off!

246
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:45,960
Yes!

247
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
I'll fix your wound in place now.

248
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,680
Sir, don't fall asleep.

249
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,760
I'm done.

250
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,960
Don't worry.

251
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,600
The rescuers are on their way.

252
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,040
Hold on a little longer.

253
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,760
Save me.

254
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,640
We'll save you. Don't worry.

255
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,760
Faster!

257

Liang,

258
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,760
hit the anchor point. I'll go down.

259
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,200
Yes!

260
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,440

What happened?

295
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
The patient developed traumatic
pneumothorax symptoms.

296
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,600
Immediate intubation is required.

297
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,720
He needs surgery.

298
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,760
His chest is moving up and down.

299
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,800
The patient is breathing.

300
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,320
Fixing is completed.

301
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,760
According to the procedure,

302
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,320
he should be moved to a safe place
as soon as possible

303
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,960
to await the rescue from
professional medical staff.

304
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,720
I am a professional medical staff.

305
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,720
He has a punctured lung,

306
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,680
causing air to enter the pleural membrane
around the lungs.

307
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,760
The high intrathoracic pressure
causes the veins to dilate.

308
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,480
The chest is going up and down.

309
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,920
The left side is weaker than the right.

310
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,440
He is at risk of suffocation
and sudden death at any time.

311
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,720
The storm is coming soon.

312
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,680
If we don't move to a safe place as soon as possible,

313
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,320
we'll all be in danger.

314
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,680
I can feel obvious soft bulges under
the skin and there's crepitus.

315
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,640
It's a typical traumatic pneumothorax.

316
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,600
There may also be blood accumulation
in the chest.

317
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,360
Trust me.

318
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,960
He can't wait for the ambulance to come.

319
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,240
We have to artificially

320
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,560
lower the air buildup in his lungs.

321
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,120
Chief Huo!

322
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,840
There's no time.

323
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,600
The trapped person developed
traumatic pneumothorax.

324
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,360
There's a risk of suffocation
and sudden death at any time.

325
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,760
The on-site medical staff needs to
take emergency measures.

326
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,080
What measures?

327
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,040
It's urgent!

328
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,480
Intrathoracic pressure keeps increasing.

329
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,800
We can't wait for the paramedics!

330
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,320
Huo Yan,

331
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,240
you've learned to beat around the bush, huh?

332
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,440
The patient needs surgery!

333
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,280
(Huo Yan,)

334
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,080
(the most important thing you should do now)

335
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,240
(is to evacuate the wounded)

336
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,600
(from the dangerous place)

337
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,320
and wait for the professionals to do the rescue,

338
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,600
not to perform surgery.

339
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,840
Evacuate immediately!

340
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,800
(Yan Lan, Yan Lan!)

341
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,480
(Little Mole, Little Mole!)

342
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,600
(Are you going to operate on someone
in the wilderness?)

343
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,120
Listen to me.

344
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,520
Evacuate to a safe place first.

345
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,680
(Leave it to Huo Yan.)

346
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,920
(He'll handle it well.)

347
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,880
(Get the wounded out first)

348
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,040
before we talk about the rescue, okay?

349
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,560
The patient needs me.

350
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,960
I won't leave.

351
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,840
The mountain is not equipped for surgery!

352
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,640
(You will ruin your future by doing this!)

353
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,040
Yan Lan!

354
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,280
Yan Lan.

355
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,040
Are you ready?

356
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,080
I'm ready.

357
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,360
(Huo Yan.)

358
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,320
(Do you copy?)

359
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,880
Huo Yan rogers.

360
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,310
Transport the wounded up at once.

361
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,160
Stop the surgery!

362
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,720
Chief Chen, trust me.

363
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,520
The patient needs the surgery now.

364
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,039
(I trust you,)

365
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,800
(but people out there only
believe in the results!)

366
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,759
You will only harm yourself and Yan Lan

367
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,560
by doing this!

368
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,799
(You listen to me now.)

369
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,960
(Do what you're supposed to do)

370
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,280
(according to the procedure.)

371
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,240
Yan Lan,

372
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,160
are you confident about this?

373
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Doctors aren't gods.

374
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,360
I don't know if I can save him,

375
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,240
but if you move him now, he'll die.

376
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,240
