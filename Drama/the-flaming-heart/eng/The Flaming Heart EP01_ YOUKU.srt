00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,520
I was even scared for you.

378
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,720
Why were you so brave?

379
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,880
I was panicking too.

380
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,240
But that man was so calm.

381
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,160
That man?

382
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,440
Place your legs properly. Doctor Zhang.

383
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,920
Who?

384
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,800
The man on the phone.

385
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,680
What did he do to you?

386
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,680
Nothing. Work on your thesis!

387
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
You busybody.

388
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,800
Sir!

389
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,760
Come in!

390
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:02,880
Hey!

391
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,840
Isn't he... Isn't he that man?

392
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,520
Why is he here?

393
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,480
Is Chief Luo in trouble?

394
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,880
You know, we save a pregnant lady.

395
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,280
We removed the trunk back then.

396
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,640
I heard that the driver

397
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,120
turned to some public accounts for complaining.

398
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,440
He's asking us to compensate for his car.

399
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,360
Let me introduce him to you.

400
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,480
Huo Yan.

401
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,880
The new deputy chief of Dongshan Station.

402
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,000
He is Luo Jie.

403
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,960
You're from the same batch.

404
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,680
Oh!

405
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Did you meet each other
at the scene of the accident?

406
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
Yes.

407
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,920
Yan Lan. You look weird.

408
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,080
Who is he?

409
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,360
Do I look weird?

410
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,320
There's none.

411
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,960
Are you not even telling me?

412
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,040
How nice is Luo Jie!

413
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,160
But you're not considering Luo Jie.

414
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Aren't you weird enough?

415
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,840
Alright. Then, we shall

416
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,080
just go on separate ways.

417
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,440
Luo Jie and I are just...

418
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,880
Don't touch me!

419
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,800
We are good friends.

420
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,400
The man who helped me...

421
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,360
I feel thankful to him.

422
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,840
And...

423
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,160
His voice is good.

424
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,960
His voice is good?

425
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,640
Very good!

426
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,760
Alright! As long as you admit it.

427
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,920
I was worried that you wouldn't admit it.

428
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
What does he look like?

429
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,720
I didn't get to see him.

430
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,360
You don't know what he looks like?

431
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,200
Yes.

432
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,440
No way. Yan Lan.

433
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,600
How silly you are!

434
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,280
You don't even know what he looks like.

435
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,640
but you like him so much.

436
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,320
You're really...

437
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,040
You are seriously...

438
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,680
Never judge people by their appearance.

439
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,400
What if there's a surprise?

440
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,240
What if he's my ideal type?

441
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,600
What if he's a handsome man?

442
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Wouldn't we be a good match?

443
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,120
Professor Ye.

444
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,360
[Be loyal to the party. Be disciplined. Dash ahead]

445
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,880
[Work wholeheartedly for the people]
Chief Chen.

446
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,220
[Work wholeheartedly for the people]

447
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,040
Wu is...

448
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,520
Is this the time to mention Wu?

449
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,480
Shouldn't we promote

450
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,800
our frontliners first?

451
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,920
What's going on now?

452
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,320
We along with all comrades

453
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,120
worked hard together

454
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,160
for so long.

455
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,760
But you let a nobody

456
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,440
take over the position.

457
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,480
I don't agree with this.

458
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,600
Huo Yan. Graduated from Fire and Rescue Academy.

459
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,040
Within three years

460
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,400
in his previous fire station,

461
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,440
he achieved one merit citation of second class

462
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,520
and two merit citations of third class.

463
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
He's the champion in both

464
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,760
the Rope Team and the Ladder-Climbing team

465
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,040
of the Inter-division Firefighting Competition.

466
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,840
He ain't

467
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,480
a nobody as you said.

468
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,160
If Wu...

469
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,000
If what?

470
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,640
I'm telling you! Luo Jie.

471
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,200
You haven't even settled your problem.

472
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,280
The driver is complaining that

473
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,560
you broke his car at the scene.

474
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,400
How can you explain this?

475
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,040
At most I will compensate him.

476
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,280
It's just a car.

477
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,640
Are you acting like a toff here?

478
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,800
Sir!

479
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
You can't blame Chief Luo on this.

480
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,160
It was my idea.

481
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,400
If we didn't break open the car,

482
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,160
the victim trapped inside
would be in mortal danger.

483
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,720
Chief Luo did according to my command.

484
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,480
I am willing to take the blame.

485
00:21:59,480 --> 00:21:59,840
I...

486
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,240
I did according to your command?

487
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,000
I am the commander of this rescue operation.

488
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,480
Do you have the right to take the blame?

489
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,680
Do you consider yourself a veteran?

490
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,840
I am not treating myself as a veteran.

491
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
A right decision

492
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,800
can save people's lives.

493
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,600
I would never regret my decisions.

494
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
Why are you acting as a righteous man here?

495
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,680
Enough.

496
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,960
Huo Yan. I'm not scolding you,

497
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,720
but it doesn't mean that you're right.

498
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,800
Did you report to us

499
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,960
when you conducted this operation?

500
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,200
Did you have the right and status
to conduct the operation?

501
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,640
Regarding this matter,

502
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I am willing to write a self-reflection essay.

503
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,560
As for my decisions during the rescue,

504
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,080
I was not wrong.

505
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,120
Yan Lan.

506
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,200
You delivered a baby in that situation.

507
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,040
What if the pregnant lady

508
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,600
had a postpartum hemorrhage?

509
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,400
What if she had a bacterial infection

510
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,760
because of the inferior surroundings?

511
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,960
Had you considered these?

512
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,960
I am sorry.

513
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,600
It's not the time to take the blame now.

514
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,280
As a doctor,

515
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
we must consider these problems.

516
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,160
We have limited time and have no time to spare.

517
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,360
This is the characteristic and also the normality

518
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
of our job.

519
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,080
I'll take note of it.

520
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,360
You did a great job

521
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,480
at the scene.

522
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,560
You were very decisive.

523
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,480
I'm here to tell you one thing.

524
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,040
Professor Li has a module.

525
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,600
He is collaborating with the Department of
General Surgery. You would get to do surgeries.

526
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,960
Most of you

527
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,560
are going to be surgeons in the future.

528
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,920
So...

529
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,680
This is a rare and valuable opportunity.

530
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,240
There is only one vacancy.

531
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,720
You may proceed with your work.

532
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,520
What's so interesting here?

533
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,080
Commander-in-chief.

534
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:14,800
Chief.

535
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,480
Commander-in-chief.

536
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,240
What's going on?

537
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,800
Don't you mention this
if Chief Luo doesn't mention it.

538
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,840
In case we bring trouble to him.

539
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,160
Got it.

540
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,880
Go and check on Wu.

541
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,840
Brother Wu, don't take it seriously.

542
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,840
He was good at conducting the operation.

543
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,240
How was he good?

544
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,960
His legs are not even longer than Chief Luo's.

545
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,320
These two guys... They did a mistake.

546
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,160
I was asking them to write self-reflection essays.

547
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,600
What decade are we in now?

548
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,480
If writing a self-reflection essay
can fix a problem,

549
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,640
what's the point of having us here?

550
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,120
Yes.

551
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,240
I have heard about your matter.

552
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,520
It's even trending on Weibo.

553
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,040
Two commanders

554
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,040
in a rescue operation.

555
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,400
One directed to extinguish the fire,

556
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,040
another directed the rescue.

557
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,560
Not bad, huh?

558
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,280
Luo Jie.

559
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,080
We, 119 must not refuse any request.*
(* Lit.: Fire alarm number, also refers to fire brigade)

560
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,360
We can't make a mistake even if

561
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,680
it's only one centimeter or one second.

562
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,360
This is our job.

563
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,200
Do you understand?

564
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,960
Yes!

565
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,240
Huo Yan.

566
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,560
Here!

567
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,520
You're amazing, huh?

568
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
You joined and commanded

569
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,960
the operation right away.

570
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,320
You even got the information before our system.

571
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,120
Huh?

572
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,480
Minister Jiang.

573
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,360
Enough!

574
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,040
Stop fighting now.

575
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,240
You should learn from each other
and improve yourselves.

576
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,520
Do you understand?

577
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,400
Yes!

578
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,240
Yes!

579
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,400
Enough!

580
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,560
Let's stop here today.

581
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,560
You may leave.

582
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,000
Chief Chen.

583
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,000
You have a great sense.

584
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,920
You actually brought Huo Yan
to Dongshan Station.

585
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,800
That's great!

586
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,520
How should I put this?

587
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,800
He has courage, charm and capability.

588
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
But he still needs some training

589
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,120
to become a member of the elite.

590
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,560
Yes.

591
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,120
We must learn from our mistake this time,

592
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,720
you see.

593
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,920
People's lives are important.

594
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,640
But their properties

595
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,040
are important to them too.

596
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:49,840
Am I right?

597
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,200
Yes.

598
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,800
May I know which floor is
the Fire Station Affairs Department at?

599
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,960
My name is Jiang Tong.

600
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,240
We are teammates from now onwards.

601
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,720
Is it here?

602
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
No!

603
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,320
Thanks!

604
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:35,960
I am doomed.

605
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,040
But seriously...

606
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
It was really the typical encounter

607
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,840
of two main characters of a drama.

608
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,680
Following the plot of a drama,

609
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,400
misunderstandings and conflicts
would happen between them.

610
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,640
Then, they would hate each other.

611
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,120
But

612
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,080
once their misunderstandings are resolved,

613
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
they would get closer

614
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,680
and fall in love with each other!

615
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,640
But when they start

616
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,480
loving each other

617
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,880
and about to develop a deeper relationship...

618
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,720
Bang!

619
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,400
The male lead loses his memory
because of an accident.

620
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,880
The female lead is diagnosed with leukemia.

621
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,040
Mind your words.

622
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,440
You will lose your memory instead!

623
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,720
Yes! He didn't lose his memory.

624
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,320
He almost lost his dignity!

625
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,360
What are you laughing at?

626
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,440
What can I do now?

627
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,600
She saw my butt.

628
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
What can I do?

629
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,840
What's wrong? Why are you making noise here?

630
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,960
Chief Luo.

631
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,840
When Wang Da Yin was showering,

632
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,960
he was caught by a girl.

633
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,760
Boss. A girl came to our team.

634
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,440
When I was showering...

635
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,240
Seems that Jiang Tong is here.

636
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,160
Jiang Tong?

637
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,200
You know her too?

638
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,640
Is there anyone in Nanjing
Emergency Management System

639
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,920
that I, Ma Qian Li, don't know?

640
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,760
Hey.

641
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,080
But Jiang Tong is Minister Jiang's...

642
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,120
Enough. Stop spreading rumors.

643
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,240
Let's go and eat!

644
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,560
Let's go!

645
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,400
I'm not going. I'm embarrassed.

646
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,640
My shirt!

647
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,360
Doctor Yan.

648
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,360
Hey! You're finally here.

649
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,800
I will never want a child next time.

650
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,400
The child is not taking her medicine.

651
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,600
We tried our best.

652
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,440
Your turn.

653
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:23,880
Okay.

654
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,640
Princess Xiao Yan Zi.*
(* Lit.: A famous character in a costume drama)

655
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,800
Look what I bring you!

656
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
A doll?

657
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,280
Swallow it.

658
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,320
I am tricked by you again!

659
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,920
What's wrong?

660
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,480
Why aren't you taking the medicine?

661
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,960
They said once I finish
the medicine for this treatment,

662
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,600
I need to go through a surgery.

663
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,880
I don't want to go through a surgery.

664
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,880
Let me tell you a secret then.

665
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,440
I'm going to grab a mystery box this week.

666
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,120
Mystery box?

667
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,680
Can you bring me there too?

668
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,240
No way.

669
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,280
But...

670
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,320
If I get the one you like,

671
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,200
I can give it to you.

672
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,440
I'll let it accompany you
into the operation room, okay?

673
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,400
Really?

674
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,280
Yes.

675
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,840
Thank you, Sister Yan Lan!

676
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,680
So you're not being mischievous again, right?

677
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,480
Who's the patient inside the room?

678
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,640
Yan Lan cares about her so much.

679
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,480
Isn't there a handsome man, Luo,

680
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,600
chasing Yan Lan?

681
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,960
She's his younger sister.

682
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,040
Everyone!

683
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,440
Look to your right!

684
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,520
Look forward!

685
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,920
At ease!

686
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,080
Attention!

687
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,200
At ease!

688
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,680
I'm sure you heard about it!

689
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,000
Our minister came this morning

690
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,360
to learn about the incident yesterday.

691
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,000
The good news is...

692
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,880
No one in our team

693
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,480
will be blamed for this incident.

694
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,400
Why?

695
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,440
Because you did

696
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,600
what a firefighter should do.

697
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,760
I hope that this complaint

698
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,640
is just a small episode.

699
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,160
I hope that it would not affect

700
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,840
anyone of you.

701
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:10,800
From now onwards,

702
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,440
as long as you think it's right, do it boldly.

703
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,760
I will take the blame if an issue arises.

704
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,960
As the chief,

705
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,480
I still have the confidence

706
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,760
in protecting all of you.

707
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,120
Do you understand?

708
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,960
Yes!

709
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,520
I have another announcement.

710
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,240
Huo Yan!

711
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,120
Here!

712
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,840
You all know him, right?

713
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,640
From tomorrow onwards,

714
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,720
Huo Yan will officially become
the deputy chief of Dongshan Station.

715
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,440
Let's welcome him with a round applause!

716
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,480
Jiang Tong! Tian Zhi Peng! Cui Ying Shuo!

717
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,080
Here!

718
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,200
This batch of rookies

719
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,280
will be led

720
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,800
by Wang Da Yin.

721
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Wang Da Yin?

722
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,280
Attention!

723
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,480
At ease!

724
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,250
[CHINA FIRE AND RESCUE]

725
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,160
Dismiss!

726
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,400
Da Yin.

727
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,480
Let's go to take a shower!

728
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,280
Chief Chen.

729
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,480
Thank you for transferring me back here.

730
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,240
Oh,

731
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,120
I should thank you instead.

732
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,160
You're just here

733
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,240
and you caused such trouble.

734
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,440
Alright! You're taking up the position tomorrow.

735
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,320
I shall assign you a mission today.

736
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,080
Spend a good time with Sister Xian.

737
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,800
You wouldn't be so free next time.

738
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,680
Yes.

739
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,760
Oh, right.

740
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,640
Don't let our team down.

741
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,720
Sister Xian.

742
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,080
You shouldn't leave the fire burning
when you are not here.

743
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,440
This may cause an accident.

744
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,960
Is my dress pretty?

745
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
Did you hear me, Mom?

746
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,040
"Sister Xian".

747
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,240
Why did you call me Mom?

748
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,760
You are making me sound old. Do you know?

749
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,960
Residential fires

750
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,160
cover 36.9% of the fire accidents

751
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,000
every year.

752
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,360
