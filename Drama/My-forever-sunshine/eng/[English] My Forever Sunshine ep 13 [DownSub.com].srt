1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,319
There's some guy at the rose garden.

3
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,759
He really is handsome!

4
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,080
He is definitely your type.

5
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
I told Ling to invite Paeng.

6
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,120
So are you coming or not?

7
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,599
I'm not going.

8
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,759
- Who are you?
- Someone Paeng has to obey.

9
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
Ling, I have to go now.

10
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,879
They're being romantic in public.

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,439
They don't respect
you at all, Artit.

12
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,560
I'll see you at home, darling.

13
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,159
Where are you? Tell me!

14
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,120
He's your type? You like him?

15
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,120
Very much.

16
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,879
He's exactly my type.

17
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,919
Aueng,

18
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,199
what factory just exploded?
Look over there.

19
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,560
Wait,

20
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,120
is that a mine?

21
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,840
A mine?

22
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,319
Why is it so close?

23
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,759
The explosion must've been huge.

24
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,039
Jeez.

25
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,439
Whoa.

26
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,680
Gosh.

27
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,919
What's up with them?

28
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,639
They're here again.

29
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,240
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,400
It's worse this time. So dusty.

31
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,240
I'm so fed up with talking to them.
They wouldn't listen.

32
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,039
Should we bring some men over?

33
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,599
We have to use force
if they're not going to listen.

34
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,439
Are you a thug?

35
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you think you can fight them?

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,639
Non, what's up?

37
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,639
Do you have a dust problem
at your farm?

38
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,240
We're having the same problem here.

39
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,920
Same here.

40
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,730
It's very close.
The resort guests all ran away.

41
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll probably have
to talk to them again.

42
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,319
Aueng, I...

43
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,199
My nose stings
and my throat is irritated.

44
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,839
I don't know if I'm catching a cold.

45
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,319
They're something wrong with me too.

46
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,560
I'm itching all over.
I must be allergic.

47
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,639
Aueng, or is it because
of the dust from the mine?

48
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,399
That's true.

49
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,879
Are my roses going to be okay?

50
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,639
Should I go ask
Mr. Artit what to do?

51
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,730
Why should we ask him?

52
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,920
Why not?

53
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,639
Are you alright?

54
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,610
You can't come in here.

55
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,800
Do you have an appointment?

56
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,519
Are you going to talk peacefully
or should I call the NGOs?

57
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,720
Or the entire village?

58
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,759
Yes, Mr. Dandin.

59
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,680
Okay.

60
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,319
Yes, sir.

61
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,720
Mr. Dandin said you can go in.

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,279
There was a small error
regarding the explosion yesterday.

63
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,959
Small?

64
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,759
Isn't that too easy of an excuse?

65
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,879
I'm not sure anymore.
If it was an error

66
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,439
or just neglect on your part.

67
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,000
It's happened too many times.

68
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,199
I might have to
notify the authorities.

69
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,639
I might also have
to inform the press.

70
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,040
Why are you making this a big deal?

71
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,480
This mine's been here
since my father's generation.

72
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,759
My farm wasn't just founded either.

73
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,480
Same as my friend's resort.

74
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,199
I'll apologize to you this time.

75
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
And I'll be extra careful.

76
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm only going to give you
one more chance.

77
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,959
Because if there's a next time,

78
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,839
we won't stand for it anymore.

79
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,920
Feel free to talk.
I won't interrupt.

80
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,639
He's the person who followed
Paeng from up North, isn't he?

81
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,160
We'll talk after we got back.

82
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,319
That guy knows Dandin as well?

83
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,879
I just found out.

84
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,720
He seems pretty arrogant.

85
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,160
That's why I felt strange.

86
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,519
Do you believe me now
that he's untrustworthy?

87
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,879
That's true.

88
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,639
Dandin doesn't associate himself
with decent people much.

89
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,839
He's surrounded by crooks.

90
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,079
Should we be worried about Paeng?

91
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,160
Do you think we should?

92
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
I understand you now.

93
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,759
I think you should warn her.

94
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,920
Warn her so that
she'll misunderstand me?

95
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,199
She's going to say that
I'm trying to get in the way.

96
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,279
She's probably craving
a boyfriend right now.

97
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,600
I'll warn her then.

98
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,800
Just leave her alone.

99
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,839
Let's wait and see what happens.

100
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,920
Maybe Mark won't be
as bad as we think.

101
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,839
You're being cool.

102
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,560
Let's do it this way.

103
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,279
I'll sniff around. It should
be manageable for me.

104
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,279
I'm sick of those miners.

105
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,680
I don't know why
Mr. Artit won't punch them.

106
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,720
You're gossiping
about your boss again.

107
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,330
Why should he
pick a fight with them?

108
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,759
You tell me.

109
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,960
They always provoke us
whenever they see us.

110
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,679
Oh, Miss Paeng. What's the matter?

111
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,090
I wanted to ask about the dust.

112
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,759
The dust?

113
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,600
We were just talking about it.

114
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,720
Everyone, the miners are here.

115
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,000
Why are they here?

116
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,720
They said they're coming to see what
problems the mine is causing us.

117
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,919
Are they here to see
or to pick a fight?

118
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
Let's go! Give it to them!

119
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,330
Oh? Hold on, everyone.

120
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,090
Help! Anyone, please help!

121
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,120
Thongkhum fainted in the kitchen!

122
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,480
Please take her to the hospital!

123
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,679
Thongkhum!

124
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,679
Thongkhum?

125
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,039
Thongkhum?

126
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,600
Paeng, what are you doing?
Let her go now!

127
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,960
Bring her to a car!

128
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,240
Is there a car around here?

129
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,330
I asked you,
is there a car around here?

130
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,919
There's a truck that's used
to transport goods.

131
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,720
Go and get it!

132
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,759
Stay out of this!
It's none of your business!

133
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,840
Are you going to let her die?

134
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,450
Do you see that her lips
are losing color?

135
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,840
How did she faint?

136
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,759
She had sudden chest pain.

137
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,879
She sat down to rest and fainted.

138
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,720
Thongkhum?

139
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,039
Go get a car right now!

140
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,919
Or have someone bring my car!

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,720
This is the key. Hurry!

142
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,159
Go!

143
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,480
Thongkhum?

144
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,960
Help me fan her!
Why are you just standing there?

145
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,450
Pong, Saeb,

146
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,720
what are you doing here?

147
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,720
We're here to look for the miners

148
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,759
The farmhands said they got in.

149
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,120
But they left once we got there.

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,450
They came into our farm?

151
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,919
That's right. They came
to see the dust problem.

152
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,639
But I think they're
here to threaten us.

153
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,399
Pong, tell our people to keep watch
on all the entrances and exits.

154
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,919
Don't let outsiders in again.

155
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,679
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,240
Mr. Artit!

157
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,240
Thongkhum fainted. She's been
taken to the hospital.

158
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,600
Huh?

159
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,679
Who's taking her to the hospital?

160
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,279
What congenital disease
does she have?

161
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,159
Don't ask. Are you a doctor?

162
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm not a doctor

163
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,720
but I need to know to talk to one.

164
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,639
Duang, this is not the time
to argue with me.

165
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,159
Hello, Mark.

166
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,960
I'll call you back.
I'm at the hospital.

167
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,600
It's not me.

168
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,279
It's the farm's cook.
She fell ill all of a sudden.

169
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,120
So I brought her to the hospital.

170
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,759
Okay.

171
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,039
Doctor?

172
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,480
Do you know
if she has any congenital disease?

173
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,639
She usually buys medicine
over the counter herself.

174
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,919
She has blood pressure problems.

175
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,320
Just a moment, doctor.

176
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,679
I had a worker at the farm
take a photo of the medicine.

177
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,080
What's going on with her?

178
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,679
The medicine for blood pressure
is probably at fault here.

179
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,519
She shouldn't be buying it
without a prescription.

180
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,840
Luckily, she didn't hit her head
when she fell.

181
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,440
Duang, how is Thongkhum doing?

182
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,480
The doctor said she's safe now.

183
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,759
Thank you very much.

184
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,960
You're here now. Then I'll go.

185
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,399
Wait.

186
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,240
We'll go home together.

187
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,360
I told someone
to drive your car back.

188
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,600
How is that possible?

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,519
The car key's with me.

190
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,639
Artit!

191
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,600
Paeng, how is she doing?

192
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,600
She's safe now.

193
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,279
Thank you for your concern.

194
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,519
You didn't have to come, though.

195
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,200
I was worried about you.

196
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,279
I think you might still be in shock
so I wanted to check up on you.

197
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,200
Mr. Artit, we meet again.

198
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,480
Look at that, twice today already.

199
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,759
You must have
so much time on your hands.

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,120
That's right. I have
a lot of free time lately.

201
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,519
Since you're here, do you
mind giving me a lift?

202
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,159
With pleasure.
Would you like to go now?

203
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,279
- Right away.
- Alright then.

204
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,440
Wanfahmai,

205
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,399
you have to help me
with some errands first.

206
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,200
Call Jook to prepare
Duang's clothes.

207
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll have someone go and fetch them.

208
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,639
I'll wait for Thongkhum to wake up.

209
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,159
During that time, I might have
some more work for you.

210
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,080
But I'm not your secretary.

211
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,039
Why?

212
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,200
Can't a boss assign work
to his employee?

213
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,360
Send your guy away too.

214
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,120
Sticking out like a sore thumb.

215
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,559
Yes, Mom.

216
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,279
I already went to see Thongkhum.

217
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,879
I just went downstairs
to eat something.

218
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,240
Then I'll go
and get things for Duang.

219
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,519
Okay.

220
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,159
Okay.

221
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,840
Why aren't you taking me home?

222
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,080
Eat something first.
We haven't eaten yet.

223
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,840
Don't pretend like
you're worried about me.

224
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,759
I'm worried about myself.
I'm hungry.

225
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,039
Thank you.

226
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,039
Eat up.

227
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,240
Because I'm worried
about you right now.

228
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,519
You probably haven't eaten anything.

229
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,360
Don't look at me like that.

230
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,679
Eat up.

231
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,679
So you'll have the energy
to argue with me.

232
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,399
Thank you again.

233
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,120
If it wasn't for you, Thongkhum
might have been worse off.

234
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,639
No need to thank me.

235
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Anyone would've helped.

236
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,399
If they were heartless,
then they wouldn't have.

237
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,840
I'm not that heartless.

238
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,759
I'm thanking you right now.

239
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,519
Then we're even.

240
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,759
You went and helped my friend
in Bangkok.

241
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,799
Now I've helped your worker.

242
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,679
We're even.

243
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,360
Helping others is a virtue.

244
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,720
I helped your friend.
You helped Thongkhum.

245
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,799
It's not about getting even.

246
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,320
But it's the goodness

247
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,840
that I see coming from you.

248
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,960
You saw it?

249
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,960
You've always viewed me
in a negative light.

250
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,360
Something as small as this

251
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,440
can change your mind?

252
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,840
That's what you think.

253
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,440
Don't try to read my mind.

254
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,200
And I don't see you
in a negative light.

255
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,840
What I saw today

256
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,120
is that you're kind to everyone.

257
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,720
Do I have to thank you

258
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,600
for seeing me as a better person?

259
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,720
You don't have to.

260
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,960
Just see me as a better person

261
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,200
like I do to you.

262
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,120
Well, you always harass me.

263
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,960
You're always assuming things.

264
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,679
I don't.

265
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,639
You do.

266
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,839
You also always bring me trouble.

267
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,759
You're such a jerk.

268
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,170
You're the jerk.

269
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,410
Like Mark,

270
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,559
you should give him some respect.

271
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,799
You shouldn't glare at him.

272
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,960
He's only a customer.

273
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,240
And you're rude to him.

274
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,200
And he's polite to me?

275
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
Go and tell him. Don't tell me.

276
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,890
He's never done anything to you.

277
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,000
I've never done anything
to him either.

278
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,720
But now I have to keep an eye on him

279
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,440
to see if he's really a customer

280
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,960
or he just wants to flirt with you.

281
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,519
I told you

282
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,759
if he wants to flirt with me,
there's nothing wrong with that.

283
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,720
It's not.

284
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,759
But if he uses work as an excuse

285
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,319
and you fall for it,

286
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,200
you'll have empty hopes
about sales. Right?

287
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,039
I can sell it to someone else.

288
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,000
See?

289
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,410
So you also feel that Mark's
not an actual customer.

290
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,890
I don't feel it yet.

291
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,799
But you like to brainwash me

292
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,240
until I go along with you.

293
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,799
Then I'm telling you to feel it now.

294
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,759
You've got to learn to read people.

295
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,079
Eat up.

296
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,410
Don't be wasteful.

297
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,920
Be careful while you're on the farm.

298
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,759
Call me if you see any strangers.

299
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,799
Is it about the miners?

300
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,480
Okay.

301
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,720
Wait.

302
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,720
This year's festival,

303
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,960
are you going to have
a stall there as well?

304
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,650
I am.

305
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,720
I hope your business goes well.

306
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,960
I can go now, right?

307
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,480
Mr. Mark,

308
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,240
someone came here asking for you.

309
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,680
Who?

310
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,559
He didn't tell me his name.

311
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,839
But he was just checking to see if
you were staying here.

312
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,759
Can I look at the CCTV footage?

313
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,599
Please, come this way.

314
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,920
He dared to go
and see you at your place.

315
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,680
That's right. It was Artit's friend,
the one we met in the morning.

316
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,440
His name is Non.

317
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,079
He owns a resort not far from here.

318
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,720
He's a good friend of Artit's.

319
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,359
I'd like his profile and address.

320
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,170
Hey,

321
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,240
don't do anything violent.
I'm in a lot of trouble lately.

322
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,650
It's not going to be violent.

323
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,170
I'd like to borrow
your storage facility as well.

324
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,240
For what?

325
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,440
i'm not a patient person.

326
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,079
There is a woman I'm looking to
score with,

327
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,079
before someone gets her first.

328
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,200
You've always got a plan.

329
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,799
Let me know if you need any help.

330
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,279
Seeing how you're so devoted,
I'd like to see her face.

331
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,410
You'll see her in a few days.

332
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,119
I'm looking forward to it.

333
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,960
She must be very beautiful.

334
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,839
But I have one thing I need to deal
with first.

335
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,000
What thing?

336
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,359
Getting back at Non.

337
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,920
You don't have to come
and pick me up.

338
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,480
I can get there on my own.

339
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,799
My car will arrive today. Okay?

340
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,960
I'll talk to you later.

341
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,240
Keep an eye on him.

342
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,359
Let me know if there's anything.

343
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,240
And don't worry.

344
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,960
Dandin gave me his permission
to have you to work for me.

345
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
I'm really sorry.

346
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,920
Are you hurt?

347
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,880
Let me take you to the hospital.

348
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,960
It's okay.

349
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,880
Why were you driving so fast?

350
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,480
I'm really sorry.

351
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,440
I dropped something. It got caught
between the brake and the gas.

352
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,240
I'm sorry again.

353
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,039
It's okay. But you have to be
more careful next time.

354
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,039
Are you going somewhere?

355
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,799
If you don't want me
to take you to the hospital,

356
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,440
can I give you a lift somewhere
instead as an apology?

357
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,160
It's fine. You didn't hit me.

358
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,599
You have to let me help

359
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,720
or I'll feel really uncomfortable.

360
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,119
Thank you but it's okay.

361
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,000
Let me help you up.

362
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,599
You followed me?

363
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,559
That's right.

364
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,519
I just wanted to
make sure that you're okay.

365
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,720
I'm okay.

366
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,599
Is this your shop?

367
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,160
I own it with a friend.

368
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,079
I'll be your customer then.

369
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,759
I hope you're okay with that.

370
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,000
Thank you very much.

371
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,319
Feel free to comment about it.

372
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,559
I have to taste it first.

373
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,640
It's really good!

374
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,799
Was that your home back there?

375
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,039
Excuse me?

376
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,480
I'm thinking of moving here.
I'm looking for a house.

377
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,839
And I have my eyes on a house
in your neighborhood.

378
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,880
But I'd like to know
some more details.

379
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,759
Oh, okay.

380
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,079
Would you mind sitting down

381
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,119
and letting me consult you
about this?

382
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,559
What's the matter?

383
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,799
The customer's really handsome.

384
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,240
He's over there.

385
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,640
I think it's quite okay.

386
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,519
Ling.

387
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,079
Hello, Non.

388
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,599
You know each other?

389
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,000
Of course.

390
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,039
Non went to see me
at my condo yesterday,

391
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,880
didn't you?

392
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,079
Hold on.

393
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,920
What do you want?

394
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,640
I should be the one to ask you that.

395
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,119
I'm warning you.

396
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,720
Stay away from my business.

397
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,839
I had your background checked

398
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,279
because you're messing
around with my friend.

399
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,400
Your friend?

400
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,599
Is it Paeng or Artit?

401
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,480
Both of them, actually.

402
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,599
You had my background checked

403
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,599
so naturally
I had to check yours too.

404
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,519
You can do that.

405
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,759
But I don't think
you should target women.

406
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,200
A gentleman wouldn't do that.

407
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,960
If you're talking about Ling,
I didn't do anything.

408
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,440
It's just a coincidence.

409
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,240
Here's my card.

410
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:24,160
Both my address
and number are on there.

411
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,880
You can come and see me anytime.

412
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,240
But I'm asking you

413
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,079
to stay away from Ling.

414
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,759
Thank you very much.

415
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,680
As for the women,

416
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,799
I'm always a gentleman.

417
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,680
You can ask Ling
if you don't believe me.

418
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,519
What? Mark?

419
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,079
That's right. He knows
I'm sniffing around about him.

420
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,319
And he followed Ling to her home?

421
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,279
He's scarier than you think.

422
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:19,599
He declared that I should stay away.

423
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,920
He's exceptionally smart.

424
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,279
And exceptionally vile too.

425
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,319
He knows that Ling is my weakness.

426
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,440
How's his background?

427
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,279
He's clean.

428
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,319
There's nothing bad about him.

429
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,160
His house is in Bangkok.

430
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:37,200
He's wealthy and was an orphan
as a child.

431
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,839
Just like Paeng.

432
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,359
That's right. Just like Paeng.

433
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,559
That's why he was able
to approach her easily.

434
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,119
And he's approaching Ling too.

435
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,720
What's his occupation?

436
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,720
He exports garments.

437
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,200
There's no criminal record.

438
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,119
Garment exports?

439
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,440
How is that related to roses?

440
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,160
If he didn't try to get involved,

441
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,440
I would've believed that he's clean.

442
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,319
I'm so annoyed.

443
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,519
Have you told Ling?

444
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,200
I haven't.
I don't want her to worry.

445
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,599
Good. Take care of Ling.

446
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,960
I'll deal with the rest.

447
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,119
(Paeng)

448
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,319
You've been staring at the phone
for ten minutes already.

449
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,839
Do you think I should call or not?

450
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,880
There's this side of you too.

451
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,599
Wanfahmai must be very beautiful.

452
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,559
She's a woman

453
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,400
that I should be taking care of.

454
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
But don't try to compete with me.

455
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,559
No need to say so.

456
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,039
I won't mess around with your woman.

457
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:02,960
I know you well.

458
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,480
If you want someone,

459
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,079
you always get them.

460
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,839
Teach me your technique sometime.

461
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,799
I remember the time
when you scored a socialite.

462
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,279
What's her name?

463
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,480
Was it Pimnapa?

464
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,039
Don't mention that woman.

465
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,000
Okay. I won't then.

466
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,319
I'll take care of
your daughter for you,

467
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,359
Pimnapa.

468
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,640
What are you doing here, Mr. Artit?

469
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,319
Uh...

470
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,400
Is your boss here?

471
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,799
She's inside.

472
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,440
Find something to do
and come back in an hour.

473
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,640
What are you going to do?

474
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,359
I won't do anything to her.
Don't worry.

475
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,000
Are you sure?

476
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,559
Have I done anything to her?

477
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,160
Well, you...

478
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,799
You always harass her.

479
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,759
- Should I jog your memory for you?
- Don't bother.

480
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,400
I promise I won't harass
her today, okay?

481
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,799
I just want to talk to her.

482
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,880
I'll go fetch her then.

483
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,759
You don't have to.

484
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
- You can go now.
- Oh? Mr. Artit?

485
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,759
- Go!
- Okay! Okay!

486
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,160
Aueng, can you get me the scissors?

487
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,599
Can you thread a needle for me?

488
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,519
Are you done yet?

489
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,240
Aueng?

490
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,640
Oh! Artit!

491
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,440
If it was a burglar, he would've
gotten to you by now.

492
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,079
If it was a burglar, I would've
stabbed him to death by now.

493
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,599
It's not funny.

494
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,519
Why are you here? And where's Aueng?

495
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,519
She's out on a stroll.
She told me to look after you.

496
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,119
I'm not five.

497
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,160
What are you doing?

498
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,880
What are you going to have me do?

499
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,640
I asked what you're doing.

500
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,440
You came here. What are you
going to have me do?

501
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,720
Nothing.

502
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,599
Then why are you here?

503
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,720
You can't come up
with any ideas to boss me around?

504
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,960
Mm.

505
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,640
Artit, call me when you do.

506
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,240
Please.

507
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,119
I've got an idea.

508
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm going to...

509
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,160
ask for a phone number.

510
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,160
A phone number?

511
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,039
Mark's.

512
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,720
What are you going to do with it?

513
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,559
I won't give it to you.

514
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,809
I'm asking you nicely.

515
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,809
No. I've told you already,
don't mess with him.

516
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,159
Paeng!

517
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:45,360
I'm not giving it to you.

518
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,639
Then we'll stay this way.

519
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:52,840
Why are you doing this?

520
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,960
What about you? I asked you nicely.

521
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,480
What did he do to you?
Why are you harassing him?

522
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,239
Don't side with him in front of me.

523
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,360
I'm not.

524
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,960
But he's much better than you.

525
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,289
Artit! Let me go!

526
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,440
No.

527
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,559
Let me go!

528
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,639
What are you doing, Wanfahmai?

529
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:41,960
Stop right now! Stop!

530
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,440
Get your filthy hands off me!

531
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,599
Just stab me if you're going
to be that harsh.

532
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,880
- Alright.
- Artit! Artit!

533
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,289
- Artit!
- Let go!

534
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,559
I won't!

535
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,239
Let go!

536
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,809
If you don't want to die,
don't touch me again!

537
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,639
Alright. He's disgusted by me.
I'll have to use this strategy.

538
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,360
Embracing me like this,

539
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,119
it's turning me on.

540
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,880
I just want to
give into you right now.

541
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,960
Why isn't he stopping me?

542
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,159
What should I do?

543
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:03,679
I might have to go the distance.

544
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,329
Paeng!

545
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,039
You!

546
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,440
You brat!

547
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,039
You deserved it.

548
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,719
Aueng.

549
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,360
- Uh...
- Uh...

550
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,639
What's up with him?

551
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,079
Why does he seem scared?

552
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,079
Was I worried about
the wrong person?

553
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,360
How am I going to start this?

554
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,719
I'm coming.

555
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,480
Who pranked me?

556
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,329
Non.

557
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,769
Why are you doing this?

558
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,329
I don't find it funny.

559
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,639
It was a test.

560
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,039
You're not safe at home alone.

561
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,599
Non, can you tell me now
why you're doing this?

562
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,239
This is my house.

563
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,039
Let's find a proper place

564
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,289
to sit and talk. Come on.

565
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,000
Ling,

566
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,079
I'm worried about you.

567
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,480
You're all alone here.

568
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,920
I've always been alone.

569
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:52,769
But you have me now.

570
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,000
I have the right to be worried
about my girlfriend.

571
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,440
You brought a lot of stuff over.

572
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,559
If someone broke in,

573
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,440
they'll think there's
a guy in the house.

574
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,809
If you allow me,

575
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,239
I'd like to keep you company here.

576
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,809
You're okay with that?

577
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,519
No?

578
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,519
Once a week then.

579
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,360
Not even once a year.

580
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,679
Can we get married now then?

581
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,079
I'm being serious.

582
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:41,809
- Don't joke.
- What?

583
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,289
What's the matter?

584
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,960
I'll move in to keep you company.

585
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,960
You can't.

586
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,769
It's safe like this.

587
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,289
You'll be safe with me.

588
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:56,199
I don't feel safe now.

589
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:57,360
Really?

590
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,880
I'm actually taking care of you.

591
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,159
Non!

592
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:18,679
Are my buttocks adorable that much?

593
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,809
Do your buttocks hurt?

594
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:30,960
No.

595
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,639
Why didn't knock first
before coming in?

596
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,519
What are you embarrassed about?

597
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:38,960
I saw you ever since...

598
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,599
Stop right there.

599
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,039
- Stop.
- What?

600
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,840
You're exactly like Mom.

601
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,119
Knock first before you come in.

602
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,809
Just in case I'm...

603
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:51,599
working out.

604
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:54,960
Well, you didn't lock the door.

605
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,360
What's wrong with your buttocks?

606
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,559
I was...

607
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,559
Someone bumped into me and I fell.

608
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,119
Let me take a look.

609
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,039
It's good that you're okay.

610
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,360
By the way, what are
you doing tomorrow?

611
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,599
Tomorrow, I...

612
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,880
I have a work meeting with Non
in the morning.

613
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,809
I was thinking of asking you to
come along with me for an errand.

614
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,360
It's alright. I'll go there myself.

615
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,599
Is it necessary?

616
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:31,119
Should I go with you?

617
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,880
It's okay. You can do your work.

618
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:36,079
- I'm going to bed now.
- Okay.

619
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:42,039
Are you sure
that your buttocks are okay?

620
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:45,639
I'm fine.

621
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,599
Non is still here.

622
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,480
You can come back now.

623
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:56,800
No need to tail him now.

624
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,119
He won't be bothering me anymore.

625
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,840
Okay, sir.

626
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:22,960
Oh? You startled me.

627
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,840
I didn't think you'd be so handsome.

628
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,360
I don't like rude women.

629
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,840
So what do you want?
Should I stay or go?

630
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:49,400
Let's leave together.

631
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:00,159
Hello.

632
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,159
Don't forget about our meeting.

633
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,440
I'm on my way.

634
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,880
I'll see you then.

635
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,280
Of course, Paeng.

636
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,159
See you later.

637
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,159
I'm okay to go ahead with this.

638
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,280
I don't have any problems with it.

639
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:28,119
Thank you very much.

640
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:30,199
We can sign the agreement
once you're ready.

641
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:35,920
We finished sooner than I thought.

642
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,639
- Let's get something to eat first.
- Sure.

643
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,400
What are you waiting for?
You can go now.

644
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,880
Did you see what I saw?

645
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:08,320
I did.

646
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,199
What are you going to do?
Find out or let it go?

647
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,320
- I want to find out.
- Then let's split up and look.

648
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:13,679
Come on.

649
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,480
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.

650
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:48,159
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

651
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:08,159
- Non.
- The woman wouldn't say anything.

652
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,920
It seems really shady.

653
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:11,719
Have you found Mark?

654
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,320
I have. He's with Paeng right now.

655
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,519
Where?

656
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:18,320
At a restaurant at your new hotel.

657
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:20,639
He deliberately did this?

658
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,760
He probably set up a meeting
with her.

659
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,559
You silly girl.

660
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,199
Don't curse yet.

661
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,239
Paeng still doesn't know
his true colors.

662
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,519
What are you going to do now?

663
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,079
I'm thinking of barging in now.

664
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:33,960
Calm down. If you do that,

665
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:36,000
you'll be pushing Paeng
towards him.

666
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:38,239
Thanks for reminding me.

667
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,159
Talk to you later.
I'll come up with something.

668
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:41,679
Alright.

669
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,800
Paeng, I'm sorry for setting up
a meeting outside.

670
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,199
It's okay. I understand.

671
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,199
I'm happy that you understand.

672
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,199
Artit doesn't seem to like me,

673
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,480
so I didn't want to make
you feel uncomfortable.

674
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,159
He doesn't like anyone much.

675
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:27,800
Just ignore him.

676
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,719
He's such a weirdo.

677
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,000
I wonder if he's ever
looked at himself in the mirror

678
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,000
to see out how poorly he looks.

679
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:41,760
Does he have a girlfriend?

680
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,159
Who would want a guy
with a face like that?

681
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,280
If he came with a free house and
a car, no one would be interested.

682
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:53,679
I can see it so clearly in my mind.

683
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,000
Where are you?

684
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:16,000
I asked, where you are?

685
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,119
Get home right now.

686
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,280
Are you okay?

687
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:39,960
It's nothing.

688
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,840
What?

689
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,840
Is it Artit?

690
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,320
There's only one person who
sends incessant texts like this.

691
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,320
- Is she your mistress?
- What?

692
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:12,119
I told you to stop being like this!
Why didn't you stop?

693
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,440
You had to make me
resort to violence.

694
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:16,559
- Are you going or not?
- I won't!

695
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,440
- Let me go!
- Hey!

696
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,760
You shouldn't hurt
a woman like this.

697
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:26,639
How is this your business?

698
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,599
Mark! Mark! Stop!

699
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,840
You punched me!

700
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,920
You hurt her first!

701
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,400
File a report with the police.

702
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,599
So he won't hurt you again.

703
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,440
As for you,

704
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:52,360
I'm happy to pay the fines.

705
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,320
Tell the police to contact me.

706
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,760
Thank you very much!

707
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,039
I don't like
seeing women getting hurt.

708
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,039
Where have you been?

709
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,760
I don't have to answer you.

710
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,360
You have to tell me everything
and everywhere you're going.

711
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:54,400
No, I don't have to do that.

712
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,440
Paeng!

713
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,599
You don't know
how dangerous men are.

714
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,280
Of course I do.

715
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:03,920
There's one right in front of me.

716
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,239
I'm not talking about me.

717
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,519
I mean Mark.

718
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,000
You know

719
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,960
that I went to see Mark.

720
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,519
I know about everything.

721
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:23,840
I even know that
you gossiped about me.

722
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,639
Do you hire a private investigator

723
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:28,400
to follow me.

724
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,800
How well do you know him?
Why do you trust him so much?

725
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,159
That's why I set up a meeting
at Non's hotel.

726
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,079
I'm not stupid

727
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,880
and I'm not gullible.

728
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,639
That's good. You still have your
cleverness.

729
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,920
But it doesn't depend on
how long we've known each other.

730
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,519
It depends on how much
we understand each other.

731
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,519
Mark and I

732
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,800
understand each other.
We can talk to each other.

733
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,679
Unlike someone.

734
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
I've known him longer

735
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,039
but I've never understood
anything about him at all.

736
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,360
Paeng,

737
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,480
what if I tell you that Mark

738
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,719
poses a danger to you.

739
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,039
Are you going to believe me?

740
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:28,119
I believe what I see.

741
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:30,239
And what I see is that

742
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,920
it's not Mark

743
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,599
who poses a danger to me.

744
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,559
I'm

745
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,559
a danger to you?

746
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,920
A severe danger.

747
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,239
- Non?
- It's me, Nang.

748
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:50,840
This is Non's number.

749
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,039
You wouldn't answer my calls.

750
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,519
Give it back!

751
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,000
It's my phone.

752
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,280
Then tell him

753
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,000
to pick me up for the festival.

754
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:06,639
Artit.

755
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,039
I heard her.

756
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:09,880
Do you have a meeting with her?

757
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,599
I know nothing about it.

758
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,119
He said he doesn't
know anything about it.

759
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,039
Auntie Tubtim said

760
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,760
she'll have him pick me up
for the festival.

761
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:23,239
Tell him that I'll be waiting
for him tomorrow.

762
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,880
I have to go now.

763
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:27,639
Wait, Nang.

764
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,159
Nang!

765
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,079
Artit, what are you going to do?

766
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:35,760
You take your sister

767
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,519
and I'll see you over there.

768
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,880
What about Mark?

769
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:41,199
I don't feel like talking anymore.
I'll talk to you later.

770
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,280
Such a cheeky sister.

771
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,559
Nang, do you know
you embarrassed me?

772
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,920
Aod?

773
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:04,280
What's the matter?

774
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,280
Miss Paeng, can I borrow your phone?

775
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,719
Mine's broken. I have to call my mom
in another province.

776
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,199
Oh, okay. You can use mine.

777
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,880
Thank you.

778
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,199
Can you enter the passcode?

779
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,960
Thank you.

780
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,039
Hello, Mom? It's Aod.

781
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,280
Yes, my phone's broken.

782
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:54,920
So I had to borrow my boss's.

783
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:56,360
I got it, sir.

784
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:57,760
Someone named Mark, right?

785
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:00,840
I'm sending his number to you now.

786
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,400
- What about the app?
- I've downloaded the tracking app.

787
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,400
Don't worry. I've hidden it well.

788
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,920
Very good, Aod.

789
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,400
You can trust me with IT stuff.

790
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:26,159
Aod!

791
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:29,599
Mom, I have to get back to work now.

792
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:30,840
We'll talk later.

793
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,039
Okay.

794
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,079
You're here.

795
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:42,280
All done, Miss Paeng.
Thank you very much.

796
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,039
- All good?
- Yes.

797
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,360
Are you going to
stay here long term?

798
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,480
Not really.

799
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,559
I thought you wanted
to move to the countryside.

800
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,119
I can't stay here.
I can't get used to it.

801
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,599
Once it's successful,

802
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,199
I'll bring her back to Bangkok.

803
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:09,840
So you're almost there now.

804
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,119
But I have to hurry.
I'm hot-tempered.

805
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,159
How soon do you want it to be?

806
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,480
So soon

807
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:25,360
that I have to do it today.

808
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,440
(Sunshine Farm)

809
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,000
Arrange it nicely.

810
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:47,679
Miss Paeng,
are the name cards ready?

811
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,719
Aueng, we don't need any
in this day and age.

812
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:54,519
I've prepared this. Just scan it.

813
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:57,079
Just scan it.

814
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,599
- Aueng, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

815
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:03,760
Where are you going?

816
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,320
It's my business.

817
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,159
Hold on.

818
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:13,239
You have to stay.
The Governor's coming.

819
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:17,239
Right over here, sir.

820
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,960
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, everyone.

821
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:25,639
Are there roses at Sunshine Farm?

822
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:28,840
There are, sir.
They're organic roses.

823
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,440
It's the first year
that we started to grow them.

824
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:33,360
Is she your daughter-in-law,
Krongprateep?

825
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,639
She's my niece, sir.

826
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,039
Her name is Wanfahmai.

827
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,360
She's just finished her degree
in agriculture.

828
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,079
You're very fortunate

829
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,679
to have a skillful younger
generation helping you.

830
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:52,400
Sunshine Farm
is developing every year.

831
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:55,280
You must be very proud.

832
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:00,679
Please, have a look.

833
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,960
Here you are, sir.

834
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,360
Do you have something
for the governor?

835
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,119
Here, sir. Try it out.

836
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,280
Why did you tell Artit that
you're bringing me here yourself?

837
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,119
I'm going to tell Auntie Tubtim.

838
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,840
Why are you complaining?

839
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,559
We live in the same house.

840
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:26,960
We're coming to the same house.

841
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:28,320
Why are you throwing a fit?

842
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:30,280
I wanted to come with Artit.

843
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,880
I should've let you stay at home.

844
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:34,559
Hold on.

845
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,840
Where are you going?

846
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,320
To see Artit.

847
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,719
Go to the stall.
Isn't it time for work?

848
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,800
You do it.

849
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:43,760
Nang!

850
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,039
Ling, let's go.

851
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,920
Non, darling. I'm coming with you.

852
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:52,320
- Let's go to the stall.
- What's wrong with you, Kot?

853
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,360
It's today.

854
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,760
I have to use
your people and location.

855
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,679
Are you going to do it
right in public?

856
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:02,920
Not really.

857
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,320
The name's Wanfahmai, isn't it?

858
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,360
I sort of want to meet her now.

859
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,920
All done.

860
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:21,320
Here. Thank you.

861
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:35,320
You're here too?

862
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,559
What an eyesore.

863
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,639
I'm here to work.

864
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,119
Where's Artit?

865
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:46,679
I don't know.

866
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,800
He's got legs.
He's probably walking around.

867
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:50,840
Cheeky.

868
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,599
I'm asking you nicely.
Don't be cheeky to me.

869
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,880
I don't know.

870
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,559
My job isn't to guard him.

871
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,320
Where's Artit?

872
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,400
I don't know.

873
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:07,760
Tell me.

874
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,519
Let me go.

875
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:11,679
I don't know.

876
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,119
We meet again, Paeng.

877
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,519
Good timing, Mark.

878
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,360
I think we're destined
for each other.

879
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:34,599
This my friend, Dandin.

880
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:37,280
Hello.

881
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,559
Hello.

882
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,599
You two have never met each other?

883
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:43,719
We haven't.

884
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:46,639
Why did you think

885
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,639
that I've met him?

886
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,760
I have a mining operation
near your farm.

887
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:04,800
You can see me off here.

888
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:07,760
- Okay.
- I have to go now.

889
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,440
The festival is in your hands now.

890
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:11,119
And

891
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,960
look after Paeng too.

892
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,360
She's tough. I don't think
it's necessary.

893
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,519
Artit.

894
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,039
Okay, Dad.

895
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:22,639
Thanks.

896
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,880
You're here!

897
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:34,599
Uncle's gone. You must be free now.

898
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:36,760
Come on a stroll with me.

899
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,360
Wait, Nang.

900
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,320
I'm not free. I have to supervise
for the festival.

901
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:43,079
Artit, just let other people do it.

902
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:44,480
There are a lot of workers.

903
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:46,480
Paeng's there as well.

904
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,639
Paeng's got her own work.

905
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,360
Besides,

906
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:54,119
I'm here to work,
not to go for a stroll.

907
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,159
But you're the boss.

908
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,480
Do you have to
do everything yourself?

909
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,559
Just let Paeng supervise the sales.

910
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,119
She's good at selling.

911
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:07,559
There's even a guy that followed her
across the province.

912
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,039
I dropped by your stall.

913
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:13,800
That guy came over again.

914
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:20,440
She probably seduced him.

915
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:24,599
They were happily chatting
and giggling together.

916
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:29,119
Oh?

917
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,079
Artit!

918
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:38,320
Aueng.

919
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,079
Yes, sir?

920
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:41,719
Where's your boss?

921
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,559
I don't know.

922
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,639
What do you want to talk
to me about?

923
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:57,199
It's about the mine.
I'd like to ask you a favor.

924
01:04:57,639 --> 01:05:00,639
Can you control the dust level?

925
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,639
I'm doing my best to do that.

926
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,000
It's serious a problem right now.

927
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:09,920
We're nearby. We share the same air.

928
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,920
A lot of people got sick
because of the dust.

929
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:14,960
And it's affecting the crops too.

930
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,840
I'm dealing with it.

931
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:20,039
It's not fun

932
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:22,119
for me to be in trouble
with the public as well.

933
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,480
It might not be fun for you.

934
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,800
But I'm not sure
about your employees.

935
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,000
Do you know that your people
came to Sunshine Farm?

936
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,320
Really? I didn't know that.

937
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,719
I'll handle it.

938
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,840
Thank you.

939
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:42,920
Okay. All clear?

940
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:44,760
Are we done with stressful matters?

941
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,039
- We are.
- Good.

942
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,639
It's about me now.

943
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,719
Would you do me the honor

944
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,800
and walk me around the festival?

945
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,840
I don't think so.

946
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,320
I'm here to sell the products.
I have to look after the stall.

947
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,400
But I sneaked out

948
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:07,079
because I don't want to talk to him
in front of anyone from the farm.

949
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,639
I don't want to get into trouble.

950
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:11,320
I understand.

951
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:13,239
What a shame.

952
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,800
Maybe next time.

953
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,800
I'll have to excuse myself now.

954
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,320
Okay.

955
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:32,440
She's lovely.

956
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:34,360
Will you really score her?

957
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,840
I will. If everything goes
according to plan.

958
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:41,440
I'll wait to hear from you.

959
01:06:41,719 --> 01:06:42,800
I have to go now.

960
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,480
Please.

961
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:07,400
I warned you not to trust him.

962
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:10,639
You know where I've been?

963
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:12,960
I have eyes and ears
all over the festival.

964
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,159
Stay away from those two.

965
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,719
Those jerks are dangerous.
Both Mark and Dandin.

966
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,199
It's rude to call them jerks.

967
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:26,239
I don't know
why you don't like Mark.

968
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,400
But I understand
why you don't like Dandin.

969
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,679
And I believe that people can
talk things over peacefully.

970
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:36,000
The problem wouldn't have gone on
this long if that was the case.

971
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,719
I talked to him

972
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,960
and he promised
that he'll solve the problem.

973
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:43,000
How many years has
he been saying this?

974
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,760
Don’t believe people so easily.

975
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,639
Both of them can't be trusted.

976
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,280
See the world from many angles
and learn how to read people.

977
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,719
Don't be too optimistic
and assuming.

978
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,679
Tell that to yourself.

979
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,480
You're the one
who's assuming things.

980
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,039
You're being disrespectful.

981
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,079
More importantly, you're insulting
me for being stupid.

982
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:15,199
What a stubborn girl.

983
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,359
Wait until the festival
is almost over.

984
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:27,840
Then execute the plan.

985
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,399
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

986
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:43,720
Miss Paeng,

987
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,079
they're starting to pack up.
Should we do the same?

988
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:49,319
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

989
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:51,399
Bew, let's pack it up.

990
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,000
Miss?

991
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:55,529
Yes?

992
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:57,529
Is this your license plate number?

993
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,529
That's right. Is there a problem?

994
01:09:00,609 --> 01:09:01,880
Someone backed into your car.

995
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:06,239
Aueng, I'll be right back.

996
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:07,479
Okay.

997
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,039
Paeng!

998
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,880
Excuse me.

999
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,880
Artit!

1000
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:35,609
- Nang.
- Let's go out to eat after this.

1001
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,920
Nang, I'm busy.

1002
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:39,960
Artit, but the festival
has finished.

1003
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:45,569
Artit! What's up with you?

1004
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:19,720
Aueng.

1005
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,960
- Yes?
- Where's Paeng?

1006
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:23,119
She said she'll be back.

1007
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,609
But it's been a while now.

1008
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,439
Let's go home now but let me
get some coffee first.

1009
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:38,960
- Of course.
- Let's have some coffee.

1010
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:40,960
- I drink it three times a day.
- Non!

1011
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:42,760
Kot!

1012
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,079
- Has anyone seen Paeng?
- What's happened?

1013
01:10:45,529 --> 01:10:46,880
Paeng followed some random person.

1014
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:49,119
I followed her
but she's nowhere to be found.

1015
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,319
Shoot.

1016
01:10:50,609 --> 01:10:51,720
This doesn't sound right.

1017
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,960
Let's split up and look for her.

1018
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,399
Come on, Ling.

1019
01:10:56,279 --> 01:10:58,000
Uh, hey.

1020
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,159
He's gone that way,
they're over there.

1021
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:02,399
Which way should I go?

1022
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,079
That way then.

1023
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,609
Where are you taking me?

1024
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,439
- Hey!
- Didn't you use chloroform on her?

1025
01:11:53,569 --> 01:11:54,649
How come she's awake?

1026
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,239
Let me go!

1027
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:00,880
Let me go!

1028
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,840
Let me go!

1029
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,399
Oh, shoot! Go after her!

1030
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:24,199
Hey!

1031
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,529
Here! Grab her!

1032
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,529
You're putting up a fight?

1033
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:30,079
Tonight, you won't be
so tough anymore.

1034
01:12:30,569 --> 01:12:31,649
Go!

1035
01:12:38,529 --> 01:12:39,609
This is none of your business!

1036
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,079
Mark!

1037
01:12:58,439 --> 01:12:59,529
Paeng.

1038
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,159
- Mark.
- Don't be afraid.

1039
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:03,199
You're safe with me.

1040
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:28,760
Stay here.

1041
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,119
You'll be safe.

1042
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,720
Thank you very much.

1043
01:13:42,609 --> 01:13:44,279
If you didn't get there in time,

1044
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,279
I might've been...

1045
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:48,399
Don't be afraid.

1046
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:50,529
If you're with me,

1047
01:13:51,529 --> 01:13:53,199
no one's going to hurt you.

1048
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:02,680
You go hurt

1049
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,239
because of me.

1050
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,720
Let me take care of your wound.

1051
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:19,479
You're worried about me?

1052
01:14:22,569 --> 01:14:23,920
Of course I am.

1053
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,880
I'm actually very worried.

1054
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:25,920
Where are you now?

1055
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:29,279
Good.

1056
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,039
Wait for me there.

1057
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:43,609
Pick up, Paeng!

1058
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,960
GPS.

1059
01:15:58,119 --> 01:15:59,279
It worked!

1060
01:16:08,609 --> 01:16:09,680
The boss is coming.

1061
01:16:21,529 --> 01:16:22,649
Who are you?

1062
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:24,439
Where are you taking me?

1063
01:16:24,569 --> 01:16:26,239
Why's she awake?

1064
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:29,609
Hey! We're in trouble.

1065
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,239
Go after her.

1066
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,159
What do you want?

1067
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:50,649
Do you want money?

1068
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,199
I'll go and get it for you.

1069
01:16:52,569 --> 01:16:55,279
Please let me go! I promise
I won't go to the police.

1070
01:16:56,609 --> 01:16:59,039
- Get up!
- Don't do anything to me, please!

1071
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:01,569
- Let her go!
- Artit!

1072
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:06,479
Artit!

1073
01:17:06,569 --> 01:17:07,649
Watch out!

1074
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:30,079
Stop! Stop!

1075
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:31,800
If you don't stop, I'll stab her!

1076
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:53,319
Whose car is this?

1077
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,760
Artit!

1078
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,359
You're both are going to die
if you keep fighting.

1079
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:38,479
Artit! Artit!

1080
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,649
Artit! Wake up!

1081
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:42,239
Artit!

1082
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,569
Artit! Artit!

1083
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:45,920
Artit!

1084
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,479
Artit! Artit!

1085
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,439
Artit! Artit!

1086
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,569
Artit! Wake up!

1087
01:19:03,079 --> 01:19:04,199
What on earth happened?

1088
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,399
We got a little sidetracked.

1089
01:19:06,609 --> 01:19:07,960
This guy showed up out of the blue
to save her.

1090
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,000
We didn't have a choice.

1091
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:11,479
- Who is he?
- It's Artit.

1092
01:19:12,529 --> 01:19:13,720
Artit,

1093
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:15,840
you asked for it.

1094
01:19:16,569 --> 01:19:17,720
What do you want us to do?

1095
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:21,279
Since he graced us
with his presence,

1096
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,760
let's have some fun with him.

1097
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,239
Take him to the storage facility.

1098
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,039
Keep an eye on him. I'll be there.

1099
01:19:28,569 --> 01:19:29,649
Understood, sir.

1100
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:34,119
Artit!

1101
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,960
Artit!

1102
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:43,279
- Hey!
- Come here!

1103
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,609
Let go!

1104
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:51,399
How is it?

1105
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:53,479
Artit didn't pick up.

1106
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,159
His phone is switched off.

1107
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:57,399
Has something happened?

1108
01:19:59,649 --> 01:20:01,439
I'll try calling Paeng.

1109
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:13,800
Her phone is off too.

1110
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:15,199
Gosh.

1111
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:17,800
Artit didn't pick up.
Paeng can't be reached.

1112
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:21,079
Holy spirits, I hope it's not
what I'm thinking.

1113
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:28,359
Artit! Artit!

1114
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:32,279
What do you want?

1115
01:20:37,649 --> 01:20:38,720
Artit!

1116
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,279
Artit!

1117
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:08,880
Dandin,

1118
01:21:09,319 --> 01:21:11,399
send me the layout
of your storage facility.

1119
01:21:31,569 --> 01:21:32,649
Artit!

1120
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,000
Artit!

1121
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,079
Paeng.

1122
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,239
It hurts.

1123
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:45,399
Careful.

1124
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,039
How are you doing?

1125
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,239
I'm okay.

1126
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:53,880
But you're...

1127
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,319
I'm fine.

1128
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:06,960
I don't know where they've taken us.

1129
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:11,239
Don't be afraid.

1130
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:14,960
I'll find a way to get
you out of here.

1131
01:22:25,529 --> 01:22:26,920
How many exits are there?

1132
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,680
Two.

1133
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:30,760
Just like in the layout
I sent to you.

1134
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:33,159
There's a road out front
and the woods are in the back.

1135
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,079
Why do you need the layout for?

1136
01:22:35,609 --> 01:22:38,319
Your storage facility is the perfect
place for me to play a game.

1137
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:40,800
So I invited a friend over.

1138
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:42,569
Don't cause me any trouble.

1139
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:45,529
Don't worry.

1140
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:47,960
Okay.

1141
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,279
You want us to guard
the front entrance

1142
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:54,960
and open the exit at the back?

1143
01:22:55,479 --> 01:22:58,239
Huh? Then they'll be able to escape.

1144
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:00,680
Let them go.

1145
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:03,880
I'll deal with the rest.

1146
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:07,159
Yes, sir.

1147
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,079
Let's go.

1148
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:03,359
Paeng,

1149
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,279
you're scared, aren't you?

1150
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:09,399
I'm not scared for myself.

1151
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:13,609
But I'm scared something might
happen to you because of me again.

1152
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,760
If you get hurt because of me,

1153
01:24:17,239 --> 01:24:19,760
I don't think I'll be able
to face Uncle and Auntie anymore.

1154
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,039
Don't be a crybaby.

1155
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,880
I don't hurt easily.

1156
01:24:33,159 --> 01:24:34,840
You have to promise me.

1157
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,439
No matter what happens,

1158
01:24:36,609 --> 01:24:38,119
you have to escape.

1159
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,119
Do you want me to abandon you?

1160
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:44,760
No way.

1161
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:49,479
We'll get out of this together.

1162
01:25:05,609 --> 01:25:06,680
Wait here.

1163
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:35,880
Where have they gone to?

1164
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,079
No one's there now. This way.

1165
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:41,720
Come on.

1166
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,279
Let's go.

1167
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:14,569
Please take care of it.

1168
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:16,479
Thank you very much.

1169
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,569
I called the police and told them
to search for Artit and Paeng.

1170
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,199
Thank you very much
for letting me know.

1171
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:27,800
If there are any updates,

1172
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:29,359
I'll call you.

1173
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:31,439
Anytime, Uncle.

1174
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:46,479
Hey! There!

1175
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,039
Run! Hurry!

1176
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:02,960
Come on.

1177
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,239
Let's go.

1178
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,119
That direction leads to the road.

1179
01:27:20,359 --> 01:27:21,609
I'll go the other way.

1180
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,960
You run away and find help.

1181
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:26,479
No, I'm not letting you go.

1182
01:27:27,399 --> 01:27:29,640
I told you we'll get
through this together.

1183
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:34,680
Did you forget
that I'm a rugby player?

1184
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,960
I can run the fastest in the team.

1185
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:38,199
They won't be able to catch up.

1186
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:40,680
No, I'm not going.

1187
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,199
You have to do as I say.

1188
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,720
If we go together,

1189
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,760
we might die together.

1190
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,960
Run as fast as you can

1191
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,800
and find someone to help me.

1192
01:27:58,319 --> 01:27:59,399
Okay?

1193
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,000
Listen to me for once, Paeng.

1194
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:20,279
Hey!

1195
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:33,520
He followed us here?

1196
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,319
Tonight I'll stay with you.

1197
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:37,319
But tomorrow I'll visit Mark.

1198
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,359
I will find evidence

1199
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:41,079
and find out

1200
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:42,520
who shot me

1201
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,720
and kidnapped Paeng.

1202
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,399
Please tell Paeng for me

1203
01:28:45,479 --> 01:28:46,560
that I'm feeling lonely.

1204
01:28:47,079 --> 01:28:48,560
Let me sleep a little longer.

1205
01:28:49,159 --> 01:28:50,880
Let go of my hand.

1206
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:56,960
Who's wouldn't be embarrassed

1207
01:28:57,079 --> 01:28:58,520
if a guy took their clothes off
in front of them?

1208
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,239
Your muscles

1209
01:29:00,359 --> 01:29:02,239
make my heart race.

1210
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,800
Do you want to kiss me?

1211
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,399
You really hated me.

1212
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,079
Yes, I did. But now,

1213
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:08,359
I don't hate you anymore.
