1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,050
Come on! Come on!

3
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,340
Quick! Quick!

4
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,710
Artit! Keep going!

5
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,419
Keep going, Artit!

6
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,919
Hooray!

7
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,879
Come on!

8
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,000
Quick!

9
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,500
Non, Non! Hurry!

10
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:21,300
Artit!

11
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,840
Keep going, Artit!

12
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,460
Keep going, Artit!

13
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,379
Keep going, Artit!

14
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Keep going, Artit!

15
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,800
Keep going, Artit!

16
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:39,050
I'm going to announce the names
of the people who passed the tryout.

17
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,250
Ekkachai,

18
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,550
Noppadol, Ohm,

19
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,000
Warat,

20
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,590
Artit

21
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,090
and finally,

22
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,840
Thanon.

23
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,000
Congratulations.

24
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,550
How was it?

25
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,550
It was great fun.

26
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,800
- Come on.
- So much fun.

27
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,550
There, there!

28
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,300
I'm so happy

29
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,169
I now have a friend
in the university's rugby team.

30
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,210
I'm going to brag about it
to everyone I see.

31
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,379
Show-off.

32
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,339
The talented one is right here.

33
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,050
He hasn't even said a word.

34
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,339
Seriously?

35
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,500
You only complimented
Artit and not me.

36
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,339
- I'm sad now.
- It's okay.

37
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,300
I'll compliment you, Non.

38
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,920
I think we should celebrate!
Let's go eat something!

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,589
I want this, this,

40
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,750
this and this. They're all good.

41
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,589
I'd like this

42
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,129
and this.

43
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:40,670
That's it.

44
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:44,209
As for me, I'd like this and this.

45
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,050
This one too.

46
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,300
Are you challenging me

47
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
into pronouncing
difficult food names?

48
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,800
No, we're not.

49
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,839
Everything we're going
to order is delicious.

50
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,709
Spicy pork belly
with beans and ginger.

51
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:00,300
Oops.

52
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:03,089
Chicken stir-fry with cashew nuts.

53
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,089
Coyote leaves stir-fry.

54
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,500
It's chayote.

55
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,959
It's pronounced "chai-yow-tee,"
not coyote.

56
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:12,209
We can't eat wolves.

57
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,959
Stiffed chicken wings.

58
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,129
Hold up!

59
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,629
It's "stuffed."
Stuffed chicken wings.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,089
You made it sound dirty.

61
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,920
Don't argue.

62
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,839
Where should we go after this?

63
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,839
You all can just go ahead.

64
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,959
I have some errands to run.

65
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:31,839
What errands?

66
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,000
What errands?

67
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,170
Hey!
Where do you think you're going?

68
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,129
I can't believe you followed me.

69
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,920
Why do I keep running
into wimps today?

70
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,670
You potty mouth!

71
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,250
All right!

72
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:55,420
Hey!

73
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,339
You want it? Come and get it!

74
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,089
Slap her.

75
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,420
- Hold her!
- Slap her!

76
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,920
Slap her now!

77
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,800
Hey, hey!

78
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,170
Remember, stay away
from my boyfriend!

79
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,670
Are you fighting over a boy?

80
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,920
Don't speak if you
don't know anything.

81
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,879
You have no right
to hurt other people.

82
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,089
Stay away!

83
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,339
Let me go!

84
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,339
Hey, come back here!

85
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,629
I'm taking you to your teacher.

86
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,000
Excuse me, where's
the disciplinary office?

87
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:28,500
- I'm not going!
- Come here!

88
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,379
You deserved that!

89
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,339
Who was that man, Little Miss?

90
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,959
I don't know.

91
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,000
He wanted a smack
so I gave it to him.

92
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,000
Come on, Little Miss. Again?

93
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,800
Don't let Master know that you
got into a fight again.

94
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,089
If you and I don't speak,
no one would know. Right?

95
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,339
Right? Right?

96
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,170
You're using this against me again.

97
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,339
I'm very worried about you.

98
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,300
I really want to warn you.

99
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,209
You've been transferred twice.

100
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,629
- If there's a third time...
- Wang!

101
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:08,750
You don't have to keep saying that.

102
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,300
I'll try to be less hot-tempered.

103
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,209
But you have to keep quiet, okay?

104
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,920
Okay.

105
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,000
But I'm not okay.
I want to tell Master.

106
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,050
Come on, Jaem.

107
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:27,339
You don't love me at all.
That's why you want dad to scold me.

108
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,670
Because I love you that's
why I want to tell Master.

109
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,550
See? Your old wounds
hasn't even healed yet.

110
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,550
When are you going to make friends
if you keep picking on people?

111
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,670
It's better to have none
than having bad friends.

112
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,209
That's too far.

113
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,709
No, it's not.

114
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,089
If you know what they did to me.

115
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:49,170
They approached me and pretended
to be nice to me

116
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,839
because they know I'm rich.

117
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,959
They're all looking to
take advantage of me.

118
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,500
As for the boys, they just want
to hook up with me.

119
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,589
Oh my! Where did you
learn that word?

120
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,089
Jaem,

121
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,170
I'm already 15 and not
an innocent five-year-old.

122
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:10,959
That's Dad's car! What do I do?

123
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,089
That's good. So I can...

124
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:16,879
Oh? Miss Paeng!

125
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,959
You're just going to hide like that?

126
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,500
Aueng.

127
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,299
Yes, sir?

128
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,960
Where's my sassy little girl?

129
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,960
Uhh...

130
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,840
Miss Paeng's not here.

131
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,379
Oh?

132
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,960
She's not here?

133
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,049
Well, then. I'm going.

134
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:04,500
That was close.

135
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,250
If Dad saw me, I might...

136
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,129
You might what, Paeng?

137
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:12,250
Dad!

138
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,340
Yes, it's me!

139
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,590
Uhh...

140
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,500
I studied hard today.

141
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,129
So I fell asleep.

142
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:24,500
Really?

143
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,129
You studied very hard?

144
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,500
Come a little closer.

145
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:31,629
Come closer.

146
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,669
Can I look at
the studious girl's face?

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,340
Oho.

148
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,129
You studied so hard,
you got bruises all over.

149
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:47,460
I didn't start it.

150
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:49,250
It was just self-defense.

151
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:51,669
Paeng,

152
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:53,460
you've grown up.

153
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:56,750
You shouldn't fight
with other people.

154
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,919
You should reason with them.

155
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:02,419
Reasons wouldn't have helped, Dad.

156
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,460
I can't believe you.

157
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,629
I guess

158
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,919
you don't need this anymore.

159
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,960
Whoa, Hermes!

160
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,500
That's right. I was going
to give it to you

161
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,799
but maybe I should keep it for now.

162
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,960
No!

163
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:23,049
You can't do that.

164
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,590
This is mine
so it should be with me.

165
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:27,879
I promise

166
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,669
I won't be in a fight from now on.

167
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:34,210
Please? Pretty please?

168
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,340
- Please?
- Paeng,

169
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,090
listen to me.

170
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,379
I care about you.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,379
You're my only daughter.

172
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,460
I want you to live happily
in the society.

173
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,169
I want you to have friends and meet
decent people in life.

174
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,379
I don't need anyone else.

175
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,590
Only you and Mom is enough.

176
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,210
What about Mom?

177
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,129
Mom!

178
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,460
Mom!

179
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,960
I'm here.

180
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:15,750
Oh, she's here.

181
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,879
Are you tired?

182
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,169
Not at all.

183
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840
This is too difficult.
Look at all the numbers.

184
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:35,210
Here's a drink.

185
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:48,750
Ling, just pick one

186
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,169
so I can have the other.

187
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,669
- Darn.
- Yes!

188
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,840
What?

189
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,090
Just hand it to me nicely.

190
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:00,919
You don't think of me at all.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,629
Don't be jealous.

192
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,669
Ling is the only girl in the group.

193
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,419
We have to take care of her.

194
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,590
Correct.

195
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,419
If you want to be treated like this,

196
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,960
then get a gender
reassignment surgery.

197
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:13,710
If I actually did that, you wouldn't
be able to say no to me.

198
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,590
Would you like to see?

199
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,340
I can't believe
you're considering it.

200
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:20,549
- Here.
- I'll be back.

201
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:21,879
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

202
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:24,710
To the bathroom.

203
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,090
You two, sit down.

204
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,960
Have you forgotten the rules?

205
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,250
No hitting on your friends.

206
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,210
I was just taking care of her.

207
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:42,340
We both did that
before we're gentlemen.

208
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,340
- You wouldn't understand.
- Really?

209
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,549
You're lying.

210
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,129
You too.

211
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:58,629
- Who cooked these?
- It's Jaem.

212
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,169
Paeng,

213
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,000
come eat with me.

214
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:06,919
What about Mom?
Is she on a diet again?

215
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,340
She's stick-thin already.
I'll go get her.

216
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:14,879
Wait. No need. She's not here.

217
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,250
She went to a party.

218
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,549
Again?

219
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,049
Ms. Pim?

220
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,590
You're here.

221
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:44,750
- Hello.
- Have you seen

222
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,669
the video?

223
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:48,919
Here.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,299
Slap her!

225
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:55,750
Slap her now!

226
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,799
Isn't that Paeng?

227
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,049
She looks very similar.

228
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,500
It's her, isn't it?

229
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,799
(Paeng)

230
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,169
Excuse me.

231
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:17,500
Of course.

232
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,299
You're really not going
to pick up, Mom?

233
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:29,710
All right.

234
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,049
What's the matter, Miss Paeng?

235
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:38,299
Go out with me.

236
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,750
Again?

237
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,549
Master might scold you.

238
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't care. I'm going
to bring Mom home.

239
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,840
Why would you do that?

240
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,049
I don't understand.

241
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,710
I'm going to make Mom worry
so that she rushes home.

242
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,960
Artit.

243
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,669
- Artit, Artit.
- Coming.

244
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,379
Artit, the Venerable Monk's here.

245
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:01,710
Boo!

246
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:05,299
Aren't you tired?
Where are you going now?

247
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I was studying but I couldn't focus.
So, I'm taking you clubbing.

248
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:11,000
That's obviously an excuse.

249
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,879
Come on. Just occasionally.

250
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,629
We don't go every night. Come on.

251
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,379
- Go and get changed, Artit.
- Which club?

252
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,840
Whoa, he's actually coming?

253
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,250
- I'm not. I'm too lazy to go.
- Then why did you ask?

254
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:24,500
- It's just a question.
- Go change now.

255
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,250
You look like...

256
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,299
Hello?

257
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,840
Paeng, let's go home!

258
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,590
I feel so out of place.

259
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:48,960
How can you?

260
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,250
I dressed you up.
You look beautiful.

261
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:52,590
Beautiful?

262
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:55,419
My cheeks are so red
they look like a monkey's butt.

263
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,210
The blush will lighten
after a while.

264
00:15:58,299 --> 00:15:59,960
- Come on.
- Hold on.

265
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,840
Will you be able to get in?

266
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,960
You're still underage.

267
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,169
That's why we have
to dress up so much.

268
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,460
They're all so pretty.

269
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,299
They've got really great music here.

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,750
Whoa!

271
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,340
So flashy!

272
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,879
Whoo!

273
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:27,669
So many girls!

274
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,210
One for each of us to take home.

275
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,419
Wow.

276
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,299
You're out of ice.

277
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,590
Who are you looking for?

278
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:45,629
Don't mind me.

279
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,299
He's looking for seats.

280
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:48,460
You don't have to look anymore.
Over there.

281
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,960
Let's take them.
There are tons available.

282
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,549
This is a good location.

283
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,169
So many girls.

284
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,920
Aueng, hold this.

285
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,839
So pretty.

286
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,089
Hold on.

287
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,420
You can't drink that.

288
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,000
Aueng, I'm just pretending.

289
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,710
Take a photo and send to Mom.
Come on.

290
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,880
- One, two, three.
- How old is she?

291
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,339
She looks very young.

292
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,339
Probably a spoiled brat.

293
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,460
One, two, three.

294
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,920
One, two, three.

295
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,210
- All done?
- All done.

296
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,210
- She's read the text.
- Okay.

297
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,130
Not again, Paeng.

298
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,549
But she doesn't reply.

299
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,130
Aueng, look for a guy.

300
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,750
I'll send her a picture with him.

301
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Isn't that too far?

302
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,920
Just pretending to drink
and dance is enough?

303
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:26,210
I found one.

304
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,380
Miss Paeng!

305
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,170
- Oh, no.
- Wow, she's good.

306
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,089
She approaches guys first.

307
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,960
Darn it.

308
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,380
Kot,

309
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,549
that table.

310
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,089
In white.

311
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:45,799
The whole gang is here.

312
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Artit, I've found preys. Let's go.

313
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,500
I'm not going. You go.

314
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:50,710
What's up with you?

315
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,380
Watch the table and the bags then.

316
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,630
- Fine.
- I'll be back.

317
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,380
Should I wear my hat or not?

318
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,549
Let's go.

319
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,460
- Hello, what's your name.
- It's Paeng.

320
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,460
Can we take a picture together?

321
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,750
Sure.

322
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,000
- Aueng, hurry and take it.
- Okay.

323
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,750
Oh my!

324
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,049
One,

325
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,299
two,

326
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,130
three. All done.

327
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:29,589
Thank you very much.

328
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,130
Hold on. What's the hurry?

329
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:35,960
We should head to another club.
It's too crowded here.

330
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,880
It's okay. I'm about to go home.

331
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,549
What's the rush?

332
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,920
We've just started talking.

333
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,500
Her mom's worried.

334
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,549
She needs to hurry home.

335
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,589
Don't go yet. Stay.

336
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,920
Drink this.

337
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,250
Then you can go home.

338
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,630
She's got a class in the morning.

339
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,380
She should hurry back.

340
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,339
Please. This is a punishment
for leaving early.

341
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,420
Please don't drink.

342
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,750
- Please.
- You can't go home if you don't.

343
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,210
Okay.

344
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,630
Please don't drink. No.

345
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,880
Come on, Aueng. So we can just go.

346
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,250
The drink's been spiked.

347
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,339
Mr. Artit!

348
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,799
Hello?

349
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,299
Mr. Artit,

350
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,920
what should I do? Miss Paeng
insisted on going clubbing.

351
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,130
She wouldn't listen to me.

352
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,299
Which club is she going to?

353
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:53,670
Aueng!

354
00:20:58,339 --> 00:20:59,420
Stay out of the way.

355
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,339
Artit is in trouble.

356
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,460
Girls, stay behind me.

357
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,880
Hey!

358
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:13,710
Kot, take him!

359
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:19,880
That's cheating!
You can't gang up against me.

360
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,250
That's right. I'm not a hero.

361
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:24,630
Mr. Artit!

362
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,589
Mr. Artit!

363
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,130
Artit! Artit, enough!

364
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,839
Enough already. Artit!

365
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,299
Enough!

366
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,420
- Enough!
- What happened?

367
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:39,670
They tried to drug women.

368
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,500
You scumbag!

369
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,089
Did you spike her drink? Did you?

370
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:47,960
You scumbag!

371
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,089
Officer, we're not with them

372
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,839
We helped these girls
from these perverts.

373
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
My friend saw them

374
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,920
putting drugs in the glass.
You can check it out.

375
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,130
- That's right.
- Do you have anything to say?

376
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,250
You're denying it?
My friend caught you in the act!

377
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:14,589
- You have to be harsh to them.
- Calm down.

378
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,960
It's none of our business.
Why did we have to come along?

379
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,049
Oh.

380
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,299
You're so ungrateful.

381
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,750
I shouldn't have helped.

382
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,960
- Who asked for it?
- Miss Paeng!

383
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,299
Why does she seem so grateful?

384
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,839
But I think she's quite cute.

385
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,049
Aueng, Mom's here!

386
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,000
Paeng! Did you drink?
You reek of alcohol!

387
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,920
She didn't.

388
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,670
It spilled all over her.

389
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,000
Artit, thank you very much.

390
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,670
If you weren't there,
she would be in trouble.

391
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,210
It's okay.

392
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,380
You keep bringing trouble
to yourself.

393
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,920
Why do you keep making me worry?

394
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,750
I can go home now, can't I?

395
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,170
- Please.
- Let's go home, Mom.

396
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,670
- Wait.
- It's okay, Auntie.

397
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,210
I've paid the fine.

398
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,750
Thank you.

399
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:13,170
Come on, Mom.

400
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:16,799
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

401
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,460
- She's so spoiled.
- Right.

402
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,000
I like it.

403
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,920
Give me your ID card.

404
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,170
- Come here!
- Jaem!

405
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,339
Enough, Jaem.

406
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,630
I'm sorry, Sir.

407
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,630
Miss Paeng told me

408
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,880
she'd go alone
if I didn't go with her.

409
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,210
So I had to.

410
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,250
I'm not blaming you. I understand.

411
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,839
Go get Paeng.

412
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,420
Thep,

413
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,460
it's my fault.

414
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,089
Pim, not now.

415
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,049
Stop taking her side.

416
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,210
She's gone too far this time.

417
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:07,460
But she's probably
learned her lessons.

418
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:10,380
She's been through a lot tonight.

419
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:12,170
Let her rest.

420
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,130
It's for the fine last night.

421
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,380
Paeng's, yours and your friends'.

422
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,839
It's okay.

423
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:32,710
Come on, Aritit.

424
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,839
How can it be okay?

425
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:39,210
I already feel bad that you helped
keeping an eye on Paeng.

426
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,549
Take it.

427
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,880
Thank you.

428
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,880
My daughter, Paeng is...

429
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,210
so stubborn.

430
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,339
Has she always been like this?

431
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:56,380
Not in the past.

432
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,799
Maybe I haven't got time
for her lately.

433
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,000
So she's begging for attention.

434
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,000
Anyway,

435
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,420
I'd like to thank you.

436
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,339
At least I have you helping me
take care of her.

437
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,049
Thank you.

438
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,130
You're welcome.

439
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,500
Hey, Kot.

440
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,710
Ling?

441
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,750
What are you doing here?

442
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,339
The class is starting.

443
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,460
I don't know where Artit is.

444
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,130
Oh, really?

445
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,880
But he left before us.

446
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:40,420
Maybe he's going to see that girl.

447
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:42,170
What girl?

448
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:09,670
Fighting.

449
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,710
Clubbing and drinking.

450
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:13,420
Anything else you haven't done?

451
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,839
You're here again?

452
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:19,130
Did Dad hire you to follow me?

453
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,960
Where are you going?
Don't you have classes?

454
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,670
- I don't.
- Do I look stupid?

455
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,960
Go back to class.

456
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,799
You're acting like a troubled child.

457
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,589
Do you think begging for attention
like this will work?

458
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:41,670
Stay out of it.

459
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,589
Get back inside now.

460
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,460
Are you from
the disciplinary office?

461
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,000
Let me go.

462
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,460
Come here.

463
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,880
Let me go, Artit! Let go!

464
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,299
Let go! Artit, that hurts!

465
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,089
That really hurts!

466
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,460
Stop acting like this.

467
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,210
There aren't parents
who don't love their child.

468
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,380
They love you so much.
Do you know that?

469
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:24,750
Don't talk
if you don't know anything.

470
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,920
You've tried misbehaving.

471
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,960
Did it work?

472
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,799
Why don't you try to be a good girl?

473
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:52,710
Wanfahmai?

474
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:56,250
Wanfahmai?

475
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:01,170
Present.

476
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,799
You're late.

477
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:05,750
I'm sorry, ma'am.

478
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,589
SKD can be distinguished
into five categories.

479
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,750
Hey, Artit.

480
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,299
Where have you been?

481
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,710
I went to deal with a spoiled brat.

482
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,589
See? I knew it.

483
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,799
You like her, don't you?

484
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,920
Are you crazy?
I don't want to go to jail.

485
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,299
But I do.

486
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,670
Korakot.

487
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,589
Let's continue.

488
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,000
Next, the first case.

489
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,920
The case can be distinguished
into two types.

490
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,630
The main case and...

491
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,839
Wow,

492
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,589
you're home on time, Miss Paeng.

493
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,799
You're all neat.

494
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,460
No scratches.

495
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:22,339
Am I dreaming?

496
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,799
If you are, then I am too.

497
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,250
Wake up, everyone.

498
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,089
Don't tease me. Or I might not
be like this again.

499
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:33,420
I won't tease you.

500
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,500
But you're very lovely today.

501
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:37,710
Can you be like this every day?

502
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,589
I'm so glad. Are you hungry?

503
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,460
I've prepared refreshments.
Let's go.

504
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,380
- Mr. Artit's here!
- Artit!

505
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,960
Still as handsome as ever!

506
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,210
Mr. Artit's here!

507
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:54,960
I know. Why do you have to shout?
My ears are hurting.

508
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,299
Mr. Artit! Let me hug you.
I've missed you.

509
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,920
You've been gone for so long.

510
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,839
Mr. Artit, I've missed you too.

511
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,839
I've missed you too.

512
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,750
- Let me hug...
- Simmer it down, Duang.

513
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,670
We can't let our guard down
for a moment, can we?

514
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,210
Seriously.

515
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,589
Just a stroke, then.

516
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,299
Wow, Mom.

517
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,960
Why is there so much food?

518
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:24,299
Who called and said he wants
to eat this and that?

519
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,839
So I went all in.

520
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,630
I need a couple of days
to eat it all up. This is a lot.

521
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,500
- Take a seat.
- Go ahead.

522
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,880
- Oh?
- These two.

523
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,170
Thanks, Saeb.

524
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,339
- Are you tired?
- Oops, sorry.

525
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,170
You got rice all over him.

526
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:53,839
Please eat up.

527
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,710
- Enough, Saeb.
- He's tired.

528
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,589
You're tired. You should eat a lot.

529
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:06,049
You said you want to
eat so many things.

530
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,170
Who is it, Mom?

531
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:11,630
It's Mr. Songtham,
your dad's new business partner.

532
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,960
Hello.

533
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,299
Hello.

534
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:19,000
I apologize for disturbing
your family time.

535
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,880
It's okay.

536
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,089
Please come to the living room.

537
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,299
Very well.

538
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,049
Hey!

539
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,549
I'm sorry, Mr. Artit.

540
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:50,000
Don't you have work to do?
Why are you here?

541
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,210
We've finished working

542
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:53,460
so we're playing football.

543
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,210
Can we have the ball back?

544
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,250
Come and get it.

545
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,170
Hey! Hey!

546
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,089
Come here, Mr. Artit.

547
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,380
- Pass the ball to me!
- Pass it.

548
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,710
- Pass it.
- Where is it?

549
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,589
Go!

550
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,960
Pass it over.

551
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,250
- Come.
- Hey.

552
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,500
- I have to go now.
- Later, dude!

553
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,960
What did you say?

554
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,960
I'll see you later, Mr. Artit.
Play with us again.

555
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,380
Let's continue. Pass it to me.

556
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,380
Pass it!

557
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,839
Whoa!

558
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:10,170
Pass it!

559
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,170
Save your energy for work too.

560
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,589
Wow!

561
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
What have you bought?

562
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,339
I don't know. I can't remember.

563
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,799
Where's Dad?

564
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,549
Master went out to do some work.

565
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,549
But today, Madam is home.

566
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,460
Mom's home?

567
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,750
Yes.

568
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,089
Hurry home, Dad.

569
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,549
I have a surprise for you.

570
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,550
Okay, honey.

571
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,710
I'm home!

572
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,920
Dad! You're home!

573
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,670
Dad,

574
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,710
I give you ten minutes
to get changed.

575
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,550
Ten minutes?

576
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,090
Right now.
Put on something nice, okay?

577
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,590
Hold on, hold on.

578
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,000
What's going on here?

579
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,380
No, you have to get changed first
and I'll tell you.

580
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,920
- What's up with you?
- Come on.

581
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,460
Are you stunned, Mr. Gentleman?

582
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,920
My wife is so beautiful today.

583
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,840
Paeng chose the dress.

584
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:23,550
Feel free to relax.
I'm going to sit over there.

585
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,800
Wait.

586
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,250
You brought Aueng and Jaem as well.

587
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,460
My sassy girl,
what are you concocting?

588
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,460
The music is so loud.

589
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,340
So what's the special surprise?
Tell me now.

590
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,500
I want a sibling.

591
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,840
Paeng!

592
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,710
Are you being serious?

593
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,800
Of course I am.

594
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,880
Are you serious!

595
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,130
What do you think?

596
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,880
You smell so nice.

597
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,710
I use this one every day.

598
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,050
No, you smell extra nice today.

599
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,300
Don't tell me you're playing
along with Paeng.

600
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,340
Why not?

601
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,090
Having another baby

602
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,170
is quite a good idea.

603
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,340
No.

604
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,460
I'm not playing along.

605
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:49,170
We're so preoccupied
with the one we have.

606
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,090
Come on, Pim.

607
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,710
I want to have another baby.

608
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,880
- Please?
- No.

609
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,750
Cherry.

610
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,130
Can you be my tutor?
I'm not good at this.

611
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,670
But I'm good at one thing.

612
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,630
And that's winning you over.

613
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,550
How about that?

614
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,340
You're good at that?

615
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,210
It's very annoying, Kot.

616
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,750
I really don't understand it.

617
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,130
Hey!

618
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,550
Hey!

619
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,000
I've lost something.

620
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,300
I can't find it. Help me, Ling.

621
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,460
Keep looking. You'll find it.

622
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,050
What? You're not playing
along with my joke.

623
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,300
You have to ask me
what I'm looking for.

624
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,050
It's an age-old joke.

625
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,340
You're looking for true love

626
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,840
and the heart you're missing, right?

627
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,960
Whoa!

628
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,670
Busted! Isn't that embarrassing?

629
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,920
- You have to use this joke...
- Enough, enough.

630
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,750
- What?
- What are you guys doing?

631
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,500
Artit,

632
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,880
can I have one good pick-up line?

633
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,500
- Let me think.
- This is my mentor.

634
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,880
It's coming.

635
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,130
- Just in time.
- Who's calling? Your darling?

636
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,250
- Home is where the heart...
- It's my mom.

637
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,920
- Yes, mom?
- Artit.

638
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,460
It's your dad. He's...

639
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,420
What's wrong with dad?

640
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,050
Don't let him get too stressed.

641
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,710
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

642
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,880
All right.

643
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,960
- Mom.
- Artit.

644
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,300
Your dad...

645
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,250
The doctor said

646
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,250
he went into a shock
because he's so stressed.

647
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,750
Why is he so stressed?

648
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,710
Songtham fooled him.

649
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,420
He's going to take our farm.

650
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,960
Songtham?

651
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,840
Mr. Songtham,
your dad's new business partner.

652
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,880
How is Dad doing now?

653
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,500
He's sleeping in the room.

654
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,170
Mom, what happened?

655
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,670
Please tell me.

656
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,710
Dad.

657
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,840
Artit.

658
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,250
He knows about it.

659
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,800
I'm sorry

660
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,420
for causing everyone trouble.

661
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,710
Dad, please rest.

662
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,750
Don't think of anything.

663
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,920
Tomorrow,

664
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,420
let's go home.

665
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,800
Thank you so much, Son.

666
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,090
I'm ready for a sibling!

667
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,630
- Good morning, Dad!
- Good morning.

668
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,420
Where's Mom?

669
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,090
She didn't tell you?

670
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,420
Tell me what?

671
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,590
She asked me if she could go on
an oversea trip with friends

672
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,880
two weeks ago.

673
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,250
What are you doing?

674
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,460
I'm going to bring her back.
I'm not letting her go.

675
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,420
Paeng.

676
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,630
Don't do this.

677
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,000
Let your mom have
her private time too.

678
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,800
What else can we do?

679
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,630
Can we check at the airport?

680
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,050
I'm going with her.

681
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,300
Paeng.

682
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,170
You've grown up.

683
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,710
Be reasonable.

684
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,750
Here.

685
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,630
Sit down. Talk to me.

686
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,090
What's wrong?

687
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,000
What's wrong, honey?

688
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,500
How about this?

689
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,130
While Mom's on her trip,

690
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,840
do you want to visit
another province with me?

691
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,050
Are you interested?

692
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,590
Are you okay with it?

693
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,460
Dad, let's go inside.

694
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,250
Artit.

695
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:29,250
Can you drive me around the farm?

696
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,460
Okay.

697
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,340
Do you know

698
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,000
that I know

699
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,210
every single grain of soil here?

700
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,340
When I started out,

701
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,670
it was just barren land.

702
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,590
No one saw how much it's worth.

703
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,960
But I'm sad,

704
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,960
not because I'm about to lose it.

705
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,630
I'm sad

706
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,630
because I've also

707
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,300
ruined your life.

708
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,590
Dad,

709
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,000
it's not that bad.

710
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,090
There must be a way out.

711
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,000
How is it, Paeng?

712
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,630
Do you feel more refreshed
with this nice weather and view?

713
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,840
Hmm?

714
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,090
Paeng?

715
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,880
Have you been here before?

716
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,750
I have a friend
who owns a farm here.

717
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,590
It's called Sunshine Farm.

718
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,090
Does that name ring a bell?

719
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,840
Not at all.

720
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,420
Who are you looking for?

721
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,500
I'm Mr. Songtham's lawyer.

722
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,210
Saeb!

723
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,420
- Saeb!
- Yes, Madam.

724
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,550
Madam?

725
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,550
- Yes, Madam?
- Get our staffs.

726
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,500
I'm here to see
Mr. Krongprateep in peace.

727
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,710
Master is here.

728
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,250
Mom.

729
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,550
Who are you?

730
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,420
He's Songtham's lawyer.

731
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,170
Mr. Songtham sent me

732
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,300
to deal with the ownership transfer
of this farm.

733
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,050
There won't be any transfer
or purchase or anything.

734
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,710
Go back and tell your boss.

735
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,840
That we will pay off the debt

736
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,590
Artit, calm down.

737
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,710
Don't be angry.

738
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,250
Let's negotiate.

739
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,920
Go back to where you came from!

740
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,630
No, Artit!

741
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,130
Help! Help!

742
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,840
Anyone, help!

743
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,210
Artit!

744
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,630
No, Artit!

745
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,050
Help! Please help!

746
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,800
Hurry!

747
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,550
Mr. Artit!

748
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,170
Artit!

749
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,590
Come on! Punch me!

750
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:01,750
Just like that!

751
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,500
I think

752
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,880
people who do farming
in the mountains like this

753
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,090
must be savages.

754
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,090
Why do you think that?

755
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,420
People around here are very nice.

756
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,960
They always smile.

757
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,670
They are also very friendly.

758
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,920
- Mr. Artit!
- I said stop!

759
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,210
Stop!

760
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,550
Right there!

761
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:25,750
There!

762
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,710
Mr. Artit!

763
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,340
Put down the gun!

764
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,960
Or I'll record it
and send to the police.

765
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,750
Put the gun away.

766
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,710
Do you want to get arrested?

767
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,380
If you meet them, you'll like them.

768
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,710
This is so nice.

769
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:06,300
A slow-paced life.

770
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:07,960
I like it.

771
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,090
Give me the phone now

772
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,840
unless you want to die.

773
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,960
All right. I'm doing this.

774
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,340
Watch out!

775
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,840
Kill him, Mr. Artit!

776
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,880
Enough! Enough!

777
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,050
Enough!

778
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,090
I've had enough!

779
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:36,380
You learned your lessons?

780
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:37,670
Enough!

781
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,380
Darn it!

782
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,590
I'm going to press charges

783
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,300
for assault.

784
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,500
Go ahead.

785
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,920
I'll send this clip with you holding
a gun to the police.

786
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,300
Mr. Krongpateep, I think you should
accept reality

787
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,250
and just sign the papers
to hand over your farm.

788
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,750
I won't.

789
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,250
And I'm not going to negotiate
anything with you.

790
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,340
If you want the farm,
then take this to court.

791
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,920
Who's coming?

792
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,460
It's Tharathep.

793
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,960
What's going on?

794
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,630
- Long story. I'll tell you later.
- Go away.

795
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,960
You want a smack?

796
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,500
Is this

797
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,250
the lovely home you told me, Dad?

798
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,750
It's full of thugs.

799
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,590
Aren't you getting out?

800
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,500
You must be shocked, Paeng.

801
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,090
There's nothing to worry about.

802
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,590
I'm not.
I've been in a lot of fights.

803
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,340
Paeng.

804
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,840
Save my face a little.

805
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,090
I'm sorry.

806
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,920
See, Artit?

807
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,300
Kids these days.

808
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:17,420
This is why I have to bother you
to help me looking after her.

809
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,550
No worries. It's my pleasure.

810
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,960
And what about you? When are you
going to stop acting up with him?

811
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,630
We're not close.

812
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,000
Well!

813
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,380
See? Kids nowadays.
They like to talk back.

814
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,300
Don't you remember him?

815
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,550
You were friends
when you were younger.

816
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,630
- Friends?
- Yes.

817
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,880
You came here when you were five.
Do you remember?

818
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:51,710
Back then you were still small and
you had those cute chubby cheeks.

819
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,550
She's very cute, indeed.

820
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,550
You gave
my battery-powered robot a bath.

821
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,300
I'll give you a bath and powder you.

822
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,960
Paeng!

823
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,210
You were naughty as well, Artit.

824
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,460
You locked her up in the woodshed.

825
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,250
Eight, nine, ten!

826
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,960
I'm coming!

827
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,550
Open up!

828
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,340
Open up, you big-headed!

829
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,960
Open up, big head!

830
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,550
She was so naughty.

831
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,920
So I had to teach her.

832
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,840
You're older but
you didn't act like it at all.

833
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,300
Paeng.

834
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,300
Artit, maybe

835
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,380
we should give her
a trip around the farm.

836
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,420
I'm not going.

837
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,380
Why not? Are you scared?

838
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,500
- I'm not.
- Then let's go.

839
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,880
Go on, Paeng.

840
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,130
I have something to talk
to my friend.

841
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,420
Okay.

842
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,050
Come on.

843
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,090
Krongprateep,

844
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:45,380
now can you tell me
what happened just now?

845
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,500
Thongkhum! Thongkhum!

846
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,590
Aren't you going to
check out the guests?

847
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,960
Why should I?
Don't you see I'm cooking?

848
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,050
Don't you want to know who came?

849
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:03,710
What's the use of knowing?

850
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,670
I have to cook
two more servings.

851
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:10,090
That's all. I'm not
a busybody like you.

852
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,050
That girl who came
looks like trouble.

853
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,550
She gets on my nerves.

854
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:18,500
They're Master's guests.

855
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,050
You dare to gossip about them?

856
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:24,050
Help me. Chop the vegetables.

857
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,920
Oh? Oh? Gently.

858
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:33,130
- Why are you so...
- How could I crush it gently?

859
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,670
Here.

860
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,050
What?

861
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,670
The key to the ATV.

862
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,130
Darn. I forgot.

863
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,750
A city kid like you probably
doesn't know how to drive.

864
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,710
Here.

865
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,550
Come on.

866
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,300
Are you going to play
a trick on me again?

867
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,300
If you behave, then I won't.

868
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,380
- Hold on to my waists.
- No.

869
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,920
Big head!

870
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,550
What did you call me?

871
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,170
You recognize me now?

872
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,840
I don't.

873
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,340
I'm not going anymore.
I'll stay with Dad.

874
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,880
No, You big-headed jerk!

875
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,630
I really trusted Songtham

876
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,460
to the point that I allowed
him to be a partner.

877
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,380
Lately,

878
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,590
he told me to expand the farm

879
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,130
and take out a loan for it.

880
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,090
I didn't know

881
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,340
that it would turn out this way.

882
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,840
I'm going to be frank with you.

883
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,170
How much time do you have?

884
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,130
I...

885
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,210
I have...

886
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:20,250
two months.

887
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,250
And after that...

888
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:29,210
Krongprateep,

889
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,170
are you going to be okay with it

890
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:35,250
if I say I want to help you?

891
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,300
Come on.

892
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,710
Where are you taking me?

893
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,420
You'll see.

894
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:21,630
Or are you going to kill me
and left my body in the woods?

895
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,210
You're delusional.

896
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,000
I'm taking you to see

897
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,880
something that a kid from Bangkok
has never seen before.

898
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,880
I don't think there's
anything I've never seen.

899
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,460
Just follow me.

900
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,960
- Is it much further away?
- It's not.

901
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,130
It's so hot out here.

902
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,800
What now? Just a little more.

903
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,340
- Can I rest for a bit?
- Come on. Get up.

904
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,800
Just a bit further.

905
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,090
You act tough. But actually,

906
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:11,960
you're not as tough as you seem.

907
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,750
You're giving up already.

908
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,590
Don't you see you're still

909
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,050
a kid.

910
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,170
Why are you calling that? I'm not
a kid. I'm a grown-up now.

911
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,210
Do you want to race?

912
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,420
Come on!

913
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,210
Whoa!

914
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,960
This is so beautiful!

915
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,460
See? You're not
tired anymore, are you?

916
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:45,840
Sure.

917
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,960
Hey,

918
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,750
I'm older than you. Be polite.

919
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,920
You have to say "yes, Artit."

920
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:56,840
Yes.

921
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,000
"Yes, Artit."

922
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,340
Yes, Artit.

923
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,210
Satisfied?

924
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:07,710
It's a step up.

925
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,340
- Wow.
- Hey.

926
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,090
From now on

927
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,960
you have to always call me, Artit.

928
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:20,460
And I'll call you Paeng, okay?

929
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,550
Okay.

930
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,210
Okay, Artit.

931
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,250
Paeng,

932
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,920
the destroyer.

933
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,130
You destroy everything.

934
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,590
There!

935
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:38,750
- Hey, hey!
- Go away, Artit!

936
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:40,630
Do you really want me to go?

937
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,550
There are tigers here.
Watch out for them.

938
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,550
They like to appear out of nowhere.

939
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,420
Did you really believe it?

940
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,550
- You tricked me?
- Why? Why?

941
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,750
Are you going to smack me?

942
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:02,800
Give that to me.

943
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,130
I'm taking it.

944
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,460
Why did you ask me
to come here again?

945
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,130
Other people know

946
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,420
that I came here.

947
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,840
Come to my office on Monday

948
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,340
to receive a 52 million baht cheque.

949
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,840
I'm going to pay off the debt
on behalf of Mr. Krongprateep.

950
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,460
I have to discuss
with my client first.

951
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,590
Mr. Songtham must
really want this farm.

952
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,800
Tell him for me

953
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,550
that there's one owner of this farm.

954
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,800
It's the person who built it.

955
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:49,000
Mr. Songtham will be furious.

956
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,920
That's his business.

957
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,920
Thank you so much.

958
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,380
Why do you like getting into fights?

959
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,090
How is that fun?

960
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,050
Are you any different?

961
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,800
You're trying to teach me
but you're no different at all.

962
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,800
See? There is a lot of
evidence on your face.

963
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:43,300
I didn't want to be in a fight.

964
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,710
I didn't either.

965
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:50,750
Do you have any friends?

966
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,170
I don't want any.

967
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,550
Oh?

968
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,960
No one wants to be friends with you.

969
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:00,920
Says who?

970
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,300
I don't want to
be friends with them.

971
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,800
Do people who don't want
to have friends exist?

972
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,630
Hey,

973
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,920
do you know what friends are for?

974
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,460
I don't.

975
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,840
And I don't want to know.

976
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:28,250
Friends

977
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:31,880
make us feel like we're
not alone in the world.

978
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,300
Friends are there to listen to
your secrets and feelings,

979
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,960
both ups and downs.

980
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,170
Or they're there to give you advice

981
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,920
when you can't talk to parents.

982
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:52,460
I've never met anyone
who's like that.

983
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:54,710
When I look at them,

984
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,710
they think I'm looking for a fight.

985
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:03,250
I believe it.

986
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,300
See?

987
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,500
Well, see?

988
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,550
You like glancing at people.
Don't look at people like that.

989
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,920
And start smiling to other people.

990
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,420
So they won't think
you're arrogant or mean.

991
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,460
I'll try.

992
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,340
Smile.

993
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:37,250
- Do I look funny?
- See? Much better.

994
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,090
All right.

995
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,590
I'll be your first friend.

996
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,000
Krongpateep.

997
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,380
Thank you so much, my friend.

998
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:31,750
I'll hurry up and pay you back.

999
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:36,050
No rush. You can pay me back
once you have the money.

1000
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,170
Money is just physical material.

1001
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:41,840
Our friendship
is the most important.

1002
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:48,340
You've given so much
worth to our friendship.

1003
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,050
I believe that someday

1004
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:56,130
If I'm in trouble,

1005
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,420
you will help me too.

1006
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,420
Most definitely.

1007
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:03,960
If you need any help,

1008
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:05,920
you can tell me right away.

1009
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,340
I'm happy to do everything for you.

1010
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,710
You don't have to go that far.

1011
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,750
Really, Mr. Tharathep.

1012
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,590
What you did today
means a lot to us.

1013
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,250
If there's anything
I can do for you,

1014
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,920
I'd like to do it.

1015
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,840
Thank you.

1016
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:28,460
I'll tell you if there is.
But there's nothing right now.

1017
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,090
Dad!

1018
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,130
- Oh?
- They're here.

1019
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:34,920
Dad, I'm back.

1020
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:37,210
You've been gone quite a while.
Where did you take her?

1021
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,590
Just around here.
We couldn't go too far.

1022
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:42,300
- Because I'm starving now.
- Oh, really?

1023
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:45,090
- Are you?
- I'm starving too.

1024
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,460
That's not me.

1025
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,460
Oh, dear. My daughter.

1026
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,380
Paeng, try this.

1027
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,960
Stir-fried eggplant with pork mince.

1028
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,170
Thongkhum's cooking.

1029
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,130
The best in the world.

1030
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,050
Try it.

1031
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,550
How is it?

1032
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,960
So these two

1033
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:14,590
have really made up?

1034
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,550
I didn't intend to at first.

1035
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,170
But I was worried that someone
will call me narrow-minded.

1036
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,170
You're very generous, aren't you?

1037
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,750
Should I be grateful?

1038
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,000
Poor Artit.

1039
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:29,920
Are you tired? You have
to deal with her all day.

1040
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:32,250
I almost died.

1041
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:34,300
That's too over the top.

1042
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:37,590
You only asked him.
You're not worried about me.

1043
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:39,210
Oh, she's jealous.

1044
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:42,960
I can rest assured now.

1045
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,840
I think Paeng's made a friend.

1046
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,920
Artit has always wanted a sister.
His wish has been granted.

1047
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,550
Hold on, hold on.

1048
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:54,340
No one's going to ask me
if I want a sister like her?

1049
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,880
Oh, come on.

1050
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:00,050
Paeng will sulk.

1051
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,880
Please.

1052
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,880
Make yourself at a home.

1053
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:17,800
If you need anything else,
just tell me.

1054
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,710
Thank you very much, Ms. Tubtim.

1055
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,050
- Please rest.
- Okay. Thank you.

1056
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:25,670
How is it, Paeng?

1057
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:28,170
Do you like it here?

1058
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:32,170
I really like it, Dad. The weather's
nice and the view is beautiful.

1059
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,710
Oh?

1060
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,130
I'm happy.

1061
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:36,920
What about the people?

1062
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:39,960
Are they still savages
like you previously thought?

1063
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,710
They're better than I expected.

1064
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,750
Do you know that
Artit is very smart?

1065
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,500
If there's any subject

1066
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:52,800
that you want him to tutor or help,

1067
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,340
you can ask him. He can tutor you.

1068
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,670
You should hire a tutor instead.

1069
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,840
It's like he's monitoring
my behavior.

1070
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:05,550
Oh, you know it?

1071
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,300
Come on, Dad.

1072
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,380
Don't you trust me at all?

1073
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,670
It's not that. I'm just worried.

1074
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,210
Do you know if I could

1075
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,210
follow you and monitor
your behavior all the time,

1076
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,380
I'd do it.

1077
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,420
Then from now on,

1078
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,590
I'll try and behave. I promise.

1079
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,590
I'm glad to hear that.

1080
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:34,800
Paeng, my daughter.

1081
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,090
Do you know

1082
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,920
that you're the person
who means the most to me?

1083
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,710
You and Mom

1084
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:49,210
are the most important people
in my life too.

1085
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:51,840
My dear.

1086
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,590
Did Mr. Tharathep pay off our debt?

1087
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,090
That's right.

1088
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,050
He doesn't want any interest.

1089
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,420
There's no deadline when we
have to repay him either.

1090
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:21,210
Initially, he didn't even want
a loan agreement.

1091
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,800
Wow. Why is he so nice to us?

1092
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,500
I never thought that
a person this generous exists.

1093
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,840
Me neither.

1094
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,670
Not only he's helping us,

1095
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,380
but he also helps everyone
on the farm to make a living.

1096
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,170
I don't know if I can pay off
his debt in this life.

1097
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,960
Remember, Artit.

1098
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,000
We owe a lot to Tharathep.

1099
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:46,340
We must not forget.

1100
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:48,550
In the future,

1101
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,050
if we can do anything to repay him,

1102
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,550
we have to do it.

1103
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,380
Okay. I will.

1104
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,880
Nang, what are you doing?

1105
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,000
Strawberry cream puffs.

1106
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,670
You really like doing this,
don't you?

1107
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,380
Once you've graduated, I probably
have to open up a shop for you.

1108
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,550
Not really, Dad.
I'm making these for fun.

1109
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:28,880
I think you should give it a go.

1110
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,090
My daughter's beautiful
and talented.

1111
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:34,670
Your bakery is going to be popular.

1112
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,960
Should we sell these at our hotel?

1113
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,460
Not yet, I think.

1114
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,250
By the way,

1115
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,670
has anyone ever flirted with you?

1116
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,590
Dad!

1117
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,380
I was kidding. Don't go.

1118
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,800
I can't hold it in anymore!

1119
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,550
I'm sorry! Where's the bathroom?

1120
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:04,170
Thank you and sorry!

1121
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,750
Who's that?

1122
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,050
Whoa, whoa.

1123
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,130
What's wrong, Nang?

1124
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,960
Hello, Mom and Dad.

1125
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

1126
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:26,380
Mom and Dad, this is Kot and Ling,
the friends I often tell you about.

1127
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,130
I have to apologize to you.

1128
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,500
I'm so sorry, Nang.

1129
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,500
I really had to go to the bathroom.

1130
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,840
It's okay.

1131
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:40,090
It's like what they say

1132
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,800
that pretty ladies are usually kind.

1133
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,840
And ugly people

1134
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,420
are usually clumsy.

1135
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,750
Ling, we're on the same team.

1136
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,960
Why didn't you tell us
that you're coming?

1137
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,460
Where are you all going?

1138
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:02,210
Don't you know Krongpateep is sick?

1139
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,880
Oh, dear. I didn't know.

1140
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:06,670
The people on the farm
didn't tell us.

1141
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,670
They must be busy.

1142
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:10,880
Is he okay?

1143
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,500
He's better now.

1144
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:15,960
Artit called last night and told us
that he's been discharged.

1145
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:21,130
We can't visit them today because of
a meeting at the association.

1146
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:24,050
Should I visit on your behalf?

1147
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,170
I have some business
to talk to Artit anyway.

1148
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,380
And what business is that?

1149
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,960
Private business.

1150
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,800
Then thank you in advance.

1151
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,590
No worries, Mom.

1152
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,800
- Okay.
- Here it is.

1153
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,840
You shouldn't have told them, Artit.

1154
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,590
They had to come
all the way from Bangkok.

1155
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:49,670
It's not an effort at all.

1156
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,840
We'd like to come anyway.

1157
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,750
Anyway,
thanks everyone for visiting.

1158
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,550
By the way,

1159
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,210
who's the driver?

1160
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,340
Come on, manly guys like us.

1161
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,920
You were sleeping the whole way.

1162
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,170
Come on.

1163
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,420
We agreed that Ling would drive
us here and you will drive us back.

1164
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,710
Wow.

1165
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,340
You're teasing Ling again.

1166
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,710
How are you doing? Are you tired?

1167
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,000
Not at all.

1168
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:20,340
Krongprateep.

1169
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,420
My parents said that you have to

1170
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,000
take these supplements

1171
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,880
so you can recover.

1172
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:28,800
You don't have to thank us.

1173
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,840
Our two families are very close.

1174
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,300
- Okay.
- Thanks so much.

1175
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:38,460
Please thank Chat and Lada for me.

1176
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:39,630
Of course.

1177
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:44,420
By the way, do you have
a place to stay?

1178
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,300
Oh, well.

1179
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,500
We're staying at my resort.

1180
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:50,710
I see.

1181
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,300
Then stay for lunch.

1182
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:57,210
Sure. Artit's been bragging a lot.
I have to taste your cooking.

1183
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,800
- That's right.
- You're quick when it's food.

1184
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,750
Well, you're going to tease me?

1185
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,300
Hold on. But it's still
a while until noon.

1186
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:06,960
Should we go on a stroll, Ling?

1187
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:09,090
Okay. Let's go.

1188
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:14,000
There are a lot of us.
Why did you only ask Ling?

1189
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,960
Well then.

1190
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:20,710
I'll ask you too.
Nang, come with us.

1191
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,250
It doesn't sound like you want us
to come at first.

1192
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,800
Why would you point that out?

1193
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,380
We'll be back for lunch, Ms. Tubtim.

1194
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:31,300
- Artit.
- Your farm's got nice weather.

1195
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,880
- Right.
- Aritit,

1196
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,170
- should we go take pictures?
- What do you grow here?

1197
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,090
Mainly grapes and some vegetables.

1198
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:40,840
- What do you want to see?
- The ladies.

1199
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,300
You are unbelievable.

1200
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,550
- I'd like to see...
- What do you want to see, Ling?

1201
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,920
- I'd like some grapes.
- That way then.

1202
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:50,800
- Awesome. Let's go.
- Come on. It's that way.

1203
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:52,670
Ling? Ling?

1204
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,340
Oh?

1205
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,130
I'm so sorry.

1206
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,840
I didn't mean it.

1207
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:00,670
That's not true!

1208
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,300
You meant it. I saw it.

1209
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:04,800
It's not true.

1210
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,710
I didn't mean it. Artit, Non.

1211
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,960
I didn't look carefully.

1212
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:10,500
I saw that you were looking at her.

1213
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:12,590
- Are you blind?
- Paeng,

1214
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:14,170
not right now.

1215
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:16,750
it's okay. It's just an accident.

1216
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:20,210
Hold on. How come you're here?

1217
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,250
Artit, I'm about to go home.

1218
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:26,130
I'll see you off.

1219
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,420
Wait here. I'll be back.

1220
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,420
Come on.

1221
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,750
Non! I'm going to go home now!
I'm sick of it!

1222
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,960
Oh?

1223
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,420
Should I see you off?

1224
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,420
Look at her.

1225
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,630
Your friends are so nice.

1226
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:50,300
They came to visit
when they know Krongprateep is sick.

1227
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,340
You see how great having friends is?

1228
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,710
Again. I wasn't talking
about myself.

1229
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,340
Well.

1230
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,800
Ling, the pretty one,

1231
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:06,670
is she your girlfriend?

1232
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,500
Ling?

1233
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,500
She's a friend.

1234
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:13,670
What about Nang?

1235
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,050
Nang?

1236
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,630
She's Non's sister.

1237
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,000
What are you thinking?

1238
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,340
Nothing. Just wondering.

1239
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,710
I see you're close.

1240
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:27,340
People who are close
don't have to be a couple.

1241
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,130
What if

1242
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,880
someone doesn't think
the way you do?

1243
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:34,210
What are you going to do?

1244
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:35,710
What's up with you?

1245
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,590
Precocious kid.

1246
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,130
- Artit!
- What?

1247
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,840
You're bullying me again!

1248
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:45,550
- Can't I do that?
- You're messing up my hair!

1249
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:47,340
Artit! Artit!

1250
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:50,130
Artit! My hair!

1251
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:51,300
Artit!

1252
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:20,960
Up in the mountains.

1253
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,750
Think of what you're waking
up to in the morning.

1254
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,090
Scoot over.

1255
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:25,300
Move.

1256
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,460
You just got here and
you're telling me to scoot over?

1257
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:30,710
Hey, I thought you said
you don't want to go to jail.

1258
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:32,630
What?

1259
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:34,960
That's right. How come Paeng's here?

1260
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:37,300
Who is she?

1261
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,090
She's Artit's girl, Ling.

1262
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:43,710
She's a sister.

1263
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:45,670
Probably his girlfriend.

1264
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,550
- He's very cunning.
- Ling,

1265
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,300
don't believe these two.
They're mistaken.

1266
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,170
Why are you making excuses to me?

1267
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:53,960
I haven't said anything.

1268
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,800
That's right.

1269
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:00,000
If you're thinking of
having a girlfriend,

1270
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,500
then I have to get over it.

1271
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:07,670
Oh?

1272
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,210
What if I'm going
to have a girlfriend?

1273
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:14,210
What are you going to do?

1274
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,960
I'm going to

1275
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:21,050
be happy that you have a girlfriend.

1276
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:24,210
So different.

1277
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:26,750
Hey, Ling. What you said just now.

1278
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:28,210
You're leading Artit on.

1279
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,840
That's true.

1280
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,050
If he's going to have a girlfriend,

1281
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:37,670
he'd have to spend some time
looking after her.

1282
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,960
I have to get over it.

1283
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,590
What are you thinking?
Such nonsense.

1284
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,880
Oh?

1285
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:51,920
You two are so fixated on her.

1286
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,750
You started it.

1287
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,920
Come here!

1288
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,300
Hey! Hey!

1289
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,710
What are you doing?

1290
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,210
I said don't get up.

1291
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,590
Take that!

1292
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:06,460
What?

1293
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,800
Was the trip fun, Miss Paeng?

1294
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,130
You've returned later than I have.

1295
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:21,710
Who are you?

1296
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:27,750
Again.

1297
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,460
You're in trouble.

1298
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:32,300
Go and make up with her.

1299
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:33,710
Okay.

1300
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:37,420
I'll go and find out if it works.

1301
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,210
- She's really sulky.
- Really.

1302
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:51,840
Paeng,

1303
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,210
we haven't seen each other for days.
Don't you miss me at all?

1304
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,550
It's you who doesn't miss me.

1305
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,590
Whoa, she recognizes her mom now.

1306
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,460
I'm sorry for going out
without telling you.

1307
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:08,750
Although,

1308
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,840
I've got you a souvenir.

1309
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,500
Here.

1310
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,590
I saw it and the first person
I think of was you.

1311
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,800
They're matching bracelets.

1312
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,130
One for me and one for you.

1313
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,550
I bought it just for you.

1314
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:29,670
No, I don't want it.

1315
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,460
Come on. Try it on.

1316
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,630
Help me.

1317
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,210
Come on, Paeng.

1318
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,340
Stop sulking and make up with her.

1319
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,840
If she's upset again,

1320
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,050
she might go out. I don't know
how to help anymore.

1321
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,210
No!

1322
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:49,920
If she goes out again,
I won't forgive her.

1323
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:55,250
Okay. I'll put it on for you.

1324
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,000
Here.

1325
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,250
Don't ever take it off.

1326
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:22,300
All right.

1327
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:27,130
How long did it take
for her to stop sulking?

1328
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:28,550
No, I'm still upset.

1329
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,800
Let's eat out today.

1330
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,500
Please? Please?

1331
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,340
Well.

1332
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:37,960
Can it be some other day?

1333
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:40,460
Jaem's already prepared the food.

1334
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:41,960
Besides,

1335
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:45,710
Dad's been driving long distances.
He's probably tired.

1336
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:50,960
Tomorrow, then.

1337
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:52,800
Please? Promise?

1338
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:54,710
Okay.

1339
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:04,630
Oh, this is so lovely.

1340
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,960
Mother and daughter have reconciled.

1341
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,210
I have an important job today.
Let's postpone the dinner.

1342
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:32,800
I love you.

1343
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:47,550
Hello, Wang. Where's Mom?

1344
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,590
She drove herself?

1345
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,000
What hotel is it?

1346
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,750
Mom! Why did you do this?

1347
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,130
You have to go home now!

1348
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:34,960
- What's wrong with you?
- What was that?

1349
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:37,920
I'm sorry.

1350
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,840
Is that your daughter, Ms. Pim?

1351
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:54,300
Mom! Mom!

1352
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:55,750
Mom!

1353
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:57,460
Ms. Pimnapa.

1354
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,960
Paeng! Turn around and get out now.

1355
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,130
I won't if you don't go home.

1356
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,420
Don't do this to me.

1357
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,300
Then come home with me.

1358
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,090
You're going to defy me?

1359
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:29,960
Who broke the promise first?

1360
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,420
Come here now.

1361
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:44,380
Have you gone crazy?

1362
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,340
I came to bring you home.

1363
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:48,500
For what?

1364
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:51,050
I told you we can't eat
together another day.

1365
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:53,840
You're not making any sense.
You're behaving worse every day.

1366
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,340
Do you know you're embarrassing me?

1367
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,300
Oh, now you're silent.

1368
01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:59,960
Why aren't you cocky like earlier?

1369
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,250
- Are you very angry with me?
- Yes!

1370
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,840
Do you know what people
are saying about you?

1371
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,250
You get involved
in fights every day.

1372
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,550
I don't know how to
answer people's questions anymore.

1373
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:15,210
Do you care about
your friends that much?

1374
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,420
I do!

1375
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,420
But you never care about me!

1376
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:20,550
You're afraid your friends
will think badly about you.

1377
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,500
But you never ask me
why I fight with my friends,

1378
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:25,250
why I fight with everyone.

1379
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,550
Don't turn this around.

1380
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,550
You're misbehaving.

1381
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,090
I'm disciplining you right now.

1382
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,500
And you never misbehave at all?

1383
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:34,800
You broke our promise.

1384
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,920
You neglect me and Dad.

1385
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:38,750
What are you doing?

1386
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,590
You don't love me anymore?

1387
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,300
Don't you yell at me!

1388
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:49,500
You really don't love me anymore!
You don't love me!

1389
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,920
Paeng!

1390
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,090
Paeng!

1391
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:06,550
Paeng!

1392
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:10,920
- Hello?
- Pim.

1393
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:13,920
She disappeared from the house.
Did she go to see you?

1394
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:16,130
She did. But we argued.

1395
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:18,550
And she ran away.

1396
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:19,750
What did you say?

1397
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,210
I'll look for her.

1398
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:22,920
Please call her.

1399
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:24,920
Okay, okay. All right.

1400
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:36,670
Finally, it's finished!

1401
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,550
This is our joint effort!

1402
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:40,800
- Come on. Let's go home.
- Shut up, Kot.

1403
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:44,250
You didn't even help.
You're just cheering on the side.

1404
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:46,340
If I did, then you're worried
I might break something.

1405
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,590
- What do you want from me?
- You keep insisting on going home.

1406
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:49,840
Oh, I can't go home?

1407
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,170
See, Ling?

1408
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,630
He said I didn't help.

1409
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,050
Should we pack up first?

1410
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:55,210
It's Tharathep.

1411
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:58,550
- Paeng's Dad?
- Yes.

1412
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:01,550
Yes?

1413
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:03,590
Paeng fought with
her mom and ran away.

1414
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:05,590
She won't answer my calls.

1415
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,460
Please help me find her, Artit.

1416
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,340
Artit.

1417
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:41,250
Paeng!

1418
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:42,920
Where are you?

1419
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:01,250
Paeng!

1420
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,920
Paeng!

1421
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,380
Artit.

1422
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,380
Paeng!

1423
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,050
Why did you leave
your bag like this?

1424
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,880
I was hungry so I went
to buy some snacks.

1425
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:29,750
I thought this spot is nice so
I put down my bag to reserve it.

1426
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,590
Put in on your shoulder now.

1427
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,920
Just a second.

1428
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,420
Hello.

1429
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:58,300
I found Paeng.

1430
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:01,800
Don't worry.

1431
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,920
I'll look after her.

1432
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:07,380
Okay. Goodbye.

1433
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:17,550
You're being naughty again.

1434
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:20,300
Do you know

1435
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:21,960
that other people are worried?

1436
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,340
Do you want to go home?

1437
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:28,960
I'll give you a lift.

1438
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,670
No, I'm not going home.

1439
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,210
Naughty as always.

1440
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:35,630
I had a fight with Mom.

1441
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,800
Mom yelled at me.

1442
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,210
She's never done that to me before
even though she's at fault.

1443
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,380
I...

1444
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:47,800
Okay, okay.

1445
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,210
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.

1446
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,170
Aren't you hungry? Eat up.

1447
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:24,340
You two have a lot in common.

1448
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,840
Ling, what do you think if a friend
changes his status

1449
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,380
into a boyfriend.

1450
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,550
I don't think it's good.
You might lose a friend.

1451
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:33,840
I know

1452
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,050
what's my happiness now.

1453
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:37,960
Come here!

1454
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,710
I won't accept this.
I'm not going to let this go!

1455
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,050
Little Miss!

1456
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:43,630
Probably she hasn't been
raised properly.

1457
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:45,750
Oh, dear!

1458
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,210
No matter what happens,
you have to be strong.

1459
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:50,340
Why do you say this all of a sudden?

1460
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,340
Paeng!
