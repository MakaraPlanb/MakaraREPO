1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,129
Here. I'll feed you.

3
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,960
- Aren't you a little too serious?
- Somethings you just can't let go.

4
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,590
Oh! Blood!

5
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,090
You've got such beautiful hair.

6
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,300
It would be a shame.

7
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,419
Gather her things

8
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,710
and dump them outside.

9
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,710
You're throwing out my stuff

10
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,250
so I'm throwing out yours too.

11
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,500
Stop that!

12
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,090
There could be trouble
if you do this.

13
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,840
So that Paeng can
finally get over him.

14
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,379
I'm not going to put up with this
any longer, Aueng.

15
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,300
Go wherever. Do whatever.

16
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:08,500
I don't care anymore!

17
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,960
We're engaged.
We're going to get married.

18
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,750
Don't mess around with Artit!

19
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,550
Are you really
going to get rid of her?

20
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,300
If it's possible
then I want to do it.

21
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,800
Are you thinking
of getting rid of me?

22
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,669
Excellent. How did you know
that I wanted to eat this?

23
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,590
You're so chatty with women.

24
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,960
But when it's me,

25
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,379
all you say is "Mm!" or "Urgh!"

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,090
Mm!

27
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,800
Saeb,

28
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,919
don't take so much.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,710
Or we might not have any left
for people behind you.

30
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,300
Really.

31
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,300
Are you going to be
able to eat all that?

32
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,669
Of course I am.

33
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
I'm starving!

34
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,300
Saeb, Master wants to see you.

35
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,210
Right now.

36
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,800
Go on.

37
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,209
This is mine. Nobody touch it!

38
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,920
Jerk! Look at him.

39
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,050
Who's going to eat your food?

40
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,670
Once your all full,
let's get back to work.

41
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,379
Ouch, Ouch!

42
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,459
My stomach hurts!

43
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,129
- Oh?
- Ouch!

44
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,670
What's wrong?

45
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,800
- Huh?
- Huh?

46
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,300
I can't hold it in anymore!

47
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,500
What's going on?

48
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:56,000
- Hey, hey?
- You need to go to the bathroom?

49
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,209
Hey?

50
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,629
What?

51
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,209
What's going on?

52
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,170
Oh, over here too!

53
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,129
Ouch!

54
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:09,420
- You too, Pong?
- I won't make it to the toilet.

55
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,000
I need to sit down.

56
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:25,250
What did the doctor say?

57
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,879
Food poisoning.

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,500
Luckily, most people are alright.

59
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:32,379
But some will need to get an IV.

60
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,879
How could this have happened?

61
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,709
You don't have to think hard.

62
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,500
It's because the food that Thongkhum
and Duang made was unhygienic.

63
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,589
It's not true, Madam.

64
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,920
Duang,

65
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,879
did you wash the vegetables
properly?

66
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,589
Of course. I washed them
as I always do.

67
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,920
See?

68
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,089
If it was clean, would people
have gotten sick?

69
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,800
It's an adult matter. Go back to
wherever you came from.

70
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm worried.

71
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,839
This time the workers have diarrhea,

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,129
but next time
it could be Tubtim.

73
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:07,879
- Oh?
- You've gone too far.

74
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,920
Thongkhum is always
careful when she cooks.

75
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:11,589
Don't make empty accusations.

76
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,920
That's right, Madam.

77
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:16,750
Who's making accusations?
The whole farm has diarrhea.

78
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,129
Does someone have to die first
before you'll admit to it?

79
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,379
Enough, Paeng.

80
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,629
I'll deal with this myself.

81
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,089
What will you do?

82
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,879
I think someone needs to be fired.

83
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,209
Go way.

84
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,709
It's none of your business.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,170
Are they going to be fired?

86
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,879
I'm so satisfied. They deserve it.

87
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,550
I don't think so.

88
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:51,050
They've worked here for a long time.
Master wouldn't be so harsh.

89
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:54,339
But all the workers have diarrhea.

90
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,670
At least, their salaries
should be deducted.

91
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,089
But it's strange.

92
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,879
They've worked in the kitchen
for 10 years or so.

93
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,250
How could they've made a mistake?

94
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,879
That's true. The whole farm getting
diarrhea isn't a common thing.

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And wouldn't those people know
if they've eaten something spoiled?

96
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,129
- Huh?
- That's true, Jaem.

97
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,800
If they've been poisoned
then that's a different story.

98
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:16,459
You're right.

99
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,339
What if?

100
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,959
I don't know.

101
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,420
But I feel so satisfied.

102
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,709
Really!

103
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,209
But that's true.

104
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,670
I won't let you fire them.

105
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,250
I don't believe they made a mistake.

106
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,920
Master! Master!

107
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,920
Excuse me,

108
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:44,050
I have something to tell you!

109
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,750
Don't cry.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,709
Don't cry, Thongkhum.

111
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,959
Sir wouldn't fire you. Believe me.

112
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,500
Why wouldn't he?

113
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,500
The workers ate our food

114
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,379
and they've all been hospitalized.

115
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,459
I don't know.

116
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,589
But Master is a fair person.

117
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,670
There must be a way out.

118
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,129
Stop crying or I'll cry too. Please?

119
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,750
Oh?

120
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,170
Where is the evidence, Saeb?

121
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:18,709
Over there.

122
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,050
- Lead us.
- What evidence?

123
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,589
What evidence?

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,300
It's a laxative.

125
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,670
How did it get here?

126
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,250
How did it get here?

127
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:33,340
Don't ask. Give it to me.

128
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,500
I know who did it.

129
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,210
You're here, you little brat.

130
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:53,669
You said if anyone causes trouble,

131
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,169
then they have to
leave the farm, right?

132
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,919
Here.

133
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,299
It's you who has to leave.

134
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,629
What are you talking about, Auntie?

135
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,629
Don't act all innocent.

136
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,549
Saeb, say it. Tell us what you saw.

137
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,419
Well...

138
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,340
Well...

139
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,840
- Well...
- Say it.

140
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,960
I saw Paeng doing
something in the kitchen.

141
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,590
You saw me going into the kitchen

142
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,379
but it doesn't mean that I did it.

143
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:56,549
See? Are you admitting
that you went in there?

144
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,000
Paeng,

145
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,590
what did you do in the kitchen?

146
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:11,210
I...

147
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:14,460
Just tell us what you did in there.

148
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,090
You're upset with Thongkhum and me.

149
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:19,500
Is that why you tried to frame us?

150
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:25,000
You're getting more and more
our of control each day.

151
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,840
I won't accept it this time.

152
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,250
I can't stand her behavior anymore.

153
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,379
What if someone actually died?
What are you going to do?

154
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,379
I think we should just
hand her over to the police.

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,500
They won't die.
It's just a laxative.

156
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:44,049
Oh? Are you admitting to it?

157
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:47,419
Saeb, take her to the police.

158
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,169
- Yes, Madam.
- Calm down.

159
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,669
Paeng,

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,840
please be honest with me.

161
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,460
Did you really do it?

162
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,379
- Paeng!
- Paeng!

163
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,549
What should I do? What should I do?

164
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,129
Artit, please help me.

165
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:31,919
You've reached the voicemail of...

166
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,549
Why are you so worried about her?

167
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,000
She'll come back.

168
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:36,799
It's already dark.

169
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,379
She's a little girl,
and it's raining.

170
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:42,250
Instead of worrying
about her wellbeing,

171
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,090
you should worry about what
she's going to do to other people.

172
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,799
Have some mercy on her.

173
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,629
If you can forgive her,
then please do.

174
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,919
Her story is more
than a child can take.

175
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,340
She's not the only
orphan in the world.

176
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,460
And other orphans aren't like her.

177
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,090
You don't know what I do.

178
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:05,629
Well...

179
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,460
Anyway, I'm begging you.

180
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,210
When pigs fly.

181
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,840
Master! Master!

182
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,250
- Master!
- What's the matter?

183
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,169
I've found Paeng!

184
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,549
- Oh?
- Uhh...

185
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,919
Please look after her, Aueng.

186
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,090
If there's anything, just call me.

187
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,549
Yes, Sir.

188
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,750
Paeng,

189
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,879
let's go take a shower and change.

190
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:44,549
Miss Paeng, would you
like some warm congee?

191
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:45,879
I'll make some for you.

192
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,500
- Oh?
- Oh?

193
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,250
Jaem!

194
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:54,799
Miss Paeng,

195
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:58,129
please get up and change first.
You might get sick.

196
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:01,129
Miss Paeng.

197
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,340
- Miss Paeng.
- Please get change.

198
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:07,299
It's okay.

199
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,250
Miss Paeng, please get up and
get change. You might get sick.

200
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:15,299
Miss Paeng!

201
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,049
- Oh, Miss Paeng!
- What should we do, Aueng?

202
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,710
What can we do?

203
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:34,750
Miss Paeng,

204
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,250
are you up?

205
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:37,460
Miss Paeng.

206
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,799
She's burning up!

207
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,340
Can you get up?

208
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,669
Let's go to the doctor.

209
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,169
I'm not going!

210
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,750
Then I'll find you some medication.

211
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,629
I'm not taking any.

212
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,629
Just let me die.

213
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,879
Miss Paeng!

214
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,169
Please help.

215
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,919
She won't listen to me.

216
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,299
Okay. I'll go check on her.

217
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:09,549
Don't go.

218
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:11,379
She might get cocky.

219
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,799
Tubtim,

220
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,669
she's sick.

221
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,629
Believe me.

222
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,669
She's only crying for attention.

223
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,710
If we give in, when is
she going to learn?

224
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,299
She'll cause more trouble.

225
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:27,379
So you're not going to let
me check up on her?

226
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,750
- No!
- Okay.

227
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:32,340
Oh? Krongprateep!

228
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,379
Krongprateep!
You're not listening to me!

229
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,629
Why did you ask me then?

230
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,879
You too.

231
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:47,629
Why did you come back?

232
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,210
She'll keep crying for attention.

233
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:54,299
I don't want Dad to be upset.

234
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,299
I heard Paeng's very sick.

235
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,549
She did this to herself.

236
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:00,549
Dad wants to take her to the doctor
but she won't go.

237
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,340
Look at how high-maintenance she is.

238
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,500
You're still complaining?

239
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,210
Thanks so much
for helping me, Artit.

240
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,750
Do you really want Artit to
bring Paeng to the doctor?

241
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,210
It's okay, Mom. I know a way.

242
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,960
Paeng,

243
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,750
Artit's back.

244
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:50,339
Go and see the doctor with him.

245
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,589
Artit?

246
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,210
Thanks so much
for coming with me, Nang.

247
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,920
My pleasure.

248
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:21,500
I told you I'm always happy to help.

249
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,049
I can do more than this too.

250
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,210
And what should we do next?

251
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,089
Where is Artit? Why isn't he here?

252
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,049
You can't do this.

253
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,170
I want to go home!
I don't want to be here!

254
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,880
You can't do this.

255
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,299
What now?

256
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:46,920
I want to go home.

257
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,799
How can you go home?

258
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,549
You've still got a fever.

259
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,500
Didn't you want to get sick?

260
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,710
Just stay at the hospital
and let the doctors treat you.

261
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,750
I don't want to be alone.
I'm scared.

262
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,630
You have to stay with me.

263
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,299
You're capable of feeling scared?

264
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,960
You always act so tough.

265
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,049
Stop being so silly.

266
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,880
I'm not being silly.

267
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,549
You have to stay here.

268
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,130
Because I don't want you
to die at the farm.

269
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,839
You've caused everyone
enough trouble already.

270
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,549
- Come on, Nang. Let's go.
- Okay.

271
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,500
Rest up. Hopefully, they can cure
your craziness.

272
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,589
I'm sorry that Artit prefers me

273
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,920
to you.

274
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,880
Just in time!

275
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:13,210
You dragged me all the way from
Bangkok just to listen to your rant?

276
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,920
That's right.

277
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,839
Why? Are you my friend?

278
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,549
Oh, Nang!

279
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,960
- Come back and sit here!
- No!

280
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,750
Enough, Artit.
You have to drive home.

281
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,380
Just one day.

282
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,380
I'm stressed.
I can't take it anymore.

283
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,420
Alcohol's not the solution.

284
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,710
Understand?

285
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,500
That's enough.

286
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,049
Non, why are you stopping him?

287
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,299
If he can't drive,
then you drive him home.

288
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,750
Why do you keep siding with him?

289
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,920
Are you my sister or not?

290
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:54,130
Hey.

291
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:57,710
Actually, I feel bad for Paeng.

292
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,960
- Huh?
- Why would you feel bad for her?

293
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,250
The person who you should
feel bad for is Artit.

294
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,380
Are you really his friend?
Why did you side with her?

295
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:11,630
You're only defending him.

296
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,500
Enough! Artit,

297
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,500
you and Paeng don't
have to get married yet.

298
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,630
Something might change.

299
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,250
I have to take your temperature.

300
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:36,549
Excuse me, another bottle.

301
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,920
No, that's enough.

302
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,380
Enough, Artit.

303
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,880
- Hey, I...
- That's enough.

304
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:44,839
You've had a lot already.

305
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,920
Right? And you were enabling him.

306
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,750
Excuse me, another bottle!

307
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,250
I said enough.

308
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,630
I'll drive you home

309
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,630
No, I can drive.

310
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:57,880
Can I have the bill, please?

311
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,799
- Hey, hold on.
- Hold on. I'll have another bot...

312
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,799
Help me! Help!

313
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,299
Grab him.

314
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,500
Watch your step.

315
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:09,130
Let's go.

316
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,299
I'll drop you off. Walk carefully.

317
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,210
Hold on. Have you paid yet?

318
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,670
- I'll deal with it.
- Can I bring another bottle home?

319
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,670
No, you can have more at my house.

320
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:23,500
I can't get a hold of Artit.

321
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,339
Paeng's also disappeared
from the hospital.

322
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,380
That's good. She can
disappear all she wants.

323
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,839
So our son can
finally live in peace.

324
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,920
Or he'll have to keep
cleaning up after her.

325
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,420
She's such a brat. She keeps
bringing us trouble.

326
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,460
Well, what should we do?

327
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,250
I'll go and look for them.

328
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:43,589
Why would you?

329
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,250
Are you going to find them yourself?

330
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,710
It's already late.

331
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,630
It's because it's already late
that I have to go.

332
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,170
I think those two might be together.

333
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,630
I don't want anything to happen.

334
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:55,420
I'll come with you.

335
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:57,799
It's okay, Aueng. Let the men do it.

336
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,750
Saeb, tell the workers to take
the cars out and find them.

337
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,960
Yes, sir.

338
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,299
I'm coming with you.

339
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,710
I'm worried about Artit.

340
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,920
- Then let's go.
- Okay.

341
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,920
Jaem, we should go
and look for them too.

342
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,210
Let's go. Hurry.

343
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,839
You always say you're okay
even when you're not.

344
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,549
I'll take off my shoes first.

345
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,089
Aren't you going to?

346
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,130
Steady, Artit.

347
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,380
Here. Stand up properly.

348
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,299
Here are your keys.

349
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,339
I think I should carry
you to your room.

350
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,420
It's okay.

351
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:32,630
- I can walk.
- Are you sure?

352
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,670
Yes. Later.

353
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,420
Watch your step.

354
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,799
Nang, Nang, come here.

355
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,960
Come here!

356
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,089
Get over here!

357
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,500
- Non!
- Where are you going?

358
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,299
To help Artit!

359
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,049
You saw him.
Will he be able to walk?

360
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,839
He's at home now.

361
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,589
Are you going to see
him off in his bedroom?

362
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,710
Can you step back a little?

363
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,299
It's getting a little too obvious.

364
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,710
Come here.

365
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,380
- Artit, Walk carefully!
- Sure!

366
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,960
- I'm going!
- Really!

367
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,880
Artit?

368
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,089
Artit?

369
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,420
Why are you so drunk?

370
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:22,630
Paeng?

371
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:25,630
How did you get in here?

372
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,500
Why did you drink?

373
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,710
It's not good being drunk like this.

374
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,880
Go back to your room.

375
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:38,210
I'm worried about you.

376
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,750
Did you pretend to be sick?

377
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,839
I wasn't pretending.

378
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:46,170
I don't believe you.

379
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:47,630
Get out now.

380
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,710
Do you really hate me this much?

381
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,670
Why? We used to be friends.

382
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,210
What did I do wrong...

383
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,750
Get away from me!

384
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,670
I'm not going. I love you!

385
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,839
Paeng!

386
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,170
Paeng! Get off me!

387
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,549
Here they come.

388
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,710
Have you found Miss Paeng yet?

389
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,089
Let me go!

390
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:31,130
Let go! Let go!

391
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,210
Decent women wouldn't
do something like this.

392
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,630
I love you!

393
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:36,839
But I hate you!

394
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:41,500
Have it your way.

395
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,710
Paeng!

396
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,549
Paeng! Get off!

397
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,089
Paeng! Hey!

398
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,710
Paeng!

399
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,799
Let me go!

400
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,299
You can't do this!

401
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,130
I have nothing to lose!
My parents are dead!

402
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,589
I don't need to care
about anyone anymore.

403
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,420
Paeng! Paeng! Stop!

404
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:10,920
Let me go!

405
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:12,839
Paeng! Paeng!

406
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,750
You're not going to let go?

407
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,460
Alright.

408
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,500
You deserved it.

409
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,710
Why do you have to
hate me this much?

410
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,960
What did I do wrong?

411
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:37,880
It's you. You're wrong.

412
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,549
Remember, Wanfahmai.

413
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,960
Even if you were the only person
left on earth,

414
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,250
I'd never take you as my wife!

415
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,839
I'd also like to know

416
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:00,750
if you'll be able to do that.

417
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,420
Paeng! Paeng!

418
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,880
These are Artit's shoes.

419
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,380
He's back.

420
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,420
Let me go!

421
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,460
What's that?

422
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,500
Paeng, let me go!

423
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,250
Paeng!

424
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,880
Okay, okay.

425
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,920
You really want me?

426
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,799
That's right.

427
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,339
Okay.

428
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:41,130
I surrender.

429
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,210
Artit! Artit!

430
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:52,130
Do you want to die?
That's why you're doing this?

431
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,839
Alright! Fight me!

432
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,460
I'd like to know how strong you are!

433
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:59,089
- Let me go!
- Fight!

434
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:00,549
Fight!

435
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,210
- Let me go!
- Alright, fight!

436
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,299
I want to see you fight!

437
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,670
You want to get hurt?

438
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:09,500
- Alright. I'll...
- Artit!

439
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:13,670
What are you doing to her?

440
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,380
Uncle, help me!

441
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,839
Mom, Dad.

442
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:24,549
I wasn't doing anything to her.

443
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:26,380
If you weren't,

444
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,500
then what were you doing?

445
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:32,920
Answer them.
Tell them what happened.

446
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,839
Get over here!

447
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,299
Have you been drinking?

448
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:47,380
Just a little.

449
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,500
But I'm aware of everything.

450
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,799
I didn't do anything to her.

451
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,420
It's not true. You're lying.

452
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,000
He tried to rape me.

453
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,210
What?

454
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:34,880
I never taught you
to take advantage of women.

455
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,250
I insist

456
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,049
that I didn't do anything.

457
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,750
You were caught in the act.

458
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,380
Do you still dare to deny it?

459
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,339
Are you saying she ripped her
own shirt and jumped onto the bed?

460
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,000
That's right.

461
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,710
Tubtim, you weren't there.

462
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,920
But I trust my son.

463
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,799
I raised him myself.
He knows right from wrong.

464
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,170
He wouldn't do something like this,

465
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:58,920
especially to this girl.

466
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,380
Dad, I always admit it
when I'm wrong.

467
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,380
I didn't do it. I won't admit to it.

468
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,380
I wasn't lying.

469
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:12,920
I saw that he was very drunk
so I went to check up on him.

470
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,710
But he...

471
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,460
I couldn't fight him off.

472
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,089
Liar!

473
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,920
Artit!

474
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,339
If you're not going
to speak the truth,

475
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,960
I'm going to kill you right now!

476
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,750
Why would she lie?

477
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,670
What women

478
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,460
would want something
like this to happen?

479
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,130
This woman, Dad!

480
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,250
She can do anything!

481
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,799
You still don't see her true colors?

482
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,299
I'd like to affirm it once more.

483
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,250
I didn't do anything to her.

484
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,839
Dad,

485
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,839
don't you trust me?

486
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,839
I trust what I saw.

487
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,299
But it's not what you thought.

488
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,839
Both of you are going
to get married anyway.

489
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,549
Therefore, you're going to
get married next month.

490
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,380
Dad,

491
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,339
I won't marry her.

492
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,880
Krongprateep, be fair to him.

493
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,630
You're hurting him.

494
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,670
But we need to do right by her too.

495
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,250
My decision

496
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:58,880
is final.

497
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,089
I won't marry her.

498
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,339
I won't marry her
even if I have to die!

499
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,880
Artit!

500
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,250
- Artit!
- Artit!

501
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,549
Artit!

502
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,750
- Artit!
- Artit!

503
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,670
- Artit, where are you going?
- Watch your step.

504
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,299
Where are you going?

505
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,670
It's all because of you.
That's why he ran away.

506
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,549
I tried my best.
You need to understand me sometimes.

507
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,960
Call me tomorrow.
I'm going to sleep.

508
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,920
Kot, hold on.

509
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,090
I said call me tomorrow.
I'm going to sleep.

510
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,050
I'm coming to see you.

511
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,500
Artit,

512
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,130
aren't you at the farm?

513
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,500
That's right.
I'm driving to your house.

514
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,130
Hold on.

515
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,050
How important is this?

516
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,590
It's very far to drive
from there to Bangkok.

517
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,500
Why do you sound like that?
Are you drunk?

518
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,840
Who are you coming with? Non?

519
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,800
No one. Just wait for me.

520
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,170
Later.

521
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,000
Artit!

522
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,920
Artit!

523
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,630
Artit, can you hear me?

524
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,590
Artit!

525
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,840
What's going on, Artit!?

526
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,170
Artit!

527
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,340
Answer me!

528
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,710
Confess right now

529
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,630
that you went into my son's room

530
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,750
and tried to seduce him.

531
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,880
Tubtim, everything is obvious.

532
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,090
What's obvious?

533
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,670
You said I wasn't there,
but what about you?

534
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,380
Don't push me past my limit.

535
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,670
If you're going to force him
to marry this girl,

536
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,380
then let's divorce.

537
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,710
Tubtim, we've talked about
this so many times.

538
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,250
How isn't she suitable for him?

539
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,800
She's from a good background.

540
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,840
Or is it you don't like the fact
that she doesn't have any parents?

541
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,250
I'm not one to judge
a book by its cover.

542
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,840
I've never cared about a family's
background or wealth.

543
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,210
I don't even care that
she's inherited billions of baht.

544
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,090
But what I can't accept
is her personality.

545
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,960
I don't want to see my son
living in hell.

546
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,300
Why are you judging me?

547
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,550
How am I judging you?
You can't do housework.

548
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,750
Your grades are bad.

549
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
You're not even
responsible for yourself.

550
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,300
You're rude.

551
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,090
You cause trouble every single day.

552
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,710
I can't even stand being
under the same roof.

553
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,090
Do you think you're the only one
who can't stand it?

554
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,550
I have to endure you too.

555
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,380
You can hate me as much as you want.

556
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,130
But you can't break your promise
to my dad!

557
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,550
- Miss Paeng, calm down.
- Paeng!

558
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,050
Don't forget

559
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,630
that everyone here owes him.

560
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,750
That's right. He's already dead.

561
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,340
So you think that you can
do whatever you want to me!

562
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,960
It's not like that, Paeng.

563
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,750
This is getting out of control.

564
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,090
Why isn't it like that?

565
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,300
If you break your promise,
then you're a vile person too.

566
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,920
- Paeng!
- Please don't, Miss Paeng!

567
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,800
Paeng, you can't talk like that.

568
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,750
Apologize to her.

569
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,090
Look at her.

570
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,250
Do we want someone like her
as a daughter-in-law?

571
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,880
Paeng,

572
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,840
apologize to her.

573
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,630
And go back to your room.

574
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,630
Master! Madam!

575
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,880
Mr. Artit's friend called.

576
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,550
What is it?

577
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,920
Mr. Artit was in a car accident.

578
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,210
Huh?

579
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,090
Artit!

580
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,130
Watch your step.

581
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,840
If anything happens to him,
it's because of you!

582
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,250
Let's go now.

583
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,460
Are you satisfied now?

584
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,800
You're such a little devil!

585
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,960
Miss Paeng.

586
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,840
Jaem, I didn't mean
for this to happen.

587
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,710
I didn't really mean it.

588
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,500
How is Artit doing?

589
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,300
He's still not out of the woods.

590
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,050
There are no

591
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,960
external injuries.

592
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,840
But internally, a lot of his
bones are broken.

593
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,340
A rib bone punctured his lung.

594
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,460
He has a concussion.

595
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,170
The doctor said we have to wait for
him to wake up and then we'll know.

596
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,960
If he wakes up, that is.

597
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,130
I'm sorry.

598
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,630
I'm wrong. It's my fault.

599
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,630
How can it be your fault?

600
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,960
When he's the one who drove away.

601
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,800
If he admitted to
his guilt that night,

602
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,960
it wouldn't have happened.

603
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,840
No, it's not his fault.

604
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,130
He didn't do anything to me.

605
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,750
I lied.

606
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,250
Thank you.

607
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,300
Thank you for admitting your fault.

608
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,800
Actually,

609
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,670
I believe that he'd never
do something like that.

610
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,090
I know my son well.

611
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,500
I'm so sorry.

612
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,420
I'm sorry.

613
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,340
We're all at fault here.

614
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,380
I am too.

615
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,750
Uncle,

616
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,670
can I go and see Artit?

617
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,380
I'm in the wrong. I'd like
to watch over him.

618
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,710
Please let me see him.

619
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,130
You shouldn't.

620
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,090
If you really want to help,

621
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,800
please stay away
from him for a while.

622
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,590
Do you understand why?

623
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,750
The doctor said

624
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,090
overall he's responding
well to the treatment.

625
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,880
But he's still unconscious.

626
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,840
He has to stay in the hospital
for a while.

627
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,130
If the doctor said he'll get better,

628
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,840
then that's good already.

629
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,090
Soon enough, he'll be better.

630
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,750
Please don't be worry.

631
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,840
Once he wakes up,

632
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,670
I'll make him some dessert.

633
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,960
Okay.

634
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,050
Artit,

635
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,750
wake up already.

636
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,800
You're so strong.

637
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,460
If you don't wake up,
I'm going to curse you.

638
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:32,670
Kot,

639
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,630
be considerate of his mother.

640
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,210
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

641
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,590
I already notified the university

642
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,090
that he's been in an accident
and won't be able to attend classes.

643
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,050
If it's really necessary,

644
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,460
we'll help with
the paperwork for the deferral.

645
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,460
Thank you.

646
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,590
Thank you very much, everyone.

647
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,380
You're in trouble because of him.

648
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,500
It's because of that girl.

649
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,500
That's why he ended up like this.

650
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,250
Please don't think too much.

651
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,250
And what about

652
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,840
Artit's Father?

653
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,800
He just went home.

654
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,380
He went to see Paeng.

655
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,380
Why is he so worried about her?

656
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,550
He's more worried about her
than his own son.

657
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,380
When are you going to leave?

658
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,550
Do you want me to prostrate
myself to you?

659
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,460
Look at her.
She still has no remorse.

660
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,590
Come on, Duang. Just let her be.

661
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:50,750
Uncle!

662
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,090
How is Artit doing?

663
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,300
Paeng,

664
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,210
I'd like to talk to you
about something.

665
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,420
Go and live in Bangkok.

666
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,670
I'll handle
the school transfer for you.

667
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,340
Go and study there.

668
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,800
I'm worried about Artit.

669
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,750
There's no need to worry
about anything here.

670
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,090
I'll do my best to
take care of everything.

671
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,300
And I'll take care of you

672
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,500
just as I promised your dad.

673
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:38,880
I will never leave you.

674
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,880
Please trust me.

675
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,670
You understand me, don't you?

676
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,300
I do.

677
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,250
Live there for a while.

678
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,920
And wait for things to get better.

679
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,960
Once Artit has recovered,

680
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,130
you can come back.

681
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,550
I promise

682
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,550
I'll visit you often.

683
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,050
I don't want anything else

684
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,500
apart from Artit being safe.

685
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:55,800
I just want him to be safe.

686
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,630
I just want him to be safe.

687
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,750
I just want him to be safe!

688
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,130
Artit?

689
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,460
Artit?

690
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,920
Nurse! Nurse!

691
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,840
- My son's awake.
- Let me check the monitor.

692
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,630
Mister, do you know where you are?

693
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,130
Can you speak?

694
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,300
Mister?

695
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,550
Are you alright?

696
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,130
Get out of here and never come back.

697
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,840
- Thongkhum.
- What?

698
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,880
I'm thinking of telling Madam

699
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,210
to host a huge merit-making ceremony
to get rid of the misfortunes here.

700
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,840
So that she can remove
all the unlucky things

701
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,090
and wash away all the filth.

702
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,340
Good.

703
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,250
Do it for three days and nights.

704
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,000
Let's go.

705
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,460
Uncle is waiting in the car.

706
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,130
Please take care of Artit, Saeb.

707
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,550
We don't do favors.

708
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,300
Why would you nod?

709
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,840
That hurts.

710
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,550
Miss Paeng.

711
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,710
Don't worry about us.

712
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,960
I'm going home.

713
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,380
And Aueng will find
work at home as well.

714
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:35,750
If you miss us,

715
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,960
feel lonely or
have no one to talk to,

716
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:42,250
you can call us anytime.

717
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,880
Okay.

718
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,710
I'll miss you both.

719
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,170
Paeng,

720
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,920
we have to go now. Or it'll be late.

721
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,960
I'm going now.

722
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,670
Okay.

723
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,170
Miss Paeng.

724
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,880
Live a better life, Miss Paeng.

725
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,880
Look after yourself.

726
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:31,050
We will never forget you!

727
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,880
Miss Paeng!

728
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,380
(Football field)

729
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,800
- Hey, hey!
- Non!

730
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,460
- Whoa!
- Non!

731
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,590
- Go!
- Come on, Non!

732
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,590
- Go, Non!
- Go!

733
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,500
- More, Non!
- Come on!

734
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:54,130
Shouldn't you be happier?
Come on! Be more cheerful.

735
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,710
That's it!

736
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:01,500
Can you take a photo for me?

737
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,880
Artit, Non's getting
even more skilled now.

738
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,500
Here! I'll show you the photo!

739
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,340
He's replacing you now.

740
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,420
He's very popular nowadays,

741
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,710
both in and out of the field.
Girls are clamoring for him.

742
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,420
Not just clamoring,
they're dying for him.

743
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,800
Here, look at this.
I've taken so many photos.

744
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,960
Have a look.

745
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,500
Huh?

746
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,710
This one took a while.

747
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,880
I'm telling you

748
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,750
I was really rooting for him.

749
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,170
In the last second,

750
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,170
just before time was up,

751
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,420
Non just got the ball
out of the blue.

752
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,710
he just ran and touched down.

753
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,000
Then time was up.
They won by a hair.

754
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,340
Besides, he was awarded

755
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:11,000
player of the match. Isn't he cool?

756
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,960
Why did you throw my phone?

757
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,590
My screen's all cracked.

758
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,340
What's wrong with you?

759
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,880
Are you angry

760
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:50,920
that Non and Ling didn't come?

761
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,170
Come on, Artit.

762
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,630
They're trying to finish up
their final projects.

763
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,420
Non also has rugby practice.

764
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:07,380
- Don't think too much.
- Why were you able to come?

765
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:15,090
Don't vent your frustrations
on others.

766
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:16,630
Get out, Kot.

767
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:20,750
Get out!

768
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,550
What's going on?

769
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,170
Kot, what's up with him?

770
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,960
He's crazy.

771
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,420
Not only is his body broken,

772
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,590
but his heart and brain are
broken as well.

773
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,050
I said get out.

774
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:37,800
Get out!

775
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,340
Get out!

776
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:55,670
Artit.

777
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,340
I'll go then.

778
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,170
I'll just leave this here.

779
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,840
I'm thinking of visiting him.

780
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,340
I'm coming with you.

781
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,420
Do you still dare to go?

782
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,380
He's angry with me
because of you two.

783
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,800
Huh? Are you going just
to have him kick you out?

784
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,420
It's actually because of you.

785
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,210
Oh? So I'm wrong?

786
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,750
Yes, didn't bother to ask us first.

787
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:50,960
You know how dedicated he is to
rugby. You rubbed it in his face.

788
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:55,710
How should I know? I just wanted
to let him know. How am I wrong?

789
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,460
You're wrong
because you don't understand him.

790
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,300
Artit is happy every time he gets
to play rugby.

791
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,300
It's what he hopes and dreams about.

792
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,380
But now,

793
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,130
he can't even walk.

794
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:12,750
So he's frustrated.
That's why he acted like that.

795
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,380
The thing he needs right now
now is our support.

796
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,670
I'm thinking that I'll stay
with him for a few days.

797
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,960
Let's do this.

798
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,800
I'll pick you up from your dorm.

799
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:29,590
I have to work. Can you pick me
up here instead?

800
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,380
Right. I'm the forgotten one.

801
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,960
You have to come with us.

802
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,300
I'm not going.
I'm still angry at him.

803
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,300
You look like you deserve a slap.

804
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,750
You deserved to be yelled
at by Artit.

805
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,840
You'll get it too.

806
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,460
Amen. I hope you get it even worse.

807
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,960
You'll get it yourself.

808
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:49,800
I'm not going.

809
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,590
How could he do this to me?
I'm his close friend.

810
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,170
Just a second.

811
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,630
Hello?

812
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,840
I'm busy right now.

813
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,920
I'll call you later.

814
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:16,800
Hey,

815
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,880
Ling and I know
who you're talking to.

816
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,630
You're talking to

817
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,880
a girl, aren't you?

818
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,750
Tell us. What faculty? Which year?
What does she look like?

819
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,670
Jerk. That wasn't a girl.

820
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,130
Here, eat up. So you can stop
being delusional.

821
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,250
No, I'm on a diet.
I might gain weight.

822
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,460
Artit, Non's getting
even more skilled now.

823
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,670
He's very popular nowadays,

824
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,090
Girls are clamoring for him.

825
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,590
Here, look at this.

826
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:25,460
He was awarded player of the match.

827
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,880
Isn't he cool?

828
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,960
Oh, aren't you getting in the car?

829
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,670
Aren't you going away for two
nights? Where's your luggage?

830
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:27,380
Oh, I forgot it at the shop.

831
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,590
Just a second.

832
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,750
Ling, I'll go get it for you.

833
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,920
Wait in the car.

834
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,920
Okay.

835
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,420
Whose is this?

836
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,710
Tattered like this?
It's definitely Ling's.

837
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,750
Ask her if you don't believe me.

838
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,960
Non wants to talk to you.

839
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,960
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

840
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:15,840
See? I knew it.
It's so tattered, it must be yours.

841
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:17,670
Hey!

842
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,000
Give it to me.

843
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,960
What is she doing?

844
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,460
Oh?

845
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:26,960
Is she going to just throw it away?

846
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,250
What?

847
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,670
I threw it but you
patched it up again?

848
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,500
What is it?

849
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,630
It was on sale,
so I bought it for you.

850
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,050
It's pretty cheap.

851
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,000
Do you like it?

852
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:12,250
I do.

853
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,880
Non, it's me.

854
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,460
I was waiting for you
to call me back yesterday.

855
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,210
I'm trouble, it's serious.

856
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:56,300
Otherwise, I wouldn't bother you.

857
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,960
Can you transfer me
about 30,000 baht?

858
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,000
Hello? Non?

859
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,340
Did you hear what I said?

860
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:06,420
Why didn't you answer me?

861
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:19,340
If you're not going to transfer it,

862
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,630
I'll go and ask Ling.

863
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:23,130
What's the matter, Ling?

864
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:26,050
Dad, it's me.

865
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,380
Ling?

866
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,960
You just...

867
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,630
Yes.

868
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,090
I was the one who answered.

869
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,880
I heard everything.

870
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:38,050
Listen to me.

871
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,250
Dad, I'll talk to you later.

872
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,550
I...

873
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:48,710
Ling!

874
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,920
Listen to me.

875
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,590
What else do I need to listen to?

876
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,750
When I've already heard everything

877
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:57,590
about you giving my Dad money.

878
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:00,090
How much has he asked from you?

879
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,050
Can you calm down and listen to me?

880
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:04,960
I know you're having money troubles.

881
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,670
I just wanted to help you.

882
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,340
This is not helping.

883
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:10,590
If you really want to help me,

884
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,380
you wouldn't do this.

885
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,710
But I mean well for you.

886
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:16,960
Other people

887
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:18,630
have no say

888
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:20,750
in my family's problems.

889
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,000
Other people?

890
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,000
How can you see me as that?

891
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:25,670
We're friends.

892
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:27,420
Friends have to help each other.

893
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,000
But not this way.

894
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,090
What you did

895
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:34,090
makes me pity myself.

896
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:35,840
Are you thinking too much?

897
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,630
Yes, I think too much.

898
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,250
It's the way I am.

899
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,380
You don't know me at all.

900
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,090
Ling!

901
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,800
(Dad)

902
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,960
Oh, Non? It's me.

903
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:12,670
Can you transfer me
about 30,000 baht?

904
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,500
Mom,

905
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,090
I'm coming to live with you.

906
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:33,210
Ling, do you have to be this angry?

907
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,840
I'm sorry. I know I'm wrong

908
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,960
for intruding into your life.

909
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:39,920
But I'd like to talk to you.

910
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,750
Can you give me a chance to explain?

911
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,000
Ling,

912
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,250
I'm sorry.

913
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:02,960
I know I'm the one who's at fault.

914
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:06,250
I'm sorry for
overstepping the bounds.

915
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:09,670
I admit that I didn't
think it through.

916
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,420
I'm sorry for making you feel bad.

917
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,840
Please forgive me.

918
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:59,340
I'm sorry that I haven't
visited you very much.

919
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,920
It's okay. I understand.

920
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,800
Did you come here alone?

921
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,090
Yes.

922
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,380
What about

923
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,460
the others?

924
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:20,800
I don't know.

925
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,380
What's the matter?

926
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:35,880
Why do you look worse
than the patients here?

927
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,460
I'm here to say goodbye.

928
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,960
I'm going to live with Mom.

929
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,960
Are you really going?

930
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,460
Are you going to leave me?

931
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,550
I have to go.

932
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,670
You're going with Non, aren't you?

933
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,550
I'm going by myself.

934
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:24,670
Non isn't involved.

935
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,840
Don't lie to me.

936
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:28,710
You don't want to be with me.

937
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,170
You love him, don't you?

938
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:35,920
I'm not leaving you.

939
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:38,710
Then tell me,

940
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,960
that you don't love Non.

941
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:45,750
Both you

942
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:47,840
and Non

943
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:50,960
are my friends.

944
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,300
Do you know

945
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,960
that you're bad at lying, Ling?

946
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,340
Am I that pathetic?

947
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,880
Is that why you
don't want to admit it?

948
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,050
Just go.

949
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,920
Because now I'm not even sure

950
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,750
if I still want to
be friends with you.

951
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:34,630
Oh?

952
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,420
I'll help you.

953
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:39,050
It's heavy. Come on.

954
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,500
Thanks for dropping me off.

955
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,130
It's okay.

956
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:52,710
I only have a few friends left.
So, I have to take care of them.

957
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,460
What's up with all of us?

958
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,750
After Non was promoted to captain,

959
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:00,300
he and Artit stopped talking.

960
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,920
Things will probably get better
if I go away.

961
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,050
How does it have
anything to do with you?

962
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:08,880
It has nothing to do with you.

963
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,710
Let's change the subject.

964
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:13,800
Aren't you going to call them
and say you're leaving today?

965
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,210
It's better this way.

966
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:19,920
Just a quick call?

967
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:24,210
Let's hurry or I'll be
late for the flight.

968
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,170
Are you sure?

969
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:27,670
Let's go.

970
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,380
You can change your mind.
You can still call in the car.

971
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:55,300
Not enough. Dance harder!

972
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:58,800
Louder! Louder! Like that!

973
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,250
Do you want to come?

974
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,670
- Alright.
- Let's go, then.

975
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:39,920
How are you doing?

976
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,630
Originally, the rose was discovered
by an anonymous person

977
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:09,420
4,000 years ago.

978
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:11,090
The characteristic of the rose is...

979
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,500
- There she is! Paeng!
- Paeng!

980
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,050
Pony! Khanoon!

981
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:10,210
- Hey! It's Ran!
- Hello, Paeng.

982
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:11,630
Wow!

983
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,170
Did you tell Ran to come?

984
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,420
You're pretty feisty
under that mug, sister.

985
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,090
Feisty my butt.

986
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,880
He just came. I didn't ask him to.

987
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:24,920
I'd like to congratulate you.

988
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:26,960
Do you want to start working now?

989
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:28,500
I have some places I can recommend.

990
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:30,750
It's okay.

991
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,550
I'd been studying for four years.

992
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:34,630
Let me make my degree
worth the tuition.

993
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,210
Anyway, thank you for your advice.

994
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,380
Hold on, Paeng. Come here.

995
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:41,710
Paeng,

996
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:45,500
as an expression of my sincerity
towards you for the past two years,

997
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,210
I'd like to tell everyone
right here that

998
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:50,380
I love you, Paeng.

999
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,840
Can you keep recording
the live video for me?

1000
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:00,500
Paeng, a bouquet for you.

1001
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:14,840
It's soaking wet!

1002
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,670
To the guys who are
watching this live video.

1003
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,420
If you want to confess
your love to someone,

1004
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,130
you should ask them first
whether they love you or not.

1005
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:28,380
Otherwise, you'll end up like this.

1006
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:31,050
- Fabulous, sister!
- Awesome!

1007
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:32,880
- Let's go.
- Ran!

1008
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:35,420
I'm still single!

1009
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,920
I'm still single as well!

1010
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,420
Come on. Hurry up.

1011
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:40,880
Bye-bye!

1012
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:45,920
Paeng,

1013
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,670
aren't you going to even
give him a chance?

1014
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,590
Everyone who has approached you
was all high-end!

1015
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,840
If I were her, I'd take all of them!

1016
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,170
- You're crazy!
- I'm not.

1017
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:59,250
A spinster like you is
probably all dried up.

1018
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:05,550
No, I'm happy being alone.
I don't want anyone.

1019
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:09,460
You don't want anyone because
there's someone in your heart?

1020
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,210
Are you crazy?
Who's going to be in my heart?

1021
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,800
I spend all of my time with a girl

1022
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,000
and a gay!

1023
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:18,750
Come on. Let's take some photos.

1024
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,590
Okay. Fab.

1025
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:14,460
Yes!

1026
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:20,880
Pokin the Princess!

1027
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,880
Khanoon the Blue Moon!

1028
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,250
Wanfahmai the Night Fairy!

1029
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:40,170
Don't take that from me!

1030
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:24,960
Whoa! Did we party
that hard last night?

1031
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:27,170
Khanoon?

1032
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,050
Pony?

1033
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:32,880
Where are they?

1034
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,840
I'm sorry for leaving early.

1035
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,130
If Daddy knows that
I hung out with you here,

1036
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,420
he'd beat the crap out of me.

1037
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,460
I'm sorry I had to go home.

1038
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,840
And who made this mess?

1039
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,500
I have to tidy it up?

1040
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:06,800
Oh, wow!

1041
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,710
Paeng is so good at cooking!

1042
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,300
Last time you made steak.
What are you going to make next?

1043
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,710
I'm thinking of trying
to make steamed buns.

1044
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:16,920
Should you open up a restaurant?

1045
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:19,170
Hold it right there, Aueng.

1046
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,750
I'm not that good.

1047
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,460
I'm so proud of you.

1048
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,170
It's been six years,

1049
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,750
you've gotten so skillful.

1050
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:29,960
You've gotten more beautiful too.

1051
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:34,340
I'm sorry for not being
at your graduation.

1052
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,550
I had to help my mom work
in the rice paddies.

1053
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,210
No worries at all. I understand.

1054
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:43,340
Have you talked to Jaem at all?

1055
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:45,750
I don't know how she's doing.

1056
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,920
She didn't reply to my texts.

1057
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,590
Jaem doesn't know how to text.

1058
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,300
She's probably happily raising
her grandkid.

1059
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:54,750
That's great!

1060
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:58,460
If you see her or talk to her,

1061
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:00,630
please tell her that I miss her.

1062
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,500
Definitely, Paeng.

1063
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,500
I miss you.

1064
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:06,130
Miss you too.

1065
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,590
Artit, can you pass me the ball?

1066
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:46,210
I'm sorry.

1067
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:08,500
I decided to let Artit get
engaged to Paeng

1068
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:09,880
not because of the debt.

1069
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,090
I don't love Paeng.

1070
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:14,170
I will never marry her.

1071
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:17,550
Artit! I love you!

1072
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:18,840
Paeng!

1073
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:22,750
Even if you were the only person
left on earth,

1074
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,170
I'd never take you as my wife!

1075
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,800
I have nothing to lose!
My parents are dead!

1076
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,380
I don't need to care
about anyone anymore.

1077
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,210
Artit!

1078
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,210
Don't you trust me, Dad?

1079
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,840
I trust what I saw.

1080
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,670
I couldn't fight him off.

1081
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:38,880
Liar!

1082
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:03,590
They're doing that on purpose.

1083
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,800
I haven't seen you in a long time.
You haven't changed.

1084
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,630
If you knew what I lost,

1085
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:10,670
you wouldn't have
said that stupid apology.

1086
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:13,590
Just atone for your sins.
You've done so much to him.

1087
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:15,300
Keep your filthy hands away!

1088
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:21,050
Your place is here. Eat up.

1089
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,800
I locked her up. I'm thinking of
leaving her for a couple of days

1090
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,210
and letting her starve.

1091
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,550
What if she actually dies?
What are you going to do?

1092
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:29,840
You're never

1093
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,710
going to forgive me?

1094
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,340
If you were me, would you be able to
put up with being like this?

1095
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:36,420
Both my dreams and my future
are ruined.

1096
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:38,960
Everything I'd accomplished was
ruined because of you!
