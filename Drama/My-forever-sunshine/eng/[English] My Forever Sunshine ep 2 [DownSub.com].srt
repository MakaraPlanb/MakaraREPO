1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,210
Songtham fooled him.

3
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,460
He's going to take our farm.

4
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,710
Go back and tell your boss.

5
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,879
That we will pay off the debt

6
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,129
Anyone, help!

7
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,710
Did Mr. Tharathep pay off our debt?

8
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,169
Why is he so nice to us?

9
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,129
Friends are there to listen to
your secrets and feelings,

10
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,750
both ups and downs.

11
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,550
I'll be your first friend.

12
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,169
It's that way.

13
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,050
- Ling!
- I'm so sorry.

14
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,419
I didn't mean it.

15
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,460
You meant it. I saw it.

16
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,550
If you're thinking of
having a girlfriend,

17
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,210
then I have to get over it.

18
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:10,710
Mom!

19
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:12,460
Ms. Pimnapa!

20
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,629
You neglect me and Dad.

21
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,960
Don't you yell at me!

22
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,500
You really don't love me anymore!
You don't love me!

23
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,669
Paeng!

24
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,500
Can I have a round of applause?

25
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,500
Us meeting every day

26
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,460
Is it coincidental

27
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:38,419
Or are we destined by heaven

28
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,500
To always have each other

29
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,879
Oh, Paeng.

30
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:43,710
Why are you so quiet?

31
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,710
I thought you said
you don't want to go home.

32
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,419
What's up with you?

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,629
Oh? Didn't you say you want to let
off some steam?

34
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,090
Paeng, do you want to sing?

35
00:03:58,169 --> 00:03:59,629
I read an academic paper.

36
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,050
Singing helps
with negative emotions.

37
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:05,169
It makes you 248.75% happier.

38
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,000
Which academic paper?
That number seems to be made-up.

39
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,500
You haven't read it. Who am I?
I'm Korakot.

40
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,050
I'll pick the song for you.

41
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,089
I feel good being with you

42
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,589
Even if it's only you who makes
me feel this way

43
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,500
Paeng.

44
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:33,920
Don't lose to us. Let's compete.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,459
How about this? You sing one song.

46
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,500
I'll pick the song for you.

47
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,379
Stop hesitating.

48
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,300
- I've got the song.
- Come on. Only one song.

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,879
There you go.

50
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,709
Just a little bit.

51
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,839
Here she comes.

52
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,209
Young and handsome

53
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,920
That's me
I'm so good-looking

54
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,709
Yesterday I rode to Pak Kret

55
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,709
Yesterday I rode to Pak Kret

56
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,550
The girls noticed me
They asked if I'm Nadech

57
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,300
Young and handsome

58
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:11,959
That's me
I'm so good-looking

59
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:15,250
Yesterday I rode to Bang Bon

60
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:17,800
Yesterday I rode to Bang Bon

61
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,709
Pretty girls asked me
if I'm Boy Pakorn

62
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:33,300
Good thing we only booked
the room for that long

63
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,050
or we'll probably end up
singing all night.

64
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,709
Actually, you're crazier
than I thought, Paeng.

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,550
Let's sing together
again next time. It's fun.

66
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,209
You all just go ahead.

67
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,250
- I'm giving her a lift home.
- Before you go,

68
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,629
can I borrow your phone, Paeng?

69
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,750
Is yours out of battery?

70
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,250
No, I'm going to add your contact.
I might try to hit on you later.

71
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,959
Whoa. No, I consider her my sister.

72
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,089
If you want to hit on someone,
try Non's sister.

73
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,589
Not my sister either.

74
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,589
Nang? She's too feisty.

75
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,089
Stop arguing.

76
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,339
Let's go home.

77
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,170
I have to go.
Take care of Ling for me too.

78
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,879
Sure. I'll take good care of her.

79
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,839
All right. Let's sing
"I Will Always Love You."

80
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,800
- Why?
- Because it's from "The Bodyguard!"

81
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,750
- Gotcha!
- You're crazy.

82
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,589
See you later, Paeng.

83
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,800
- What's so funny?
- Come on. Let's go.

84
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,089
Please, this way.

85
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,550
How was it? Do you feel better now?

86
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,209
Much better.

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,459
Thank you, Artit.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,089
Next time,

89
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,459
you have to be calmer.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,050
You've grown up now.
You're not a little kid anymore.

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,550
What's this? I said I feel better
and now I'm being scolded.

92
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,800
I'm not scolding you.

93
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:54,589
I think you're too hot-tempered

94
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,339
and you're very clingy
with your mom.

95
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,300
I'm worried about her.

96
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,550
I know

97
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,379
that you love her very much.

98
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,839
But one day you have to grow up

99
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:15,300
and stand on your own legs.

100
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,209
I can't live without Mom and Dad.

101
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,629
You know I don't have anyone else.

102
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,589
Are you that much of a loner?

103
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:31,250
Don't you have any friends?

104
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,550
I've just made one recently.

105
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:37,800
It's you.

106
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,420
Do you know I really envy you?

107
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,629
Your friends are so nice.

108
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,250
Try to be more open.

109
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:50,839
It's not that difficult

110
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,879
to approach other people first.

111
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:55,089
We have to start somewhere.

112
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,500
If you can do it,

113
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,709
it's your own gain.

114
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,420
- What?
- I'm returning this.

115
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,050
Thank you.

116
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,049
I'm sorry, Mom.

117
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,340
I was really worried about you.

118
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,379
Don't do this again.

119
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:50,750
I was wrong too

120
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,299
for being emotional like that.

121
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,750
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:56,710
Please forgive me.

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,129
Thank you so much, Artit.

124
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,960
Artit,

125
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,960
be proud. You're the first and only
person who can deal with her.

126
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:26,750
Really?

127
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,629
That's why I have
to bother you often.

128
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,299
It's a bit of a trouble.

129
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,340
Not at all.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,840
What I do can't even compare to
how you helped my dad.

131
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,500
You know about it?

132
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,629
If there's anything I can help you,
I'm happy to do it.

133
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:55,710
Thank you very much,

134
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:57,629
- Artit.
- You're welcome.

135
00:09:58,169 --> 00:09:59,250
Okay.

136
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:01,840
- I'm going now.
- Thank you.

137
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,879
Try to be more open.

138
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,299
It's not that difficult
to approach other people first.

139
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:37,840
We have to start somewhere.

140
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,169
If you can do it,

141
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,419
it's your gain.

142
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,210
Let's try again one more time.

143
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,090
Are you smiling at me?

144
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,799
What's your name?
What class are you from?

145
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,549
What are you doing, Boy?

146
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,750
Are you seducing my boyfriend?

147
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,590
Don't.

148
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:56,250
Don't just walk away.

149
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:57,750
We have to settle this.

150
00:11:58,169 --> 00:11:59,299
You're mistaken.

151
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,379
You were just smiling at him.

152
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,549
Come here.

153
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:09,710
Stop.

154
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,919
Hey!

155
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,340
Stop right now!

156
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,049
What's going on?

157
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,340
What should I do
with you, Wanfahmai?

158
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:21,340
Why are you in a fight every day?

159
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,049
She started it.

160
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:24,250
That's not true.

161
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,919
And I'm more injured too.

162
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,799
You're from the same school.

163
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,629
I'm going to call your parents.

164
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,129
Hello. I'm Wanfahmai's parent.

165
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,379
Dad, I'm sorry.

166
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,750
But how did you know

167
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,710
that I was in a fight today?

168
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,919
Paeng, I didn't come over
because of that.

169
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:04,090
Mom and I have
something to deal with.

170
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,960
You have to live somewhere else
for a while.

171
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:08,299
What's all this about?
Why can't I stay at home?

172
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:10,840
Let the adults deal with it.
You won't understand.

173
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,629
I've packed your clothes.
Let's go now.

174
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,000
Now, Dad? What happened?

175
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,919
Where am I going to live?

176
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:25,500
Have a seat.

177
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,090
Please take care of her,
Krongprateep.

178
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,750
I have to bother you now,
Ms. Tubtim.

179
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,379
Don't worry about it.

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,419
What's going on?

181
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,879
Is there anything else
I can help with?

182
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,419
No need.

183
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,250
I have to deal with this myself.

184
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,049
Dad,

185
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,250
do I have to stay here long?

186
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:11,549
When are you going to
come to pick me up?

187
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,419
Paeng,

188
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,299
it won't be long.

189
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:21,879
You won't be staying here long.

190
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:26,460
I'll hurry and solve
all of my problems.

191
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,840
And I'll pick you up.

192
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,669
Don't worry.

193
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,799
I'll look after her the best I can.

194
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,919
Thank you so much,

195
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:40,750
Krongprateep.

196
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,750
I have something to talk to you.

197
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,590
Drive safely, Dad.

198
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,049
Paeng,

199
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:56,549
behave while you're living here.
Okay?

200
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,710
I love you so much.

201
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,840
You know that, right?

202
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,500
I want you to be happy.

203
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:11,710
Remember that.

204
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,750
No matter what happens,

205
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:15,879
you have to be strong

206
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,419
and deal with
whatever comes your way.

207
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,590
Why are you saying this to me?

208
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,210
It's probably because

209
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,919
you got in a fight today.

210
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:36,669
It's nothing.

211
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:38,669
I'm just worried about you.

212
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,169
I'm worried about you too.

213
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:45,000
Why are you acting so strange today?

214
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,169
I have to go now.

215
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,250
Don't worry.

216
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,419
I'm going now, okay?

217
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,049
Wait, Dad.

218
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,840
Can I hug you?

219
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:34,840
I love you, Dad.

220
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:40,919
I love you too, Paeng.

221
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,919
Be a good girl, okay?

222
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,299
Okay?

223
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,589
Ouch, my back.

224
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,460
Oh?

225
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,960
Do you think this is a hotel?

226
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,500
What are you complaining about?

227
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,049
It's a Master's friend.

228
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,960
He dropped off his daughter here.
Who knows how long she'll be here.

229
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,380
Who? Which friend?

230
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,839
That friend who visited last week.

231
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,380
The one with the daughter
I don't like.

232
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,089
That explains the complaint.

233
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,960
Let me tell you something.

234
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,049
Master hasn't even said a word.

235
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,380
You're a maid. Just shut your mouth.

236
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,589
If someone heard it and told him,

237
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,960
you might get reprimanded.

238
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,380
If someone's going to hear it,
it's because you tell them.

239
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,210
I was just complaining.

240
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,750
You don't understand me.

241
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,170
You don't understand me at all.

242
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,880
Duang!

243
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,750
How are you, Paeng?
Did you sleep well?

244
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:16,339
Yes. I'm sorry for sleeping in.

245
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,920
It's okay. It's good you can sleep
in an unfamiliar place.

246
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,880
Are you hungry?

247
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,089
Oh, dear. Duang.

248
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,880
She hasn't eaten yet.

249
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,839
Sorry.

250
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,589
Go get something from the kitchen.
There's still congee left, right?

251
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,839
I don't feel like congee.
Do you have any sandwiches?

252
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,049
We don't have that.

253
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:41,339
I didn't know what you want to eat
so I didn't prepare anything.

254
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,380
Just have congee for today, okay?

255
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:45,630
Okay.

256
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:47,670
Go and get it.

257
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,049
Yes, ma'am.

258
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,880
Eat up.

259
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:29,500
- What's the matter?
- Mom,

260
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,420
I don't want to be here.
Can I come home?

261
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,380
What did you say?

262
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,000
What's up between you and Dad?

263
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,049
Why do I have to stay here?

264
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:40,799
Are you going to be away long?

265
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,250
I can live with Aueng and Jaem.

266
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:45,839
Hold on, Paeng. Slowly.

267
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:48,210
I didn't know anything about this.

268
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,799
Where are you?

269
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,589
Dad said you have some business to
deal together with you.

270
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,670
Aren't you with him?

271
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,339
Well.

272
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,380
Let's talk later. I'm busy.

273
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,420
It's not an object. But it's...

274
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,130
This is...

275
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,500
Kot, what are you doing?

276
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:33,960
Nothing.

277
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,049
What's this?

278
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,380
Ling's tutoring us.
What are you doing?

279
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,210
- Let me see.
- What?

280
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,380
- I was just...
- Give it to me.

281
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,089
- Hey, Ling?
- Everyone's studying hard.

282
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,880
But you're busy flirting with girls.

283
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,420
I was just taking a break.

284
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,089
Can't you do it after the exam?

285
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:53,460
- Who are you? My parents?
- Give it to me.

286
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,339
Turn it off.

287
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,089
Off? All right.

288
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,460
For us to be even, you all have to
turn yours off too.

289
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,880
I'll turn it off too.

290
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:03,420
All right.

291
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,920
Turn them all off.
And put them there.

292
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,750
There.

293
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,299
Do you know how to?

294
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:11,630
I do.

295
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,960
The number you have
reached is not available.

296
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,960
Artit's phone is also turned off.

297
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:23,839
I can't contact anyone.

298
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:25,500
What are you doing, Dad?

299
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,549
Whoa, whoa.

300
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,589
Miss Paeng's calling.

301
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,089
- Yes, Miss Paeng?
- Aueng!

302
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,630
I'm so relieved. I thought
no one's going to talk to me.

303
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,170
I'll talk to you.

304
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,420
What's the matter?

305
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,250
Do you know
where mom and dad are going?

306
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,960
I don't know. I'm not at home.

307
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:58,049
- Oh? I'll call Jaem then.
- Oh!

308
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,799
No need. Jaem's with me now.

309
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,549
Give it to me. What's going on?

310
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,420
What's the matter, Miss Paeng?

311
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,000
Where are you and Aueng going?
Why aren't you home?

312
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,339
Master told us to take leave.

313
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:14,420
He said you're going to a camp.
So, he let Aueng and I

314
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,089
take leave and return home
for two weeks.

315
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,880
Did Dad say that?

316
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,960
Why?

317
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:26,630
Oh?

318
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:30,210
- Jaem!
- She hung up.

319
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,500
Krongprateep,

320
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,920
I have a bad feeling
for some reason.

321
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,460
About what?

322
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,210
It's Mr. Tharathep.

323
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,170
I think he seemed different.

324
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,589
He was acting strange.

325
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,299
I think so too.

326
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:50,000
Tharathep loves Paeng very much.

327
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,750
But he left her in our care
all of a sudden.

328
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,549
Didn't he tell you what's going on?

329
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,299
He didn't.

330
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,049
You were talking to him
in your office for quite a while.

331
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,670
Well,

332
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,299
he only said that he's got
an important business.

333
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,920
Tubtim, listen to me.

334
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,710
We owe Tharathep a lot for the farm.

335
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,130
If there's anything
we can do for him,

336
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,589
then we should do it.

337
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,210
Just consider it a repayment to him.

338
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,000
I know.

339
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:25,960
But it's really strange this time.

340
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,250
I don't know if it's just me.

341
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,630
Master, Madam! Where are you?

342
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,250
Oh, you're here.

343
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,670
What's going on?

344
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,960
We have a problem.

345
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,839
Miss Paeng disappeared.

346
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,130
- What?
- She disappeared.

347
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,630
Oh? Here's her bag.

348
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,960
Her clothes are all here.

349
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,960
Did you search everywhere?

350
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,089
- Well.
- Is there a misunderstanding?

351
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,420
She might be out for a stroll.

352
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,049
But I found this.

353
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,049
(I'm going home to see Mom and Dad
Paeng)

354
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,000
What's going on today?
No one is answering my calls.

355
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,880
- What about Artit?
- Master!

356
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,380
Have you found her?

357
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:56,000
I looked everywhere.
I don't see her at all.

358
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,880
She's probably returned to Bangkok.

359
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,089
How could she? She's still young.

360
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,630
How could she do that alone?

361
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,670
Oh, dear.
If something bad's happened,

362
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,549
how are we going to tell Tharathep?

363
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,670
What are you doing? You're all here.

364
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,920
It's his friend's daughter.
We don't know where she is.

365
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,089
Have you seen her?

366
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,630
- Miss Paeng?
- Right.

367
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,960
Oh?

368
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:22,089
This must hers.

369
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,839
- Where did you find it?
- It's in the back of my truck.

370
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,250
This really is Paeng's.

371
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,710
Oh, dear.

372
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:33,549
What was she unhappy about?
Why did she go back to Bangkok?

373
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,670
I promised Tharathep
to take care of her well.

374
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:38,170
I'm going after her.

375
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,339
Huh?

376
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,210
Why did this have to happen?

377
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,880
I feel like I'm going to faint.

378
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,339
- Ms. Tubtim.
- Easy, ma'am.

379
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:12,130
Dad? Mom?

380
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,880
Dad?

381
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,960
Dad!

382
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:38,710
Mom!

383
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,960
Dad.

384
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,250
Dad.

385
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,960
Dad!

386
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,420
Dad!

387
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:48,000
Dad, why did you do this?

388
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,880
Dad!

389
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,799
Dad, wake up!

390
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,710
Dad!

391
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,000
Dad, wake up!

392
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,170
Dad!

393
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:04,880
Don't leave me!

394
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,250
How can I live without you!

395
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:10,210
Dad, stay with me!

396
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,380
Dad! Dad!

397
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,210
Dad, don't leave me!

398
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:26,170
Dad!

399
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,880
Dad, don't leave me!

400
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,670
Dad!

401
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,210
Dad!

402
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,920
Don't leave me!

403
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,880
Paeng!

404
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,880
I found Paeng.

405
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,339
But something's happened.

406
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,250
Huh?

407
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:04,589
Mr. Tharathep and Ms. Pimnapa?

408
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,630
Are you sure?

409
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:08,960
Both of them are dead.

410
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:12,130
Oh, dear.

411
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,380
What about Paeng?

412
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,420
How is she?

413
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,960
She's in very bad shape.

414
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:21,710
I'll tell you once I got back.

415
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:24,299
Let me deal with things here first.

416
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:26,420
Okay.

417
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,630
What's your relation
to Miss Wanfahmai?

418
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,299
I'm her dad's friend.

419
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,049
Thank you.

420
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,589
Miss? Miss?

421
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,920
What's wrong? Miss?

422
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,750
Paeng! Paeng!

423
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,750
Paeng! Paeng!

424
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,960
What's wrong? Paeng! Paeng!

425
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,500
Calm down.

426
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,710
Paeng, calm down. Paeng!

427
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,130
We haven't found the main cause.

428
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,339
She might have an untreated

429
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,589
neurological problem.

430
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,049
And there might be something

431
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,299
like continuous physical or
mental stress that stimulated it.

432
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,880
We have to keep an eye on her
before giving a diagnosis.

433
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,049
Fire!

434
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,799
Fire!

435
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,049
I'm tired enough already.

436
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,880
You yelled fire
and I had to run off.

437
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,339
Why did you trick me?

438
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,460
I want you to wake up
and be conscious.

439
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:55,839
I asked you to study together.

440
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,460
Don't be lazy.

441
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:59,380
Have you seen the time?

442
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,750
We've been studying
since the afternoon.

443
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,210
What time is it now?

444
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:04,460
I'm tired. Do you understand?
Why do we have to study so much?

445
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,170
- I'm sleepy. I'm going home now.
- Wait.

446
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:08,130
You sit down now.

447
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,799
If you don't,
I'm going to tell Cherry

448
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,089
that you're a womanizer.

449
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,460
- You're using that against me?
- That's right.

450
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:17,299
If you expose me, I'll expose you.

451
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,670
- What about?
- That day at Ekkamai,

452
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,670
- at the middle of the table...
- Enough! Enough!

453
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,799
Let's take a break.

454
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:29,299
Ever since I've known you,
you're the cutest today.

455
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,839
- Hey.
- What? What?

456
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,250
What are you doing?

457
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,799
Really.

458
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,500
- I'll give you 15 minutes.
- Okay.

459
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,920
- We can turn on our phones now?
- I got so many calls!

460
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,920
I'm going to the bathroom.

461
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,799
Whoa.

462
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,839
Yes, Dad.

463
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,630
Where are you? Why did you
turn off your phone?

464
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,210
I was in a study group with friends.

465
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:02,670
So, we switched off all our phones.

466
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,839
This late?

467
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,339
The final exams are getting closer.
So, we have to study hard.

468
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,000
There were so many calls
from you and Paeng.

469
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,710
What's the matter?

470
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,920
Nothing.

471
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,500
Paeng visited the farm

472
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,170
and she wanted to talk to you
so she asked me to call you.

473
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:23,960
Right.

474
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,960
She must have gone home, right?

475
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,049
She did.

476
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,420
Keep studying. That's all for now.

477
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,839
Okay. Talk to you later, Dad.

478
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,549
Will she get better?

479
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,089
She can.

480
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,589
Have you heard about PTSD?

481
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:01,250
Some patients who were
extremely traumatized

482
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,299
will be constantly
plagued by anxiety

483
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,960
as if the incident
is happening repeatedly.

484
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,630
They'll get better
depending on many factors.

485
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,380
The patient themselves
and external stimulants.

486
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,550
The time it takes
depends on the individual.

487
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,630
We have to keep monitoring her.

488
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,670
Paeng,

489
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,630
why are you standing here?

490
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,460
I had a nightmare.

491
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,300
I dreamed that my parents died.

492
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,590
I was so shocked

493
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,250
I couldn't breathe.

494
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,920
So, I came out for some air.

495
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,050
And how come

496
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,090
I'm at the hospital?

497
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,420
Listen to me carefully.

498
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,710
That wasn't a dream.

499
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,750
Both your parents have passed away.

500
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,750
You're lying.

501
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,050
I don't believe you.

502
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,420
My parents didn't die.

503
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,960
Paeng.

504
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,630
I wasn't lying.

505
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,550
How can I live without my parents?

506
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,090
Of course you can.

507
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,460
You still have me, Tubtim and Artit.

508
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,920
Remember that.

509
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,300
You're not alone.

510
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,300
Remember that.

511
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,000
Oh?

512
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,250
Paeng.

513
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,170
How are you?

514
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,340
Are you tired of the journey?

515
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,340
A little.

516
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,670
I've prepared a room.

517
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,050
I'll take you there.

518
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,420
This way.

519
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,460
Krongprateep.

520
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,130
How is Paeng doing?

521
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,170
She said she's exhausted.
So, she went to bed.

522
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,300
Does Artit know about this?

523
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,380
I haven't told him.

524
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,670
He's got exams right now

525
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,130
so I don't want him to be stressed.

526
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,670
Let's look after Paeng
together for now.

527
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,050
Okay.

528
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,840
I was wondering

529
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,920
if she has any relatives at all.

530
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,210
Is that why she has
to come live with us?

531
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,840
That's right. She has no relatives.

532
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,670
Before what happened to Tharathep,

533
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,960
he told me to help take care of her.

534
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,670
Do you remember the day he took her
here all of a sudden?

535
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,340
I do.

536
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,630
Whoo!

537
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,880
Exams are over.

538
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,050
- Yay!
- Whoo!

539
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,920
Move over.
I'm going to take pictures.

540
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,630
Here. Some sunscreen.

541
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,090
Are you having fun watching her?

542
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,590
- Ling!
- What's up with you?

543
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,170
I have something to tell you.

544
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,130
What? What?

545
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,800
Ouch!

546
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,670
- You're killing me!
- It's okay, Ling.

547
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,170
Guys play like this.

548
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,420
There! There! There!

549
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,460
It's so breezy!

550
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,920
What plans do have for the break?

551
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,170
I'm thinking of going home.
I haven't done so for months.

552
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,590
You're such a mommy's boy.

553
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,800
What about you, Non?

554
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,380
I'm going home too.

555
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,420
You two

556
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,550
have a lot in common.

557
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,710
Artit,

558
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,590
what do you want to
do after graduation?

559
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,130
I want to be
a national rugby player.

560
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,000
You will be.

561
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,880
I'll probably work in Bangkok.

562
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,300
But my parents

563
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,340
want me to take over the business.

564
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,960
As for me,

565
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,840
I want to do anything
that makes a lot of money.

566
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,670
I'm going to use the money

567
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,420
to buy a condo,

568
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,210
a sports car

569
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,500
and eat nice things.

570
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,880
When I go shopping,
I'll buy anything I want.

571
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,460
- How much do I have to earn?
- Kot,

572
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,090
get a job first.

573
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,920
What a killjoy.

574
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,500
Just give me some encouragement.

575
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,880
What about you, Ling?
What do you want to do?

576
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,210
I'm thinking of getting ready.

577
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,840
Ready for what?

578
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,710
It's too soon to tell.

579
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,000
What is this?
Why are you being secretive?

580
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,840
Just tell us already.

581
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,420
I thinking of doing
a Master's degree.

582
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,090
I looking for a university.

583
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,590
You're so hard-working.

584
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,130
I thinking of doing a Master's too.

585
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,420
Have you decided on where to go?

586
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
So we can be at the same place.

587
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,800
I'm thinking of somewhere
that's close to Mom.

588
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,840
England?

589
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,500
I think there are
a lot of good universities here too.

590
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,250
Mom's worried
that I live here alone.

591
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,920
A foreign country seems nice too.

592
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,750
I might get
to marry a Caucasian guy.

593
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,050
My children will be good-looking.

594
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,500
Ha-ha!

595
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,590
That's not funny.

596
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,050
Hey!

597
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,960
Of course it's funny.

598
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,750
It's a Caucasian guy. Do you know
why their eyes are so big?

599
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,000
- Why?
- Why?

600
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,380
Do you see
how they greet each other?

601
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,500
It's like "hello!"

602
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,630
Their eyes are so big and lopsided.

603
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,880
How long are you two
going to hide it?

604
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,590
Hide what?
What are you talking about?

605
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,130
You like Ling.

606
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,880
You like Ling too.

607
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,170
I know our group's rule
is no hitting on friends.

608
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,460
But since things have come this far,

609
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,050
you have to accept it.

610
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,630
Just tell Ling that you like her.

611
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,170
If she rejects either of you,

612
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,880
then that one has to accept it
and move on.

613
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,340
You heard her.

614
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,460
She'd like a foreign boyfriend.

615
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,800
She's probably

616
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,170
not interested in any of us.

617
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,670
If you already know,
then just get over her. Enough.

618
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,710
Don't drag it out. Understand?

619
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,670
Don't say it if you can't do it.

620
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,050
Oh? You're not going
to say anything?

621
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,670
I'm so irritated with you two.

622
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,880
If you let this feeling
overwhelm you,

623
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:28,000
in the end
you won't be able to control it.

624
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,000
And the person who suffers the most

625
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,340
will be you.

626
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,920
What would you do if you were us?

627
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,250
If it's me?

628
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,380
I'll tell her how I feel.

629
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,500
I'll tell her I like her.

630
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,420
If she rejects me,

631
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,920
I'll be happy that I've told her.

632
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,050
We're going to graduate
in a few years.

633
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,500
We'll have to go our separate ways.

634
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,380
Just hurry up and say it.

635
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,170
Time is short.

636
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,300
Aueng and Jaem are home!

637
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,630
Aueng and Jaem are home!

638
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,750
Hold on.

639
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,880
I think you should stop shouting.

640
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,840
It seems that no one's home.

641
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,800
It looks like
the house is abandoned.

642
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,130
Oh?

643
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,170
It does look like
the house is abandoned.

644
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,210
What happened, Aueng?

645
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,050
What about Miss Paeng? Where is she?

646
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,460
Where is she?

647
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,880
Paeng,

648
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,460
have some congee. It's still warm.

649
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,460
I'm not hungry.

650
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:05,340
But if you don't eat anything,
you'll fall ill.

651
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,960
That's good.

652
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,130
So I'll die and I can be
with my parents.

653
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,840
But I don't think

654
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,840
your parents would want that.

655
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,960
They'd want you

656
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,840
to grow up happily.

657
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,960
Happiness?

658
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,750
My happiness was gone
the day they died.

659
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,340
I'll put the bowl right here.

660
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,340
Just eat a little bit.

661
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,090
Please don't make me worry, okay?

662
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,800
What?

663
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,210
Look at her!

664
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,880
She dumped all
the congee Madam made.

665
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,800
Why are you so loud?

666
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,130
She might hear you.

667
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,300
Who cares? I don't.

668
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,590
I understand it's hard
to get over your parents' death.

669
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,300
But she doesn't have to act up and
make people worry about her.

670
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,170
- Do you understand?
- I do.

671
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,380
She's having problems.

672
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,050
Just leave her alone.

673
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,960
I feel bad for Madam. She has to go
through troubles because of her.

674
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,460
She probably hasn't had
enough time to process it.

675
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,250
Have some sympathy for her.

676
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,840
She's just a kid.
She won't cause us any problems.

677
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,340
Wait and see.

678
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,250
Someday she'll show her true colors.

679
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,210
She wouldn't eat as always.

680
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,090
I don't think we can keep this up.

681
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,250
If we let this continue,

682
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,500
- I'm afraid she might...
- I understand.

683
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,170
I'm trying to find
a way to help her.

684
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,590
But I don't know what to do.

685
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,960
Hello?

686
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,840
Are you Mr. Krongprateep?

687
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:38,920
It's Aueng. I used to work for
Mr. Tharathep.

688
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,460
Paeng,

689
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:49,340
someone's here to see you.

690
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,130
- Little Miss!
- Little Miss!

691
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,130
Aueng! Jaem!

692
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,300
Little Miss!

693
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,550
I've missed you.

694
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,750
How are you?

695
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,460
I'm really sorry.

696
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,460
I just learned
about Master and Madam.

697
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,550
It's okay. I understand.

698
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,750
But it's really strange.

699
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,840
Before he passed,
he told you and me to go home.

700
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,050
After that, they both died
in a car crash.

701
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,920
A car crash?

702
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,210
By the way,

703
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,800
are you hungry?
We'll cook something for you.

704
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,340
No. No.

705
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,090
- You're so skinny.
- That's too much.

706
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,420
It's true.

707
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,880
Her arms and mine

708
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,500
are like chicken legs and pig legs.

709
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:13,130
You're smiling now. I'm so happy.

710
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,800
I'm so happy

711
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,590
that you both are here.

712
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,880
There, there. Don't cry now.

713
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,000
There is much less stuff
compared to Miss Paeng's house.

714
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,460
That's true.

715
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,250
And here there's only...

716
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,670
Hey! Who are you two?

717
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:49,050
What's this? Are you stealing?

718
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,960
I'm not stealing.

719
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,920
I'm just looking for something
to cook for Little Miss.

720
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:55,800
Little Miss?

721
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:57,550
Miss Paeng.

722
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,300
Isn't she a burden enough?

723
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,420
Now she's bringing her people too?

724
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,630
Aueng, don't.

725
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,550
We're just guests here.

726
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,840
You know you're just guests.

727
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,840
Then don't touch things
as if you own them.

728
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,710
How much are all of these?
I'll pay you.

729
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,380
I don't want money.

730
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,630
Then what do you want?

731
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,460
I want you both out of here.

732
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,500
I'm not going to stand
that mouth of yours anymore.

733
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,420
- There!
- Aueng!

734
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,130
You ugly toad!

735
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,750
- Duang! Don't!
- You're the ugly one!

736
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,130
Today I'm going to
cut your tongue out!

737
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:36,090
What is this? What's going on?

738
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,170
Good. You're here. Stop them.

739
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,750
Calm down! Stop!

740
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,460
You toad!

741
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,460
Master! Master!

742
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,710
Master!

743
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,090
- What's the matter, Saeb?
- We have a problem.

744
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,000
Hey, why are you standing there?
Stop the girl!

745
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,840
- And why didn't you?
- Can't you see that I can't?

746
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,090
If you can't, how can I?
You want it?

747
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,840
- You want it?
- This way, Master.

748
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,960
Stop! I said stop!

749
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,550
She started it, sir.

750
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,170
You started it. I was going to
cook for Miss Paeng.

751
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,750
But this is my kitchen.

752
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,630
I don't anyone to touch my stuff.
It'll get messed up.

753
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,920
If this is your kitchen,

754
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,630
then I can't come in?

755
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,380
I didn't mean that.

756
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,380
Keep this in mind.

757
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,090
This kitchen doesn't
belong to anyone.

758
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,750
Also remember that from now on,

759
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,460
Jaem and Aueng will be living here.

760
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,550
So they can take care of Paeng.

761
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:56,880
Do you understand?

762
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,500
Yes, sir.

763
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,380
Here's some shrimp fried rice.

764
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,670
Aueng, what happened to your face?

765
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,500
Oh. She was clumsy.

766
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:17,960
She fell and hit her face.

767
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,050
That's right. I was clumsy.

768
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,340
It's nothing.

769
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,090
Aueng, don't lie to me.

770
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,460
This is a handprint
Who did this to you?

771
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,750
No one!

772
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,840
It's obviously a handprint.
Was it the maids here?

773
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,250
It's just nonsense.

774
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:37,170
I won't accept this.
I'm not going to let this go!

775
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:40,590
- Little Miss!
- Please don't!

776
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,460
Just forget it, Little Miss!

777
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:45,090
I know they don't like me.

778
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,880
But they have no right
to hurt my people.

779
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,050
Please don't go. I'm begging you.

780
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,750
We're just guests.

781
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,670
Well, I...

782
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,340
I didn't mean that.

783
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,880
It's okay. I understand.

784
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,340
Thank you for reminding me.

785
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,380
I forgot that we don't
have a home anymore.

786
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,710
Can you help me?

787
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,670
I just moved to Thailand.

788
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,210
And I really need help.

789
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,340
I can't find my classroom.

790
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,920
Can you help me?

791
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:56,880
Hey! Do you hear me?

792
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,670
Or you don't
understand what I'm saying?

793
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,590
Oh! I'm glad we're taking
the same class.

794
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,300
Oh,

795
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,960
really?

796
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,420
You understand me.

797
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,210
Yes, of course.

798
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,630
Okay. Come with me.

799
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,550
Ling.

800
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,840
Should we go on a stroll?

801
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,960
Hey.

802
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,960
What are you doing here?

803
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:09,550
Ling asked me to come on a stroll.

804
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,300
Did she ask you too?

805
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,880
She didn't.

806
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,550
I asked her.

807
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,460
Kot's disappeared.

808
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,590
He's probably busy with some girls.

809
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,750
I was going to ask him on a stroll.

810
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,050
Did you ask everyone on a stroll?

811
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,130
It's fun when there's
a lot of people.

812
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,500
Come on.

813
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,090
Ling,

814
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,380
have you ever thought
of having a boyfriend?

815
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,590
I don't know.
I haven't thought about it.

816
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,380
Ling, what do you think

817
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:04,750
if a friend changes his status

818
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,880
into a boyfriend.

819
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,630
Hey. I don't think it's good.

820
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:12,800
You might lose a friend.

821
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,750
It might not turn out
that way for everyone.

822
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,960
It's not fair for an opportunity
to be taken away.

823
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,460
But I think it's good as it is now.

824
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,550
What do you think, Ling?

825
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,130
Do you agree?

826
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:50,800
What you said is true.

827
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,090
If you become a couple,

828
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,130
you might lose a friend

829
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,300
when you break up.

830
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,340
- What were you saying?
- What about you?

831
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:40,750
Ling.

832
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,170
RIght. You're right.

833
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:21,300
Ling, what do you think
if a friend changes his status

834
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,840
into a boyfriend.

835
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,710
Hey. I don't think it's good.

836
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,880
You might lose a friend.

837
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,590
Hello, Professor.

838
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,710
Chiratchaya, tell Thanon that

839
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,130
he can't just focus only on rugby.
He might not graduate.

840
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,920
He hasn't resubmitted the work
he's supposed to redo.

841
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:04,920
This is his final year.

842
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,130
Okay, Professor.

843
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,300
Thongkhum and I aren't
going to complain

844
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,210
if they're going to use the kitchen.

845
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,960
But we'd like them to be neat.

846
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,130
Thongkhum is very old

847
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:27,920
and she has to clean up after them.

848
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,670
You're telling me this.

849
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:31,710
What do you want me to do?

850
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,710
I'd like you to

851
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,380
tell Miss Paeng's people

852
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,000
that they have to tell us first
before they come in to do anything

853
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:40,960
so there'll be no problem.

854
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,250
Actually, who's the one
who got problems?

855
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,460
My people didn't start the fight.

856
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,340
But it's your people who did.

857
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,960
That's not true.

858
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:52,800
Aueng slapped me first.

859
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,090
If it wasn't because of your mouth,
Aueng wouldn't have done that.

860
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,090
Paeng! Why did you say that?

861
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,420
I'm always like this.

862
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,170
You just didn't know it.

863
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,090
I know that's what you're like.

864
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:10,750
But you have to be considerate.
Duang is older than you.

865
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,250
So what? Do I have to bow to her?

866
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,960
Wanfahmai! You've gone too far.

867
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,460
Who taught you to
be this ill-mannered?

868
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,000
Probably no one

869
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,550
- because her parents are dead!
- Right.

870
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,380
Oh, dear!

871
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,750
Stop, Wanfamai!

872
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,170
I'm standing right here!
Be considerate!

873
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:43,880
- Are you okay, Duang?
- I got it right in the face.

874
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,590
Paeng slapped Duang?

875
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:47,750
Isn't that a surprise?

876
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,590
I didn't expect her
to be this ill-behaved.

877
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:55,460
But I don't think she's going to
do anything without reasons.

878
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:57,670
That's right.

879
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,050
Duang said something
she doesn't like.

880
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,420
See?

881
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,710
But isn't it too far to
do it in front of me?

882
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:06,920
Whoo!

883
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:10,460
Mom, Dad, I'm home!

884
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:14,300
Oh,

885
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,000
aren't you glad?

886
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,840
I'm back.

887
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,210
Oh, we're glad.

888
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,550
Of course we are.

889
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,000
What now?

890
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,590
Artit.

891
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,300
What are you so angry about?

892
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,880
Paeng.

893
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:02,800
Hold on, Paeng.

894
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,300
Paeng!

895
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,170
You're going to
scold me, aren't you?

896
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,340
You're always like this.

897
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,960
I haven't said anything but
you're already acting out.

898
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,670
I just want to ask you something.

899
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,920
Are you ready to talk?

900
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,130
First of all, I just found out

901
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,670
about what happened to your family.

902
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,960
It's okay.

903
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,710
Your dad told me you had
to study for exams.

904
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,000
How are you doing now?

905
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:01,710
I'm sorry

906
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,460
for not being by your side
when it happened.

907
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,300
I'm really sorry.

908
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,670
Well,

909
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,550
is there anything else
you'd like to tell me?

910
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,500
I asked Paeng about yesterday.

911
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,250
They're both in the wrong. But

912
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:39,590
our people started it first.

913
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,300
As I expected,

914
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,000
Paeng's not someone
who starts fights first.

915
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,420
Fine.

916
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:51,000
How can you be sure
that she wasn't lying?

917
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:53,460
Well,

918
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,710
as long as I know her,

919
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,920
she's very direct.
She can't hide her emotions at all.

920
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:00,130
She can't lie.

921
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:04,210
If you insist,
then I have to believe you.

922
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,300
But for today,
she's completely at fault.

923
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,550
She knows that.

924
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,250
That's why she wants
to apologize to you.

925
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:20,630
Paeng.

926
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,210
I'm really sorry.

927
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:41,300
I'm sorry for saying things and
behaving badly in front of you.

928
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:50,420
Forgive her.

929
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:52,750
She's already apologizing.

930
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:59,800
Fine.

931
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:01,750
I forgive you.

932
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,090
Since this is

933
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,000
your first time misbehaving.

934
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:08,130
Thank you.

935
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:22,250
Non!

936
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:24,750
You're glad that I'm back?

937
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,380
If you're back,

938
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,210
then that means Artit is back too,
right?

939
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:33,380
You only think about guys.

940
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,840
I'm so sad.

941
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,960
Don't be sad.

942
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:42,460
Or you'll go bald and no one
will want to marry you.

943
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,880
You're going to be a spinster
because of yourself.

944
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,630
I'm not going to be a spinster.
Are you crazy?

945
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,630
What about Mom and Dad?

946
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,050
Dad's not here.
Mom's not here either.

947
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,420
Anyway, stay home for me.

948
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:00,170
Hey, hey! Where are you going?

949
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,750
I'm going to see Artit.

950
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:04,420
Hey! Stop!

951
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:07,050
- Let me go!
- You little...

952
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,750
- Let me go!
- SIt down.

953
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,670
You're embarrassing me
running after guys like this.

954
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:18,050
Is she really in such bad shape?

955
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:21,840
She still needs
to see a psychiatrist.

956
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,800
She wouldn't eat either.

957
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,960
What should we do, Dad?

958
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,090
I try to find something
for her to do,

959
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:36,250
like books and movies.
But she doesn't want to do anything.

960
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,380
We're here.

961
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:03,300
Let's go.

962
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,590
Here.

963
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,750
What's this?

964
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:24,840
I brought you to dig some dirt.

965
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:30,380
Look at your face.

966
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:33,500
I forgot. Little Miss probably
doesn't know how.

967
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,170
I'm going to plant some new seeds.

968
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:42,550
But you don't have to help me.
I can do it myself.

969
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,170
What are you planting?

970
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,550
If you want to know,
you have to help me.

971
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,920
Do it like this.

972
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:03,800
Stab it like this.

973
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,340
Pull it up.

974
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,840
Mr. Artit!

975
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:14,170
Saeb's here to help! Move away, sir.

976
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,750
Come on, Mr. Artit.

977
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,920
Leave the digging to me.

978
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,960
- Saeb.
- I'm working.

979
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:24,590
Just tell me whatever you need, sir.

980
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,300
I guess you want to get fired.

981
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,500
What did I do wrong?

982
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:33,130
I was working.

983
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,460
Who ordered you to?

984
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,670
It might be bad timing.

985
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:41,170
Correct.

986
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:46,710
I guess you just want
to be alone together?

987
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,460
If Saeb knows,
the whole world knows.

988
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,000
Saeb!

989
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,420
Come on. Are you ready?

990
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:43,750
Paeng,

991
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,500
that's enough for now.
Go and sit over there.

992
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:49,710
Sit over there.

993
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,590
What are you doing?

994
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,340
Your hair's all messy.
I'll tie it up again.

995
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,550
Your hair's quite thick.

996
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,130
Turn around.

997
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:25,300
Okay.

998
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,420
Better.

999
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:31,420
Here's your reward.

1000
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,050
What is it?

1001
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,300
We're going to plant the seeds.

1002
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:40,590
In a few months,
they'll all blossom beautifully.

1003
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,800
What flower is this?

1004
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,590
You have to wait and see.

1005
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,250
It will take a long time.

1006
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,000
It's not that long.

1007
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,670
We have to take care
of them every day.

1008
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,050
If you have to do that,
can you handle it?

1009
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:02,050
That's all? Can we plant them now?

1010
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,210
Hold on.

1011
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,630
We have to keep
digging up the dirt first.

1012
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:07,210
But are you hungry now?

1013
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:11,750
I'm hungry too.

1014
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,500
Pong, I was just helping.

1015
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,960
If it's you, are you going
to shoo me away?

1016
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:18,800
- I won't.
- See?

1017
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,170
Something's going on.

1018
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:23,380
A guy wants to be alone with a girl.
What does that mean?

1019
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,340
We all know it.

1020
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,880
You have such a big mouth.

1021
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,170
No one's going to call you a mute
if you don't say anything.

1022
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,800
Little Miss is only a child.

1023
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:37,300
If you talk too much,
it's bad for Mr. Artit's image.

1024
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,300
You call her a child?

1025
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,880
See? Look at Jook.

1026
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,880
She got married at 16, got pregnant
at 17 and gave birth at 18.

1027
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,420
- It's not the same.
- I'm sure!

1028
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:52,050
- Sure of what?
- I'm sure that they'll be together.

1029
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,800
Oh, hey!

1030
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,960
Where are you going?
I'm not done yet.

1031
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,460
That's not all, Pong.

1032
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:06,550
He helped tie up her hair too.
When he's done,

1033
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,250
he bent down
so low they're almost kissing.

1034
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,250
He bent down this low.

1035
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,880
That low?

1036
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,380
- Try looking up.
- What for?

1037
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,840
I have nothing to do with him.

1038
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,590
Is he?

1039
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,380
- He is.
- I am.

1040
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:34,750
Hold on, Saeb.

1041
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,750
Keep eating. Finish it up.

1042
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:39,710
Paeng, sit down.

1043
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:45,840
Take it easy, Saeb.

1044
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,500
You can have another serving
if you're not full yet.

1045
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:50,800
You probably won't be
earning any more salaries.

1046
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:53,630
I'm full already.

1047
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,710
Saeb, no need to be so shocked.

1048
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,300
Mr. Artit was just messing with you.

1049
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:04,090
Don't be shocked.

1050
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,460
It's only going to be
for three months maximum

1051
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,800
or maybe six.

1052
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:13,090
- What do you mean, Pong?
- You don't really know?

1053
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:14,500
- I don't.
- Salary deduction.

1054
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,090
That's a good idea.

1055
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,840
Mr. Artit, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1056
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,590
Please forgive me.

1057
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,130
- Keep eating.
- I'm full.

1058
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:31,630
- You're full already.
- Yes, sir.

1059
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:34,590
Don't go anywhere. Just sit here.

1060
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,960
Little Miss,

1061
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:41,460
how is it going to be delicious
with those small bites?

1062
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:44,380
You have to take
a huge bite like this.

1063
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,050
Yum!

1064
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:54,840
Little Miss, you have to say
"yum" too.

1065
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:56,460
Paeng, take it slow.

1066
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:57,750
You might choke.

1067
01:14:58,050 --> 01:14:59,880
Yum!

1068
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,800
Get her some water.

1069
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,550
- Okay, sir.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1070
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:07,750
I was getting water.

1071
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:11,500
- Just sit here. Aren't you eating?
- I'm full, sir.

1072
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:23,710
All done.

1073
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:25,710
No.

1074
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:29,000
We're not done yet. You have to
take good care of them.

1075
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,250
Because their lives
depend on you now.

1076
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:36,750
You have to fertilize them,
loosening the soil, water them

1077
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,630
and weed them.

1078
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,170
If you take good care of them,
they'll be happy.

1079
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:43,880
And they'll grow
strong and beautiful.

1080
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:53,800
Here.

1081
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,880
(Wanfahmai's flower bed)

1082
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,630
Wanfahmai's flower bed.

1083
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,670
I want you to be happy

1084
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:09,500
and grow up beautifully.

1085
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,920
From now on,

1086
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,090
this is your home.

1087
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,670
Everyone here is your family.

1088
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:23,960
You're not alone anymore.

1089
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:31,300
I'll put this down for you.

1090
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,960
Wait for them to grow, okay?

1091
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,340
Okay.

1092
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,880
- Are they clean now?
- Yes.

1093
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,050
Good.

1094
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,630
What's wrong? Does it hurt?

1095
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,550
It doesn't, but it's a bit red.

1096
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:28,500
Let me have a look.

1097
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:35,130
Just a little bit red.

1098
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,340
It's okay.

1099
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:40,590
But why are your wrists so small?

1100
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,050
You're too skinny.

1101
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,880
I have to fatten you up some more.

1102
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,420
I'm not skinny. You're just fat

1103
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,550
- Who are you calling fat?
- You.

1104
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,250
- I'm fat?
- Your cheeks are so chubby.

1105
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:53,420
- Look at yourself.
- No!

1106
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,340
Artit!

1107
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:58,920
I baked you something.

1108
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:02,300
Have a taste. They're very good.

1109
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:04,630
Of course.

1110
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,880
- Thanks so much, Nang.
- You're welcome.

1111
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,550
Actually, you two

1112
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,170
are around the same age.

1113
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,920
You could be friends.

1114
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:21,130
From now on, Paeng will live
and study here.

1115
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,880
In two days, Dad will take her to
apply at a school.

1116
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:27,340
If you meet her,
please take care of her.

1117
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,960
Sure. You can trust me
with taking care of things.

1118
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:37,380
Paeng,

1119
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,170
we'll be closer now.

1120
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:43,670
If there's anything I can help,
you can tell me.

1121
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:51,250
Thank you, Nang.

1122
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,590
Please take care of me, then.

1123
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,170
My pleasure.

1124
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,880
Hey, hey! Nang!

1125
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:14,210
Who stepped on your tail?

1126
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,630
Are you crazy?

1127
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,000
I'm a human, not a dog.

1128
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:21,920
Why didn't you tell me that
she's moving into Artit's place?

1129
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:24,670
She's going to study here too.

1130
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,960
Did you go to see Artit again?

1131
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,300
And who were you talking about?

1132
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:32,710
That girl, Paeng.

1133
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,050
Oh?

1134
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,710
She moved here?

1135
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,630
Artit didn't tell me.

1136
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,050
- I don't want it! I don't want it!
- Hey, hey!

1137
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:45,090
- What don't you want?
- Go away!

1138
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,420
Paeng,

1139
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,170
let's meet at around 8 p.m.

1140
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,300
There's a meteor shower tonight.
Let's go and watch.

1141
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,920
I'll hurry downstairs
and wait for you.

1142
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,170
- Artit.
- Yes, Dad?

1143
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:06,920
Where did you take her?

1144
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,300
Just around our farm.

1145
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,380
But tonight I'm taking her
to watch a meteor shower.

1146
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:12,710
That's good.

1147
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:15,340
Have you two eaten?

1148
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:17,300
We've eaten a lot.

1149
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,380
Paeng is so stuffed.

1150
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,300
Do you know

1151
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:24,130
since you came back
she cheered up a lot?

1152
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,960
I'm relieved to see that.

1153
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:29,420
Stay with her
during the break, okay?

1154
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:32,090
Once semester starts, it'll be good
if you can come on the weekends.

1155
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,880
Of course, Dad. Easy enough.

1156
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,250
- I'm going to take a shower.
- Go on.

1157
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:49,420
The atmosphere is so nice.

1158
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:58,300
Wow! What a beautiful sight.

1159
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,380
Missy, why are you
standing there alone?

1160
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:09,590
Whoa!

1161
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,630
You're Aueng,
the pretty girl from Bangkok.

1162
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,380
Oh, don't say that!

1163
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:18,880
Aueng, do you want to watch
the meteor shower with me?

1164
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,340
I can't.

1165
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,380
Jaem's very protective of me.

1166
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,550
I have to wait for Miss Paeng too.

1167
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,880
But she called and told me
to go ahead.

1168
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,420
She's not free right now.

1169
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:36,800
Wow!

1170
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,880
Whoa!

1171
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:41,840
Meow?

1172
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,840
Aueng, my darling. Wait for me.

1173
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:55,210
Come on.

1174
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:59,420
Here. Be careful.

1175
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:02,880
I see. Now I know

1176
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:04,840
why I didn't see you, Aueng.

1177
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:09,380
I came to prepare things for you.

1178
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:12,050
Sir, I've prepared mosquito nets,

1179
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:14,550
pillows and blankets for you.

1180
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:16,800
SIr, do you want to drink with us?

1181
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:18,920
It's okay. Feel free to relax.

1182
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:22,500
But don't drink too much.
You have work tomorrow.

1183
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,210
Aueng, would you like to drink?

1184
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:30,670
I know you want me to get drunk.

1185
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:32,880
Just to warm you up.

1186
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:37,460
Just a little bit, then.

1187
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:41,420
Miss Paeng, can I go join them
over there?

1188
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,920
Do you even have to ask me?

1189
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,750
She said yes.

1190
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:48,630
The grilled pork smells nice.

1191
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,920
The grilled pork smells nice.

1192
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,380
Can I sit with you?

1193
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:55,590
- This way.
- Do you want to sit over there?

1194
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:06,800
I can see so many stars here.

1195
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,590
They're so beautiful.

1196
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,840
There's no light pollution here

1197
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:14,250
so we can see so many stars.

1198
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,670
Paeng,

1199
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:32,840
try laying down.

1200
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,380
What?

1201
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:40,630
Lay down. So you won't sprain
your neck looking up.

1202
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:47,460
That's true.

1203
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,340
Let's get started with astronomy
from the ground up.

1204
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,460
Do you see those constellations?

1205
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:01,210
With the tail there, see?

1206
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:02,590
That line.

1207
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,550
That line coming down.

1208
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:10,300
I see it now.

1209
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:26,210
Hurray! A shooting star!

1210
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:28,710
Wow!

1211
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,460
They really are shooting stars!

1212
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,000
Make a wish.

1213
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:03,630
I wish that I can
stay with Artit forever.

1214
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,670
I wish that Ling accepts my love.

1215
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:17,750
Another one. There.

1216
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,710
Hurray!

1217
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,750
- So many of them, Artit!
- It'll be a while.

1218
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:57,550
Why are you smiling, Miss Paeng?

1219
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,090
You reek of alcohol.

1220
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:04,250
Come on, Miss Paeng!

1221
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,840
By the way, why are you smiling?

1222
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,250
The corner of your lips almost
reach your ears.

1223
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,250
Really?

1224
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:12,550
Really.

1225
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:15,000
Confess to me now.

1226
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:19,250
It's only a meteor shower.
Why are you this gleeful?

1227
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,460
Was it that enjoyable?

1228
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,550
What?

1229
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:25,960
See?

1230
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:28,300
You're blushing?
I was just teasing you.

1231
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:31,090
Oh! Or maybe

1232
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:33,090
are you thinking about Mr. Artit?

1233
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:35,710
I wasn't.

1234
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,340
How can I do that?

1235
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:40,710
He's like a brother to me.

1236
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:43,590
A brother it is then.

1237
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:47,300
But it'd be nice if you two
can get together.

1238
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,050
If it's you,

1239
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:50,920
I'll step aside.

1240
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,880
You're laughing to cover it up.

1241
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,630
- Aueng!
- You're all red.

1242
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,960
Mr. Artit brought a girl to watch
the meteor shower? Who?

1243
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:08,500
Who do you think? Someone familiar.

1244
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:10,960
It's Miss Paeng.

1245
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:14,340
It's not an ordinary relationship.

1246
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:17,050
Soon enough,

1247
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,130
we might have
a new madam of the farm.

1248
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:23,380
It's not true. How is that possible?

1249
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,920
And how is it not possible?

1250
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:28,500
Why is Miss Paeng staying
here permanently

1251
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,920
all of a sudden?

1252
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,090
It's because Master

1253
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,670
and Madam

1254
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:39,750
want her to marry Mr. Artit.
I'm sure of it.

1255
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,090
Bad news this early morning.

1256
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,090
Huh? What did you say?

1257
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:52,300
Saeb told me Miss Paeng moved here

1258
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:54,420
to marry Mr. Artit. Is that true?

1259
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,300
That's not true, right?

1260
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,960
Please don't be quiet.
Say something.

1261
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:01,460
Say it, Madam. Don't be quiet.
It's upsetting.

1262
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:02,630
Stop!

1263
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:05,460
I'm about to say it.

1264
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:06,710
Okay, Madam.

1265
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:09,380
You're assuming things.

1266
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:12,090
There's not going to
be anything of that sort.

1267
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:14,880
Are you for real, Madam?

1268
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:17,210
Are you calling me a liar?

1269
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:19,750
No, Madam. It's not like that.

1270
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:23,090
I'm just confirming it
for everyone's sake.

1271
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:27,670
I think if Mr. Artit is
going to marry someone,

1272
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,590
he deserves someone better.

1273
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:30,960
What's bad about Paeng?

1274
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,170
I didn't mean that.

1275
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:38,590
Miss Paeng is good too.

1276
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:42,920
But I think she's still very young.

1277
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:46,630
Hurry up and tell everyone
to stop talking about this.

1278
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:48,750
Don't let me hear any more of this.

1279
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:53,050
Right away, Madam.
I'll do that right now.

1280
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:58,050
How did they come up with that?
Such perverts.

1281
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,090
Miss Paeng moved here
to marry Mr. Artit. Is that true?

1282
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,050
I know

1283
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,670
what's my happiness now.

1284
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:00,800
Dad?

1285
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:03,630
The girl I love is you, Ling.

1286
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:09,800
Artit is mine.

1287
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,300
Stay away from him.

1288
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,090
Paeng!

1289
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,130
- I can be even crazier than this.
- Stop this right now.

1290
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:22,710
It hurts! Let me go, Artit!

1291
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,670
I decided to let Artit
get engaged to Paeng

1292
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,090
not because of the debt.

1293
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,960
I will never marry Paeng.

1294
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:31,210
You have to be mine and only mine!

1295
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:32,710
Get away!

1296
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:36,840
Artit! Artit!
