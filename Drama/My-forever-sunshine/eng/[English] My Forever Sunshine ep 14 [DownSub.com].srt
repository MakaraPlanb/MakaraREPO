1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,639
You had my background checked

3
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,680
so naturally
I had to check yours too.

4
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,919
Embracing me like this,

5
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,639
it's turning me on.

6
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,879
I just want to
give into you right now.

7
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,599
You two have never met each other?

8
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
I have a mining operation

9
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,360
near your farm.

10
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,520
You're putting up a fight?

11
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,840
This guy showed up out of the blue
to save her.

12
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,159
We didn't have a choice.

13
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,039
Artit, you asked for it.

14
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,680
Do you want me to abandon you?
No way.

15
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,960
We'll get out of this together.

16
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,240
- Hey! There!
- Run! Hurry!

17
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,599
You have to do as I say.

18
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,759
If we go together,

19
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,039
we might die together.

20
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,439
Hey!

21
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,319
He's over there!

22
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,800
Why is he so quick?

23
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,080
Where has he gone to now?

24
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,439
I'll look over there.

25
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes!

26
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,519
Artit!

27
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,879
Mark!

28
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,800
How did you get here?

29
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,920
I followed you from the festival.

30
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,319
I'll explain later.

31
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,730
You're safe, right?

32
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,879
Mark, I heard gunshots.

33
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,560
I'm scared Artit might get shot.

34
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,240
Is Artit here too?

35
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,959
These crooks kidnapped us.

36
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,170
He lured them
in the other direction.

37
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,439
I ran away then I heard gunshots.

38
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,319
I'm worried about him.

39
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,050
Calm down, Paeng.

40
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,079
I think you should get out
of here first. It's not safe.

41
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,480
No, I have to see Artit first.

42
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,199
Okay. I promise I'll find him.

43
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,170
But you have to come
with me now, okay?

44
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,199
Come on.

45
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,199
Wait for me in the car.

46
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,730
Don't open the door for anyone.

47
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,399
I'm going to help Artit.

48
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,040
This is my phone.

49
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,600
You can call the cops now.

50
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,959
Mark,

51
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,879
please find Artit.

52
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,040
Definitely.

53
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,120
Hey!

54
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,480
Who are you?

55
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,879
What do you want?

56
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,120
You're not going to tell me?

57
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,199
Fine. I'll tell you.

58
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,799
Artit!

59
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,039
Artit!

60
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,090
Paeng!

61
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,000
You told me you're going to be okay.

62
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,759
I...

63
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm sorry.

64
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,159
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Just hold on.

65
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,279
Artit.

66
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,000
Artit!

67
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,480
Don't fall.

68
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,399
Artit!

69
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,330
Artit, don't fall down. Hang
in there. I can't hold you up.

70
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,639
Paeng, Paeng.

71
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,679
Don't panic.

72
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,039
I'm okay.

73
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm just feeling woozy.

74
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,279
I'll be alright eventually.

75
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,399
Let me rest for a bit.

76
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,039
I hope you're right.

77
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,639
You're going to be okay, aren't you?

78
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,840
Who's there? This is the police!

79
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,919
Help! Help!

80
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,720
Go! This way!

81
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,559
Artit,

82
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,039
the cops are here.

83
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,919
- You have to be okay.
- Are you alright?

84
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,480
There's a man injured.

85
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,879
Please help.

86
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,399
Call the station.

87
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,559
- Are you okay?
- A man has been found shot.

88
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,000
Please relax.

89
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,799
Uncle! Non!

90
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,879
- Artit's been shot.
- We know.

91
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,840
Doctor!

92
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,840
How is my son?

93
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,440
The bullet missed his vital organs.

94
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,480
I've taken it out. He's safe now.

95
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,840
Can we go and see him?

96
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,159
He's still asleep.

97
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,080
We'll keep him overnight
for observation.

98
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,799
You can visit him tomorrow.

99
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,799
He's definitely okay, right?

100
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,200
We have to keep an eye on him.

101
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,039
But he's safe now.

102
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,919
Thank you.

103
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,039
Artit's safe now, Paeng.

104
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,639
Uncle.

105
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,559
Does Auntie know about this?

106
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,519
I didn't dare tell her.

107
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,159
But I think

108
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,960
she's asleep now.

109
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,080
I'll tell her tomorrow.

110
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,960
Uncle,

111
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,600
can I stay with Artit tonight?

112
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,679
I'll keep her company.

113
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,840
Good.

114
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,120
Then,

115
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,320
please watch over him.

116
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,159
- Okay?
- Okay.

117
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,039
I'm going to go
and talk to the police.

118
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,039
I'm not scared for myself.

119
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,960
But I'm scared something might

120
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,639
happen to you because of me again.

121
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,799
If you get hurt because of me,

122
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,840
I don't think I'll be able
to face Uncle and Auntie anymore.

123
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,200
Paeng,

124
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,039
you're all dirty. Should I take
you home to change?

125
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,320
I'll watch over him.

126
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,279
Arit's probably happy to know

127
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,960
that you're worried about him.

128
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,720
Use this to cover yourself up.

129
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,120
Thank you.

130
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,080
Stay strong, Paeng.

131
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,639
Come on.

132
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,360
Paeng, you haven't slept at all?

133
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,159
I'm waiting for Artit to wake up.

134
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,159
Then I'll go home first.

135
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,679
I'll be back later.

136
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,399
Okay.

137
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,799
Artit?

138
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,480
Artit?

139
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,919
You were shot.

140
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,120
But you're safe now.

141
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,360
Do you remember?

142
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,440
How are you doing?

143
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,720
I'm totally fine.

144
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,120
Good.

145
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,440
What's wrong?

146
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,039
Thank you for
being worried about me.

147
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,410
You're worried about me too.

148
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,920
I'm scared

149
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,079
that something might happen to you.

150
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,039
What are you smiling about?

151
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,359
I'm happy

152
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,759
that you're worried about me.

153
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,890
I'm thirsty.

154
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,410
The doctor said small sips only.

155
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,650
Are you hungry?

156
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,119
Would you like anything?

157
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,410
You seem exhausted.

158
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,240
Would you like to rest more?

159
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,799
Can you hold my hand?

160
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,410
Sorry?

161
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,519
Why are you letting me
hold your hand?

162
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,200
So I can rest assured.

163
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,079
- Madam.
- What's the matter?

164
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,079
Master called and said he'll take
you somewhere today.

165
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,240
Where?

166
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,759
I don't know, Madam.

167
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,410
And he's left?

168
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,279
What's going on?

169
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,039
He came back late
and he woke up before me.

170
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,519
What's all this trouble?

171
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,359
He won't tell where he's taking me.

172
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,680
How am supposed to prepare myself?

173
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,079
Hello, Uncle.

174
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,680
How are you doing, son?

175
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,680
I talked to the doctor.

176
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,440
There's nothing to worry about.

177
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,920
You can rest assured now, Paeng.

178
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,799
Okay, Uncle.

179
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,240
Here are your clothes.

180
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,519
I let Aueng pack them up.

181
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,440
But I haven't told her anything

182
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,920
except that you're with me.

183
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,960
Okay.

184
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,519
You get changed

185
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,410
and go home to get some rest.

186
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,559
I'll watch over him.

187
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,680
No, Uncle.

188
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,799
I want to stay with him.

189
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,680
Paeng,

190
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,559
can you go ask the nurse for me

191
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,650
when he'll be able
to eat by himself?

192
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,039
Sure.

193
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,920
I haven't told Mom yet.

194
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,920
I don't know where to start.

195
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,599
But I probably have to be gentle.

196
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,890
I'll bring her over this afternoon.

197
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,440
Be prepared.

198
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,200
Can we not tell her?

199
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:50,920
We have to.

200
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,920
She's your mom.

201
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,960
If she finds out from other people,
we'll be the first in trouble.

202
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,759
Then

203
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,359
can we not tell her that this has
something to do with Paeng?

204
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,440
So you want Paeng to be sad?

205
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,480
Whoa, Artit!

206
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,079
I'm sorry!

207
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,240
How are you doing?

208
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,559
I thought you're going to die.

209
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,119
And who dared to do this to you?

210
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,640
Aren't they afraid of going to jail?

211
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,279
Artit, how are you doing?

212
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,680
I'm okay now.

213
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,200
It's good that you're okay.

214
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,440
And why are you alone like this?

215
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:48,960
No one stayed over. Should I do it?

216
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,799
- You don't have to.
- Why not?

217
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,759
I have someone to do that.

218
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,440
Someone? Where?

219
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,519
She's in the bathroom.

220
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,920
It's your mom, isn't it?

221
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,440
Hello, Auntie.

222
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,880
Hello.

223
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,160
Paeng?

224
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,440
Do you want me to adjust the bed?

225
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:22,839
Is that okay?

226
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,119
All done.

227
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,519
You can keep talking.

228
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,880
Paeng,

229
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,599
can you move my pillow?

230
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,240
Okay.

231
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,640
Move it down a little.

232
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,640
Is that okay?

233
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,319
You can keep talking.

234
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,599
Paeng,

235
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,240
hold on a second.

236
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,200
I want to go to the bathroom.

237
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,039
- I can take you...
- No need.

238
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,680
Paeng, please help me.

239
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,200
Okay.

240
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,599
Just a moment.

241
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,160
Excuse me.

242
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,440
Careful.

243
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,319
You can walk.

244
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,039
He's recovered all of a sudden.

245
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,640
What is this?

246
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,079
No way.

247
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,960
Paeng, what's wrong with Artit?

248
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,960
I don't know either.

249
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,519
Apart from being shot,

250
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,440
was he beaten in the head
or did fall and hit his head?

251
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,599
Probably.

252
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,559
But I don't know where he got hit.

253
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,480
Do you think it's strange?

254
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,799
Definitely.

255
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,759
He's changed a lot.

256
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,440
See? It's not just me.

257
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,680
Should we tell the doctor?

258
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,039
Of course. Have a complete check-up.

259
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,400
Let him get a CT scan.

260
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,519
No need. You'll get used to it.

261
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,799
Get used to it?

262
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,039
I mean we'll get used to it.
Just give him time.

263
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,519
So what's wrong with him?

264
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,319
Tubtim.

265
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,400
Just tell me.

266
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,880
Where are you taking me?

267
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,559
You told me you're picking me up
at noon. It's late already.

268
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,599
I'm taking you to the hospital.

269
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,640
How come?

270
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,960
Uh...

271
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,960
Artit's unwell.

272
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,759
He was okay
when he left for the festival.

273
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,000
Wait, what are you
trying to tell me?

274
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,680
What's wrong with him?

275
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,200
Calm down. He's fine.

276
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,519
What's wrong with our son?

277
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,759
Artit is safe and well.

278
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,200
But there was a bit
of an accident yesterday.

279
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,240
Just tell me.

280
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,480
- Was it a car accident?
- No, it wasn't.

281
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,880
- Is he really fine?
- He is.

282
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,319
Then take me there now. Quick.

283
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,319
Tubtim, calm down.

284
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
Do you have any enemies?

285
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,559
I've never had any.

286
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,799
I don't think they kidnapped
the wrong person.

287
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,599
Is it possible

288
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,039
that it's about

289
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,000
my farm?

290
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,319
Do you mean
that they're targeting you?

291
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,480
That's a possibility.

292
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,319
Have you had any problems with
anyone lately?

293
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,640
It's not really a big problem.

294
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,160
But he's that only one that
could be possibly involved.

295
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,759
Who is it?

296
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,440
There is a conflict between me and
Dandin's mining operation.

297
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,279
Dandin.

298
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,559
That's right.

299
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,160
Thank you very much. We'll proceed
with the investigation.

300
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,319
- Please do.
- Alright.

301
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,960
Artit, why did you get up?
Do you need anything?

302
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,839
Nothing.

303
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,799
I saw that you haven't eaten
anything all day.

304
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,599
Have you had anything at all?

305
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,640
I'm not hungry.

306
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,519
Were you watching over
me the whole night?

307
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,720
I was.

308
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,200
Did you get any sleep?

309
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,720
Paeng,

310
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,480
thank you very much
for worrying about me.

311
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,400
But don't make me be
worried about you in return.

312
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,400
It's late afternoon already.

313
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,079
You have to eat something.
I'll order it for you.

314
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,480
And you can rest after eating.

315
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,240
I really am not hungry.

316
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,440
Alright. Then I won't eat dinner.

317
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,440
Okay.

318
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,759
I'll eat.

319
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,200
I'll go downstairs.

320
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,599
Alone?

321
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,359
I'm worried.

322
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,119
Artit, this is the hospital.
Nothing's going to happen.

323
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:47,599
Alright.

324
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,759
Just hurry back.

325
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,720
Okay.

326
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,960
Ten minutes.

327
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,640
Uncle.

328
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,920
Artit!

329
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,440
Are you okay?

330
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,440
I'll go talk to the doctor to
make sure that you're really okay.

331
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,799
I'm fine now, Mom.

332
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,480
The wound only hurts a bit.

333
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,960
I don't believe you.

334
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,319
Should I get up and run around?

335
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,599
Don't! Don't! Don't!

336
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,960
Don't get up. Just lay down
until the doctor lets you go home.

337
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,319
What about Dad?

338
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,480
Oh, he said he's going
to talk to the doctor.

339
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,960
Anyway, have the police
caught the culprits yet?

340
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,240
An officer came here to question me.

341
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,079
Who did you get involved with?
Why did they have to shoot you?

342
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,920
Does the farm have
anything to do with this?

343
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,480
I'm not sure.

344
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,880
But I think it won't be difficult
for the police to find the culprits.

345
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,680
If it's about the farm,
then just sell it.

346
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,680
If my son has to risk his life,
then it's not worth it.

347
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:30,359
Next time, if something big
like this happens again

348
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,799
and I'm the last to know,

349
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,960
I'll be after both you and Dad.

350
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,680
Once is enough, Mom.

351
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,359
You're right.

352
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,119
Why did this unfortunate thing
have to happen to you?

353
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,640
I almost had a heart attack.

354
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,079
I'm sorry, Mom.

355
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,039
I don't know if I'll be
able to sleep tonight.

356
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,960
The culprits are still out there.

357
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,319
I don't know if they'll return
to do anything to you again.

358
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:05,960
I don't think they'll dare now
that the police are onto it.

359
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,880
My dear son.

360
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,720
Tonight I'll stay with you.

361
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,759
Don't be scared.

362
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,240
You'll be able to get
a good night's sleep.

363
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,759
Get some rest.

364
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,279
Auntie wants to watch over her son.

365
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,279
So I volunteered to
bring you back home.

366
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:49,920
I understand.

367
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,279
If Auntie knows

368
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,680
that Artit got hurt because of me,

369
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,400
she might hate me even more.

370
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,279
But the reason he survived

371
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,079
is also because of you.

372
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:09,599
If you ran away
and left Artit there,

373
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,880
I might have lost my son.

374
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,359
How could I leave him?

375
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:19,680
He risked his life to save me.

376
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,079
By the way,

377
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,640
he wants you to move back
into the main house.

378
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,279
Pardon me?

379
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,359
I agree with him.

380
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,079
I'm worried about your safety.

381
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,200
We don't even know

382
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,720
why this happened

383
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,200
or who did it.

384
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,240
I don't think I should.

385
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,759
I'm afraid I might make
Auntie uncomfortable.

386
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,720
But Artit's very worried about you.

387
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,319
He insisted on it.

388
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,200
He's very concerned
about your safety

389
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,279
and forbids any stranger
from coming into the farm.

390
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,960
I'm also worried about him.

391
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,880
He'll be able to come
home in a few days.

392
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,720
You can rest assured now.

393
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,759
Okay, Uncle.

394
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,880
Oh, Nang. You're here.

395
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,119
- Hello, Auntie.
- Hello.

396
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,359
Artit,

397
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,400
does it hurt?

398
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,880
When Auntie called me,
I was so flustered.

399
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,480
Can I have a look at your wound?

400
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,680
Don't, Nang.

401
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,279
Jeez.

402
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,200
Just a little bit.

403
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,079
Don't worry, Artit.

404
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,000
I took an intensive nursing course.

405
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:04,119
I guarantee
that I can look after you.

406
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,319
I'm almost recovered.

407
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,559
No, you need someone close by

408
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,119
to look after you, especially
when you've almost recovered.

409
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,159
It's evening now.

410
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,199
I'll wash you.

411
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,480
Auntie, may I?

412
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,679
Nang!

413
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,880
Mom!

414
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:37,840
Mom!

415
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,920
It's time for your sponge bath.

416
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:48,769
Auntie.

417
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,400
Tonight I can
stay over here too, right?

418
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,559
Certainly.

419
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,559
What's the matter?

420
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:12,000
An officer is here to see you.

421
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,769
Miss Paeng!

422
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,769
There's a rumor

423
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,440
that Mr. Artit got injured
and was hospitalized. Is that true?

424
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,519
What happened to him? Who did it?

425
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,599
They'll have to deal with us.

426
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:34,440
Pong, what are you going to do?

427
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,809
Yell at them.

428
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,480
Come on, Pong.

429
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:40,519
If that's all you can do,
better to just stay quiet.

430
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,440
Shouldn't we just listen
to Miss Paeng?

431
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,559
I'll knock your teeth out.

432
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:46,239
Saeb, you're really
asking for it. I'll...

433
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,480
- You'll kiss me?
- I'll kick your butt.

434
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,960
I'm sorry, Pong.

435
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,360
- Let's listen to her.
- Miss Paeng,

436
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,960
Mr. Artit is fine, right?

437
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:57,519
He'll be able to come home
in a few days.

438
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,289
You and Saeb can ask him then.

439
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,769
It's the miners, isn't it?

440
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:08,000
We don't know
who the culprits are yet.

441
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:12,440
I knew it! They definitely
came after him!

442
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,239
It's true.

443
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,840
Everyone! Come listen to this!

444
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,480
Everyone, come here!

445
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,639
I have something to tell you!
Gather round!

446
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,400
Artit, the doctor said you can go
home tomorrow. Are you happy?

447
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:33,199
You recovered quickly
because Nang was taking care of you.

448
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,440
Not really, Auntie.

449
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,199
I'm just being attentive.

450
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,719
I've chosen the right person.

451
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:47,329
I told you that
she's a lovely person.

452
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,769
Auntie!

453
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,239
Thank you very much, Nang.

454
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,840
But I've already recovered.

455
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,639
You can just go home.

456
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,329
I can't go yet.

457
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:05,920
Because Auntie told me
to take care of you at home

458
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,159
until your wound
has completely healed.

459
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,920
And I've already agreed to that.

460
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,360
Don't you have any work to do?

461
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:17,719
Work?

462
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,400
I've already finished it up.

463
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:21,559
I told Dad I'm taking leave

464
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:25,480
for one, two, three months.

465
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,039
No worries!

466
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,599
Dad approved it already.

467
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:34,840
Mom,

468
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,960
but I can take care of myself.

469
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,840
My word is final.

470
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:42,559
She will continue to take care
of you at home.

471
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,039
I'll head home first.

472
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,880
Nang's going to give me a lift.
She'll come back here after.

473
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,079
Mom!

474
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:54,599
- But...
- Artit,

475
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:57,719
why are you surprised?
I'm not going to do anything do you.

476
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,079
She's right. There's no
need to be scared.

477
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,639
Come on, Nang.

478
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,039
- Hello?
- Non, it's me.

479
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:33,440
I'm about to go and visit you.

480
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,559
Good. Can you buy me two phones?

481
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,039
No problem.

482
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,400
I have a favor to ask you.

483
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,920
What is it?

484
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:46,880
My sister again?

485
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,559
Alright. I'll handle it.

486
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,440
Thanks a lot.

487
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,639
You little rascal.

488
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,599
You always embarrass me
in front of my friends.

489
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,880
Perm, where's my car?

490
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,559
Non had it taken to the shop.

491
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,000
Taken to the shop?

492
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,119
- My car?
- Yes, miss.

493
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,679
I just parked it here.

494
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,239
Actually, all the cars.

495
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,599
All the cars in the house?

496
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:20,920
He said you weren't going to leave
for anywhere anyway.

497
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:25,400
Gosh. You didn't consult me
with at all.

498
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,920
Where's Non?

499
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,079
He drove off just now.

500
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,119
He had all the cars
in the house taken to the shop,

501
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,159
except for his?

502
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,119
You jerk of a brother.
How am I going to go now?

503
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:44,159
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

504
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:45,679
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

505
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,159
Miss Paeng!

506
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,480
What's the matter, Saeb?

507
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,639
Mr. Artit called and asked
that you rush over to the hospital!

508
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,769
Is he okay?

509
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,880
I don't know! Please hurry!

510
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,400
Please hurry, Miss Paeng!

511
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,480
- Hello?
- Miss Paeng just left.

512
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,289
I saw her take some food over too.

513
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:09,400
Well done, Saeb. Thanks very much.

514
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:11,079
No worries, sir.

515
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,239
Hey.

516
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,639
So I should leave now?

517
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:24,400
That's right.

518
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,400
Why are you leaning against me?

519
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,559
I got you the phones and now
I'm no use to you anymore?

520
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:32,239
I want you to pay
attention to me too.

521
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,639
Go on. Go.

522
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,920
Thanks.

523
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:38,199
Alright. I'll go.

524
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,679
I'll go and see Ling then.

525
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,440
It's time to go now!

526
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,840
I'll see you later.

527
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,679
Paeng.

528
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,199
What are you doing here?

529
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,559
Why can't I be here?

530
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,599
You should've known
what you've done.

531
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,079
Do you even have to ask me that?

532
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,289
What have I done?

533
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,079
You're coming to see
that Artit's been shot, right?

534
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,329
Don't make empty accusations.

535
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,159
I can sue you for that.

536
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:21,639
Then why are you here?

537
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,440
I'm here to visit my friend.

538
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,289
To visit your friend?

539
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,679
My friend Mark also got hurt
and is hospitalized here.

540
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,239
Really?

541
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,400
You can see for yourself

542
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,079
if you don't believe me.

543
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:41,159
He's in room 6602.

544
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,159
I have to go now.

545
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:05,519
(Patient name: Mr. Mark Tanitkitja)

546
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,920
Mark.

547
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,920
Paeng.

548
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,809
Miss Paeng left a while now ago.

549
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,039
- How come she hasn't arrived yet?
- I don't know, sir.

550
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:35,880
You have to know.

551
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,719
How should I know?

552
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,559
I didn't go with her.

553
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,599
Mr. Artit,

554
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:43,559
what if she went back to Bangkok?

555
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,480
Enough.

556
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:48,519
I'm going nuts talking to you.

557
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:50,719
Mr. Artit? What?

558
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,519
Oh, Paeng.

559
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,039
How come you just arrived?

560
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:15,840
I was about to go and find you.

561
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,880
Why did you get out of bed?

562
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,159
I'm fine now.

563
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,960
Saeb told me you brought
something for me.

564
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:27,639
Uh...

565
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,329
I already gave it to someone else.

566
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:34,480
Who did you see?

567
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:37,360
Well,

568
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:39,769
it was Mark.

569
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,559
Huh?

570
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,440
Where did you meet him? How?

571
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,400
You don't even have
his phone number.

572
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:50,719
I met him here at the hospital.

573
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:54,559
He followed you here?

574
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:57,039
He didn't.

575
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:58,719
Listen to me.

576
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,840
He's hospitalized
because he got shot as well.

577
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,440
Tell me. How come Mark is involved?

578
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,719
I bumped into him in the woods.

579
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,360
He got me out.

580
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:29,440
And he went to find and help you.

581
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,519
He came to help me?

582
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:36,119
He appeared
in the woods all of a sudden.

583
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,480
Don't you think it's too much of a
coincidence?

584
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,960
Initially, I thought so too.

585
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,559
But he already told me.

586
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,360
What did he tell you?

587
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:53,920
I saw someone usher you into a car.

588
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:56,800
But it seemed like you were
unconscious.

589
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,440
So I went back to my car
to go after them.

590
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,239
But I didn't see where they went.

591
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,920
I called you

592
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,800
and kept driving

593
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,440
until I saw that car
parked on the side of the road.

594
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:13,480
So I called the police.

595
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,199
I decided to get out
and I found you.

596
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,159
Then there was a gunshot.

597
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:25,000
And you helped Artit.

598
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,039
That's right.

599
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,960
But I bumped into the culprits.

600
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:30,760
So I was shot.

601
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:35,360
You were shot? Is that true?

602
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,440
I'm sorry

603
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,719
that you got hurt because of me.

604
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,119
I'm happy to know that you're safe.

605
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,559
But are you injured or anything?

606
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,239
No, I'm fine.

607
00:45:57,719 --> 00:45:59,760
I really didn't know
that you got hurt.

608
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,199
How is Artit doing?

609
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,000
He got shot as well.

610
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,599
But he's safe now.

611
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,679
Uh...

612
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,320
isn't there anyone here
to watch over you?

613
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:25,960
I feel guilty.

614
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:29,599
If I'd known, I would've come
to visit you when it happened.

615
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,880
I'm happy that you're
worried about me.

616
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,000
Then come

617
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:38,880
and stay with me after this.

618
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,280
Okay.

619
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,880
Paeng,

620
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:47,840
do you know who they are?

621
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,079
I have no idea.

622
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,440
The police came to question me.

623
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,119
I think I've seen
their faces before.

624
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:02,800
But I can't remember where.

625
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:16,719
And you believe him?

626
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,280
I saw him go in to help you.

627
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,639
Do you really think
that he'd help me?

628
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,079
What do you mean?

629
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,079
This is not coincidental.

630
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,719
He deliberately went there.

631
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,280
And he's the person who did it.

632
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:38,639
Artit,

633
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,559
I understand
that you don't like Mark.

634
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,360
But I think you're going too far

635
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,679
in thinking that he's the culprit
even though he got injured.

636
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:49,679
I'm not going too far.

637
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,159
I don't believe him no matter what.

638
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,440
Who's crazy enough to shoot himself?

639
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,360
How injured is he?

640
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,760
Probably the same as you.

641
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:13,840
The bullet missed his vital organs.

642
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,440
Paeng,

643
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:22,360
until the culprits are caught,
I don't want you to see him.

644
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:26,519
But it will look really bad
if I don't visit him.

645
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,559
Then wait and go with me.

646
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,800
- But if you go...
- Paeng,

647
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,000
that's enough. I'm not feeling well.

648
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:42,800
Okay.

649
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,960
Then stop speaking ill of him.

650
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,719
You should be a bit more
polite to him.

651
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,679
No.

652
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:52,679
I don't trust him.

653
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:16,400
What have you done?

654
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,159
Didn't you think
that it's going to affect me?

655
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,239
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

656
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:25,880
You shot Artit.

657
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,079
Can you call that an accident?

658
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,920
I intended to fire a warning shot.

659
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:32,920
But he ran over to take the bullet.

660
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,559
I made a mistake

661
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,400
for not asking you
what your plan is.

662
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,599
Actually, Artit wasn't part of
my plan.

663
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,039
Things wouldn't have
gotten escalated

664
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,159
if he didn't butt in.

665
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:48,800
What are we going to do now?

666
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,239
It happened at a place I own.

667
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,840
People know there are conflicts
going on between us.

668
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,960
I'm going to be in trouble
instead of you.

669
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,599
Why are you worried?

670
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,519
He won't know who did it.

671
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,039
You're overconfident.

672
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:04,000
You'll fail easily.

673
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,480
You asked for it

674
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,599
and took too much
effort in doing this.

675
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:12,599
So things will be over
and you won't be in trouble.

676
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,559
I've sent those people who helped
you somewhere else.

677
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,719
And you have to stop
messing around with that woman.

678
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:19,719
No.

679
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:22,320
Mark,

680
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,920
is she really that important?

681
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:27,599
Yes.

682
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,400
She's very important to me.

683
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:36,480
Then have it your own way.

684
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:39,239
But I'm not going
to help you anymore.

685
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,400
The police are here with a warrant
to search our old storage.

686
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:08,239
They're not going to let this go,
are they? They want to get me.

687
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,239
Why do you have to protect
your friend so much?

688
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:15,239
I'm indebted to him.

689
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:18,239
He saved my life.

690
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,960
Please eat a little bit.

691
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,239
Ling, are you done?

692
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,559
I am.

693
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,880
- Hello, Artit.
- What's up?

694
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,800
Ling and I are about to go over.

695
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,119
I'm sorry it's already evening.

696
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:53,360
- You don't have to come.
- Why not?

697
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,119
I'm sleepy.

698
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:00,800
He said he's sleepy.

699
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,280
Okay, okay.

700
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,079
Get some rest.

701
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:16,760
Paeng, wait.

702
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,039
What are you doing?

703
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,480
You said you're sleepy
so I'm adjusting the bed.

704
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:24,800
I'm not sleepy.

705
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:28,639
I just

706
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,039
didn't want them to come.

707
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,559
It's enough with just the two of us.

708
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:36,239
These are my clothes.
You can wear them for now.

709
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:40,320
Do I have to watch over you?

710
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,360
If it's not me, then who are you
planning to watch over?

711
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,239
Artit,

712
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,480
you still have your family
and friends.

713
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,199
But he doesn't have anyone.

714
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,239
You're still thinking of Mark.

715
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,880
Are you going to watch over him?

716
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,559
Whether I want to or not,

717
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,079
isn't it a responsibility
I should take?

718
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:16,480
Then I'm going to
demand your responsibility

719
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,079
and make you take care of me.

720
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:21,800
Will you do it?

721
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,239
Okay.

722
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,559
Tonight I'll stay with you.

723
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,719
But tomorrow I'm going
to watch over Mark.

724
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,199
Tonight I'll stay with you.

725
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:04,719
But tomorrow I'm going
to watch over Mark.

726
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,639
Who are you looking for?

727
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,119
Paeng told me that you were shot.

728
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:33,800
So I'm here to visit you.

729
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,079
To visit me? Or to see Paeng?

730
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:41,480
Both, actually.

731
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:46,679
That night,

732
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:48,639
why were you there?

733
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,880
I think Paeng already
told you everything.

734
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,440
Yes, she has.

735
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:56,320
But I'm not buying it.

736
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,039
You don't like me
that's why you don't believe me.

737
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:02,639
And have you found out

738
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,440
why you were shot?

739
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,360
Which one of your enemies did it?

740
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,800
I've never had any enemies.

741
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,159
But if anyone wants to be my enemy,
then that's a different story.

742
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,760
I think you might've gotten
in someone's way.

743
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:19,079
Be careful.

744
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,920
I think

745
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,559
it's just a dog that likes
to bite from behind.

746
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,519
I'm not scared.

747
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:32,880
Paeng must be inside.

748
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,960
Leave her alone.

749
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:40,719
Why should I?

750
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:42,639
I'm interested in her.

751
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,480
And I believe that
she wants to see me too.

752
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,440
Unless someone has forbidden
her to do so.

753
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,360
Then you should know
that I have the power to forbid her.

754
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:00,440
We have to wait and see

755
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,800
whether you'll be able
to forbid her forever.

756
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,920
I will get evidence

757
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:15,599
and find out who shot me

758
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:18,840
and kidnapped Paeng.

759
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,480
I believe

760
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:23,639
that my instincts about
the culprit are correct.

761
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:27,159
Keep me updated.

762
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,679
Because I was shot as well.

763
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,400
Tell Paeng for me

764
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,559
that I'm feeling lonely.

765
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,159
Who's crazy enough to shoot himself?

766
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,400
He's scarier than you think.

767
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,800
He declared that I should stay away.

768
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,960
Paeng?

769
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,440
Paeng?

770
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,360
We've arrived.

771
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,480
Where are we?

772
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,519
Artit.

773
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,280
Artit.

774
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,719
Artit, why aren't we going home?

775
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,880
Whose place is this?

776
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,280
Wow! It's so beautiful.

777
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:52,159
Where is this?

778
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:54,280
Paeng,

779
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,880
I want to get some rest.

780
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,119
If you want to rest,
then sleep at home.

781
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,039
Do you want to go back to sleep?

782
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:05,320
No.

783
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,920
Are you hungry?

784
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,920
I'm not.

785
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,840
Okay. I'll have some rest.
I don't feel well.

786
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,159
Artit.

787
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:34,199
Artit, whose place is this?

788
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,920
Let me sleep a little longer.

789
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,559
Let go of my hand.

790
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:58,159
Artit! I'm here!

791
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,360
I'm sorry I couldn't
come last night.

792
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:03,239
Non pulled a prank on me.

793
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:06,360
Were you lonely sleeping alone?

794
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:08,639
You can go home today.

795
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,280
Where is Artit?

796
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,079
Did I come into the wrong room?

797
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,800
I'm really sorry.

798
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,559
It's the right room.

799
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,719
Or has he already gone home?

800
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,039
Are you up now?

801
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,679
I saw you were sleeping so I didn't
want to wake you.

802
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:12,079
I'm envious. You sleep so easily.

803
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,400
Don't you accuse me.
It was just a short nap.

804
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,880
I was watching over you for hours.

805
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:20,529
Are you going to eat
or shower first?

806
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,439
I want to talk to you first.

807
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,199
Are you ready?

808
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,359
Let's eat first

809
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:33,649
and we'll talk afterward, okay?

810
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:36,159
Please have a seat.

811
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:41,720
It looks delicious, right?

812
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:45,399
It does.

813
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,569
I didn't know you can cook.

814
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,720
Come on. There are lots of things
that you don't know about me.

815
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:54,649
What are you smiling about?

816
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,319
People smile when they are happy.

817
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:10,720
Artit!

818
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:12,649
Yes?

819
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:15,159
You're happy that you're with me?

820
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:17,359
Correct.

821
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,279
You're pranking me.

822
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,159
Artit,

823
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,960
why are you doing this?

824
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,439
What do you want?

825
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,720
You... hate me.

826
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,000
I can understand that.

827
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:43,439
And if you're going to forgive me,

828
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,800
I can understand that as well.

829
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:51,529
But why are you doing this to me?

830
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,960
What do you want?

831
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:56,920
Isn't it good that I'm like this?

832
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,800
Well...

833
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:09,199
It feels good

834
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,479
that you're treating me nicely.

835
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,079
But I...

836
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,199
I'm confused.

837
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:22,399
What are you confused about?

838
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,880
Um...

839
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:29,119
Well...

840
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,119
Initially,

841
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:35,920
you harbored a murderous
hatred towards me.

842
01:10:36,569 --> 01:10:38,479
But now,

843
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:43,159
you're suddenly worried about me.

844
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,720
And you came to my rescue.

845
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,439
Which one do you prefer?

846
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,039
Uh...

847
01:10:56,649 --> 01:10:58,199
I don't know how to act.

848
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:00,529
How come?

849
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,239
Because I...

850
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:08,399
Because you hate me.

851
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:10,840
I never hated you.

852
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:12,479
So you like me.

853
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:14,680
I don't like you!

854
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:17,529
You're smiling again!

855
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:24,609
Go and take a shower
after you're done eating.

856
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:26,159
Your clothes are over there.

857
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:30,569
How come they're here?

858
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,529
I told Saeb to handle it.

859
01:11:33,609 --> 01:11:35,569
This and this.

860
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,439
This is your new phone and number.

861
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,079
You probably won't get to
use it when you're with me.

862
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,960
But just in case. I'll be able to
find you if you got lost somewhere.

863
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,760
Is it good?

864
01:12:05,649 --> 01:12:06,720
It's good.

865
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:26,359
Artit.

866
01:12:27,399 --> 01:12:28,479
Artit.

867
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:32,279
Artit, can you stop and talk to me?

868
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:36,760
Artit.

869
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:38,479
Artit.

870
01:12:40,529 --> 01:12:41,609
Artit.

871
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,680
Artit.

872
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:48,800
Artit,

873
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:52,079
can you tell me now
why you're not going home?

874
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:55,760
I have many reasons.

875
01:12:56,649 --> 01:12:58,840
Then tell me everything.
I want to know.

876
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,960
Sure.

877
01:13:02,569 --> 01:13:03,649
First,

878
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:06,039
I don't want to go back and have
Nang taking care of me.

879
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,319
If I go home, she's going
to be all over me.

880
01:13:09,529 --> 01:13:10,649
You guys seem like a good match.

881
01:13:11,479 --> 01:13:12,569
Paeng.

882
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:14,239
What's the next reason?

883
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,960
Second,

884
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:19,720
I'm worried about your safety.

885
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,199
I don't feel that we're safe yet.

886
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:28,680
And third,

887
01:13:31,649 --> 01:13:32,960
I don't want to be
with other people.

888
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,319
I want to be with...

889
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,359
Enough. I don't want to listen
to this one anymore.

890
01:13:45,319 --> 01:13:46,529
But this one is the most important.

891
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,039
Artit!

892
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:50,479
Why are you being so loud?
I'm right here.

893
01:13:51,529 --> 01:13:52,800
You're pranking me.

894
01:13:53,649 --> 01:13:54,720
How am I pranking you?

895
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,920
Look at me and tell me
how I'm pranking you.

896
01:14:08,609 --> 01:14:11,039
I know. You were shot

897
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:13,239
and you probably
got hit in the head.

898
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,119
You might be losing your mind.

899
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:18,039
Your brain could be affected.

900
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:23,649
Your tone towards me is much nicer.

901
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,399
Ever since you gained consciousness,
you've changed.

902
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,960
You noticed?

903
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,920
I did. I'm not losing my mind
like you are.

904
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,720
Artit, listen to me carefully.

905
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:44,800
Sure. I'm listening.

906
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,760
I'm going to repeat it for you.

907
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,239
Actually,

908
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:54,649
you hate me.

909
01:14:58,479 --> 01:14:59,569
I used to hate you.

910
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,479
That's right. You really hated me.

911
01:15:03,609 --> 01:15:06,279
I was. But now
I don't hate you anymore.

912
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,680
If I hated you, I won't be
able to do this.

913
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,920
Artit,

914
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:28,920
I think you have to get
your brain checked.

915
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:31,079
- I'm fine.
- You're not.

916
01:15:33,649 --> 01:15:34,720
Then I'm not.

917
01:15:39,529 --> 01:15:40,649
Let me go.

918
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,649
I'm telling you.

919
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,319
Once you've recovered and
remembered everything,

920
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:52,960
you can't blame this on me.

921
01:15:53,239 --> 01:15:56,039
Because you're the one
who took me here.

922
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:59,569
You embraced me.
I didn't embrace you.

923
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,920
Once you're back to normal,

924
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:04,569
you have to remember what you did.

925
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,920
I'll remember that this time

926
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,960
I kissed you

927
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:47,720
and you didn't kiss me.

928
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:04,039
Paeng, that hurts!

929
01:17:04,649 --> 01:17:07,199
Well, you kissed me!

930
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,920
It's me, Dad.

931
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:36,649
Tell me where you are.

932
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,720
Mom's throwing a fit.

933
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:40,760
I'm in another province.

934
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:43,529
How did you get there?

935
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,479
You're still not fully recovered.
Who's going to look after you?

936
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:48,609
I brought Paeng with me.

937
01:17:50,529 --> 01:17:52,039
You took Paeng with you?

938
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:54,239
That's right.

939
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:56,720
I want to rest for a few days.

940
01:17:57,399 --> 01:17:59,319
Why didn't you call me?

941
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:02,479
Anyway, I understand.

942
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:04,760
But what I don't understand

943
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,760
is why you brought Paeng along.

944
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:10,399
So she can look after me.

945
01:18:12,649 --> 01:18:13,720
Are you worried about her?

946
01:18:15,159 --> 01:18:16,399
That too.

947
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:20,159
Good that you're
admitting it directly.

948
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,199
Anyway, you have to be
respectful of her.

949
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:29,960
Whoa, Dad. You're making me
look bad.

950
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:33,239
Since Paeng's return,

951
01:18:34,119 --> 01:18:37,039
it's always looked bad to me.

952
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,239
You're kicking me while I'm down.

953
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,199
Do you know now

954
01:18:41,609 --> 01:18:43,279
that Paeng's changed?

955
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:46,800
You're still kicking.

956
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:50,239
Dad,

957
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,239
please handle Mom for me.

958
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:55,239
Artit,

959
01:18:56,319 --> 01:18:58,569
I'm worried about both of you.

960
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:02,529
But I didn't think
that you'd like her.

961
01:19:06,649 --> 01:19:07,960
I didn't either.

962
01:19:09,569 --> 01:19:11,649
There's going to be a lot
of problems after this.

963
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:15,439
I think we have to talk
when you get back.

964
01:19:18,529 --> 01:19:19,609
Okay.

965
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:21,159
I'll talk to you later.

966
01:19:47,479 --> 01:19:49,079
Aren't you going to ask first
who's knocking?

967
01:19:49,609 --> 01:19:50,760
What if it was someone else?

968
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:55,159
It's only the two of us here.
If it's not you, then it's a ghost.

969
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,649
I'm trying to say that
we should be a bit more careful.

970
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,079
Okay.

971
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,840
Wait.

972
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,760
Artit,

973
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:15,840
what's the matter?

974
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,880
I'm going to take a shower.

975
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:21,960
Oh, then go ahead.
Why are you telling me this?

976
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:24,079
And why did you come into my room?

977
01:20:26,439 --> 01:20:27,529
Well,

978
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,569
I can't take off my shirt.
My wound hurts.

979
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:35,199
How did you manage to put it on?

980
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,529
I don't know. I was in a hurry.

981
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,439
Sit down gently then.

982
01:20:58,569 --> 01:21:00,199
Raise your arms slowly.

983
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,279
Raise your arms slowly.

984
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,680
Keep flexing your arm.

985
01:22:03,239 --> 01:22:04,760
Got it!

986
01:22:09,529 --> 01:22:11,319
Are you happy that you're
able to take off a guy's shirt?

987
01:22:12,529 --> 01:22:13,609
Jerk.

988
01:22:24,569 --> 01:22:27,319
Artit, you can get
in the shower now.

989
01:22:30,199 --> 01:22:31,279
What's wrong?

990
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:34,720
Are you embarrassed?

991
01:22:38,649 --> 01:22:40,529
Who's wouldn't be embarrassed

992
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:42,569
if a guy took their clothes off
in front of them?

993
01:22:44,609 --> 01:22:47,079
You weren't in the past.

994
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:56,439
What are you doing?

995
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,880
Helping you put on a shirt.

996
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:05,439
I'll help you. No need
to be embarrassed.

997
01:23:05,529 --> 01:23:07,680
I can do it myself.

998
01:23:15,609 --> 01:23:16,880
Artit!

999
01:23:17,529 --> 01:23:19,720
Is it so much fun
pulling pranks on me?

1000
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:23,680
Hold on! Hold on!

1001
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,000
I won't prank you anymore.

1002
01:23:26,439 --> 01:23:27,529
I'm sorry.

1003
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:39,279
Does your wound hurt?

1004
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:43,399
It doesn't hurt anymore

1005
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:45,119
knowing that you worried about me.

1006
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:51,960
I'm happy that you're
worried about me.

1007
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:54,800
Then come and stay
with me after this.

1008
01:23:56,359 --> 01:23:57,439
Okay.

1009
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,000
Paeng,

1010
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:08,159
what are you thinking about?

1011
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:11,399
Nothing.

1012
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:14,649
So can you take a shower now?

1013
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:20,359
I forgot.

1014
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,680
I guess I can only have
a sponge bath.

1015
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,800
Oh, you can do that yourself?

1016
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,960
Why? Are you going to do it for me?

1017
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,680
Well, if you can't.
Then I'll do it for you.

1018
01:24:44,529 --> 01:24:45,609
Uh...

1019
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,239
I think I'll do it myself.

1020
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:51,840
How come?

1021
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,359
You're embarrassed?

1022
01:24:57,279 --> 01:24:59,800
Artit, I can do it for you.

1023
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,529
It's okay. I'll do it.

1024
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:05,569
I told you I'll do it for you.

1025
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:07,479
- But...
- Don't be naughty.

1026
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:11,239
Sit down.

1027
01:25:24,609 --> 01:25:25,680
Hurry up.

1028
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,920
Are you done?

1029
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:32,319
Artit, what's wrong with you?
You keep complaining

1030
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:35,319
instead of being thankful
that I'm doing this for you.

1031
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:37,199
You wouldn't understand.

1032
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:42,199
I won't understand a
high-maintenance person like you.

1033
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,609
You're a whiner like me.

1034
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:50,880
I'm with you, so I have
to get better at arguing.

1035
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:01,119
I'm sorry. I'll be gentle.

1036
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:20,199
I want to kiss you again.

1037
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:29,760
I'm here to take care of you

1038
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:31,960
and now you're being cheeky.

1039
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,960
Your muscles make my heart race.

1040
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:53,569
Do you want to kiss me?

1041
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,399
A prank for a prank.
We have to get even.

1042
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:44,359
Uh...

1043
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:48,039
You seduced me first.

1044
01:27:49,399 --> 01:27:51,479
But if you want to get even,
you can kiss me back.

1045
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:55,560
- Artit!
- Hmm?

1046
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,720
You're so pig-headed!

1047
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,119
Paeng, stop!

1048
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,079
Stop! Stop!

1049
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:07,399
No! Don't!

1050
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:10,359
Artit! You think you're so tough!

1051
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,880
- Don't!
- You said you're going to stop!

1052
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,800
You're pranking me, aren't you?

1053
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,239
Enough! Enough!

1054
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,039
- Okay.
- You can't raise that arm, right?

1055
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,159
- Artit!
- You called him. Do you miss him?

1056
01:28:34,279 --> 01:28:37,119
You toyed with my feelings.
You must be very satisfied.

1057
01:28:37,239 --> 01:28:38,600
It must be very fun for you.

1058
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,319
Paeng should be with me and not you.

1059
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,760
You don't hate me anymore?

1060
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,359
I've stopped hating you
for a while now.

1061
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:53,159
What other surprises do you have?

1062
01:28:53,239 --> 01:28:54,319
This is just the beginning.

1063
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:56,439
Can you love me again?

1064
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,640
If you don't tell me,
I'll find the answer myself.

1065
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,600
Don't be afraid.
I won't let go of your hand.

1066
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:04,479
I will be here

1067
01:29:05,079 --> 01:29:06,199
to protect you.

1068
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,079
Tubtim, I think you've gone too far.
