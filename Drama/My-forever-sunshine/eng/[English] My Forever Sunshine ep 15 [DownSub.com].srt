1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,840
Paeng.

3
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,400
I met him here at the hospital.

4
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,960
He followed you here?

5
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,599
I will get evidence

6
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,719
and find out who shot me

7
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,960
and kidnapped Paeng.

8
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,879
Let me sleep a little longer.

9
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,599
Let go of my hand.

10
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,680
You really hated me.

11
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,479
I was. But now

12
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,680
I don't hate you anymore.

13
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,960
Who's wouldn't be embarrassed

14
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,439
if a guy took their clothes off
in front of them?

15
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,280
Your muscles

16
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,439
make my heart race.

17
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,800
Do you want to kiss me?

18
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,919
Kot, Non.

19
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,960
I called the police this evening.

20
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,680
What did they say?

21
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,879
The culprit

22
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,680
definitely works for Dandin.

23
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,120
So the cops can arrest him now?

24
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,360
Not yet.

25
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,520
Even though they know
who the culprit is,

26
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,080
but they haven't captured him yet.

27
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,039
Dandin claimed that he's fired him
ages ago due to a problem.

28
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,879
He told the police that
this guy framed him.

29
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,439
How could it end up that way?

30
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,199
And the cops believed him?

31
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,759
They probably believed him
due to the evidence they have.

32
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,080
Because there's no
incriminating evidence yet.

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,120
And Mark was also shot.

34
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,520
I think

35
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,439
Dandin and Mark
are involved in this.

36
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,400
But if they did this
because of the mining conflict,

37
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,280
why didn't they deal
with you directly?

38
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,560
Why did they take it out on Paeng?

39
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,240
Or maybe they thought you and Paeng

40
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,610
are together.

41
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,360
That's why they went for her.

42
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,279
I think Dandin is involved as well.

43
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,050
But I think Mark is the person
who planned that.

44
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,480
What do you mean?

45
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,800
I can't say for certain,
It's just a hunch.

46
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,439
Do you feel that

47
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,959
he's unusually targeting Paeng?

48
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,000
That's right.

49
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,399
Is he crazy enough to shoot himself?

50
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,240
It's possible.

51
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,680
Hey.

52
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,639
If what Artit said is true,

53
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,959
Mark is worse than we thought.

54
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,120
Would he go that far?

55
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,680
Who's crazy enough to shoot himself?

56
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,839
And Paeng isn't suspicious?

57
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,199
He's cunning. She won't be able
to keep up with his game.

58
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,639
That's why I brought her here.

59
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,639
Artit,

60
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,560
if you're scared
that she's in danger,

61
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,759
you can just ask the police
for protection.

62
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,319
Or you can tell me,
I'll protect her.

63
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,920
Kot, I don't trust you.

64
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,560
Really?

65
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,079
It's you, actually.

66
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,439
You can't be trusted about Paeng
the most. You're a danger.

67
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,839
You're so hot and cold.

68
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,360
Kot, if you don't know
then don't say anything.

69
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,439
Non.

70
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,439
Please help me keep tabs on Mark.

71
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,480
I have to go now.

72
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,040
Non, did I say something wrong?

73
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,000
He's such an angel
when he's nice to her.

74
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,879
And such a devil when he's mean.

75
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,160
Isn't he? Don't you think so?

76
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,240
Right. You're clever. You're good.

77
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,360
Right? I know I'm good.

78
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,800
- That's right.
- See?

79
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,560
Artit, you can go to bed now.

80
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,720
Let me watch TV with you.

81
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,439
Are you okay?

82
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,920
I just want to watch TV with you.

83
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,120
Artit,

84
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,560
you're mocking me, aren't you?

85
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,679
You're trying to embarrass me.

86
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,279
You did everything

87
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,210
because you want me to
feel embarrassed, don't you?

88
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,960
You're being very mean.

89
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,960
It's not fun.

90
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm not doing anything.

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,090
But

92
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,799
I feel

93
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,450
like I'm burning up.

94
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,000
Artit, I'm speaking.

95
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,450
You don't listen to me at all.

96
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,090
Take my temperature.

97
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,279
No.

98
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,399
You really are burning up.

99
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,279
It's probably because I'm sleep
deprived and got too much sun.

100
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,960
Are you getting a fever?

101
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,159
Is it because

102
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,960
your wound is infected?

103
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,919
I don't think so.

104
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,210
What if it is?
What are we going to do?

105
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,159
Did you bring any medicine?

106
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,759
What are we going to do?

107
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,639
I'll go and rest.

108
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,759
I might feel better
once I get some sleep.

109
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,360
Artit,

110
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,039
get up right now.

111
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,039
Artit!

112
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,679
Artit!

113
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,720
You're driving me crazy.

114
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,159
You got up early. You couldn't
sleep, could you?

115
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,159
Mmm.

116
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,159
Stop being angry with him.

117
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,159
My son defied me.

118
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,720
Right. This old mom probably
doesn't mean anything to him.

119
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,440
That's why no one listens to me.

120
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,080
You're exaggerating.

121
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,879
I think you should stop
being angry with him.

122
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,679
Let him rest.

123
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,720
He's recovered.
He should be okay now.

124
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,279
Instead of coming home to let me
or Nang take care of him,

125
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,799
wouldn't you be upset?

126
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,039
Who did he go with?

127
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,440
He went by himself.

128
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,840
Oh, dear.

129
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,840
That's even more worrying.
He doesn't have any company.

130
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,600
You're overthinking things.

131
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,720
Just let him be.

132
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,399
He's already grown up.
He can take care of himself.

133
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,320
And if he wants someone
to take care of him,

134
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,679
just let him choose.

135
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,679
What are you talking about?

136
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,440
It's just a general statement.

137
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,200
You're saying strange things.

138
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,360
If he had someone,
I wouldn't be so upset.

139
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,799
- How come?
- I'm afraid it'll be Paeng.

140
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
What if

141
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,360
he actually chose Paeng?

142
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,679
Oh, my.

143
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,279
Why are you saying inauspicious
things like that?

144
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,679
I'm telling you.

145
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm not having her as
my in-law no matter what.

146
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,279
- How frustrating!
- Why?

147
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm going.

148
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,919
- Are you tired? Have some water.
- Thank you.

149
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,440
There are two of us
but only one glass.

150
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,320
Do it yourself.

151
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,840
Whoa.

152
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:40,159
I'm so envious of the lovely couple.

153
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,399
When will I find my soulmate?

154
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,240
Kot, take it easy.

155
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,000
Your soulmate might come
to you without you knowing.

156
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,120
- Whoa.
- Right?

157
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,759
You're so cheesy.

158
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,200
What a waste of time.
I'm going to go make a sale.

159
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,559
My very first kiss!

160
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,320
It's not true!

161
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,559
My very first kiss!

162
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,320
Kot, you jerk!

163
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,200
It should be me who's screaming!

164
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,240
My very first kiss!

165
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,960
My very first kiss!

166
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,399
Are you crazy?

167
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,639
What are you laughing about?

168
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,759
Kot, you jerk!

169
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,320
That was my first kiss!

170
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,120
You're so loud! Shut up!

171
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,519
Paeng?

172
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,159
Paeng, are you up yet?

173
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,320
Paeng?

174
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,159
Pick up, Paeng.

175
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,480
Come on.

176
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,559
I'm here. I'm with Artit.

177
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,320
I'm sorry for not visiting you.

178
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,240
That's right. He brought me here
all of a sudden.

179
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,159
So I didn't have time to prepare.

180
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,200
Mark,

181
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,039
please don't follow me.

182
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,960
We should meet when I get back.

183
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,159
Right now?

184
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,759
Artit!

185
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,519
Have you gone crazy?

186
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,920
I should be the one
who has to say that.

187
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,960
Did you tell him where we are?

188
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,240
Well, he asked.

189
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,440
Stop being so nice to him.

190
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,650
Have you gone crazy?

191
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,720
Why did you have
to throw my phone away?

192
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,000
You think because you bought
it for me

193
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,680
that you can do anything you want?

194
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,480
I called you because I'm worried.

195
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,119
But you didn't answer.

196
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,759
You called him. Do you miss him?

197
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,680
He called me. I didn't call him.

198
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,890
Don't lie to me.

199
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,759
How did he get your number?

200
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,720
He got it from Aueng.

201
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,839
Because I called her yesterday.

202
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,319
He came on to my farm?

203
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,119
He wouldn't set his foot there.

204
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,559
But he bumped into Aueng
at the market.

205
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,839
He's trying everything!

206
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,599
Paeng,

207
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,170
I'm sorry. I misunderstood you.

208
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,960
I'm happy

209
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,079
that your brain has recovered.

210
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,839
This is the real you.

211
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,559
Not the person from yesterday.

212
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,279
Paeng.

213
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,799
Paeng!

214
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,319
Artit!

215
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,759
Have you gone crazy?

216
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,799
You called him. Do you miss him?

217
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,000
He called me. I didn't call him.

218
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,279
Don't lie to me!

219
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,319
Hello?

220
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,079
I stayed somewhere
in the vicinity before.

221
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,119
Where are you staying?

222
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,680
I'm at...

223
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,559
It's very beautiful over there.

224
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,799
I'd like to visit there
again sometime.

225
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,240
Your food is ready.

226
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,319
Why is it just one serving?

227
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,319
I've already eaten.

228
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,039
If you hate me, you don't have
to cook for me.

229
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,200
I can separate

230
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,839
work

231
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,400
and personal matters.

232
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,839
Paeng. Paeng.

233
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:48,599
I did that
because I'm worried about you.

234
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,799
You think he's the culprit

235
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,640
even though I told you
that he went to help you.

236
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,519
I admit that I'm biased.

237
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,559
Everyone sees him through.
He's not a good person.

238
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,680
You judge people with your feelings.

239
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,720
It's very narrow-minded of you.

240
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,960
Mark might seem untrustworthy
in your eyes.

241
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,400
But it doesn't mean
that he's an evil person.

242
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,359
Okay, okay.

243
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,759
Then let's wait and see, okay?

244
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,880
Have it your way.

245
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,079
And why are you angry with me?

246
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,359
I'm not.

247
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,720
I'm just disappointed.

248
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,759
When are we going back?

249
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,960
Not until we talk things through.

250
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:56,200
We don't have anything else
to talk about.

251
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,920
I took care of you

252
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,359
because I'm the reason you're hurt.

253
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,599
As for when you...

254
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,759
pretended to be nice

255
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,519
and worried about me

256
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,680
so that I'd feel bad,

257
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,119
you've already succeeded.

258
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,200
You toyed with my feelings.

259
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,039
You must be very satisfied.

260
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,359
It must've been fun, right?

261
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,160
If you're satisfied now,

262
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,759
I'm begging you.

263
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,440
Please take me home.

264
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,000
Paeng.

265
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,119
Let me know when you're ready.

266
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,720
Hello.

267
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,039
Ling, it's me.

268
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,759
Artit?

269
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,359
That's right. I haven't added
your new number to my phone yet.

270
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,200
Ling,

271
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,960
I need to consult you
about something.

272
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,599
About what?

273
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,640
Making up with someone.
How do I do it?

274
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,680
- About Paeng, right?
- Mmm.

275
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,279
That's the one thing you've failed.

276
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,079
What's so funny?

277
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,200
Women

278
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,480
don't need much.

279
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:05,680
They just want men to listen
to what they say,

280
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,400
to understand what they want.

281
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,200
If you can't do that

282
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,319
then be reasonable and talk

283
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,160
and don't let emotions overcome you.

284
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,880
I tried to listen
but she wouldn't listen to me.

285
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,359
I'm guessing

286
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,359
you forced her to listen
to you, didn't you?

287
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:29,839
A little bit.

288
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,200
Try letting things go naturally.

289
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,960
Don't go against her feelings.

290
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,440
Things might get better.

291
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,359
I think

292
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,359
I'll have to stay for two more weeks
until she can open up her heart.

293
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,680
See? I just told you.

294
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,480
You're forcing her again.

295
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,359
Have you asked her
if she even wants to stay?

296
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,960
I have to make her want to stay.

297
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,200
Thanks, Ling. I have an idea now.

298
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,000
Paeng,

299
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,240
pack your things.

300
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,319
Come again?

301
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,480
Don't you want to go back?

302
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,880
Artit, I'll drive.

303
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,359
It's okay. I'll drive myself.

304
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,319
What's wrong?

305
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,960
What are you angry at me
for this time?

306
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,440
Nothing.

307
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,279
Let's go.

308
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,400
Paeng should be with me

309
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,960
and not you.

310
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,359
Hey! What? Go around!

311
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,839
Hey!

312
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,279
Artit,

313
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,119
I thought you said we're going
home. Where are we going?

314
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,759
We're almost there.

315
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,839
Where is "there?"

316
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,960
Are you angry with me?

317
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,759
Do I even have the right to be?

318
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,359
Artit, haven't you had enough fun?

319
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,440
Rather than of taking me home.

320
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,119
I have work to do.

321
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,519
And you, you're injured
but you refuse to rest.

322
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,519
Instead you drive away
to another place.

323
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,920
Do you have so much time
on your hands?

324
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,519
Are you done talking?

325
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,480
If you are, then get out of the car.

326
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,640
How am I going to get home
if I get out here?

327
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,839
What are you playing at?

328
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,920
Come on, get out of the car.

329
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,160
Alright. I'll get out.

330
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,799
Little Miss?

331
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,319
Jaem!

332
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,880
My dear Jaem!

333
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,440
Little Miss!

334
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,640
Jaem!

335
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,440
Are you doing okay?

336
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,799
I'm okay.

337
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,960
I've missed you so much.

338
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,519
I've missed you too.

339
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh?

340
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,559
- Hello.
- Hello.

341
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:45,119
How come you're with Mr. Artit?

342
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,680
Did you reconcile with each other?

343
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,240
Not yet.

344
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,160
Come inside. You must've
driven quite the distance.

345
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,440
Please.

346
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,160
Come on.

347
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,200
Jaem, I'm sorry I didn't come to
your husband's funeral.

348
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,200
It's okay.

349
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
I didn't want to bother you,
that's why I didn't contact you.

350
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,920
Don't say that.

351
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,640
You've always taken care of me.

352
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,960
You've always been there for me
when things were tough.

353
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,279
I'd like to repay you some time.

354
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,960
If there's anything I can help
you with, I'd like to do it.

355
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,799
It really is okay.

356
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,160
Jaem,

357
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,720
from now on, don't feel like you're
bothering me again.

358
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,599
Just tell me if there's
anything. Okay?

359
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,119
- Okay, Little Miss.
- Pinkie promise.

360
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,240
Okay.

361
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,200
Here.

362
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,160
There!

363
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,720
Okay.

364
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,960
Jaem, you're not alone anymore.

365
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,519
You have me.

366
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,289
My Little Miss.

367
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,769
Jaem!

368
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,960
It's alright. I'm okay.

369
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,960
Jaem,

370
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm here to visit you.

371
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:25,480
How can I let you make an effort
to take care of me?

372
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,440
- I'll do it myself.
- Okay.

373
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,400
How are you feeling?

374
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,920
I'm fine now.

375
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,360
Have you had the pain long?

376
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,519
You're all alone now.
Aren't you lonely?

377
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,719
Do you want to come live with me?

378
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:55,329
I'll take care of you.

379
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,559
I don't want to burden you.

380
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,920
Jaem,

381
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,920
you're like my family.

382
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,440
I only have you and Aueng left.

383
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,809
Let me take care of you in return.

384
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,199
Little Miss,

385
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:12,719
I've left home for many years.

386
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,400
I missed home.

387
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:16,599
I don't want to go anywhere anymore.

388
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,289
I'm happy to live here.

389
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:23,360
It warms my heart being here.

390
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:27,119
Please don't be worried about me.

391
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,119
You don't love me anymore.

392
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:34,000
I love you the most, Little Miss.

393
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,920
Don't think like that again.

394
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,719
Okay. From now on
I'll come and visit more often.

395
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,239
Excellent.

396
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,719
Artit.

397
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:15,840
Hmm?

398
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,809
Can I stay here tonight?

399
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,360
I want to be with Jaem.

400
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,809
Of course.

401
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,769
Thank you!

402
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,440
Little Miss, it's hot in here.
Stay outside.

403
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,719
It's okay. I want to help you.

404
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,769
Go and look after Artit.

405
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,239
We don't know what he's doing.

406
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,769
He has to sleep somewhere
unfamiliar too.

407
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,599
Jaem,

408
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:09,920
he dragged me around
and still I'm okay with that.

409
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,679
Little Miss, you can't do that.

410
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:17,039
Artit drove a long way
to bring you here.

411
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,039
You're not being very nice.

412
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,159
Just think of it as though you're
looking after him for me.

413
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:31,559
Okay, I'll look after him.

414
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,480
Where's he gone to?

415
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,289
What are you doing?

416
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,960
Fixing the steps.

417
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,119
But your wound hasn't
completely healed yet.

418
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,079
It doesn't hurt anymore.
This is easy.

419
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,239
Thank you.

420
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,039
Paeng,

421
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:20,039
can you get me a 1.5-inch nail?

422
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,769
This one?

423
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,480
No.

424
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,559
This?

425
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,599
Paeng, I need a nail, not a screw.

426
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,039
This one?

427
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,119
That's only one inch.

428
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,920
This?

429
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,719
- Correct!
- Yes!

430
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,289
Here you go.

431
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:14,119
Paeng, go and do something else.
I can handle this.

432
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:17,679
Just tell me what you need
and I'll get it for you.

433
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:19,679
Your wound might hurt
if you go back and forth.

434
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,360
Are you going to help me
until I'm done?

435
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,329
Yes.

436
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,400
These are nails, aren't they?

437
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,679
Here. Some spares.

438
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,599
The food is here. I made it myself.

439
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,679
Didn't Jaem make it?

440
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,809
I made these two.

441
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,440
I didn't know that you
don't eat spicy food.

442
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:02,079
But Paeng remembered
so she made more.

443
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,599
These two

444
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:05,880
are especially for you.

445
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,360
It just felt familiar.
I didn't remember it.

446
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,769
Is it edible?

447
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,360
Are you insulting me?

448
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:18,119
That's why you wouldn't eat when I
cooked for you this afternoon.

449
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,880
I didn't want to eat because
you thought it was your duty.

450
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:24,440
I did my best this time.

451
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,639
Do you feel like it now?

452
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,239
I do.

453
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,840
Are you okay with these?
They're all home-style dishes.

454
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,719
They're all my favorites.

455
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,599
Then dig in.

456
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,639
Here. I'll help you.

457
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,599
Let me help you with that.

458
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:11,079
You're here too.

459
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:13,159
I just shooed Little Miss away.

460
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,000
It's okay. I can do it.

461
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,880
Please let me help.
I'll feel better this way.

462
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,199
Okay, then.

463
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:30,519
You're all alone.
You don't have any children?

464
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:32,840
Well,

465
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,400
I have three.

466
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,480
I have a grandchild from the eldest.

467
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,440
I used to help raise him.

468
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,360
But

469
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,519
the parents already took him back.

470
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,559
And where are they now?

471
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,119
Why did they let you
live here alone?

472
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:51,840
They just live their only lives.

473
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:55,329
Aren't you lonely?

474
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,639
I didn't get to raise
my children much.

475
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,239
I was busy working.

476
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,159
Earning money their tuition.

477
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,159
Nowadays,

478
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,769
I have the time

479
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,809
but they don't.

480
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,769
But I understand.

481
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:24,840
A child is always the most important
part of a mother's life.

482
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:30,559
I can only wait and see if someday

483
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:33,880
one of my children will visit me.

484
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,599
But do you know

485
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:50,199
that the wait

486
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,599
is also a mother's happiness?

487
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,360
I see.

488
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,079
Can I sit with you?

489
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,599
The atmosphere here is so
simple and heartwarming.

490
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,480
I really like it.

491
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:52,760
Thank you

492
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,480
for bringing me to see Jaem.

493
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:59,559
I'd like to apologize to you too

494
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,119
for throwing a fit at you.

495
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,599
I didn't know where
you were taking me.

496
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,159
And

497
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,480
how did you know
where Jaem's house is?

498
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,360
I asked Aueng.

499
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,440
Why did you bring me here?

500
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,440
I figured you probably missed
and wanted to see Jaem.

501
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,239
How did you know?

502
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,599
You're asking so many questions.

503
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,480
Well, I want to know.

504
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,679
If people can be with someone

505
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,360
who understands them,
they'll be happy.

506
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,039
Don't you agree?

507
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,320
That's true.

508
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,719
I'm so happy to get to see Jaem.

509
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:47,800
What?

510
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:07,679
Paeng! Paeng!

511
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,800
Paeng, what's wrong?

512
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:15,159
The water's cold!

513
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,400
Gosh!

514
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,760
You frightened me!

515
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:23,960
Well, the water's so cold.
I couldn't help but scream.

516
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,960
It will be cold if you pour it
over yourself.

517
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,519
What are you doing?

518
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:39,519
I haven't even washed myself yet.

519
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:41,320
Wait for a bit, okay?

520
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,280
It's warm now.

521
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,400
Thank you.

522
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,320
Artit,

523
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:17,000
go inside so I can wash myself.

524
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,360
Go ahead. I'll keep an eye
out for you.

525
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,079
Huh?

526
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,039
I'll close my eyes, then.

527
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:35,719
I'll turn my back to you.

528
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,119
Artit,

529
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:40,880
you can go inside now.

530
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,559
Come on.

531
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,400
I boiled you some water.

532
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,880
You're asking me to be grateful?

533
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:52,559
There!

534
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,440
Go now! Get inside!

535
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,559
There!

536
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,039
- Go!
- So I shouldn't keep an eye out?

537
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,800
No need. Get back inside.

538
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:03,719
Alright.

539
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,840
Uh...

540
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:38,440
I'm sorry. My house is rather small.

541
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,039
It's okay. I can sleep here.

542
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:44,719
The blankets aren't enough either.
I wasn't expecting any guests.

543
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,039
Are you sure you'll be
able to sleep?

544
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,559
I like it when it's cold anyway.

545
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,159
Don't worry. You and Paeng
can head off to bed.

546
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,159
Artit, are you really going
to be able to sleep here?

547
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,719
Why? Are you worried?

548
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,159
Of course I am.

549
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:10,360
Knowing that you're worried
has already warmed me up.

550
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:18,760
I'm going to bed then.

551
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,360
Jaem,

552
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,519
you can go to bed. Don't worry.

553
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,679
Okay.

554
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,840
Oh?

555
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:01,760
Hey.

556
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:03,719
Paeng,

557
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,519
why are you here?

558
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,559
I came to see you.

559
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,920
You haven't gone to sleep yet.

560
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:15,360
You're cold, aren't you?

561
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:18,239
A little.

562
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:20,679
Here.

563
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,840
Paeng,

564
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,039
what about you?

565
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,400
I don't want you to get sick.

566
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,440
And it's warmer inside.

567
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,480
Keep it for yourself.
Don't worry about me.

568
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:45,840
I'm a guy.
I'm much stronger than you.

569
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:52,840
I'm happy

570
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:55,320
that we can talk nicely.

571
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,320
I'd like to thank you as well

572
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,920
for everything you've done for me.

573
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,559
Even though I don't know
the reasons,

574
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:11,760
I'm very grateful.

575
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:15,800
Well, are you happy?

576
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,559
If you are, I'll keep
doing what I'm doing.

577
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,199
Can you tell me the reason why?

578
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,000
Do you really want to know?

579
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,559
I do.

580
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:44,320
Uhh...

581
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,039
Let's just say that
I've done everything

582
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:50,960
without any hidden motives,

583
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:54,000
trickeries,

584
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,920
or pranks behind it.

585
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:00,239
Artit,

586
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,480
you don't hate me anymore.

587
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,239
I haven't hated you for a while now.

588
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,559
Thank you, Artit.

589
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,079
I'll go to bed then.

590
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,079
- Here.
- Hold on.

591
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,719
Thank you for worrying about me.

592
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,559
I'll put the blankets on your bed.

593
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:24,639
What are you looking at, Mr. Artit?

594
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:27,960
Whose boat is that?

595
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,480
It was my husband's.

596
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,639
I'm okay.

597
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,119
It's good to talk about the past.

598
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:46,719
He really loved the river.

599
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,000
He told me that when he died,

600
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:51,360
I should scatter his ashes
in the river.

601
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,760
But I haven't done so yet.

602
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:56,639
Why not?

603
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,559
I don't know how to drive a boat.

604
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,599
I've fulfilled my promise.

605
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,440
Thank you for always being with me.

606
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,119
If reincarnation exists,

607
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,519
I hope to see you again.

608
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,360
Rest in peace.

609
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:53,639
Let me be with him for a bit.

610
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,000
Of course.

611
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:10,320
What are you thinking?

612
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,360
I'm thinking

613
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:18,400
if anything happened to me,

614
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,840
would anyone be sad?

615
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:23,599
Don't say that.

616
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,800
You shouldn't joke
around about death.

617
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:29,639
Are you going to be sad?

618
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:31,719
Come on.

619
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,599
I won't let anything happen to you.

620
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:38,320
That's all I wanted to hear.

621
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:53,440
Artit's really lovely.

622
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,440
He's lovely when he's nice.

623
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,840
But when he's mean,
he's really mean.

624
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,960
I can see how he feels about you.

625
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:06,559
But what I want to know

626
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:08,559
is how you feel about him.

627
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,280
I don't dare to have
any feelings for him.

628
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,719
Little Miss, do you know

629
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:20,360
when the best time of our lives is?

630
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,639
It's childhood, isn't it?

631
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,639
I remember I was so happy back then.

632
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:30,599
No, it's not.

633
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,320
But it's today,

634
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,119
right here and right now.

635
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,559
Because it's the only time

636
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,880
that we know what our heart desires

637
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:45,400
and what we want to do.

638
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:47,760
There's no past, no future.

639
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,480
Just the present.

640
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,519
I want you to let
your heart lead you.

641
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,880
Don't hang on to anything.

642
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:03,159
And you'll find the happiest
moment of your life.

643
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,880
It's me, Dad.

644
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,880
- Artit?
- Hmm?

645
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:19,760
Yes.

646
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:21,960
Mom's with you, right?

647
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,800
- She is.
- Can I speak to her?

648
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,199
Are you sure you want to do that?

649
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:29,639
You can put me on speaker
if you want.

650
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:34,519
Artit wants to talk to you.

651
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,079
Really?

652
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:38,159
Artit, is that you?

653
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:41,440
You should come home now.

654
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:43,239
I'll see you tomorrow.

655
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:45,679
Artit, you can't keep doing this.

656
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,280
I don't want this anymore.

657
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,039
I'll bring you to the temple
for prosperity.

658
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:53,039
To cleanse him of misfortunes?

659
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:55,039
That's right. So I'll feel relieved.

660
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,639
Cleanse yourself
of misfortunes a bit, okay?

661
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,039
Of course.

662
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,199
I'll do anything you want me to.

663
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:04,679
But there's one thing
I'd like to ask of you.

664
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,920
Whatever it is just say it?
I can do anything for you.

665
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,559
I want Paeng to come back
and stay at our house.

666
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,480
What does this have to do with her?

667
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,199
Artit, you don't hate me anymore.

668
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,440
I haven't hated you for a while now.

669
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:56,960
I can see how he feels about you.

670
00:59:57,559 --> 00:59:59,440
But what I want to know

671
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,639
is how you feel about him.

672
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,960
Is Paeng with Artit?

673
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,719
Oh, dear.

674
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,599
How could you let this happen?

675
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,599
I can't. I have to bring Artit back.

676
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,880
- Tubtim, I won't let you.
- Hey.

677
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,440
Give me the phone now.

678
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,719
How can you let him be alone
with her? What if something happens?

679
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,960
I don't want to think about it.

680
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,360
Tubtim, he said he's coming back.

681
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,960
What if she tricks him
and stops him from coming back.

682
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,400
Our son is not five anymore.

683
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,559
Anyway, once they got back,

684
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,000
there'll be trouble.

685
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,679
Don't you dare.

686
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,599
Are you worried about Miss Paeng?

687
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,719
She's been gone for a while now.

688
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,480
So I was thinking I'd go
look for her.

689
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,440
I'm happy that
you're worried about her.

690
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,960
I'm glad.

691
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:29,039
Did you know that when
you had your accident,

692
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:31,760
she couldn't eat or sleep?

693
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:34,159
She felt extremely guilty

694
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:36,320
for causing the accident.

695
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:43,480
How was she during that time?

696
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,320
A little girl like that

697
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,599
losing her parents suddenly.

698
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:52,519
When it came to my husband,
I had prepared myself for a while.

699
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,480
Still, I could barely handle
the grief.

700
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,039
She's so strong.

701
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:02,239
Not really.

702
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,400
She's tough but soft on the inside.

703
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:08,159
She acted up

704
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,199
because she wanted
to defend herself.

705
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:14,360
She's actually very scared.

706
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,119
She wouldn't go back
to her own home.

707
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,960
Aueng and I tried to convince her,

708
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:23,920
but she wouldn't go.

709
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,880
She insisted to stay at your place.

710
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:30,519
She must've been very scared.

711
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,239
That's why she clung
to you so tightly.

712
01:02:35,239 --> 01:02:37,159
Then that day happened.

713
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,920
I can't really blame Paeng for it.

714
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,280
The person who was at fault
that day was me.

715
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,679
I was drunk and drove away
without any second thoughts.

716
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,199
But my Little Miss was still
the reason why you did that.

717
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,480
Did she feel really guilty?

718
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,079
That's right.

719
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:09,440
Thank you for telling me.

720
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,599
I'll help her get over the guilt
from that day.

721
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,519
I want Paeng to come back
and stay at our house.

722
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,239
No way!

723
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:53,280
I won't allow her to be
in our house.

724
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,679
It's more than enough
letting her stay on our farm.

725
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:55,119
Artit,

726
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:56,800
did you follow me?

727
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,840
My eyes are bad. I can't see
the needle hole properly.

728
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:39,679
Please help me sew it up.

729
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,920
Of course. It's easy.

730
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,960
I'll help you. Here.

731
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,519
Okay.

732
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,400
Jaem?

733
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:06,239
Jaem?

734
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,880
Artit?

735
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:16,920
Artit?

736
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:23,280
Whoa.

737
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,880
Food's ready.

738
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,440
You...

739
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,679
Where did you get all the ornaments?

740
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,679
From inside Jaem's house.

741
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,119
Jaem and her husband
must've been very romantic.

742
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:03,639
Here.

743
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,360
I think...

744
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,039
Don't talk while you're eating.

745
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,960
Eat up.

746
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,400
Are there any other surprises?

747
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,199
This is just the beginning.

748
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,239
Do you know when the best time of
our lives is?

749
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,119
It's childhood, isn't it?

750
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,119
I remember I was so happy back then.

751
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:05,599
No, it's not.

752
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:08,199
But it's today,

753
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,639
right here and right now.

754
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:12,960
Because it's the only time

755
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,880
that we know what our heart desires

756
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:17,569
and what we want to do.

757
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,960
There's no past, no future.

758
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,199
The sunset

759
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,569
and you right now

760
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,800
are so similar.

761
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:41,239
How so?

762
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,439
You seem warm

763
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,359
like the sun in the evening.

764
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,609
I've always been like this.

765
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,319
You just didn't see it.

766
01:08:55,079 --> 01:08:57,720
You? Did you
misunderstand something?

767
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,720
You never see me in a good light.

768
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,279
You didn't know yourself.

769
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,239
What do you mean? What am I like?

770
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,960
Don't get me started.

771
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,479
Just tell me. I want to
know what you think.

772
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,039
So I can improve. Isn't that good?

773
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:21,279
Previously,

774
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,609
you were like the summer sun

775
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,079
in April.

776
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,960
Huh?

777
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,159
Really.

778
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:35,760
Probably around 45 °C.

779
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:37,960
You were always scorching.

780
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:39,760
It was so scary.

781
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,399
You're making me look bad.

782
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,199
Well, it's true.

783
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:49,159
You really were scared
of me, weren't you?

784
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,649
I'm not anymore.

785
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,159
I'm happy with how you've
treated me.

786
01:10:02,529 --> 01:10:03,609
Why?

787
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,960
Because I want to atone for it.

788
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,399
What if I say

789
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:20,760
that you've atoned for everything?

790
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,039
I've moved on from the past.

791
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:31,119
And I don't want you to blame
yourself anymore.

792
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:34,529
Just forget about it.

793
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:38,720
Can you really forget?

794
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:42,529
Of course.

795
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,760
Paeng,

796
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:49,800
let's start over.

797
01:10:52,529 --> 01:10:54,840
Start over? How?

798
01:10:57,239 --> 01:10:59,880
Well, what would you like me to be?

799
01:11:04,529 --> 01:11:05,609
I...

800
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,199
I want us to feel

801
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,439
like we're siblings again.

802
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:14,569
And

803
01:11:16,569 --> 01:11:18,880
I won't have any feelings
for you anymore.

804
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,079
That's all you want?

805
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:32,199
Yes.

806
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:37,529
What if I don't want that?

807
01:11:44,609 --> 01:11:47,439
I want you to love me again.

808
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:00,239
I wouldn't dare to love you again.

809
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:04,359
Why not?

810
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,960
I've learned my lessons.

811
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,960
I almost killed you.

812
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:18,960
I made everyone hate me.

813
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,279
I don't want to go through
that again.

814
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:26,439
Paeng,

815
01:12:27,159 --> 01:12:28,960
the situation is different now.

816
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:31,800
Right here, right now,

817
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:33,800
I don't see you
like I used to anymore.

818
01:12:37,529 --> 01:12:38,609
Paeng,

819
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:41,649
I promise that those things
won't happen again.

820
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:45,960
I'm really scared.

821
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,960
Do you know

822
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,649
before I got through it,

823
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:55,880
I thought about you

824
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,199
every night before bed?

825
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:00,569
Are you going to die?

826
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:02,479
Are you going to be handicapped?

827
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,079
Wait.

828
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,649
Why do you want me
to love you again?

829
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,760
Because

830
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,199
I think I like you.

831
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:30,159
No,

832
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:32,680
I think

833
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:37,239
I love you.

834
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,239
Can you love me again?

835
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:15,359
If you're not going to answer,

836
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:19,359
I'll find out myself.

837
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,960
You still love me.

838
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,279
I don't love you.

839
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:49,439
You do.

840
01:15:56,399 --> 01:15:57,800
I don't.

841
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:00,760
If you didn't,

842
01:16:01,569 --> 01:16:04,359
you would've slapped
or pushed me into the water.

843
01:16:21,529 --> 01:16:22,609
Paeng?

844
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,239
Paeng, what's wrong?

845
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,119
Paeng, it's just the fireworks.

846
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:42,319
Paeng.

847
01:17:12,569 --> 01:17:13,649
Fireworks?

848
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,960
That's right.

849
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,359
Where did you get them?

850
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:24,920
What are you doing?

851
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,039
Artit,

852
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,119
I'm scared.

853
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,079
Paeng,

854
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,359
when we're scared of something,

855
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,760
we have to confront it.

856
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,359
You have to try and fight it.

857
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:27,479
Paeng! Paeng!

858
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:29,529
Paeng!

859
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:14,199
Paeng,

860
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,359
don't be afraid.

861
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:19,800
I won't let go of your hand.

862
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,119
I'll be here

863
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,880
to protect you.

864
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:42,760
You don't have to be scared anymore.

865
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,039
See?

866
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,920
It's nothing.

867
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:16,439
Paeng, look.

868
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,079
Look at it.

869
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,960
Look at how beautiful the thing
you used to be scared of is.

870
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,720
Safe travels,
Little Miss, Mr. Artit.

871
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,960
Jaem, look after yourself.

872
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:41,319
If anything comes up,
you can call me anytime.

873
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:43,000
I'll visit you often.

874
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:46,319
Okay. You have to look
after yourself as well.

875
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,039
Please take care of her, Artit.

876
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:52,479
Jaem!

877
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:54,239
Don't worry.

878
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,119
I'll take care of her.

879
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:03,239
Come on.

880
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:05,399
Goodbye.

881
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,609
- Jaem, call me.
- I will.

882
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:32,319
Aueng,

883
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:35,800
pack-up Paeng's belongings.
I'll get Saeb to retrieve them.

884
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:37,119
Pardon?

885
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:39,840
Don't worry. Just do as I say.

886
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:41,760
Yes, certainly.

887
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:44,649
What are you doing?

888
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:46,569
Why are you moving my belongings?

889
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,569
I promised Jaem that
I'd take care of you.

890
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:52,800
I have to keep my word.

891
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:17,840
Do you want me to move here?

892
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,279
I want you to stay here for now.

893
01:23:22,279 --> 01:23:23,760
It should be safer than
where you were.

894
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:25,399
Artit,

895
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,880
I'm begging you,
please don't do this.

896
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:29,680
Paeng,

897
01:23:30,119 --> 01:23:31,800
I'd be worried

898
01:23:32,439 --> 01:23:33,569
if you stayed at the worker's house.

899
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:37,800
Don't be worried about me.

900
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:40,039
I don't want to be in trouble
with Auntie

901
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:42,529
or with anyone else.

902
01:23:45,529 --> 01:23:46,680
I'm ok with being in trouble.

903
01:23:48,199 --> 01:23:49,760
You're being selfish.

904
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,880
Paeng,

905
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:55,079
your kidnapping

906
01:23:55,159 --> 01:23:56,479
and me getting shot

907
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,039
are serious matters.

908
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,720
I can't trust anyone right now.

909
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:08,079
Because I don't know if the culprit
wants to get to me or you.

910
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,399
One day, if we catch the culprit

911
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:14,840
and then we can prove that either
Mark or Dandin isn't at fault,

912
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,159
I'll be able to rest assured.

913
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,039
So,

914
01:24:21,569 --> 01:24:22,880
you have to stay here for now.

915
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:31,529
Mr. Artit, here's the stuff
you ordered.

916
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,760
Thanks.

917
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,680
And don't tell anyone
that I'm back yet.

918
01:24:37,399 --> 01:24:38,479
Of course, sir.

919
01:24:38,649 --> 01:24:39,720
Hold on.

920
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:43,840
If you let it slip,
I'll deduct it your salary.

921
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,239
I won't let it slip, sir.

922
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,649
Why isn't Artit back yet?

923
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,000
Here. A phone.

924
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,039
Another one?

925
01:25:05,569 --> 01:25:06,960
I have to go to work now.

926
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:09,880
You can tidy things up

927
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,880
and get used to the house.
I already called Aueng.

928
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:15,359
But I still have a lot
of work to do.

929
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:17,119
I think I should go to work.

930
01:25:18,439 --> 01:25:20,609
Okay. Should I wait for you?

931
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:24,079
You can go ahead.
I can get there myself.

932
01:25:25,239 --> 01:25:27,319
I'll pick you up in the evening.

933
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:30,399
Artit,

934
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,920
can't I stay where I used to?

935
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,319
I've explained everything to you.

936
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:40,649
Okay, then.

937
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,880
I have to go now.

938
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:57,680
Okay.

939
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,159
Why I am getting butterflies
in my stomach?

940
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,279
Saeb.

941
01:26:18,609 --> 01:26:19,680
Yes, Madam?

942
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,199
Why hasn't Artit come back yet?

943
01:26:25,239 --> 01:26:26,319
I don't know, Madam.

944
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,239
How can you not know?

945
01:26:28,649 --> 01:26:30,800
The farmhands saw his car
coming into the farm.

946
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,439
Where is he?

947
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,760
He asked you to not tell, didn't he?

948
01:26:41,319 --> 01:26:43,159
I asked you where he is.

949
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:48,439
If you don't tell me, I'm going to
fire you. Are you going to tell me?

950
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,880
He's at the safehouse.

951
01:26:51,399 --> 01:26:52,479
With whom?

952
01:26:56,439 --> 01:26:57,840
He's with Paeng, isn't he?

953
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:02,479
Get out of the way.

954
01:27:02,569 --> 01:27:04,649
- Where are you going?
- To fetch my son.

955
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,319
- Out of the way.
- Tubtim.

956
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,840
Tubtim.

957
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:10,239
Out of the way, Saeb.

958
01:27:12,529 --> 01:27:14,680
- Auntie.
- Why are you here?

959
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:17,569
Tubtim, I'll talk to her.

960
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,000
No!

961
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:25,800
Tubtim!

962
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:26,960
Oh, no!

963
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,840
Paeng!

964
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:35,399
I think you've gone too far.

965
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,439
Why did you have to slap her?

966
01:27:45,079 --> 01:27:47,479
I'm happy to wait
until you're ready.

967
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:50,720
Artit!

968
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,960
You have no right to do this to her.

969
01:27:52,039 --> 01:27:53,359
Who has the right then?

970
01:27:54,039 --> 01:27:56,079
Paeng wants to reopen

971
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,680
her mom's murder case.

972
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,760
Pimnapa didn't die in a car crash?

973
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:03,760
The main suspect in
Pimnapa's murder is...

974
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,840
That's not true! I don't believe it!

975
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:08,960
If someone accused Uncle,
would you just accept it?

976
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,760
I want to take care
of your daughter,

977
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,319
but she never thinks of me.

978
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,880
Mark?

979
01:28:18,319 --> 01:28:21,319
I told you to leave her alone.

980
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:23,079
I'm the one who asked him to come.

981
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:26,159
Are you only going to talk
about your own matters?
