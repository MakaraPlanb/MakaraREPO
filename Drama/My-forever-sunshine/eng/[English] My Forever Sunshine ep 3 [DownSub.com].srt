00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,629
You two have a lot in common.

3
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,210
Ling, what do you think
if a friend changes his status

4
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,669
into a boyfriend.

5
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,750
I don't think it's good.
You might lose a friend.

6
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,000
No matter what happens,
You have to be strong.

7
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,090
Why are you saying this to me?

8
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,340
Dad! Dad!

9
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,750
Dad, don't leave me!

10
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,919
Paeng!

11
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,169
Thongkhum! What's going on?

12
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,000
I won't accept this.
I'm not going to let this go!

13
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,379
- Little Miss!
- Please don't!

14
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,879
Probably no one

15
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,750
because her parents are dead!

16
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,879
Oh, dear!

17
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,210
this is your home.

18
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,550
Everyone here is your family.

19
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,000
You're not alone anymore.

20
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,919
I know what's my happiness now.

21
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,960
(Wanfamai's flower bed)

22
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,710
Grow fast
and absorb a lot of fertilizer

23
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
so you'll have lots of flowers.

24
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,210
Miss Paeng,

25
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,250
I'm here to help.

26
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,629
- I'll help water them.
- It's okay.

27
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,800
Saeb, I'll do it myself. Artit told
me to take care of them myself.

28
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,960
Oh, wow. Miss Paeng.

29
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,210
You're very obedient to Mr. Artit.

30
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,050
I have to be so that he loves me.

31
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,840
Aw.

32
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,090
Miss Paeng, would you like
Mr. Artit to love you?

33
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,460
Of course, Saeb.

34
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,340
I love him.

35
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,840
And I want him to love me.

36
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,000
Wow!

37
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,459
Miss Paeng, can I ask you something?

38
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,670
In what way do you
want him to love you?

39
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,129
Saeb.

40
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,500
In what way do girls love guys?
You shouldn't be asking.

41
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,750
Are you happy?

42
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,250
Turn around and let me see.

43
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,709
Why the long face?

44
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,379
It's your first day of school.
Aren't you happy?

45
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,800
I don't want to go.

46
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,800
I want to stay home with Artit.

47
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,800
Mr. Artit won't go anywhere.

48
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,459
You'll see him today
when you come back.

49
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:58,129
Come on. Let's go to school.

50
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,459
I'll carry your backpack.

51
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,339
Come on now.

52
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,089
You'll definitely see him
after school today.

53
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,500
Artit, you're up already?

54
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:09,670
Yes.

55
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,550
So, it's your first day of school.
Are you happy?

56
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,670
Why not?

57
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,839
Artit,

58
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:19,339
stop talking to her.
She's about to be late.

59
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,920
Come on.

60
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,089
Can you give me a lift?

61
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:24,839
I was planning to.

62
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,339
No need, Artit.

63
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,629
I told Saeb to do it.

64
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:32,839
It's okay, Mom. It's her first day.
I can drop her off.

65
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,000
You're the best! Let's go.

66
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:37,170
Hold on.

67
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,709
Say goodbye to my mom first.

68
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,920
Goodbye.

69
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,209
Come on.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,170
Really!

71
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,500
She's got that long face
just a few moments ago.

72
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:54,839
How dare she holds
my son's hand like that?

73
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,750
Oh, dear.

74
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:00,959
What am I thinking?

75
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,709
MIss Paeng!

76
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,209
We've arrived, Paeng.

77
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,629
Can you come pick me up
this evening?

78
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,959
Sure.

79
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,550
Can you give me a lift every day?

80
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,459
Every day?

81
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:35,089
You have to go back to university
in only a month.

82
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,709
Then I won't get to see you anymore.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,209
You will.

84
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll try to come back every weekend.

85
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,959
Really? You promise?

86
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,500
Well, only if you behave.

87
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:53,959
Don't be naughty
or pick a fight with people.

88
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:55,709
Then, I'll keep my word.

89
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:59,500
Then I promise I'll study hard.

90
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,170
Excellent.

91
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:03,800
You can go to school now.

92
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,420
Bye!

93
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,879
I'll see you this evening.

94
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:15,670
Love you, Artit.

95
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,129
Can I order something?

96
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,250
Oh, Non! How did you get here?

97
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,750
Boo! I'm here too.

98
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,050
Are you free today? Have a seat.

99
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,629
Wait.

100
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:56,670
Ling told me to sit first. I have
to go first and you wait.

101
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,750
See? I'll sit first

102
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:01,300
and you sit later.

103
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,839
Wow, so many refreshments.

104
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,339
Very funny.

105
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,800
That's the wrong side.

106
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:16,550
It's still the refreshments.

107
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,839
Jerk! It's this side.

108
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,170
When are you going to order?
It's not going to be in the exams.

109
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,050
If we hurry, then we won't
get to talk much.

110
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,629
Be considerate to other tables.

111
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm working.

112
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,129
Umm...

113
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:35,840
When do you finish work?

114
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,129
At 09:00 p.m.

115
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,460
Can you leave early?

116
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,129
I'd like to invite
you to the movies.

117
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,250
I'm not the owner, just an employee.

118
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,049
I don't understand you at all.

119
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,340
Your family is well-off. Why do you
have to work a part-time job?

120
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,629
Because I take my life seriously.

121
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,129
When will I grow up if I keep asking
for an allowance from my parents?

122
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,299
Oh? Is she talking about me?

123
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,250
- Right.
- You too.

124
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,629
You two get along well
like steak and salad.

125
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,750
I'll have shrimp paste fried rice

126
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,169
and chicken macaroni.

127
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,629
Just that for now.

128
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,840
Now you can go take orders
from other tables.

129
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,379
- All right.
- Here's the menu.

130
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:19,169
Non, I ordered two dishes just now.

131
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,799
You ordered four right?

132
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,669
Can I eat some of your food?

133
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,840
You order whatever you want.
It's my treat this time.

134
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,629
You said it.
Then I'll order takeout too.

135
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,960
Excuse me, can I have the menu?

136
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,090
Hurry! Hurry! This way!

137
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,750
Don't open your eyes!

138
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,590
- Don't open them!
- Hold on.

139
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,590
Why don't we go
into the house first?

140
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,000
- Where are you taking me?
- I have something to show you.

141
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,049
- Don't open your eyes!
- Okay.

142
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,960
This way.

143
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,129
Why can't I open my eyes?
Where are you taking me?

144
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,090
I have a surprise for you.

145
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
This is the spot.

146
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,169
You can open your eyes now.

147
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,840
- Ta-da!
- Wow!

148
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,129
You let me plant
Japanese Chrysanthemum.

149
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,799
Didn't you? Aren't I good?

150
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:28,379
Very good.

151
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,549
Smile like this often.

152
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:32,169
I like it when you smile.

153
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,340
I will.

154
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,549
Artit, do you know

155
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,210
that you're the first person
I feel happy when I'm with

156
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,250
apart from my parents

157
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,919
I want to have you
by my side forever.

158
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,250
You can be quite sweet sometimes.

159
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,500
Are you proud of them?

160
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,129
- Are they beautiful?
- They are.

161
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,960
Let's take some pictures.

162
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,169
Wait. Not in that position.

163
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,129
One, two, three.

164
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,960
Oh, Paeng.

165
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:50,750
you're not going to bed yet?

166
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,340
It's only 08:00 p.m.

167
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,799
Can I watch TV with you?

168
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,919
Sure. Sit next to me.

169
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,879
What are you watching?

170
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:24,500
Nothing in particular.

171
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:26,919
I'm waiting for a TV drama.

172
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:28,629
- Do you want to change the channel?
- It's okay.

173
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:49,460
What's wrong?

174
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,000
Are you lonely?

175
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,000
Do you think

176
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,250
there are customers who stay
as long as we do?

177
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:05,129
We've been here since 03:00 p.m.

178
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,500
It's now 08:45 p.m.

179
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,379
I'm so stuffed and gassy.

180
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:12,750
Kot,

181
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,340
we dropped by the place,
aren't you going to wait for Ling?

182
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,549
Are you really going to wait
until the shop closes?

183
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,210
I can't keep eating any longer.

184
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,710
You deserve it.

185
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,960
You were eating non-stop.

186
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,250
What do you want me to do?

187
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,299
You'll get kicked out
if you don't order anything.

188
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:32,250
You ordered tons of food
but then you don't eat it.

189
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,500
So I had to.

190
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,000
I can't take it anymore.
I'm leaving.

191
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,090
Are you really going to leave?

192
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,250
Really. Bye.

193
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,919
Ling, someone's here to see you.
He's outside.

194
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,250
Hey,

195
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,049
who is that?

196
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:00,960
Can I have the bill, please?

197
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,919
Just ask Mom.

198
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,879
She's so rich.

199
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,049
She gave me a lot each year.

200
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:19,250
And I've given it all to you.

201
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,210
I've also spent it all up.

202
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,000
That's why I'm here to ask for more.

203
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,590
Tell Mom that you're sick

204
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,799
and you need money.

205
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,500
I don't want to lie to her.

206
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,419
And do you want me to suffer?

207
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,590
Dad, I'm tired.

208
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,799
I only have this much.

209
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,840
I don't know if it's going to
be enough for the electricity bill.

210
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:06,250
I'm getting paid in two days.

211
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,840
Just come back here then.

212
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:11,710
All right.

213
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,169
Don't change jobs to avoid me again.

214
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,549
I love you, Ling.

215
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,960
Get home safe.

216
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,549
Oh? I thought you went home.

217
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,839
I thought you did too.

218
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,549
Get in the car.
I'll give you a lift.

219
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,460
Are you tired?

220
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,210
Eat something.

221
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,380
How do you know I haven't eaten?

222
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,130
I work at a restaurant.

223
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,880
There is a lot of food.

224
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,380
But did you get to eat them?

225
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,089
I saw you working the whole day.

226
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,960
Who's calling?

227
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:08,630
It's Artit.

228
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,339
Just eat.

229
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,589
Ling's not available
to talk right now.

230
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,670
Yes, it's me. Later.

231
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,089
Hey...

232
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,839
Non! You backstabbing friend.

233
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:32,549
Did you really do that?

234
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:34,460
Yes, I did.

235
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,250
Eat up, Ling.

236
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,380
A girl with a gaunt face
isn't pretty.

237
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:44,130
Here.

238
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,299
There's another one.

239
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,460
See which one you like.

240
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,089
Wow.

241
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,880
This one's pork belly.

242
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,420
- Kot?
- Help me.

243
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,210
I'm having a bad stomach ache.
Help me, please.

244
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,549
What have you been doing?

245
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,750
I had dinner with Non.

246
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,339
I ate too much.

247
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,049
Did you go see Ling?

248
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:33,380
We did, but I left first.

249
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,049
I had too much food
so I'm having a stomach ache.

250
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,500
You left first?

251
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,210
So, you left Non
and Ling alone together?

252
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:44,250
How could you say that? They're not
alone. There are a lot of customers.

253
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,880
But can you help me now?
My stomach's hurting so bad.

254
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,049
I don't know whether it's just gas
or food poisoning.

255
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,880
What medicine should I take?

256
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,420
Can you tell me?

257
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:55,880
Just take whatever.

258
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,589
Artit? Artit?

259
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,589
Gosh, you're such a bad friend.

260
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,710
Non.

261
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,250
What are you laughing about?
Why are you happy, ugly toad?

262
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,089
I'm happy

263
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,960
that Miss Paeng will end up
with someone decent like Mr. Artit.

264
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,880
How dare you say that.

265
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:37,920
You're saying like she and Mr. Artit
are going to get married. Dream on.

266
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:39,960
I'm not dreaming. It's happening.

267
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:42,420
You're delusional.

268
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,920
This is the first time
I see a toad bragging.

269
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,380
An insane toad too.

270
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,130
Don't go talking yet.

271
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,299
People might not believe it
and they'll say you're assuming.

272
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,049
Who cares about them?

273
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,299
Let's think about

274
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,589
how we're going to
rearrange the kitchen

275
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,670
after we kick out these pests.

276
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,750
- You toad!
- What?

277
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,130
What's the matter, you cockroach?

278
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,589
You want it?

279
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,299
Cross it!

280
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,089
Cross the line so I can
tell Mr. Krongprateep.

281
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,380
You cross it.

282
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,339
Why would I? I'm not stupid.

283
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,339
- Jaem.
- What's the matter?

284
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,339
Let's go and shop for something
for the kitchen.

285
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm feeling so happy today.

286
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:28,130
Come on, then.

287
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:32,710
You heard what she said?

288
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,380
She might be telling the truth?

289
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,960
What do you mean?

290
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,710
I mean what I said.

291
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,710
Miss Paeng and Mr. Artit professed
their love to each other?

292
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,920
That's right, Pong.

293
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,630
I heard Miss Paeng professing to him
with my own ears.

294
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,210
Whoa!

295
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,170
Aueng and I kept watching Mr. Artit.

296
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,380
I want to put my money on this.

297
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,670
- Within this year...
- What?

298
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,880
They'll definitely get married.

299
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,170
Saeb, you're just assuming things.

300
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:13,000
Miss Paeng just got
into high school.

301
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:16,299
Why would Mr. Artit rush it?

302
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,089
You're too old. You've got grey hair
all over. I'll pluck it.

303
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,920
Go on. If you're not afraid of
your hands cramping.

304
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,839
Pong, you don't understand
young people's love.

305
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:29,500
- What?
- Would you like a challenge?

306
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:30,880
Do you want to bet on this?

307
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,839
Gambling?

308
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,630
Did you forget that Master forbade
us from gambling on the farm?

309
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,420
It's just for fun, Pong.

310
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,839
It's not fun.

311
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:45,920
Gambling is bad.

312
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:48,500
It has turned many decent people
into villains.

313
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,380
There are fathers
who hurt their children

314
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,210
because of their gambling obsession.

315
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,420
Fire still leaves you with the land.
Gambling will take even the pole.

316
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,630
- What pole?
- North Pole.

317
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:01,670
North Pole!

318
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,670
You're still not sorry?

319
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,589
I'm sorry, Pong.

320
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

321
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,960
Are you Ling's dad?

322
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,089
How do you know?

323
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,089
I'm Ling's close friend.

324
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:30,589
I have something
to talk to you about.

325
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,170
Here you are.

326
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,589
Why do you think you
have to give me money?

327
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,170
I don't want to see Ling suffer.

328
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,170
We're friends.

329
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,420
Just think of me as a relative.

330
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,380
I'll accept it.

331
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:53,089
You're a good and generous person.

332
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,960
If you're this close to her,

333
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,839
just call me Dad.

334
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,880
Yes, Dad.

335
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,630
If you need money again,

336
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,799
call me.

337
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,960
You don't have to call Ling.

338
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,339
Do you want to do it that way?

339
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,589
Then

340
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:18,549
can I have your number?

341
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,500
Here.

342
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,210
Thanks.

343
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,549
I have to go now.

344
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,670
I stayed home the whole day.

345
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,710
I'm starving right now.

346
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,920
I'm starving too.

347
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,130
Hey.

348
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,049
Are you a new student?

349
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:51,420
I'm Maew and she's Toom.

350
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,960
Friends

351
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,500
make us feel like we're
not alone in the world.

352
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,049
Friends are there to listen to
your secrets and feelings,

353
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,589
both ups and downs.

354
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:07,920
Or they're there to give you advice

355
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,630
when you can't talk to adults.

356
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,049
I'm Paeng.

357
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,920
Come sit with us over there.

358
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,710
If you have any
questions, just ask us.

359
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,170
We know about everything
in the school.

360
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,299
But if it's about studying,
don't ask us

361
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:27,339
because we don't know.

362
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,460
Come on. Let's go take a seat.

363
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,500
You sit here.

364
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,420
We'll sit next to you.

365
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,839
You can go to buy lunch.
I'll keep watch of the table.

366
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,960
- What should we eat?
- I don't know. Let's check it out.

367
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,299
Come and sit with us.

368
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,750
Sit down.

369
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:32,839
Toom, Maew

370
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,630
why didn't you tell me
that you want to switch seats?

371
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,130
So I can sit with you.

372
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,549
Who said you can sit?

373
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,299
Do you own the cafeteria?

374
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,089
- No.
- If you don't, I can sit anywhere.

375
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:59,500
How dare you talk back to us?
You're younger.

376
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,630
I'm not talking back.
I'm telling the truth.

377
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,630
Enough.

378
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,089
Don't mind her.

379
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,299
She's an orphan

380
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,880
so there's no one
to teach her manners.

381
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:24,670
Paeng,

382
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,500
go sit somewhere else.

383
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
We'll sit with Nang.

384
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,710
Your friend said so herself.
I didn't say it.

385
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:39,420
Get going now.

386
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,000
Go away.

387
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:42,500
Or do you want us to drag you away?

388
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,500
I thought you've got guts.

389
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,589
I'm going home.

390
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:52,420
Perm, you can drive home.
I'll go home by myself.

391
00:28:57,089 --> 00:29:00,380
I'm so happy to see you, Paeng.

392
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,549
Are you happy?
Don't fake it. I'm not stupid.

393
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:08,589
Don't see me in that negative light.

394
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,500
What do you want?

395
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,880
My driver said that
the car broke down.

396
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:17,710
Can I hitch a ride with you?

397
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,500
You know that Artit's picking me up.

398
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,420
Artit's picking you up?

399
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,170
I didn't know that.

400
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,500
Not believable.

401
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,839
Good. So we won't have to fake it.

402
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:35,630
What do you want?

403
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,960
I just want to hitch a ride.

404
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:42,000
- I'm not allowing you.
- Did I ask for your permission?

405
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,589
I can ask Artit myself.

406
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,210
Artit is mine.

407
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:48,799
Says who? I met him before you.
Remember that.

408
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,339
I've met him since I was five.

409
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,960
I've met him since I was four.

410
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,299
Paeng, let's go.

411
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,339
Oh, Nang.

412
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,670
Artit, can I hitch a ride with you?

413
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,960
My driver said the car broke down.

414
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,000
Okay.

415
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,880
No, I won't let her.

416
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,589
It's okay, Paeng. Get in, Nang.

417
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:29,420
Get off right now.

418
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,089
I'll sit at the front.

419
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,500
I can't sit the back.
I might get carsick.

420
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,210
I said get off now.

421
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,299
Paeng, behave.

422
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,210
Paeng.

423
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,170
Paeng, get in the car.

424
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,630
I'll sit at the front.

425
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:53,049
Get down from my seat now.

426
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,500
You're not very nice
behaving like this.

427
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,089
How can you be harsh like that?

428
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,960
Artit, if Paeng's not happy.
I can sit at the back.

429
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,000
Then go ahead.

430
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,799
Paeng,

431
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,589
we're home. Go inside.

432
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,380
I'll drop Nang off
then I'm going to see a friend.

433
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,210
I'm coming with you.

434
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,839
Paeng, get out of the car.

435
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,630
What time are you coming back?

436
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,710
- I'll drop Nang off and...
- Paeng,

437
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,549
give him some alone time.

438
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,670
If you're too clingy,
he might be uncomfortable.

439
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:21,460
I'm not talking to you.

440
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,299
You're an outsider, don't butt in.

441
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,380
- Oh, my!
- Paeng,

442
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:28,670
don't be rude. Get out of the car.

443
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,460
Go on.

444
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,549
Let's go, Artit.

445
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,380
Nang, is Non home?

446
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,420
He's not back yet.

447
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,299
I'll drop you here then.

448
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,170
Artit,

449
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,250
is there a problem with Paeng?

450
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:26,339
I'm worried about her.

451
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,920
Aren't you angry with her?

452
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,250
I'm not.

453
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:33,339
Thanks so much.

454
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,880
I'm sorry on behalf of Paeng too.

455
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,299
Paeng is all right. Don't mind her.

456
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,920
Does she have a problem at home?

457
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,000
Is that why she
has to live with you?

458
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,380
Uhh...

459
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,960
That's Non.

460
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,460
Do you miss me so much you have
to come all the way here?

461
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:08,960
Get out now. Out.

462
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,630
What's up with you?

463
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,500
- I'll switch the engine off first.
- Quick.

464
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,960
I haven't even rolled
the windows up yet.

465
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,050
- Come talk to me over here.
- What?

466
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,130
Come here.

467
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,920
Where have you been?

468
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,250
Kot's sick.
So, I went to take care of him.

469
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,050
Was it Kot or Ling?

470
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,800
You weren't free.
How can you be angry at me?

471
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,250
I have to take care of Paeng.

472
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,460
Don't take advantage of this.

473
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,210
If you have someone to take care of,
don't do two things at once.

474
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,880
Take care of Paeng if you're worried
about her. I'll take care of Ling.

475
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,710
I have to take care of her.

476
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,210
Dad asked me to.

477
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,880
- You have to?
- Right.

478
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,050
Why?

479
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,960
He's not back yet.

480
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,750
Paeng, come in and talk to me.

481
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,380
I'm going to wait for Artit.

482
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,840
But I have something to talk to you.

483
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,300
Her parents have all passed away.

484
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,800
That's right.

485
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,550
They both died in a car crash.

486
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,920
She has no relatives either.

487
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,750
So Dad had to take her in.

488
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,170
I feel so sorry for her.

489
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,880
Right?

490
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,420
That's why I have to
take care of her.

491
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,880
She's really fond of me too.

492
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,050
I think you're doing
the right thing.

493
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,630
You have to give her a lot of time.

494
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,050
A child who's been
psychologically traumatized

495
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,670
might harm or kill themself.

496
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,960
You have to keep a sharp eye on her.

497
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,050
You're doing the right thing.

498
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,750
I think

499
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,420
you should just stay here
during the break.

500
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,420
What about you?

501
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,170
I think I'm going back to Bangkok

502
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,090
and take care of Ling.

503
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,300
You're taking advantage of this.

504
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,750
- How dare you?
- Artit! Artit!

505
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,050
- I'm only joking!
- How dare you?

506
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,460
Hey, hey!

507
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,880
Hey, hey!

508
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,960
Hey, hey!

509
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,300
I want you to behave
more appropriately.

510
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,920
You're a girl.

511
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,670
You must be reserved.
Do you understand?

512
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,590
What are you trying to tell me?

513
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,670
What am I doing wrong?

514
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,210
You're growing up into a woman.

515
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,590
You can't just go and lean
on a guy's shoulder.

516
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,090
Did someone tell you something?

517
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,340
I don't care.
I didn't do anything wrong.

518
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,710
How aren't you wrong?

519
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,550
I'm trying to teach you.
You're a girl.

520
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,300
What's all the yelling?

521
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,590
Why can't you think
what's proper or not?

522
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,130
What's the matter, Tubtim?

523
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,210
Someone told me

524
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,460
that the other night

525
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,630
she was leaning on
Artit's shoulder while watching TV.

526
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,460
Is that true, Paeng?

527
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,500
Artit didn't even say anything.

528
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,590
Why are you scolding me?

529
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,130
I'm always wrong in your eyes.

530
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,500
But is it appropriate?

531
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,590
Why can't you figure it out?

532
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,090
Tubtim, calm down.
There's probably nothing.

533
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,630
Are you going
to wait until there is?

534
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,670
Anyway, I'm going to talk to Artit
once he's back.

535
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,550
You're trying to get in our way.

536
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,210
You don't love me!

537
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,340
What are you saying?

538
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:48,380
I love Artit. I want to be with him.
What's wrong with that?

539
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,630
Paeng!

540
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,420
- Calm down.
- Did you hear that?

541
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,380
Did you hear what she's thinking?

542
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,750
Calm down.

543
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,380
I can't calm down anymore.

544
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,630
Artit is with Non.

545
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,960
I'm going to talk to him today.

546
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,840
Let's leave it for another day.

547
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,800
You're going to stress him out.
It's already late.

548
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,420
Don't you feel anything at all?

549
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,670
Aren't you afraid of
what she's going to do next?

550
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,130
Tubtim,

551
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,460
Paeng's only 16.
She's not as bad as you think.

552
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,460
Are you sure?

553
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,750
She's vile, that girl.

554
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,170
Just you wait.

555
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,920
I can't even stand
just thinking about it.

556
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,170
What if

557
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,300
- those two are really in love?
- What?

558
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,050
What did you say?

559
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,300
What if Artit loves Paeng?

560
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,500
No way.

561
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,920
I won't accept that girl
as my daughter-in-law.

562
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,210
Never.

563
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,590
Whoa, hey!

564
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,000
How did you come in?

565
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,920
You forgot to lock the door.

566
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,500
What time is it?

567
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,090
It's late. I'll be late for school.

568
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,300
Huh?

569
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,460
Wait. I'll take a shower

570
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,050
Why didn't the alarm go off?

571
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,340
Paeng, you're still here?

572
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,050
You told me to wait.

573
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,960
Why didn't you wait outside?

574
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,380
Get out now. I'm getting dressed.

575
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,920
What are you doing?

576
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,300
I'm helping you get dressed.

577
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,920
I can help you. Don't be shy.

578
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I can do it myself.

579
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,420
Wait outside.
I'm putting on my pants.

580
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,050
Don't be shy.

581
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,090
- I'll turn around. I won't look.
- Paeng, get out.

582
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,670
Hurry or I'll be late for school.

583
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,800
All right, then.

584
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,050
Paeng,

585
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,920
next time don't come into my room
like this, understand?

586
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,960
People might see us. It'll look bad.

587
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,130
You're scolding me about this too?

588
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,840
- Are you done yet?
- Not yet.

589
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,340
Hurry up, Artit.

590
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,420
I'm finished.

591
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,460
Come on. Let's hurry.

592
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,550
What time is it?

593
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,210
It's exactly 06:00 a.m.

594
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,380
Six...

595
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,090
Six o'clock?

596
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,500
I thought you said you're late.

597
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I want you to take me out
for some breakfast.

598
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,250
Paeng!

599
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,170
Let's go, Artit.

600
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,380
Yes?

601
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,550
I've just arrived at the dorm.

602
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,050
Later.

603
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,880
- Hello?
- Non, it's me.

604
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,880
Yes?

605
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,840
Dad, what's the matter?

606
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,920
I need another 5,000 for something.

607
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,460
I just gave some to you.

608
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,380
I know. I'm feeling guilty too.

609
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,920
But it's really necessary.

610
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,340
But if it's inconvenient
for you, then it's okay.

611
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,460
I can ask Ling.

612
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,920
Hold on, Dad.

613
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,340
Ling won't have it.

614
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,920
Right?

615
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,800
That's why I called you.

616
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,920
Let's meet at the same place.
The same ATM

617
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,590
close to where Ling works.

618
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,710
I'll see you later.

619
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,550
Dad? Hello? Dad?

620
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,000
Here you are.

621
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,880
Thanks.

622
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,630
Dad?

623
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,750
Non?

624
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,710
Do you know each other?

625
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,750
Is this your dad?

626
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

627
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,420
Are you Ling's friend?

628
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,960
What's your name?

629
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,960
- It's Non.
- Oh.

630
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,500
Why does it look
like you were talking?

631
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,340
I was withdrawing some money.

632
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,920
Then I turned around and saw you.

633
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,380
Why are you withdrawing money here?

634
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,460
I was thinking of eating
at the shop.

635
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,420
So many questions.

636
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:15,340
It's nothing. We just met.

637
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,460
Since we've met now,

638
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,250
let's eat together.

639
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,050
You too.

640
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,500
No, Dad.

641
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,750
I have to work.

642
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,380
You can take leave for a day.

643
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,920
All right? Eat with me.

644
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,380
I'll ask for a leave for you.

645
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,340
Come on. Let's eat at
a place around here.

646
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,960
I'll help you take leave.

647
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,460
Eat it all up.

648
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,800
It's my treat this time.

649
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,670
- How much did you order?
- Not much.

650
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,500
Come on. We eat together
once in a while.

651
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,960
Here. Fried chicken
is Ling's favorite.

652
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,630
Get some for her.

653
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,670
- Come on.
- I can do it myself.

654
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,090
No, you're a girl.

655
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,630
Let the gentleman serve you.

656
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,000
Go on.

657
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,710
Just like that.

658
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,750
You go to the same university?
Same faculty as well?

659
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,420
Yes, sir.

660
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,960
What do your parents do?

661
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,130
Dad!

662
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,590
They own a business.

663
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,630
What is this business?

664
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,340
A resort.

665
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,630
A resort? Wow, you must be rich.

666
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,670
Ling is very good at English.

667
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,340
Let her work for you
after graduation.

668
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,340
My daughter is still single.

669
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,840
She's beautiful
but she's still available.

670
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,460
Would you like to apply
to be my son-in-law?

671
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,500
Dad, that's enough.

672
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,340
I was only kidding.
You don't mind, right?

673
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,210
I don't.

674
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,380
See? He doesn't mind.

675
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,380
Eat up. Here.
This is very delicious.

676
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,210
This spicy salad is your favorite.

677
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,420
We're here.

678
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm sorry, Non.

679
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,420
What? What are you apologizing for?

680
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,460
Do I even have to answer?

681
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,250
It's nothing.

682
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,800
I don't really mind him.
Don't mind him too.

683
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,340
You don't understand.
Dad's always like this.

684
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,050
Do you want to go for a walk?

685
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,590
Here. Eat up.

686
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,050
You'll feel better.

687
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,340
Does that even work?

688
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,630
It does. Snacking helps
you feel better.

689
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,960
Try it if you don't believe it.

690
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,170
Look at that face. Here.

691
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,250
Here.

692
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,050
No more.

693
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:26,750
Here.

694
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,460
Good. You deserve it.

695
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,170
What are you smiling about?

696
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,710
You're pulling pranks on me.

697
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:42,920
Does that mean
you're feeling better?

698
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,460
Yes.

699
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,380
If there's anything,
just let it out sometimes.

700
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,170
Don't keep it to yourself.

701
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,380
You'll lose all your hair.

702
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,960
No one will love you if you're bald.

703
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:58,050
Are you giving me snide remarks?

704
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,920
No.

705
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,880
It's direct.

706
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,300
I can see you're feeling better.

707
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,090
I feel relieved now.

708
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,670
Don't act like you can read my mind.

709
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,420
How many years have we been friends?

710
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,960
I know everything about you.

711
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,420
What's the matter?
Why are you silent?

712
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,710
I'm grateful

713
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,130
that I have a good friend like you.

714
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,630
Don't cry.

715
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,170
Is it that touching?

716
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,800
Jerk.

717
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,250
I'm grateful for having
a good friend like you too.

718
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,380
- Are you trying to be touching?
- Stop.

719
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,090
My hair's all messed up.

720
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,170
If you don't have anyone,

721
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,920
you always have me.

722
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,460
You have Artit and Kot too.

723
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,050
Right.

724
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,130
How pitiful. An orphan.

725
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:00,130
I understand why you're like this.

726
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,960
You have no parents to educate you.

727
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,050
How is that anyone's business?

728
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,340
I feel bad for you.

729
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,130
Your parents are dead.

730
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,210
You must feel terrible.

731
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,090
What are you talking about?
How did you know about me?

732
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:23,840
Everyone knows that.

733
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,550
Your parents are dead.

734
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,210
You must feel terrible.

735
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,550
Stop talking right now.

736
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,340
I said so because
I'm worried about you.

737
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,090
Let's do it this way.

738
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,170
I'll let everyone know
what happened.

739
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,210
So everyone will feel sorry for you.

740
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,460
Stop that!

741
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,000
Why?

742
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,250
Are you embarrassed?

743
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,920
If you don't want anyone
else to know,

744
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,130
then stay way from Artit!

745
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,050
Remember that.

746
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,710
Come here!

747
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:18,670
Why did you do that to her?

748
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,670
Good thing someone found them.

749
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,960
Or there might be serious injuries.

750
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,630
You can punish her
as much as you want.

751
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,250
I have no problems with it.

752
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,800
I'm not guilty.
She started it first.

753
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:36,960
It's not true.

754
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,170
I was only greeting her

755
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,750
because we know each other.

756
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,130
But I don't know
what she's angry about.

757
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:47,300
She grabbed my hair
and slapped me repeatedly.

758
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,920
Why are you like this?

759
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,960
I'm so sorry, Nang.

760
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,460
Are you hurt?
I'll take you to the doctor.

761
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,380
Oh, dear. How am I going to look
Ms. Ladawan in the face?

762
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,420
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

763
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:04,460
I'm not guilty. She started it.

764
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,130
What did she do?

765
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,170
I asked you so many times.
But you didn't say.

766
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,460
Say it.

767
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,050
Oh, no.

768
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,630
Wanfahmai. In front of a teacher?

769
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,380
I'm going to have you
clean the toilets for ten days

770
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:24,170
and your behavior points deducted.

771
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,590
If this happens again,
your punishment will be harsher.

772
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,130
Hold on. Stop right now.

773
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:59,920
- We have to talk.
- Paeng!

774
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,210
Mom, what's going on?

775
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,460
It's Paeng. She slapped Nang.
What's wrong with her?

776
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,170
Why did you do that?

777
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,090
So she'll know
not to pick fights with me.

778
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,840
Picking fights? I've known
Nang for a long time.

779
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,550
She's very nice and well-behaved.
She wouldn't do that.

780
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,500
- You're stupid for buying that.
- Paeng!

781
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,170
Don't be rude to my mom.

782
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,880
Let's go apologize to Nang.

783
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,670
No, I'm not going. I hate her.

784
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,130
Tell her to leave me alone.

785
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,750
- Or I'll slap her again.
- Paeng!

786
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,960
Don't do this again.
I don't like it.

787
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:37,300
How can you be so rude?

788
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,130
- I'm not going!
- Go! Go!

789
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,210
- Artit, no!
- This little brat!

790
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,050
Help! Anyone?

791
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,840
- Let me go!
- Paeng!

792
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,550
I'm not going!

793
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,960
Mom!

794
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,090
What's going on?

795
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,210
- My hip.
- Are you hurt?

796
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,250
Dad, look after her.

797
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,420
- Are you okay?
- Paeng.

798
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,750
She's such a brat.
I can't take this.

799
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,420
Did Paeng really say that?

800
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,960
I don't know if she's mentally ill
or just ill-mannered.

801
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:22,500
No matter what it is.

802
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,960
If she's going to be rude,
then we can't live together.

803
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,380
Calm down, Tubtim.

804
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,250
I've already reached my limit.

805
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,750
Look at her and what she's done.

806
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,590
There's the thing about Artit.
Now she slapped Nang too.

807
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:41,050
If she really is ill, then we have
to take her to the doctor.

808
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,090
Or we can just let
her live somewhere else.

809
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,420
No, we can't.

810
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:46,750
Why not?

811
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,710
If we're doing this to
pay back to Mr. Tharathep,

812
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,300
we can just give her money.

813
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:55,090
We can let Aueng
and Jaem take care of her.

814
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,090
They probably won't abandon her.

815
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,920
I don't want to live under
the same roof with her anymore.

816
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,300
We can't do that.

817
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,880
Paeng must live here forever.

818
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,420
Why?

819
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,340
Is there any other reason
I don't know?

820
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,000
Paeng.

821
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,920
Stop.

822
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,630
You can't just kick Mom
and run away like this.

823
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:34,340
I didn't mean it.

824
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,300
If you didn't, then go apologize.

825
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,590
You can't be
a naughty girl like this.

826
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:41,840
Go apologize to her.

827
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,090
Will you stop being
angry with me if I do?

828
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,800
You have to go to Non's with me.

829
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,300
You have to apologize to Nang.

830
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,630
No, I'm not going.

831
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,460
Paeng!

832
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,550
You don't know it. She hates me.
She likes to bully me.

833
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:02,170
If I go there,
she'll laugh at me for sure.

834
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,840
But you hurt her.
You have to apologize.

835
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,090
Your mom too.

836
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,420
She hates me. Your maids hate me.

837
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,960
Paeng,

838
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,550
stop being rude to people

839
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,800
and stop blaming others.

840
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,710
No one hates you.

841
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,670
You didn't see it.
You wouldn't know.

842
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,090
Before blaming others,
look at yourself first

843
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,800
why they don't like you.

844
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,050
Why do you have to scold me?

845
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,800
Because you're being like this.

846
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,710
You keep on being rude

847
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,250
and very headstrong.
You never listen to others.

848
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:42,960
Who's going to love you?

849
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,420
You don't believe me.

850
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,880
You're siding with those people?

851
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:51,210
Who are you calling "those people"?

852
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:53,130
My mom?

853
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,340
Don't make hate you also.

854
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,500
You hate me!

855
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,750
You hate me!

856
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,420
Okay, okay. Paeng.

857
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,920
About Nang,

858
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,460
I'll wait for you
to calm down a bit.

859
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,840
But for now,

860
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,210
you have to go inside
and apologize to my mom.

861
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,550
Understand?

862
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,340
That's right.

863
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,130
There are other reasons
I haven't told you.

864
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,000
Well,

865
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,130
what are they?

866
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,250
But you have to promise me

867
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:15,670
to calm down and wait
for me to finish talking.

868
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,500
What is it, then?

869
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:22,710
All right, all right.
I'll listen. Just say it.

870
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,550
Do you remember the day Tharathep
dropped Paeng off with us?

871
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,750
That day you asked
what we're talking about.

872
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:35,630
And I told you it's nothing.

873
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,300
I remember.

874
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,710
Actually, there is something.

875
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,210
Tharathep.

876
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:51,960
Just say what you want to say to me.

877
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:58,340
Do you remember your promise

878
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,800
that you're willing to
help me with anything?

879
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:03,170
Of course I do.

880
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,460
What would you say

881
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:07,800
if I want to

882
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,670
let Paeng

883
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,750
get engaged to Artit, your son.

884
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,090
What did you say?

885
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:21,750
Why are you quiet?

886
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,170
It's not that I don't like Paeng.

887
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,090
But isn't it too soon

888
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,920
for us to talk
about things like this?

889
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,670
Our kids are both very young.

890
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,340
That's what I'm worried about.

891
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,630
If

892
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:41,460
one day

893
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:43,670
I'm not here,

894
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,420
I'm afraid Paeng will
meet some bad people.

895
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,170
Why are you saying that?

896
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,710
Just in case.

897
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:56,210
My Friend,

898
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,960
can you promise me?

899
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:59,800
Think of it

900
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,420
as a way for you to help me
feel relieved.

901
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,550
Can you do it?

902
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,340
How could you agree with him?

903
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,880
Why didn't you discuss it
with me first?

904
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,630
Everything was happening so fast.

905
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,300
Tharathep also seemed in a rush
so that's why he dropped Paeng off.

906
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:25,750
You should ask for time
to consider it regardless.

907
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,920
This is our son's entire life.

908
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,050
You know I can't do that.

909
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,000
We owe a lot to him.

910
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,550
We owe him.

911
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,460
But you're doing this.
It's like you're selling our son.

912
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,960
I want you to keep it separate.

913
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:41,880
I decided to let Artit
get engaged to Paeng

914
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:43,960
not because of the debt.

915
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,880
Engaged?

916
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:54,920
I decided to let Artit
get engaged to Paeng

917
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,000
not because of the debt.

918
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:58,840
Engaged?

919
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,960
I'm not selling my son.

920
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:08,460
Even if those two got married,
I'll pay Paeng back anyway.

921
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:10,750
That's good.

922
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,460
Since we're talking about this,

923
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,630
I'd like everyone in this house
be nicer to Paeng.

924
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:21,090
She's not living here like a tenant.

925
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,920
She's living here as our creditor.

926
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,840
But you're the one
who took out the loan.

927
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,960
Are you going to let our son
pay off the debt for you?

928
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,590
I told you those two matters
are separate.

929
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,460
And I can't break
my promise to Tharathep.

930
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,300
I won't accept it. I can't take it.

931
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:40,000
What if Artit refuses?
What if he loves someone else?

932
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,880
Would you let him break up with her
and marry someone he doesn't love?

933
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,300
I won't let you destroy
his happiness and future.

934
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:49,460
Artit must marry Paeng
no matter what.

935
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,880
Artit.

936
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:14,170
I don't love you.

937
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:16,670
Dad.

938
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:23,670
I don't love her.

939
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,380
I will never marry her.

940
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,840
Artit, wait for me!

941
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,670
Artit! Artit!

942
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,380
- Artit! I love you!
- Paeng.

943
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,550
- Don't leave me. I'm marrying you.
- Paeng.

944
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,420
Let me go.

945
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,420
No!

946
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:07,050
Artit! I love you!

947
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:10,170
I want to marry you!

948
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,960
Artit, don't leave me!

949
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:27,670
Artit, don't leave me!

950
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,340
Dad,

951
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,340
I don't love Paeng.

952
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,500
I'm not going to marry her.

953
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,880
Artit,

954
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:57,750
listen to me.

955
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,090
What's left for me to listen?

956
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,210
I've heard everything.

957
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,590
But I gave Tharathep my word.

958
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,460
Do you want me to break my promise?

959
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,420
But this is my life, Dad.

960
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,840
I'm happy to do anything to pay back
to Tharathep,

961
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:19,000
but not by marrying Paeng.

962
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:24,590
It's never going to happen.

963
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,340
I hope you're aware of that.

964
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,170
But it must happen.

965
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,500
Because this is Tharathep's only
request before he died.

966
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,300
And I will never break
my promise to my friend.

967
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,630
Be prepared.

968
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,300
As soon as she graduates,

969
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,340
I will have you engage to Paeng.

970
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,670
Your only duty is to do as I say.

971
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:59,050
Do you understand what I said?

972
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,630
I asked if you understand
what I said.

973
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:09,800
I understand.

974
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,920
But I'm not going to obey.

975
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,250
This is my life, not yours.

976
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:21,380
Therefore, I'm the only person
who can choose how to live it.

977
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,800
You can't force me.

978
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:30,710
Artit!

979
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,670
Do you really have to marry Paeng?

980
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,340
That's right. Look at
what my dad said.

981
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:48,210
What's this?

982
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,880
You were like siblings yesterday.
Now you're engaged to each other?

983
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,170
This is as huge as
the Big Mountain Festival.

984
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:56,340
I feel bad for you.

985
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,300
You didn't even do anything.

986
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,130
But you have to repay
for what you didn't do.

987
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:03,840
What are you going to do?

988
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,710
If I don't get married,
I'll be in trouble with Dad.

989
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,670
Are you going to get married?

990
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:12,670
Are you crazy? Who would? I won't.

991
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,130
It's like you're in trouble
either way.

992
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:19,630
So what are you going to do then?

993
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:24,250
There's only one thing.

994
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,090
I have to convince Paeng.

995
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,500
She doesn't really love me.

996
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,920
It's because I'm the only person
who's kind to her.

997
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,460
Are you sure?

998
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,050
I'm sure.

999
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,000
Now she's just confused.

1000
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,960
I'm going to explain to her
what true love

1001
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,380
between a woman and a man is.

1002
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,380
It's not
how she's thinking about me.

1003
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,840
It'd be good if she listens to you.

1004
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:55,300
Everything will be easier.

1005
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,050
If Paeng and I keep refusing,

1006
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:02,210
Dad will give in.

1007
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,380
I hope so.

1008
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,170
I'll get you something to eat.
Come inside.

1009
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,630
I'm not dreaming, aren't I?

1010
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,710
Paeng and Mr. Artit
are getting married.

1011
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,880
Why did you slap me?

1012
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,300
So you'll know you're not dreaming.

1013
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,960
But at least it's a good thing

1014
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:33,880
that Mr. Artit refused
Master outright.

1015
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,670
And do you think
that Master will be okay with it?

1016
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,800
That's true.

1017
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,670
What if she became our mistress?

1018
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,670
Don't we have to give
the kitchen to Aueng?

1019
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,550
You're only worried
about the kitchen.

1020
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,380
Worry about a place to live instead.

1021
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,380
That's true.

1022
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,750
What should we do, Thongkhum?

1023
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,000
I don't know.

1024
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:11,800
Paeng.

1025
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:13,840
Artit.

1026
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:16,880
We have something to talk.

1027
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,210
I have something to talk to you too.

1028
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:23,250
I really love you, Artit.

1029
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,130
Paeng,

1030
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,460
it's not like that.

1031
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:33,460
You're latching on to me
because I'm kind to you.

1032
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,550
You mistook it as love.

1033
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,420
I didn't.

1034
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,840
I know I love you.

1035
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:44,840
You love me

1036
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,920
as a brother.

1037
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,840
No.

1038
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,210
I want to marry you.

1039
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,960
This is not something to joke about.

1040
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:57,500
I'm not joking.

1041
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,800
You told me to
find my own happiness.

1042
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,460
I know what it is now.

1043
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:06,840
My happiness is you.

1044
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:10,920
Artit,

1045
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,880
please don't leave me.

1046
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:14,250
Stay with me

1047
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,960
just as you promised.

1048
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:20,380
Paeng, let me go.

1049
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,960
I don't love you.

1050
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:31,130
I never did and I'm not going to.

1051
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:38,670
I never feel towards you like a man
would feel towards a woman.

1052
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:44,550
You're like a sister to me.

1053
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,670
You have to get over me.

1054
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:52,880
And you have to tell my dad
that you're cancelling the wedding.

1055
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,380
No.

1056
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,670
I'm not going to get over you.

1057
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,920
Paeng,

1058
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,090
listen to me.

1059
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,050
You love me like a brother.

1060
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:26,800
Paeng!

1061
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:29,250
What are you doing?

1062
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,710
I'm letting you know

1063
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,800
how I love you.

1064
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,590
You have to marry me.

1065
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:39,550
You have to be mine and only mine!

1066
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:42,340
- Please, Artit!
- Let me go!

1067
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:43,800
You're not making any sense.

1068
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:45,130
We shouldn't talk right now.

1069
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,380
Artit!

1070
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:50,050
Artit! Artit! Where are you going?

1071
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,670
I think we should stay away
from each other.

1072
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,210
I'm not letting you go.

1073
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:56,710
Move away.

1074
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,090
- No.
- Move!

1075
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:01,250
- No.
- Move!

1076
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,750
- You're mine!
- Paeng!

1077
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,920
Artit!

1078
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:06,380
Get away!

1079
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:09,210
Artit!

1080
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,130
I didn't mean it.

1081
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,500
- Paeng.
- Don't leave me!

1082
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:20,000
- Artit!
- Let go. Let go!

1083
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:21,170
Artit!

1084
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:26,420
Artit! Artit!

1085
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:28,750
Artit!

1086
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,710
Artit!

1087
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,340
Artit! Don't leave me!

1088
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,300
Artit!

1089
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:47,960
I don't love you.

1090
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,670
I never did and I'm not going to.

1091
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,460
I never feel towards you like a man
would feel towards a woman.

1092
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:04,500
Jaem, Aueng.

1093
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:07,500
Artit doesn't love me anymore.
He hates me.

1094
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,460
What should I do?

1095
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,050
Now Mr. Artit too?

1096
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:15,840
I thought he'd understand you.

1097
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,550
He's like everybody else.

1098
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,750
Little Miss, if the people here
don't welcome us anymore,

1099
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,670
should the three of us
go back to Bangkok?

1100
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,590
That's true. I want to go
back to our home.

1101
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:31,170
I really hate Duang.

1102
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,880
Nobody likes us here either.

1103
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,710
Should we go back to our home?

1104
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,210
It's a big house.

1105
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,550
The kitchen's much nicer.

1106
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,130
It's more comfortable there.

1107
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,800
The air conditioning is great.

1108
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,670
And the bedrooms are big too.

1109
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,050
Let's go back to our home.

1110
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,500
No, I'm not going home.

1111
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:57,500
I'm not going! I'm not going!

1112
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,090
I'm staying here!

1113
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,710
I'm staying here!

1114
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,670
Little Miss, how can you stay here?

1115
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:06,340
I'm staying here!
I don't want to die like Dad!

1116
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,300
I'm not going to be weak like Dad!
I don't want to die like him!

1117
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:14,500
I'm staying here! I'm staying here!

1118
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,460
I'm not going! I'm staying here!

1119
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:20,590
Little Miss,
why are you saying that?

1120
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:23,960
That's true.
Please don't talk about death.

1121
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:28,800
I don't want to go home.

1122
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:33,420
Little Miss.

1123
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,630
Darn it.

1124
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:53,460
I knew it.

1125
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,250
I knew you wouldn't
be able to convince Paeng.

1126
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:59,050
I have to get away from here.
I can't stay here anymore.

1127
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,250
I'm going back to Bangkok.
Are you coming?

1128
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,000
I don't think
running away is the solution.

1129
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:08,380
You should talk it out with Paeng.

1130
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,000
I tried but I failed.

1131
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:13,340
I think it's enough.

1132
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:18,750
Did you get slapped?

1133
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:21,210
Worse.

1134
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,090
- What? A punch?
- Enough. Stop asking.

1135
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:26,590
Just answer me.
Are you coming or not?

1136
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,960
You go ahead. I'll follow you later.

1137
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:30,300
- That's all.
- Oh?

1138
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,170
Oh, hey, hey. Look at you.

1139
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,050
Why is he so angry?
I'm worried about him.

1140
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:45,210
It's okay. I understand everything.

1141
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:48,550
Just stay in Bangkok and be happy.

1142
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:51,550
Don't worry about over here.
I'll talk to Dad for you.

1143
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:53,250
Okay.

1144
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,960
Tubtim,

1145
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,840
have you seen Artit?

1146
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,210
He's gone to Bangkok.

1147
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,090
Why is he in a rush?

1148
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:08,550
Go ask that girl

1149
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,340
what she did to him.

1150
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,750
She's so brazen.

1151
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,130
What did she do?

1152
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,210
What, Tubtim?

1153
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:40,710
Jaem, what should we do?
She wouldn't reply to us as all.

1154
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:46,500
Little Miss,

1155
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,210
what's wrong? Can you tell me?

1156
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,210
Master.

1157
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:58,380
I know about everything.

1158
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:59,840
Come on. You can go.

1159
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:01,170
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1160
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:11,420
Paeng.

1161
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,420
Mr. Krongprateep.

1162
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:18,960
Artit doesn't love me anymore.

1163
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,750
He left me like my parents.

1164
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,300
No, he didn't.

1165
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:28,920
He didn't mean to leave you.

1166
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:34,550
He's probably just in shock
about what's happened.

1167
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:39,170
Am I wrong

1168
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,800
for loving him?

1169
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,590
You're not wrong

1170
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:50,960
for wanting to love someone.

1171
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:56,000
But you have to know the limits.

1172
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:00,250
If it's too much, you might make
them uncomfortable.

1173
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,090
I made Artit uncomfortable.

1174
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,340
Give him some time, okay?

1175
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,590
Don't cry.

1176
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,670
It's okay.

1177
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:36,050
- Hey, hey!
- Enough, Artit.

1178
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:39,210
Do you think being drunk
will make everything better?

1179
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:43,500
Everything will be the same
the next morning.

1180
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,300
Ling's right.

1181
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:48,630
Instead of drinking,

1182
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,630
you should think of
how to refuse your dad?

1183
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:53,960
Because I couldn't think

1184
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,960
of how to refuse Dad.

1185
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,880
That's why I have to drink.

1186
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,630
Is that so?

1187
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,420
What did Paeng say to you
when you talked to her?

1188
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:17,500
I'm letting you know

1189
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:19,500
how I love you.

1190
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,420
You have to marry me.

1191
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,710
You have to be mine and only mine!

1192
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,710
Hey, hey! Easy!

1193
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,090
How many has he had?

1194
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:41,380
I only know as much as you do.

1195
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,880
I don't know what Paeng did to him.

1196
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,960
Why did you order so many drinks?
Hey, hey!

1197
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,500
You can't even walk straight.
Where are you going?

1198
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:56,800
I want to be alone.

1199
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,750
Artit.

1200
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:02,670
- Artit! Artit!
- You can't walk anymore.

1201
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,630
I'll go after him.
You stay here and pay.

1202
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,300
Can I have the bill, please?

1203
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,670
One, two, three, four, five drinks.

1204
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,300
Five drinks and one popcorn.

1205
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,880
I have...

1206
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,130
I have 200 baht.
That's not going to be enough.

1207
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,090
Hey, Ling!

1208
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,920
Come back!
I don't have enough money!

1209
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:46,630
I'm here to keep you company.

1210
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,590
Ling,

1211
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,050
let me hold you for a bit?

1212
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:25,550
Do you feel better now?

1213
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,300
Yes.

1214
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,250
Ling,

1215
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,590
Paeng confessed her love to me.

1216
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:53,210
Why aren't you surprised?

1217
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:57,630
I already know.

1218
01:21:58,050 --> 01:21:59,840
Women can see each other through.

1219
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:05,590
But I don't love her.

1220
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:10,750
The only one I love

1221
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,130
is you.

1222
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:30,090
Ling, can you be my girlfriend?

1223
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,670
If you're my girlfriend,

1224
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:36,960
my dad probably won't
force me to marry Paeng.

1225
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:41,170
You're the only one who can help me.

1226
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,920
Artit.

1227
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,550
I...

1228
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,420
I can't be with you.

1229
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:10,630
I'm sorry.

1230
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:39,250
I see.

1231
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,840
You don't have to apologize.

1232
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,000
You can't force

1233
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:47,460
things like this to happen.

1234
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:56,090
I think this is not the solution.

1235
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:00,550
Let Paeng calm down

1236
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,170
and talk to her again.

1237
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,300
It's probably the best way.

1238
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,210
What did Mr. Artit
do in his past life?

1239
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,590
Why did he have to meet
a brazen girl like this?

1240
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:53,710
That girl's worse than I thought.

1241
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:56,130
She's evil beneath
that innocent facade.

1242
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,590
I'm guessing

1243
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,630
that she's been with so many guys.

1244
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,670
Aren't you going a little too far?

1245
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:04,920
Not at all, Thongkhum.

1246
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:09,750
A girl this young who knows how to
kiss a guy must be promiscuous.

1247
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,500
Hey!

1248
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,750
What about people who gossip
behind people's back?

1249
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,460
What do they call it? Is it nosy?

1250
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:18,710
So what?

1251
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,750
Are you going to argue that
your mistress didn't kiss Mr. Artit?

1252
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,710
You can't, can you?

1253
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:29,250
So what? What does her kissing Artit
have anything to do with you?

1254
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,960
Why is it strange? They're engaged.

1255
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:33,750
Oh, right!

1256
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,670
Dream on.
Mr. Artit doesn't love her.

1257
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,050
It's only your mistress
who's lusting after him

1258
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:41,210
even though he doesn't want her.
What a shameless!

1259
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,300
- What? Spit it out! Say it!
- Stop

1260
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:47,130
I won't.

1261
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:49,170
Whatever will be, will be.
I've endured this far too long.

1262
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:50,800
Then don't.

1263
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,800
Get out. I'm firing you.

1264
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:53,960
Oh!

1265
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,800
Did you hear what she said?

1266
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,710
Who does she think she is?

1267
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,380
Do you own this place?

1268
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:01,420
You're just living here.

1269
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:04,960
I'm not surprised

1270
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,550
why your parents
are in such a hurry to die.

1271
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,460
Look at their daughter.
Who can stand her?

1272
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,670
Let's go. It stinks around here.

1273
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:17,960
What stinks?

1274
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,710
Rabid dogs.

1275
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,710
Paeng!

1276
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,460
Let her have it Paeng!
Give her your best shot.

1277
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,590
Let me go!

1278
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:31,920
My head!

1279
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:34,090
You want to fight me?

1280
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:36,000
- Do you?
- Come here.

1281
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,210
MIss Paeng, don't.
I'll squash her myself.

1282
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,880
- Stop!
- There you go!

1283
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,500
You crazy girl!
How could you do that?

1284
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:56,960
Come and get it if you don't want
to live to old age.

1285
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,340
She's gone crazy!

1286
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,170
Yes, I'm crazy
and I can be even crazier than this.

1287
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:03,880
What's next?

1288
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,590
Go ahead, Miss Paeng!

1289
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:11,050
Stop! Stop right now!

1290
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:14,630
Madam!

1291
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:17,420
Please help me!

1292
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,170
Here. I'll feed you.

1293
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,800
- Oh!
- Aren't you a little too serious?

1294
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,050
Some things are acceptable
and some aren't, Artit.

1295
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:42,090
Go gather Paeng's things
and dump them outside.

1296
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:45,750
Since you're throwing my stuff out,
I'm going to throw yours too.

1297
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,000
Stop that!

1298
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:48,500
If I do this, things will escalate.

1299
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:51,250
So Paeng can finally get over you.

1300
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:53,840
I'm not going to keep
enduring this anymore, Aueng.

1301
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,710
Go wherever you want
and do whatever you please.

1302
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:56,920
I'm not going to care
about you anymore!

1303
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,380
We're engaged.
We're going to get married.

1304
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:01,090
- Don't take Artit from me!
- Paeng, calm down!

1305
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:03,630
Your mine. Don't ever cheat on me

1306
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:05,750
and don't mess around with
other girls. I won't accept it.

1307
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,340
You're really not making any sense!

1308
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,590
It's like talking to a crazy person.
