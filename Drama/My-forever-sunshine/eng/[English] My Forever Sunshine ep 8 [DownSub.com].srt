1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,840
Kot!

3
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,879
Are you happy to see me?

4
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,050
I'm very happy!

5
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,129
Seeing her be happy
with the person she loves

6
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,460
makes me happy too.

7
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,090
Wise but heartbreaking.

8
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,500
You couldn't seduce me
so you're seducing my friend?

9
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,250
You can't stand not
having a guy in your life?

10
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,460
Snake! Snake!

11
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,800
- Snake! Snake!
- Paeng.

12
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
Because for some things,
if you wait too long,

13
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,840
you might miss it. You might have
to wait for the rest of your life.

14
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm not eating anymore!

15
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:13,090
Are you trying to be a ringleader?

16
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:16,090
She started a mob.
I saw it with my own eyes.

17
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,000
Where's Paeng?

18
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,250
Your papaya salad and
grilled pork are the best!

19
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,629
Papaya salad and grilled pork,

20
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,340
these are all my favorites!

21
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,129
Thank you, Pong.

22
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,300
Tell me if you want anything.

23
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:40,960
Your wish is my command.

24
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,090
Miss Paeng, Could I have some more?

25
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,960
Hold on, Saeb!

26
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,460
I'm an old man. I should go first.

27
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,460
You don't even have teeth.
Give it to me.

28
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,800
Potty mouth. Put it down
or I'll beat you up.

29
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,300
Easy there. No need to argue.

30
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,210
Everyone will be served.

31
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,550
I'll do my best to make sure

32
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,000
it's so delicious that you won't
want to leave.

33
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,919
- Yes!
- Hooray!

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a shame Artit won't
let us work for her.

35
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,169
Or we'd be able to eat
like this every day.

36
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,960
Lately, Thongkhum's been cooking

37
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,840
the same thing every day.
I can't stomach it anymore.

38
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,090
That's right.

39
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:16,250
Seriously,

40
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,879
Artit should be a bit
more open-handed.

41
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,379
I don't know why he's
so angry with Paeng.

42
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,379
Now we're in trouble for that too.

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,500
Greetings, sir.

44
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:29,000
What, Pong?

45
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:30,629
Why?

46
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:33,300
Do you think Artit would come here,
right now?

47
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,459
Impossible. I'm not buying it.

48
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,800
- Saeb.
- Saeb, Saeb.

49
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,300
That voice is just like him.

50
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,000
That's a great imitation.

51
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,250
Let me turn around
and see who he is.

52
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,589
Saeb!

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,589
The face and voice are the same.

54
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,089
The power of my kick
is the same too.

55
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,379
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

56
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,339
- I'm sorry, sir!
- He could bust your face.

57
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,500
That's right. You all worship her.

58
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,209
But be careful.
You might get poisoned.

59
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:05,339
How do you know
I'm going to poison them?

60
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,500
You're clever!

61
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,879
I'm not.

62
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,839
But I know your true colors.

63
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,420
I was being sarcastic.

64
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,800
Did you fall for that?

65
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,250
Then you're not clever.

66
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,250
Sir, she insulted you
for being stupid!

67
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,589
I know that!

68
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,750
Where did you get those papayas?

69
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,420
Uhh... from this tree.

70
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,209
- Duang.
- Yes?

71
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:29,500
Throw them all out.

72
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,879
Okay, sir.

73
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,420
Hey! Don't.

74
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,459
Don't you dare touch
my papaya salad!

75
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:37,920
Who says it's yours?

76
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,670
You picked these papayas

77
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,800
from a tree grown on my farm.

78
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,709
So that means they're mine.

79
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:48,300
The eggplants and chilies as well.

80
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,459
Don't ever take my stuff again.

81
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,879
You're being unreasonable.

82
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,339
Why? It's my nature.

83
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,339
If you don't like it, then get out!

84
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,920
Paeng started a mob?

85
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:06,459
That's right.

86
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,879
Nonsense.

87
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:13,500
How could you believe Duang?
You know they don't get along.

88
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,050
But I believe her.

89
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,250
Be careful. She might take
over the farm one day.

90
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,879
She wouldn't do that.

91
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:22,339
Why wouldn't she?

92
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,800
She already had Artit's
farmhands working for her.

93
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,379
Good thing Artit took them
back just in time.

94
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,459
So no one's helping her at all?

95
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,500
That's right. No one.

96
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm putting my foot down.

97
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,839
You cannot touch anything
on this farm.

98
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,550
You cannot fraternize
with my workers either.

99
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,209
What about me?

100
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,500
Can she fraternize with me?

101
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,379
It's getting out of hand.

102
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,089
I'd like to tell you all that

103
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,300
you can help Paeng.

104
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:00,800
You have my permission.

105
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,300
Dad,

106
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,959
but I'm their boss.

107
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,800
If you do this, then you're
undermining me.

108
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:09,800
But

109
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:12,500
I'm the father of their boss.

110
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:15,209
Who has more power?

111
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,670
That's true, Pong.

112
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,959
That's true.

113
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Saeb, Aod, Kaew.

114
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,750
From now on, if Paeng needs help,

115
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,300
go help her right away.

116
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,670
I permit you. No need to be
scared of anyone.

117
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,209
Dad!

118
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,209
Tell me the truth, Thongkhum.

119
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,459
How many days in a row did you

120
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:49,800
make chili paste and
boiled vegetables with omelet?

121
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:52,750
Uh, well...

122
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,800
Don't make a big deal out of this.

123
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,709
It's a balanced meal.

124
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,589
I think the farmhands
are just being difficult.

125
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,839
I think you should let
Thongkhum answer.

126
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,920
What do you say?

127
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,920
How many times did you make that?

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,550
- Five.
- Five meals?

129
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,879
Five days.

130
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,089
- Huh?
- What?

131
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,170
Five days?

132
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,420
So that's fifteen meals?

133
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,050
Oh, dear me!

134
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,089
Thongkhum, did you cook anything
else for them?

135
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Some days I make clear soup.

136
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,590
Oh, dear.

137
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,549
Aren't you bored of it too?

138
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,669
Well, I don't eat with them.

139
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,919
- Oh?
- Oh?

140
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:43,879
You vary the menu for yourself.
Think about their feelings.

141
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,299
That's right.

142
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:48,000
Try putting yourself
in their shoes for a change.

143
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,840
These farmhands work hard.
They deserve good food.

144
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:53,710
Think about it.

145
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,549
If you had to eat the same thing
every day, how would you feel?

146
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,840
You wouldn't like it either.

147
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,549
Treat others how you would like
to b treated.

148
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:08,799
This time

149
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,549
I'll let it slide.

150
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,169
Next time, don't do it.

151
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,549
Don't do it again.

152
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:16,379
Understood.

153
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,879
- You can go now.
- Okay, Madam.

154
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:23,049
How could she do that for
fifteen meals straight?

155
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:24,500
Really!

156
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,090
I'm so unlucky.

157
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,340
Who told Master?

158
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,750
Probably a worker.

159
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,169
A worker?

160
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,090
Would they dare?
I cook for them every day.

161
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,919
That's true?

162
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,340
Who'd want to pick a fight
with the cook?

163
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,879
Oh! What if it was Paeng?

164
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,049
Definitely.

165
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,549
She's the only one who would
want to pick a fight with us.

166
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,460
She must be angry
that we insulted her

167
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,090
so she took revenge.

168
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,960
Rotten Paeng!

169
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:07,049
I won't let you get away with this!

170
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,419
Me neither.

171
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,919
An eye for an eye.

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,500
Otherwise, don't call me Duang.

173
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:21,879
Now that's food! Sun-dried pork
with mushroom Tom-Yum soup.

174
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:25,340
The omelet has now been reborn.

175
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,629
Don't haunt us anymore! Sathu!

176
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,049
No more ghosts of chili paste
and boiled vegetables.

177
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:34,549
That's right. I hope those menu
items are gone for a long while.

178
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:35,750
Extra pork, please.

179
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,710
Okay. I'm serving it to you.

180
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,879
Here. Is that enough?

181
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:42,049
I'm sorry

182
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:45,169
for making you all eat the same
thing over and over again.

183
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,879
From now on, if you want
to eat anything,

184
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,379
just tell me!

185
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,629
- So satisfying!
- Really?

186
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,840
Really.

187
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,750
Then tomorrow
I'd like some tasty larb.

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,129
Your wish is granted.

189
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,299
Awesome!

190
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:03,419
You do it yourself.
Take as much as you want.

191
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,799
Quick! Quick!

192
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:08,340
Thongkhum, what are you thinking?

193
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:10,250
It's good.

194
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,840
But aren't you tired?

195
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,549
I'm tired

196
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:17,669
but I have to because I don't
want a repeat of yesterday.

197
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,460
That's right.

198
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,210
Thongkhum and I

199
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:24,250
don't want the farmhands
messing around with Paeng.

200
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:26,210
She's so promiscuous.

201
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,590
Do you remember
when she tried to assault Artit?

202
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:31,090
- I do.
- That's right.

203
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,090
Once she sees a man,
she can't leave them alone.

204
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:35,669
Watch out for your husband.

205
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,549
She wouldn't have a farmhand
as her husband.

206
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:40,250
You can't underestimate her.

207
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,419
She always makes those eyes when
she talks to the farmhands.

208
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,919
She's evil.

209
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,549
Okay.

210
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,960
All done, Uncle.

211
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,210
Today I've improved
and fermented the soil.

212
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,250
As for the product research lab,

213
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm just waiting on the contractor

214
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,250
Oh! You got it?

215
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,669
They're coming tomorrow?

216
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,169
Yes!

217
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,090
Thank you.

218
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:13,750
Paeng,

219
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,549
is the contractor coming?

220
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,419
That's right. They're coming to
pick up the blueprints tomorrow.

221
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:20,669
Excellent!

222
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,590
So, they're going
to start right away?

223
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:25,629
I'll tell them to start right away.

224
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,960
So the job will be done quickly

225
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,960
and I won't have to be an unwanted
presence for much longer.

226
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,879
I feel uncomfortable too.

227
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,340
It's going to take two years.

228
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:38,129
Two years can pass by quickly.

229
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,379
But it can also feel
like a long time.

230
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,879
So that's why we have
to stay focused.

231
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,129
Every second of our time
is valuable.

232
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,250
We have to do our best.

233
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,000
Sathu! I wish
everything goes smoothly!

234
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:11,250
Your face is already red and you're
not even working that hard.

235
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,879
But you're so enthusiastic
when you're getting paid.

236
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,710
Work's never easy. I feel hot too.

237
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,250
- Pong.
- Yes, sir?

238
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,419
Why are you alone?

239
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,210
Where are Saeb, Aod, and Kaew?

240
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:28,210
Uh...

241
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,340
Uh...

242
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:34,210
Those three went to work
for that woman, didn't they?

243
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,049
Aod, do your best!

244
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:40,500
Don't let Paeng down.

245
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:42,340
I know that!

246
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,000
Can we start
with the construction right away?

247
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:47,960
Sure. The plans are very detailed.

248
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,090
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

249
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:52,629
- Aod, Saeb!
- Shoot!

250
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,340
Yes, sir?

251
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,919
You're slacking off at work.

252
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,340
Do you want to get reprimanded?

253
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,500
Well, we're working here.

254
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:05,299
Did you forget that your dad ordered
the two of us to help her?

255
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:07,750
You have my dad's permission

256
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,299
but I didn't say for you
to come and help her.

257
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,669
Come with me.

258
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes, sir.

259
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,799
No, stop right now.

260
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,960
Oh?

261
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,549
These two are my people now.

262
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,000
What are you babbling about?

263
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,919
I pay these two, not you.

264
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,629
But Uncle assigned them to me.
You heard him.

265
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:31,299
My dad is too optimistic,
that's why he fell for your trick.

266
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:34,919
This is real life, Wanfahmai.
We're not playing house.

267
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,250
I don't like the farm
using free labor

268
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,840
especially with something...

269
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:41,379
that will never succeed.

270
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,129
How do you know that it won't?

271
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,590
I'm just getting started.

272
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,919
Because I know you well enough.

273
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,549
Come on. Come with me.

274
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,960
No, you can't!

275
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,169
You have to stay with me!

276
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,379
What should we do, Saeb?

277
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,000
Miss Paeng, Mr. Artit.

278
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,750
Should we try rock-paper-scissors?

279
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,090
Whoever wins will...

280
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:06,460
Oops.

281
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,919
You have to stay with me!

282
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:12,549
You can't go anywhere else!

283
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,590
If you have a problem,
go and talk to Uncle yourself.

284
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,460
Do you remember what he said?

285
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,799
I'll repeat it for you.

286
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,169
Uncle is your father

287
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,919
and also the owner of this place.

288
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,250
In conclusion, he ranks
higher than you.

289
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,960
Don't threaten me with my dad!

290
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,590
Do you think I'm scared?

291
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,000
If you're not,

292
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,129
I'd probably be out of this farm.

293
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,500
But I'm still here.

294
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,340
Alright.

295
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,129
I'll show you
who's the boss of this place.

296
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,960
Oh, wow!

297
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,129
You can't even
win an argument with me!

298
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:57,629
Oh!

299
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,419
Let's get back to work.
Don't care about him.

300
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,960
- Okay.
- Right away.

301
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,960
This way, please.

302
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,840
It's him!

303
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,590
Miss Paeng! Watch out!

304
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:19,840
- What, Saeb? I can't hear you?
- Watch out!

305
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:22,750
Miss Paeng! Watch out!

306
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,049
What is it?

307
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,710
Saeb! Help me!

308
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,169
Saeb! Saeb!

309
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,879
Run, Miss Paeng. Run!

310
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,710
Artit, calm down!

311
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,049
Come on!

312
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,419
Artit!

313
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,340
Saeb!

314
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:57,960
Hurry up, Paeng!

315
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,250
Saeb! Help me!

316
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,670
Saeb! Saeb!

317
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:08,130
Saeb!

318
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,000
- Go!
- Come on, Saeb!

319
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,089
Miss Paeng!

320
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,920
- Miss Paeng!
- Are you okay?

321
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,839
I'm okay.

322
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,089
I wasn't hurt.

323
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,460
I wasn't hurt!

324
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,170
Come on.

325
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:57,750
Pong,

326
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,670
can we harvest these grapes
according to the order?

327
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,250
- Yes, sir.
- What about the quality?

328
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,799
- Definitely up to standard.
- Good.

329
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:07,799
I'm meeting a client.

330
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,839
- Take care of the transportation.
- Yes, sir.

331
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,799
- What are you looking for?
- Yes.

332
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,299
- Pong!
- Yes?

333
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,920
I asked what you're looking for.

334
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:19,170
For a dog.

335
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,880
What dog?

336
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,799
This morning Miss Paeng
was bitten by a dog.

337
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,130
What a vicious dog.

338
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,799
Her knees are all scratched.

339
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,589
This dog only acts tough

340
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,210
towards children, women,
and the elderly.

341
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:36,460
If I ever see this dog,

342
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,210
I'll give it a swift kick
to the butt.

343
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,670
Bad dog!

344
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,880
Oh, I got carried away.

345
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:48,500
Aren't you in a hurry
to get to your meeting?

346
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,960
Pong,

347
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,670
be careful.
You might get bitten as well.

348
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,630
I think it might be a rabid dog too.

349
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,799
- Pong!
- Yes, sir!

350
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,299
Is it underneath the car?

351
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,420
Artit!

352
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,589
Artit! Artit!

353
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:16,130
Artit!

354
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,880
What now?

355
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,339
How can you go?

356
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,170
Your tires are flat.

357
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:24,630
Gosh!

358
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,380
The other side as well.

359
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,549
What?

360
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:40,049
Who would dare do this?

361
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,299
There's only one person.

362
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:46,670
Who?

363
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,670
The dog!

364
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,299
That dog again!

365
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,799
Not only did it bite Miss Paeng,

366
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,170
but it chewed on the tires as well.

367
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,670
Better hope it doesn't run into me.
I'll kick it's back legs out.

368
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,799
- Pong.
- It even chewed on the tires.

369
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,960
Give me the keys to your car.

370
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,750
You're in a hurry
to get to the meeting?

371
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,799
Change the tires too.

372
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,960
Yes, sir.

373
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,750
Okay.

374
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,549
Need to lure it out.

375
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:18,089
Gosh, Miss Paeng!

376
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,920
Taking revenge like that,
aren't you scared?

377
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,049
You know how I am.

378
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,420
If I let it go, then he'll
think I'm scared.

379
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,589
And we'll always get bullied.

380
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,549
But aren't you scared
that he'll get you back?

381
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:32,210
I'm not scared.

382
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,130
Gosh!

383
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,339
If you're not, then come here!

384
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,380
- Mr. Artit!
- Let me go!

385
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,299
- Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!
- Artit!

386
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,960
- Aueng, help me!
- Miss Paeng!

387
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,299
Oh, no!

388
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,460
- Miss Paeng!
- Help me!

389
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:48,710
You punctured my tires, didn't you?

390
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,880
Get in!

391
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,960
- Miss Paeng!
- Get in!

392
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,750
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

393
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,960
- Miss Paeng!
- Aueng!

394
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,130
Let Miss Paeng go!

395
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,000
Stay still!

396
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,210
Be still!

397
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,630
What are you going to do to her?

398
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,920
If my dad hears about this,

399
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,380
your boss will be missing
some limbs on her return.

400
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,299
Okay.

401
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,960
Miss Paeng!

402
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,210
Artit!

403
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,589
I thought you weren't scared?

404
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:46,420
Alright.

405
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,960
Artit!

406
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,500
Okay.

407
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,049
Do you still dare to defy me?

408
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:19,630
You're not remorseful, are you?

409
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,049
Okay, then!

410
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:45,299
Hey! Hey!

411
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,460
Hold on!

412
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,750
Unlock it!

413
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:55,420
Not yet! Not yet!

414
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,000
Get down!

415
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,460
Are you ready to keep going?

416
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,799
Where are we going?

417
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:09,630
To your murder in the woods.

418
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,339
I thought you're not scared.

419
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:14,670
Your eyes are bulging.

420
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,049
I'm not scared. Death is death.

421
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,549
If you want me to die,
then I'm okay with it.

422
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,460
Are you being cheeky?

423
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,630
But I hope you can
get away from the cops.

424
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,049
Do you still dare to threaten me?

425
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,839
I wasn't threatening you.
You'd go to jail for your crime.

426
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,049
What about you?

427
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,089
Oh, maybe a woman raping
a man doesn't have to go to jail?

428
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,630
Artit, you're going too far.
I wasn't going to rape you.

429
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,170
That was rape.

430
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,089
Back then, I...

431
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,799
You what?

432
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,460
You what?

433
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,589
You can't even say it?

434
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,799
I was young!

435
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,960
So that's why you
didn't have to go to jail?

436
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,670
Then call the cops
so they can throw me in jail.

437
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,670
How many times will you keep
shaming me for that?

438
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,710
With your thick skin,
I'm sure you don't feel a thing.

439
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,839
Just stab me if you're
going to be that harsh.

440
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,880
- Alright.
- Artit! Artit!

441
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,589
- Don't!
- Let go!

442
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,339
No!

443
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,500
Let go!

444
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,460
If you don't want to die
a premature death,

445
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,880
then don't ever touch me again!

446
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,460
- Get in!
- What?

447
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,170
I'd like the grape festival
this year to be extra special.

448
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,710
There'll be wine tasting.

449
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,210
So that grape-lovers can taste
our newest wine.

450
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,049
What's even more special,

451
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:56,210
they will be able to mix the wine
flavors the way they want.

452
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,920
That's a good idea.

453
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,839
This will attract high-end tourists.

454
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,549
If the customers are satisfied
or want to order more,

455
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,549
we'll also offer a delivery service.

456
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,839
Excellent. It's convenient this way.

457
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,049
That's right.

458
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,089
And this is...

459
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,960
Hey.

460
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,750
Where are you going?

461
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,210
Come here.

462
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,549
Hey!

463
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,880
Artit, let me go.
I can walk on my own.

464
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,049
No, or you'll run away again.

465
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,960
You're hungry, aren't you?

466
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,750
I'm not.

467
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,170
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

468
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:30,089
I'd like some crispy pork
and sausages.

469
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,420
Here it is.

470
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,420
Wow!

471
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,710
It's so tasty!

472
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,920
Yum!

473
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm so full.

474
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:07,670
Artit...

475
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:13,049
So many leftovers.

476
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,049
Here.

477
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,460
Here, you.

478
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,960
Eat up.

479
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,130
Eat lots, doggie.

480
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:29,630
You're so cute.

481
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,049
Waiter, payment for
the food is here.

482
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,299
Are you coming to the car?
Or are you going to walk back?

483
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:23,630
Why did you drive into a pothole?

484
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,710
I didn't see it.

485
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:27,960
Even I saw it! Are you stupid?

486
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,839
What are you going to do now?

487
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,920
Get out!

488
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,000
If I do, then how am I going
to make my way back?

489
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,170
Who told you to go back?

490
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,049
You're going to push.

491
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,839
What?

492
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,460
Get out!

493
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,799
Go!

494
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:56,089
- Ready?
- Ready!

495
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,799
Push harder!

496
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,089
This is all you've got?

497
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,799
Find something
to lever the wheels up.

498
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,920
Hurry up!

499
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,299
Yes!

500
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,380
Go sit in the back.

501
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:40,880
You're dirty.

502
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,630
Go!

503
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:08,420
Artit,

504
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,170
I didn't tell anyone.

505
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,089
Where did you leave Paeng?

506
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,799
What?

507
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,960
Get down.

508
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,210
Miss Paeng!

509
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,549
You're still alive!

510
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,710
But how did you end up like that?

511
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,799
It's fun taking revenge.

512
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,549
Have a think

513
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,839
about how you're
going to get back to me.

514
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,049
Because I'll be thinking about

515
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,500
how I'm going to
get back to you too.

516
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,589
Careful.

517
00:31:58,339 --> 00:31:59,420
Psycho!

518
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:12,130
I've returned her
with all her limbs intact,

519
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:13,630
just as I promised.

520
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,799
Yes, sir.

521
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,589
Wait for me, Miss Paeng.

522
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,799
He didn't even let you eat anything?

523
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:29,670
Here you go.

524
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,089
Not only did he not let me eat,

525
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,710
but he fed a dog in front of me too.

526
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,000
Whoa.

527
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,460
What did you do to him?

528
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,380
I warned you but you didn't listen.

529
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,799
There!

530
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,130
You saw it.

531
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,299
He hurt me first.

532
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,630
And is it worth it to be continually
getting back at each other?

533
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,670
And when will Artit forgive you?

534
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,710
Oh, Aueng!

535
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,049
Please stop mentioning that name!
I'm stressed!

536
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,799
So stressed!

537
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:09,089
Drink up.

538
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,880
There, there. Some more water.

539
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,500
Why did I open it?

540
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,839
I don't know how to fix it anyway.

541
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,549
That's true.

542
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,049
Here.

543
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,960
Let me give you a lift.

544
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,670
It's okay.

545
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,250
I can call Artit.

546
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,460
I'm right in front of you

547
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,590
but you won't even let me help.

548
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,250
Do you really hate me?

549
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,210
No, Non. I've never hated you.

550
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,800
Then get in my car.
I'll drop you off.

551
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,960
- It's okay.
- Ling,

552
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,090
don't refuse a friend's kindness.

553
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,250
Don't overthink it.

554
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,880
Follow me.

555
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,460
Those apples look tasty.

556
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,210
You can't eat them.
They're for Artit.

557
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,880
What's this? Huh?

558
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,710
You're giving them to Artit again?

559
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,300
He's got heaps on his farm.

560
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,960
Mine are tastier.

561
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,880
I'll win him over
with my hospitality.

562
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,420
Hey,

563
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,710
Artit's already got a girlfriend.

564
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,340
Stop messing around
with him. It looks bad.

565
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,460
He can still break up with her.
He's not even married.

566
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,090
But even if he is,
he can still divorce.

567
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,670
Hey, give that to me.

568
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,420
You're going too far.
Who taught you this?

569
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,130
Hey.

570
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,800
Non,

571
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,050
stop acting like an old geezer.
It's annoying.

572
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,670
You're my sister.

573
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,550
Artit and Ling are my friends.

574
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,710
I can't let you do this.

575
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,840
You worry more about other people
more than you do your own sister?

576
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,000
I'm actually worried about you.

577
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,750
Other people might think
of you in a bad way.

578
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,000
I don't care.

579
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,170
I have the right to choose
and so does Artit.

580
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,500
It's the freedom of the heart.

581
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,880
Do you understand?

582
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,590
But freedom

583
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,170
must also be based on morales.
Do you understand?

584
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,840
I'm here! Non! Nang!

585
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,170
You two, what lovely sibling
moment are you having?

586
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,550
- What?
- Non, this is my happiness.

587
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,710
Don't be selfish.

588
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,840
You're getting carried away. I have
to stop you when you're wrong.

589
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,340
So what? It's my business.
Understand?

590
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,340
And how am I selfish?

591
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,590
Everything.

592
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,800
- Let me go.
- You can't go.

593
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,710
- No one hears me when I talk.
- Still not letting me go?

594
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,880
- Oh, my. I'm probably...
- No!

595
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,710
This chance is within my reach.

596
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,250
- What am I...
- This looks delicious!

597
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,880
He can look after himself...

598
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Whoa, so fresh!

599
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,050
Kot!

600
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,300
- What?
- I have to do it again!

601
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,460
- Why?
- Kot, you jerk!

602
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,050
What did I do wrong?

603
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,050
- You didn't. You did well.
- Right?

604
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,420
Shrimp paste, sugar, fine sugar.

605
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,420
Paeng said to buy snacks
for the farmhands.

606
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,170
And then...

607
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,670
Household items.

608
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,210
That should be all.

609
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,460
Let's go.

610
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,000
Hey!

611
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,710
You little brat! Hey!

612
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,130
Hey! You brat!

613
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,960
Hey! Stop!

614
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,340
Saeb, catch that kid!

615
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,090
Where are you going?

616
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,960
Don't let him get away!

617
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,750
- Oh!
- Catch him!

618
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,460
Stop, Madeaw!

619
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,380
Madeaw,

620
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,300
do you know stealing is bad?

621
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,670
I know!

622
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,590
Then what are you going
to use that money for?

623
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,550
To buy toys.

624
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,250
Why didn't you ask your mom?

625
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,920
I did. Mom wouldn't give me any.

626
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,250
So you stole?

627
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,840
Madeaw, this is my money.

628
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,500
If you took it,
how could I buy the stuff I need?

629
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,800
If someone stole your money,

630
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,210
how would you feel?

631
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,840
I don't have any to begin with.

632
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,250
Really!

633
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,920
Don't waste time. He's naughty.

634
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,710
- He won't listen anyway.
- That's right.

635
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,090
You have to whip him.

636
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,500
But if you don't want to do it,
then tell his mom.

637
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,630
No!

638
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,630
Wow, you're scared of your mom?

639
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,460
That's good then.

640
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,340
Let's go and tell your mom!
She'll hit you if she knows.

641
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,590
No! Don't go!

642
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,210
No! No!

643
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,500
Don't go! Don't tell Mom!

644
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,750
Now you're powerless.

645
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,840
Madeaw, don't cry anymore.

646
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,050
If you want money,
I'll give you some.

647
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,050
Miss Paeng!

648
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,500
Do you know there are lots
of ways to earn money?

649
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,210
If you work and don't steal,

650
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,340
you won't be punished or scolded.

651
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,250
Remember, next time
if you want money,

652
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,800
you have to come and tell me.

653
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,300
It's a promise.

654
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,300
You're so lovely, Miss Paeng!

655
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,170
Paeng!

656
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,960
Madeaw!

657
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,840
Why did you steal?

658
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,340
I don't have money.

659
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,920
How many times have you done this?

660
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,460
It's the first time.

661
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,550
What about the money I gave you?
Where is it?

662
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,420
I gave it all to my mom.

663
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,960
Aren't you afraid that your mom and
grandmom will be sad if they know?

664
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,500
Grandmom is sick

665
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,420
so I gave the money to Mom.

666
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,630
I want Grandmom to get better.

667
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,670
Why didn't you tell me?

668
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,920
Hey,

669
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,250
I'll take your grandmom
to the doctor.

670
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,590
Don't worry, okay?

671
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,170
Really?

672
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,710
Really.

673
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,050
I'll do my best to take beautiful
photos for you, Artit!

674
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,630
Don't be too loud.
Someone might hear us.

675
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,550
Alright?

676
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,460
I made you lunch.

677
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,300
Thank you, Ling.

678
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,920
I feel so guilty.

679
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,550
Don't be.

680
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,880
Try it.

681
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,550
I'll go ahead then.

682
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,460
Wow!

683
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,550
What are you planning to do?

684
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,840
I'm thinking of turning it into a
center for all things rose-related.

685
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,250
Not just grow them here,

686
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,960
but I'll produce
things made from roses.

687
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,590
Uncle trusted me.

688
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,460
So I want to give it my all.
I don't want to disappoint him.

689
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,710
You've changed a lot.

690
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,090
You've matured and are more skilled.

691
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,960
How do you know?

692
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,590
Judging from how you taught Madeaw.

693
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:22,210
You've also matured
and are a lot more beautiful.

694
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,550
Non and Kot have got
a lot more handsome too.

695
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,880
Everyone's changed for the better.

696
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,880
Except for Artit.

697
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,840
It's true. He's changed a lot.

698
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,670
His face has aged a lot.

699
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,960
But how is he going to stop that?

700
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,340
He keeps frowning and twisting
his face all day long.

701
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,050
Please remind him to not
throw too many tantrums.

702
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,250
He might die prematurely
from cancer.

703
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,300
You might die prematurely from
gossiping too much.

704
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,500
Artit.

705
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,130
Ling, if you want to
make merit, just tell me.

706
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,960
I'll take you to feed some dogs.

707
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,500
They're more grateful than humans.

708
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,840
Potty mouth!

709
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,300
Come on, Artit.

710
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,710
Why aren't you going back to work?

711
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,340
Well, I've missed you.

712
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,840
I'm full now.

713
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,380
Hold on. How can you be full?

714
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,960
You only had a few bites.

715
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:18,670
Let her be.

716
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,130
You're too kind.

717
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:24,380
You can't expect anything in return
from certain kinds of people.

718
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,000
Once you give in
and start pitying them,

719
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,590
they'll stab you in the back.

720
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,670
It happened to me before.
I'm warning you because I'm worried.

721
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,880
You've gone too far, Artit.

722
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,300
I don't think so.

723
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,960
She deserves it. There she goes.

724
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,550
These look tasty.

725
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,170
Can I have some? Let me eat too.

726
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,250
I made these for Paeng, not you.

727
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,250
I'm hungry. I've been
working really hard.

728
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,550
You jerk.

729
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,340
You keep following me around.

730
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,000
Did you make these yourself?

731
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,960
Happy, aren't you?

732
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,670
Smiling from ear to ear.

733
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,880
Do you want to eat with me?

734
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,340
It's so good.

735
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,630
So happy.

736
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,210
Yum!

737
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,130
I made these for Paeng.

738
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,750
She walked away.
So they're for me now.

739
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,170
I drove her away because of this.

740
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,130
Cheep,

741
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,550
I have something to
talk to you about.

742
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,250
Once you start preparing,

743
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,590
please add more food
and beverage kiosks

744
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,380
because there might be
more guests that day.

745
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,750
- Please handle this for me.
- Okay.

746
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,960
Hello.

747
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,750
Hello, Non.

748
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,550
Are you here to see my dad?

749
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,920
He's not here today.
He's got a meeting somewhere.

750
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,590
I'm here to see you.

751
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,550
You're going to share the festival
with my farm this year?

752
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,420
That's right.
I discussed it with Artit.

753
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,090
But as for the details, I still have
to meet up with a lot of people.

754
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,840
Paeng also told me that you helped

755
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,210
look at the construction plans
for the rose garden, right?

756
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,170
That's right. But Paeng's plans
are already good.

757
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,840
I just gave her some advice.

758
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,050
I don't have a lot of time.

759
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,880
If you do,

760
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,960
please help me look after her.

761
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,500
Don't worry.

762
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,710
I'll do my best to help her, anyway.

763
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,670
I'll give you a tour
of the festival space.

764
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:32,920
Please, this way.

765
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,460
Jook.

766
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,880
Hello, Mr. Artit.

767
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,210
Where's your mom?

768
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,170
She's inside.

769
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,550
Take me to her.

770
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,800
Okay, sir.

771
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,340
Hello.

772
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,300
How are you doing?

773
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,210
I'm much better now.

774
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:13,920
Jook, has she gotten better?

775
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,050
She was a lot worse two days ago.

776
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,880
Her asthma was acting up and
she couldn't sleep.

777
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,250
So I bought her some medication.

778
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,250
What medication?

779
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,670
- Uh...
- And

780
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,920
why hasn't anyone told me?

781
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,090
She told me not to.

782
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:31,800
Why not?

783
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,500
You've already helped us so much.

784
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,130
I'm was trying to be considerate.

785
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,960
You're in my care.
I have to look after you.

786
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,500
Why do you have to be considerate?

787
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,210
I haven't worked
for a year or so now.

788
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,590
That's unrelated.

789
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,000
You used to work for us.

790
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,840
You never left us,
even when we're struggling.

791
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,710
I consider it as a debt
we owe you for helping us.

792
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,800
Today,

793
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,800
you've fallen sick
and you need treatment.

794
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,550
If I don't take care of you, how can
I consider myself a human?

795
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,300
You didn't tell me.

796
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,340
If you get worse,

797
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,170
I'll be even more worried.

798
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,420
Next time, please let me
know if there's anything you need.

799
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,340
Okay. I won't do that anymore.

800
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,300
I didn't think you're in trouble.

801
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,130
I forgot that Jook's working alone.

802
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,670
From now on, I'll give you a salary.

803
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,500
Jook, come and get them from me.

804
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,920
Okay, sir.

805
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,300
I can't accept it.

806
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,170
If others know,

807
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,130
they might bad-mouth you.

808
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,590
I'm very transparent
in how I treat my people.

809
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,250
Don't worry.

810
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,420
Jook,

811
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,210
where did you buy the medication?

812
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,710
From the market, sir.

813
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,550
Bring me the medication

814
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,250
and help me bring
your mom to my car.

815
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,590
I'm taking her to the doctor.

816
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,670
Thank you!

817
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,590
You're welcome.

818
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,630
Next, come and get your payment.

819
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,130
Our paychecks are here!

820
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,130
Hey, who's interested in going
into town and to eat Mala with me?

821
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,670
Saeb,

822
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,800
do you dare to eat Mahler now?

823
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,210
Not Mahler!

824
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,880
Mala! It's Mala, Chinese food.

825
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,590
I'm coming.

826
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:10,800
But first,

827
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,550
I have to get some new threads.

828
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,340
I'm not coming.

829
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,800
I have a date.
We're watching a movie.

830
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,880
You all spend
your paychecks right away

831
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,630
and don't save any.

832
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,340
When are you going to be rich?

833
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,920
Are you not coming?

834
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,000
You're going to stay home and
fill your piggy bank?

835
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,210
Of course I am.

836
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,090
But I'm not going to eat
Mahler whatever that is.

837
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,750
I'm going to have a hamburger.

838
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,300
Hamburger?

839
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,380
For you, the bread for the fish
at the temple is considered posh.

840
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,210
I'm not a catfish. I'm a human.

841
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,380
- Really!
- Pong, your turn.

842
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,090
Here's your paycheck.

843
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,590
- Gladly, sir.
- There he goes.

844
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,300
Here it comes.

845
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,210
Receiving before signing.

846
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,380
The envelope?

847
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:04,880
Where's mine, sir?

848
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,130
- Mine too.
- Also mine.

849
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:17,710
Pack it up.

850
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,000
- What about Mala?
- Mala?

851
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:21,500
- Mala?
- Mala?

852
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,250
I didn't even get paid!

853
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,130
- Artit!
- Sir!

854
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,920
Saeb, Aod, Kaew.

855
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:37,840
I thought you said
you were going into town?

856
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,210
Oh?

857
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,210
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

858
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,710
Calm down, Paeng!

859
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,670
Artit!

860
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,170
- Artit!
- Paeng!

861
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,000
Artit! Come out and talk to me!

862
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,340
- Artit!
- Calm down, Paeng!

863
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,420
Artit!

864
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,420
What's up?

865
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,630
Why didn't you pay them their wages?

866
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,920
It's against the Labor Law.

867
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,340
Apart from studying agriculture,

868
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,380
you've studied the law as well?

869
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,210
I'm not paying.

870
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:24,630
Because these three
aren't my employees anymore.

871
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,380
Even if they're working for me,

872
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,710
they're still the farm's employees.

873
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,750
If they're not working for me,

874
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,420
then don't expect me to pay.

875
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,710
You all asked for it.

876
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,460
Everyone,

877
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,300
see this as an example.

878
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,460
If you want to work for me,
don't betray me like they did.

879
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:50,090
Are you going to play this way?

880
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,670
But then again,

881
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,170
it's your first mistake,

882
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,130
I'll forgive you.

883
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,460
Are you going to come back
and work for me?

884
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,420
What should we do, Saeb?

885
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:15,710
Saeb,

886
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,000
how much is your wage?

887
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,500
I get 3,000 baht.

888
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,090
I'll give you 3,500 baht.

889
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,500
Whoa!

890
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,170
You don't have to go anywhere.

891
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,710
Stay with me.

892
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,130
I'll look after you.

893
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,500
- Thank you, Miss Paeng.
- Thank you.

894
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:06,880
- I'm rich!
- That's right!

895
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,300
Working for Miss Paeng is easy!

896
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,550
Most importantly, it's less tiring
than farm work.

897
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:16,170
I earn more.
It's definitely worth it.

898
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,670
We don't have to clock-in. We can
also finish work whenever.

899
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,670
That's right. Miss Paeng
is also generous.

900
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,710
She always brings us food.

901
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,130
Miss Paeng, you're
my guardian angel!

902
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,250
What are you eating?

903
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,840
Share with me.

904
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,420
Miss Paeng,

905
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,670
you took away Mr. Artit's workers.

906
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,670
That's why he's angry.

907
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,170
Of course he is.

908
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:44,340
I saw his eyebrow
twitching like this.

909
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,210
- Like this?
- He picked a fight with me first.

910
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,090
What if Mr. Artit is vengeful

911
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,960
and takes revenge on you again?

912
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,340
If it's about work,

913
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,960
I can take it.

914
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,130
But if he bullies me,

915
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,750
I'll fight him.

916
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,250
From this day forward,
I'm ready for anything!

917
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,420
Bring it on!

918
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,960
Miss Paeng, what's that mob?

919
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,710
- Miss Paeng!
- Hurry up!

920
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,090
- Miss Paeng!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

921
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,710
Miss Paeng, I'd like 3,500 baht too.

922
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,590
I don't want to work for Mr. Artit.
I want to work for you.

923
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,590
- Miss Paeng!
- No.

924
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,380
Calm down!

925
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,000
I warned them but no one listened.

926
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:33,170
Good, Pong.

927
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,880
I'd like to know what
that woman is going to do.

928
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,960
Mr. Artit! Mr. Artit!

929
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,380
Mr. Artit!

930
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,880
The workers wouldn't listen.

931
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,340
Can you please come
and take them back?

932
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,090
I'm not going.

933
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:52,920
Artit, let me apologize
on behalf of Miss Paeng.

934
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,250
Your boss is tough, isn't she?

935
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,050
Let her deal with it herself.

936
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,170
Mr. Artit!

937
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,590
What's going on?

938
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,960
Mr. Krongprateep!

939
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,250
Everyone, calm down.

940
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,090
I can't hire all of you.

941
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,460
You can hire
just some of them.

942
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:19,130
Please hire me.
I'm very hardworking.

943
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,630
I'm hardworking.

944
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:24,710
What should we do?

945
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,420
I don't know either.

946
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,210
But if I hire all of them,
I'll go bankrupt.

947
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:33,210
Everyone,

948
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,590
please go. The three of us are
already enough for her.

949
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,420
- There are no openings.
- That's right.

950
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,300
Saeb, you selfish man!

951
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,670
Uh...

952
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,340
Everyone, calm down!
Please don't fight!

953
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,920
Please go back. I'm begging you.

954
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,050
No, we won't.

955
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,460
- Please hire us.
- Please, Miss Paeng.

956
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:54,710
- Please go back.
- Everyone, stop!

957
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,420
- Master's here.
- Uncle?

958
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,130
Miss Paeng!

959
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,710
Saeb, Aod,

960
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,130
return the money to Paeng.

961
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,300
- Huh?
- Huh?

962
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,880
- Why do we have to do that?
- That's right.

963
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,090
Because you are my employees.

964
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,000
You are the workers of this farm.

965
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,380
You work equally.
You get paid equally.

966
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,300
Go on. Get back to work.

967
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,500
But but Mr. Artit said...

968
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,710
This rose garden also belongs to
the farm.

969
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,550
Paeng is helping me.

970
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,800
I should actually be paying her.

971
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:34,300
Therefore, you have no right to
request payment from her.

972
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,340
Uncle, please don't scold
Saeb and the others.

973
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,420
They didn't start it.

974
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,210
I know.

975
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,880
Don't let a misunderstanding
like this happen again.

976
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:53,170
Can you get back to your work now?

977
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:54,670
Yes, sir.

978
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,920
Come on. Hurry.

979
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,090
Quickly.

980
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:58,920
Now no one got a raise.

981
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:01,300
I'm begging you.

982
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,420
Don't let something like
this happen again.

983
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,840
Come on, Dad.

984
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,710
How can you blame me?

985
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,750
You can deal with it

986
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,460
but you wouldn't.

987
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,050
If you want me to deal with it,

988
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,800
then your niece must
work under me directly.

989
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,460
Hold on.

990
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:28,170
Do you mean I have to
be your subordinate?

991
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,800
You already let me take care of
everything in your place.

992
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,880
If Paeng works for you,

993
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:37,090
then that means she's
my subordinate.

994
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:38,800
Is that right?

995
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,710
Is that right, Dad?

996
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,170
Yes, that is right.

997
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,500
What's all this?

998
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:15,710
Your work schedule.

999
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,460
You're the worker of the farm.

1000
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,170
You have to do something
for the farm too.

1001
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,420
But I'm already working
on the rose garden for Uncle.

1002
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:25,630
The rose garden?

1003
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,340
You don't even know
if that's going to make it.

1004
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,050
I don't count that as work.

1005
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:36,170
From now on, your mornings will be
spent doing the farm's work.

1006
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,340
You can work on
your rose garden in the afternoons.

1007
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,130
Product harvesting,

1008
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,670
feeding the calves,

1009
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,750
daily production record.

1010
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,380
Why do I have to this?

1011
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,800
Because it's the boss' orders.

1012
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,300
You have to do it no matter what.

1013
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:16,170
You saw this as a chance to
cause me problems, didn't you?

1014
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,420
Paeng!

1015
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,460
Kot?

1016
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:13,250
Paeng, darling!

1017
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,090
I have some goodies
to present to you.

1018
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,880
Hurry on in! You can take
a closer look.

1019
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,920
This is an automated
hydroponic grow box.

1020
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,460
You, you, you and you

1021
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:29,880
won't have to bend down
and dig the dirt anymore.

1022
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,340
You only have to put vegetable seeds

1023
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,250
into all these holes,

1024
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,460
then you just plug it in.

1025
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:40,460
Simple. You can control both
the temperature and light.

1026
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:43,380
Then you can just lie down and wait.

1027
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,130
Because now you
will have clean, safe,

1028
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,340
and non-toxic vegetables.

1029
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,170
It really suits your work, Paeng.

1030
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,840
Kot, this is great!

1031
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,800
If it's great, why aren't you
coming closer?

1032
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,960
Step closer

1033
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:04,750
and take this brochure. We still
have many other innovations.

1034
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:09,000
It's all safe and sound.
Here you go. Please.

1035
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:11,670
- You can just eat like this?
- Sure. We've tested it.

1036
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,210
That's right. There are multiple
shelves. Five of them!

1037
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,920
Try it out.

1038
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,420
- It's really nice!
- Very clean and no toxins involved.

1039
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,210
Redo the surface of the dirt.

1040
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,000
- Then you can start planting.
- Yes, sir.

1041
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,210
Alright.

1042
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,550
Mr. Artit, hold on!

1043
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:34,670
Look here. This is very interesting!

1044
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:39,300
Automated hydroponic grow box?

1045
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,000
Nonsense.

1046
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:44,170
Not at all, sir.

1047
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,050
If you have a whole building
for them,

1048
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,880
I guaranteed you it'll work.

1049
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,170
That's right, sir. It really can
be used to grow vegetables.

1050
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:53,210
I know it can.

1051
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:55,090
But it's not suitable for our farm.

1052
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,840
Don't you want to try it out, sir?

1053
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,920
I've seen a grow box in action.

1054
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,170
Where did you see it?

1055
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,000
Miss Paeng, she bought on.

1056
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,630
Not just that,
she bought many things.

1057
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:13,380
It's very sturdy. You're going to
say it's "awesome" when you see it.

1058
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,590
What now?

1059
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:20,090
Awesome!

1060
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,090
It's so cool!

1061
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:30,670
Over there!

1062
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,630
Whoa!

1063
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,050
It can sprinkle water too!

1064
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,250
It's just water right now.

1065
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,380
But we'll use it for fertilizer.

1066
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:43,550
This is so cool.

1067
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:47,460
Much easier than just walking
and spraying the fertilizer.

1068
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,880
Besides, my beautiful skin won't get
stained from the fertilizer either.

1069
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,800
It's going!

1070
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,340
Oh, Miss Paeng.

1071
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,670
Your karmic relation is here.

1072
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,090
Hurry! Hurry!

1073
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:32,420
I'm sorry.

1074
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,960
What a desperate woman!

1075
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,750
How am I desperate?

1076
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,880
You don't even know how to
use your brain.

1077
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:40,550
The drone and the grow box

1078
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:41,840
are wasteful.

1079
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,500
It's you who's not
using their brain.

1080
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,380
Everything I've bought will help cut
back on manpower.

1081
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,590
We can work faster with them.

1082
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:52,130
The drone can cover an area
of eight acres in an hour.

1083
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,800
It will save both manpower and time.

1084
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,000
Do you all agree?

1085
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:56,460
Agreed!

1086
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:59,460
But we have to put
our hearts into farming.

1087
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,500
Not just finish up in an hour.

1088
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,800
Each grapevine and all of
our produce requires our attention.

1089
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,170
And not just aim
to finish work for the day.

1090
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,880
Do you all agree?

1091
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,920
Agreed!

1092
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,840
Then let's just keep the grow boxes.

1093
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,960
- No.
- You're black-hearted!

1094
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,500
Who are you calling black-hearted?

1095
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:20,130
Isn't it true?

1096
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,210
Why don't you consider it from
the point of view of the workers?

1097
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:25,960
It's bad for our health
if we work too hard.

1098
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:28,050
If we can cut back on manpower,

1099
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,460
the farmhands will
have more free time.

1100
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:31,500
Then they can spend that time
with families.

1101
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:35,300
They will be harmonious and their
kids won't feel neglected, right?

1102
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,130
Right! Come on!

1103
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:45,130
Artit, the grow box is really good.

1104
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,670
They will help improve our farm.

1105
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,550
The grow box. Isn't it obvious?

1106
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:54,880
You can't grow grapes,
melons, or mulberries.

1107
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,130
And look, at this farm

1108
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,960
the soil, water,
and the sunlight is great.

1109
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:03,920
Those cabinets need to be plugged in
and temperature control.

1110
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,380
It's a waste of electricity.

1111
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,090
Don't you agree?

1112
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,050
Agreed.

1113
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:16,170
Those things are meant
to be used in the city

1114
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,500
where there is limited space.

1115
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,380
You only have money and no brain.

1116
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,550
Saeb! Saeb!

1117
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:33,300
Miss Paeng,

1118
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,840
Mr. Artit's got a point.

1119
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:42,710
I'll show you that what I bought is
useful on this farm.

1120
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:45,880
It will also give the workers
more time to rest.

1121
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,500
If these things were no good,

1122
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,050
why would I buy them to test out?

1123
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:51,750
Don't you agree?

1124
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:54,710
Right.

1125
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:56,630
Come on! Come here!

1126
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,340
In conclusion,

1127
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,170
you all agree with her
that we should buy these things.

1128
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:16,130
That's right.

1129
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,920
Okay.

1130
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:21,590
I'll let you buy them then.

1131
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,300
Thank you, sir!

1132
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:29,960
But I'll fire everyone!

1133
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,050
Because I won't need
human labor anymore.

1134
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,340
It's a deal, then?

1135
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:39,050
What should we do?

1136
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,300
Everyone's going to lose their job.

1137
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,550
Sir! Sir!

1138
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,250
Quick! Hurry!

1139
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,550
Sir!

1140
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,920
Sir! Sir!

1141
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:07,880
Calm down, sir!

1142
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,460
Calm down, sir!

1143
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,550
Sir!

1144
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,460
Sir, please don't fire us!

1145
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:15,880
If you do, we won't be
able to feed ourselves.

1146
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,590
So do you want to buy them or not?

1147
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:19,960
No!

1148
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,130
Good.

1149
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,630
Then get back to work!

1150
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,960
Thank you so much, Artit!

1151
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,710
- Pong.
- Sir?

1152
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,500
Why are you standing there being
all old and shriveled? Back to work!

1153
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,880
Miss Paeng, let's get
back to our work.

1154
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:51,750
Don't go yet.

1155
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,380
Your boss wants to see you.

1156
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,920
Come on. Just talk to him.

1157
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:14,960
Did you forget that you're the
employee and I'm the boss?

1158
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,710
You have no right to do
whatever you want.

1159
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,130
You have to consult me first

1160
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,670
and not just use your money.

1161
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,250
The workers might get out of line
and start to defy authority.

1162
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,380
That's a mouth full. Which orifice
do you use to breathe?

1163
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,420
I can breathe from
whatever orifice I want.

1164
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,420
Remember, Wanfahmai.

1165
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,050
From now on,

1166
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,500
you'll be receiving your
monthly salary from me.

1167
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:39,710
Okay. I can go now, right?

1168
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,920
Wait.

1169
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,880
Give me your ATM
and credit cards right now.

1170
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,630
You don't have to be that disgusted.

1171
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,380
Give them to me!

1172
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:27,750
Hand them over.

1173
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,920
I won't. They're mine.

1174
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,670
Then that means someone like you

1175
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,710
is only good for having money.

1176
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:45,800
At a loss for words?

1177
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,210
Okay. Take them.

1178
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:16,050
I'm going to show you that
I can survive without money,

1179
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:30,670
Get back to work.

1180
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,880
Kot!

1181
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,050
Oh, no!

1182
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,210
Yes, Mr. Piya.

1183
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,590
I'd like to order five grow boxes

1184
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:16,090
and five fertilizing drones.
When will they be ready?

1185
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,130
Thank you very much.
Please rush it for me.

1186
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:20,670
Goodbye.

1187
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,800
Who's ordering this many?

1188
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,130
It's Paeng.

1189
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,880
Why did you hit me?

1190
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:29,710
What did you con her?

1191
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,750
Hey, Ling.

1192
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,300
Con? If the stuff is good, then I
should let other people know.

1193
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,630
Paeng is clever with her purchases.

1194
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:41,420
Unlike you, you never buy anything
even though I tried to convince you.

1195
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,880
It's called being stingy.

1196
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,630
It's called being clever
with my purchases.

1197
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,380
You make it sound so nice.

1198
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,130
Oh, Paeng.

1199
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,800
Just in time. I was about to call.

1200
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,130
You'll get your order in three days.

1201
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:59,960
- Kot...
- Too long? I'll rush them.

1202
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,500
- Mr. Piya, the stuff I ordered...
- I'd like to cancel them.

1203
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:04,670
I'd like to cancel them.

1204
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:07,130
Please wait for a moment, Mr. Piya.

1205
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,340
How come?

1206
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:12,750
I'd like to cancel the order, Kot.

1207
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:14,170
- Well...
- Because?

1208
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,960
Artit disapproved of it.

1209
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,130
There it is. It's over.

1210
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,460
It's all over.

1211
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,920
Artit! You killjoy!

1212
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,130
Kot, I really have
to apologize to you.

1213
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,340
I didn't want to cancel the order.

1214
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,920
But Artit's my boss.

1215
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,880
I really don't want to defy him.

1216
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:38,380
Is it a huge loss for you?

1217
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,210
It's okay, Paeng.

1218
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,880
But

1219
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:46,300
the stuff you've ordered previously

1220
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,880
can't be canceled.
You still have to pay up.

1221
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:54,550
I thought I can still return them if
I paid for the first installment.

1222
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:57,170
You can't for that order.

1223
01:12:58,750 --> 01:12:59,840
What is it?

1224
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,550
It's Artit.

1225
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,550
Thanks.

1226
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,000
Here.

1227
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,000
Thank you.

1228
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,420
It's your favorite, carrot cake.

1229
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,960
I saved it for you.

1230
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,960
Perfecting timing. I'm hungry.

1231
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:31,750
Wow.

1232
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,050
You took away Paeng's
ATM and credit cards, didn't you?

1233
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,050
Tattletale

1234
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,630
She not a tattletale.

1235
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,170
I kept asking her
until she finally told me.

1236
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:49,800
So?

1237
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,920
Did she ask you to come
and ask me for her cards back?

1238
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,920
No. I'm here on my own.

1239
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:56,840
She doesn't know any of this.

1240
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,710
So don't scold her.

1241
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:05,300
Ling, can't you see that she
hasn't changed?

1242
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,750
She uses money to solve problems
like she's a spoiled child.

1243
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,090
She's self-indulgent,

1244
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,090
so I have to teach her a lesson.

1245
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:16,250
I'll see if she can get
through this like she said.

1246
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,380
What if she can?
What are you going to do?

1247
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,250
I don't have to do anything.

1248
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,550
It's not fair.

1249
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,420
You keep watching
to see if she'll make a mistake

1250
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,630
so that she won't be
able to stay here.

1251
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,420
If she proves herself to you,
that she's really changed,

1252
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:38,840
you should give her a chance.

1253
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:41,460
And not just say that
you don't have to do anything.

1254
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,960
Think about what I said carefully.

1255
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,880
Ling is such a lovely girl.

1256
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:29,210
It's 50,000 for the grow boxes.

1257
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,000
Then it's 70,000 or so
for the drones.

1258
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:41,880
How am I going to pay
for the installments?

1259
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,800
Huh? Miss Paeng?

1260
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,420
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

1261
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:52,710
You have to go to the temple
early tomorrow morning.

1262
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,250
Okay, Aueng.

1263
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,880
It's time to sleep now.

1264
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,420
Boss?

1265
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:50,630
Hey,

1266
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:52,210
why would you take pictures
when I'm with her?

1267
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:54,880
You told me to take
photos all the time.

1268
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:57,460
I did as you told me.

1269
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:03,050
Next time just take
pictures of Paeng. Understand?

1270
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:04,750
Alright, sir.

1271
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,090
Did I hire the right person?

1272
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:21,710
Trim all the stray twigs.

1273
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,250
- It's losing its shape.
- Here?

1274
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,090
Right. At the bottom too.

1275
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:28,880
Krongprateep, where are you going?

1276
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,920
To the temple to make merit.

1277
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:34,550
It's the anniversary of Therathep
and Pimnapa's deaths today.

1278
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,090
Do you want to come along?

1279
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:39,090
Just the two of us or with Paeng?

1280
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:41,550
Tubtim.

1281
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,880
If it's with her, I'm not going.

1282
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,840
Otherwise, I'd be committing sins
rather than making merit.

1283
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,340
Can you let it go just for a day?

1284
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:51,210
Don't make such a fuss
over making merit for them.

1285
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,880
It's something we should do.

1286
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,380
I'm not making a fuss
over making merit.

1287
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,340
But I'm fussing over Paeng.

1288
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,840
Dad! Mom!

1289
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,840
Good morning.

1290
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:07,050
Are you going to town now?

1291
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:10,840
Doesn't the seminar
start at 10 a.m.? What's the hurry?

1292
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:13,050
Oh? You have work to do.

1293
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:14,840
How can you go
and make merit with Paeng?

1294
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:16,630
Let her go alone.

1295
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,340
We'll do it later. Okay?

1296
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:21,170
Will I make it in time
if I go to the temple first?

1297
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:23,590
Are you crazy? How will you make it?

1298
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:25,550
I already promised Paeng.

1299
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:59,630
Be prepared to dedicate your merits.

1300
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:04,590
Venerable monk,
I'd like to ask you something.

1301
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,210
What's the matter?

1302
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:10,710
These merits we make for the dead,

1303
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,960
they will actually
receive them, right?

1304
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,630
Certainly.

1305
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,500
Focus your mind

1306
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:20,050
and the merits will
reach the recipients.

1307
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:25,000
If the recipient has
committed a grave sin,

1308
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,590
these merits can help them, right?

1309
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:29,550
It will help partially,

1310
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,380
but not completely.

1311
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:36,300
Everyone is born
with their own karma.

1312
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,090
Think of it as growing a tree.

1313
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:41,170
Whatever tree you grow,

1314
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:44,170
you will get the same kind of fruit.

1315
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:49,960
- Venerable monk.
- Hmm?

1316
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:51,750
Apart from the dead,

1317
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,500
can we dedicate merits
to the living as well?

1318
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:56,300
Of course you can.

1319
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,460
Such as sick people

1320
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,630
or karmic relations
that are still alive.

1321
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,000
That's good.

1322
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:08,090
I should do it too. So I can finally
get rid of my karma.

1323
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:12,630
Merit dedication

1324
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,130
is a good deed.

1325
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,050
The only condition is
to have a pure heart,

1326
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,340
show mercy to each other,

1327
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,460
and not wish bad things
for each other.

1328
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:26,050
What will happen
if you wish for bad things?

1329
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,590
It will come around to you instead.

1330
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:36,420
Let's get started.

1331
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:43,130
Venerable monk, do you
have another one?

1332
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,630
Why are you asking
so many questions?

1333
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:47,880
You're so demanding.
It's a waste of time.

1334
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:51,880
Pour the ceremonial water
and receive the blessings.

1335
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,550
Just as rivers

1336
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:02,340
Full of water

1337
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:04,170
Fill the ocean full

1338
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:06,170
Even so does

1339
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:09,130
What is given benefit the dead

1340
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,750
- Over there too.
- They're huge, Aueng.

1341
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:36,920
Are you done yet?

1342
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:38,800
Why are you doing so much?

1343
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,050
You can go ahead if you want to.

1344
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,920
How can I? I came with you.

1345
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:45,630
I don't know.

1346
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:49,750
Miss Paeng,

1347
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:53,420
why did you ask
the venerable monk that question?

1348
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:55,380
A grave sin?

1349
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,920
What's that?

1350
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,630
What are you worried about?

1351
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:10,750
Let's go home, Aueng?

1352
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:12,500
Okay.

1353
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,880
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

1354
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,340
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

1355
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:46,630
- What's wrong?
- Miss Paeng!

1356
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,380
- Miss Paeng!
- Paeng!

1357
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,340
Let's put her down over there.

1358
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:51,750
Miss Paeng!

1359
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,960
Miss Paeng!

1360
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:57,880
- Miss Paeng!
- Paeng!

1361
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:00,250
I'll go find a menthol inhaler.

1362
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,050
Paeng?

1363
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:10,420
Paeng?

1364
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:35,550
Paeng?

1365
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,090
Dad!

1366
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,460
Dad!

1367
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:47,800
Paeng?

1368
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:04,960
Here's the inhaler!

1369
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,710
- Paeng!
- I'll do it.

1370
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:08,710
Paeng?

1371
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,960
Paeng?

1372
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:15,750
Miss Paeng?

1373
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:17,550
Miss Paeng?

1374
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:30,710
You fainted.

1375
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:33,250
Don't look at me like that. Take it.

1376
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,090
Let's go now.

1377
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:53,130
Miss Paeng, can you get up?

1378
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,130
I'll help you.

1379
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,130
Walk slowly.

1380
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:03,300
Are you okay?

1381
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:05,500
You can take a rest if you need to.

1382
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,460
I'm fine now.

1383
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:11,380
- Hey, Miss Paeng's back!
- Miss Paeng!

1384
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:13,710
- Come on!
- Miss Paeng!

1385
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:16,380
- Wait up.
- Did you get it, Miss Paeng?

1386
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:18,420
What?

1387
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,420
The winning lottery numbers.

1388
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:23,090
What did the venerable monk
say at the temple?

1389
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,380
- Huh?
- Did you bring any holy water?

1390
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,800
- Candle wax tears are fine too.
- Or the ashes of the incense.

1391
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,420
Calm down, everyone.

1392
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,050
I went to make merits.
Not to win the lottery.

1393
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,800
Miss Paeng!

1394
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,460
We can't get hopes up
with you, can we?

1395
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,050
- That's true.
- No number. So disappointing.

1396
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:43,250
No one's disappointed about anything

1397
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,840
because I have it right here.

1398
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:50,880
That's it!

1399
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:53,380
Eight-five! Eight-five!

1400
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,210
Six-three!

1401
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:56,750
When did you take it?

1402
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,670
Something this important?

1403
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,380
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1404
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,500
Can you make it out?
What number it is?

1405
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:06,960
- Two-eight-five above!
- Six-three under!

1406
01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:09,300
- Reverse it too!
- That's right. Reverse it.

1407
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:13,670
Why would you buy these?
The chances of winning are very low.

1408
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:15,500
Most people lose every time anyway.

1409
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:17,880
Save your money
for when you need it.

1410
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,460
Buy the necessities.

1411
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:22,880
Miss Paeng, you don't understand.

1412
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:25,380
The lottery is
the poor people's hope.

1413
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:26,670
That's right.

1414
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,590
At least we can afford dreams.

1415
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:33,170
Every time we buy a ticket, we have
good dreams for 15 days!

1416
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,960
It's better if you don't.

1417
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:39,880
We should save up our money
and invest in something.

1418
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,880
The money will grow from
our investment,

1419
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,590
and then we'll be rich.

1420
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:46,000
Once we're rich, it's not going
to be just a dream anymore.

1421
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:48,840
It's too difficult.

1422
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:51,710
We'll die before we're rich.
We can only save 10-20 baht a day.

1423
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,630
- It's better to play the lottery.
- That's right.

1424
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,960
Let me have that, please.

1425
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,960
Here. This one.

1426
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:00,380
Five-seven. Five-seven-three!

1427
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:01,920
Reverse it too!

1428
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:09,420
Oh, Artit!

1429
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:13,500
Are you safe?

1430
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:17,300
Did Paeng do anything to you again?

1431
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:19,590
You had to wait for me to come home?

1432
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,590
Well, I was worried.

1433
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,250
You shouldn't have told Dad that.

1434
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,960
I should've gone with her myself.

1435
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,710
- By the way, Mom.
- Hmm?

1436
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,960
Uh...

1437
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:36,130
What does a grave sin include?

1438
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:38,420
Why are you asking me that?

1439
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:43,380
I heard at the temple
so I was wondering about it.

1440
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,670
Well, I'm not really
knowledgeable about this.

1441
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,300
A grave sin

1442
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:53,170
is committed by murdering someone

1443
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:54,710
or killing oneself, I think.

1444
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,750
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

1445
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,500
First prize

1446
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:49,800
for 17 January.

1447
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,880
You all lost!

1448
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,920
It's called the man's way.
It's all about dignity.

1449
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:00,710
I didn't that I'm in
a relationship with Ling.

1450
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:02,710
- Artit!
- Hey, hey!

1451
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,090
I'm going to uncover
how you really feel.

1452
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:15,250
It must be Mr. Artit.

1453
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:16,880
There's only one person

1454
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,710
who would dare pull
a prank on me like this.

1455
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,050
I'm the mastermind behind all this.
