1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,370
I have evidence.

3
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,879
I'd like to play an audio recording

4
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,560
which serves as physical evidence.

5
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,479
You arranged for a meeting
with the defendant

6
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,199
and you used this knife to hurt him,

7
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,240
is that correct?

8
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,719
That's correct.

9
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,120
I deny all accusations.

10
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,280
You're not going to get away, Mark.

11
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,680
You're as vile as your mother.

12
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,719
Once I've finished up my work,

13
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,479
I'd like to get out of here.

14
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,639
Don't go, Paeng.

15
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,400
It doesn't matter what
your reasons are.

16
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,199
I've made a decision.

17
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,560
Hold on tight.

18
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,319
Please don't pull a prank on me.

19
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,879
I don't know

20
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,639
what to do

21
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,360
to convince you to stay either.

22
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,879
Can you tell me

23
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,599
what I should do?

24
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,840
Mr. Artit?

25
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,439
Are you busy?

26
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,959
Thongkhum,

27
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,480
what's the matter?

28
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,170
Well,

29
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,480
I have something to tell you.

30
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,639
Can you promise me

31
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,639
that there's not going to be
anything between you and Artit,

32
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,839
other than being siblings?

33
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,439
If you give your word,

34
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,000
you always keep it.

35
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,959
If it makes you happy,

36
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,170
then I promise.

37
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,680
Oh, Artit?

38
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,120
Are you here for lunch?
Why didn't you call first?

39
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,439
Mom,

40
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,839
why did you send Paeng away?

41
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,480
Mom!

42
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,639
Didn't we come to an understanding?

43
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,730
I didn't send her away.

44
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,920
She chose to leave herself.

45
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,279
There was only one thing that
I asked of her.

46
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,079
That she could stay in here
in any role,

47
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,639
except as my daughter-in-law.

48
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,199
Why, Mom?

49
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,120
Why can't you accept her?

50
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,639
What's so bad about her?

51
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,879
I don't disagree that
she's a good person.

52
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,759
But marriage

53
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,639
isn't just about love.

54
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,279
It also involves other things.

55
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,000
Like what?

56
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,959
The two of you have
nothing in common.

57
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,720
Whenever you're together,

58
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,560
trouble always follows.

59
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,800
How many times did you almost
die because of her?

60
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,879
What's more,

61
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,160
is the fact that she came
from a broken family.

62
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,120
How can we be sure
she won't turn out the same?

63
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,560
I can't stand seeing that happen.

64
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,199
You're not giving Paeng a chance.

65
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,240
You're not giving us a chance.

66
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
But I'm doing this
because I love you.

67
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,240
Mom, I believe

68
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,800
that Paeng and I
can build a stable family.

69
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,839
Until now, Paeng and I

70
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,600
never abandon each other
no matter whatever happened.

71
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,399
There is your proof.

72
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,759
Paeng is the person I want
to spend the rest of my life with.

73
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,319
But if it doesn't work out?

74
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,720
It has to!

75
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,279
See? You only think of the present

76
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,639
and never about the future.

77
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,759
I couldn't stand to see
your family crumble.

78
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,279
Mom, can you listen to me?

79
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,879
It's you who has to listen.

80
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
I love you very much.

81
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,120
You're my only son.

82
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,800
I'd like to see you
live a happy life

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,839
without any trouble.

84
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,040
Mom,

85
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,120
I'm sure

86
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,519
that no matter what happens,

87
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,839
Paeng is ready to hold my hand
and fight alongside me.

88
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
I'm sure of that.

89
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,360
Alright.

90
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,240
If you choose her,

91
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,120
then just forget
that you have a mother.

92
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,159
Mr. Artit!

93
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Would you like to watch
the meteor shower?

94
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,450
Invite Miss Paeng as well,
it will be nostalgic.

95
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,679
Are you interested?

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,519
I'll arrange a spot for you.

97
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,600
Please?

98
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,480
No need to feel considerate.

99
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,240
I will do anything for you.

100
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,210
Thanks, Saeb.

101
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,919
But I'm not in the mood.

102
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,399
What's wrong?

103
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,919
Mr. Artit.

104
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,720
Please return to your old self.

105
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,799
Scold me. Chase after me.

106
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,879
Kick me. Or deduct my salary.

107
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,679
This is not who you are.

108
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,330
It's not like you to thank me.

109
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,519
Saeb,

110
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,360
do you want to get kicked?

111
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,159
If you're not going to stop crying,
I'll deduct your salary.

112
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,330
Just like that. Thank you, sir.

113
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,210
I have to go now.

114
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,799
Paeng.

115
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,840
Artit.

116
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,450
Where are you taking me?

117
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,210
Just follow me. You'll know soon.

118
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,639
Why did you bring me here?

119
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,080
I wanted to create some good
memories with you.

120
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,559
So that when you're gone,

121
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,360
you'll miss me.

122
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,960
And when I'm with you,

123
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,840
I'll be reminded of
the good memories

124
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,799
that we shared together.

125
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,440
Is it beautiful?

126
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,960
Yes, it's really beautiful.

127
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,120
The sky

128
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,759
and the sun.

129
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,559
It's you and me.

130
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,960
Wanfahmai

131
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,399
and Artit.

132
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,960
I know the reason why
you have to leave.

133
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,480
It's because my mom won't
accept you.

134
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,080
You didn't tell me.

135
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,320
Well, I...

136
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,480
No need to explain.

137
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,480
I understand everything.

138
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,759
But now,

139
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,840
there is only one word
I'd like to hear.

140
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,360
The only word that I've never
heard from you.

141
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,559
If we remove Mom from the equation,

142
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,399
can you tell me

143
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,919
how you feel about me?

144
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,639
If the truth

145
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,240
will cause you pain,

146
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,559
then it's better to be ignorant.

147
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,279
I want to feel pain.

148
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,279
Please tell me.

149
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,240
I...

150
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,799
I love you, Artit.

151
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,039
Thank you, Paeng.

152
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,519
Thank you for telling me.

153
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,840
Thank you for loving me.

154
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,320
Look over there.

155
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,200
I wish for Artit to live a good

156
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,120
and happy life.

157
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,080
I wish that the time would stop

158
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,360
right here.

159
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,600
I don't want to see you cry.

160
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:44,000
Can you spend tonight with me?

161
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,919
It might the last night

162
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,799
that we're together.

163
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,240
If you're sure

164
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,039
that you want to be with me,

165
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,890
then I'll tell my mom

166
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,759
that I insist on marrying you.

167
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,480
I don't want Auntie
to feel any worse.

168
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,000
We'll go

169
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,960
and explain it to my mom together.

170
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,279
Please?

171
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,650
Let's go see my mom.

172
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,079
Artit,

173
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,759
I don't want Auntie

174
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,039
to give in just
because we forced her to.

175
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,119
I don't want to build our family

176
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,170
on top of the ruins of yours.

177
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
I want to see everyone happy.

178
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,079
Even though,

179
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,410
we won't be happy?

180
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,440
We're happy that we were in love.

181
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,319
Even though we don't get
to marry each other,

182
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,480
but we got to love each other.

183
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,039
I'm already

184
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,650
very happy with that.

185
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,200
But I'm happy

186
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,680
because I have you.

187
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,240
If you're uncomfortable,

188
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,039
just tell me

189
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,559
what I should do.

190
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,519
Artit.

191
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,279
Paeng,

192
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,200
I already asked you.

193
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,799
Let us be together.

194
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,279
If it's going to be our last night.

195
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,240
Don't be afraid.

196
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,960
I won't take advantage of you.

197
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,759
I just want us to make
happy memories together.

198
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,400
Be with me.

199
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,480
Okay.

200
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,640
I'm going to take a shower.

201
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,640
Don't turn around.

202
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,279
I don't want you
to see me being weak.

203
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,440
I only want you

204
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,920
to remember my smile.

205
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,519
I just want to
stay with you like this.

206
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,640
Gosh!

207
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,559
Artit!

208
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,839
Paeng,

209
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,720
you broke your promise!

210
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,680
Why didn't you keep your word?

211
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,279
What promise?

212
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,640
What did you make her promise?

213
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,079
- Auntie!
- Paeng.

214
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,519
What did you promise her?

215
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,559
Do you have to leave

216
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,440
because of this promise?

217
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,319
Artit,

218
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,319
she misunderstood us.
We didn't do anything.

219
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,480
She didn't.

220
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,119
We love each other.

221
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,880
I won't let her push you away
like this.

222
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,519
I'm going to talk to her.

223
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,440
Artit! Artit!

224
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,960
Please don't do this.

225
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,960
- I will.
- Artit!

226
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,400
I thought we already
talked this through.

227
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,799
That's why I agreed to be with you
until this happened.

228
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,000
If you do anything,

229
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,200
things are going to get even worse.

230
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,039
It will get better.

231
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,599
You have to believe me.

232
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,599
No.

233
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,599
Paeng, listen to me.

234
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,240
No, you listen to me.

235
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,480
Please don't make things any worse.

236
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,599
Please don't hold me back.

237
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,759
You keep insisting
that you're going to leave.

238
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,960
I can't change your mind
no matter how hard I try.

239
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,400
Because you never wanted
to fight alongside me.

240
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,960
You've never respected
any of my decisions either.

241
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,960
Alright.

242
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,960
I'll respect your decision.

243
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,400
Just like you want.

244
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,799
Why are you sighing so much?

245
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,599
I feel sorry for Artit.

246
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,079
Paeng chose to go.

247
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,960
His good looks didn't
even help anything.

248
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,960
Nothing happens by chance.

249
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,960
It must be karma
for what Artit did to Paeng before.

250
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,920
Now he'll know

251
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,920
how unrequited love feels!

252
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,759
Meanie!

253
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,279
Kot!

254
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:05,279
It's not unrequited love for Artit.

255
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,359
Both of them are in love.

256
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,640
I can confirm that.

257
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,839
Enough. I don't want to hear that.

258
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,839
Now you don't want to listen.

259
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,759
Mom.

260
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,839
Am I still your mother?

261
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,279
Just do whatever you want.

262
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,839
There's no need to care
about my feelings.

263
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,359
Go ahead.

264
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,559
Get married if want.

265
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,319
Since you've had premarital
intercourse anyway.

266
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,160
Mom,

267
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,400
Paeng and I didn't do anything.

268
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,400
And I'm here to tell you

269
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,279
that I'm letting her go.

270
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,240
If it makes you

271
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,839
and Paeng happy,

272
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,279
I will have to accept it.

273
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,720
Artit,

274
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,480
I did it

275
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,640
because I love you.

276
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,839
Artit,

277
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,079
you understand me, right?

278
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,640
I'm happy

279
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,039
that you believe me.

280
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,839
And you're happy
that I'm hurt too, right?

281
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:15,480
I'll do anything you want.

282
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,880
Because I hope that one day

283
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:20,880
you'll see

284
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,559
what it is that Paeng and I
both want.

285
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,289
I'll wait

286
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,719
for the day when you
accept our love.

287
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,719
Mr. Artit, I'll help you.

288
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:08,289
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

289
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,519
I made you your favorites.

290
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,960
Have some, okay?

291
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:27,880
Thanks, Mom.

292
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:38,599
Paeng.

293
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,519
Are we going to keep in touch?

294
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,809
Are you going to call me?

295
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,639
I...

296
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,639
I don't want you to wait for me.

297
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,840
I'll wait for you no matter
how long it takes.

298
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,480
Please don't do this.

299
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,840
I'd like you to be the same person
that you were

300
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,559
before I came back.

301
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,480
I can't do that.

302
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,159
Can you?

303
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,809
I can.

304
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,360
I'll start a new life.

305
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:42,199
Don't forget

306
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,769
how much misfortune
I've been through.

307
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,159
This is nothing.
I'll be able to forget it.

308
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,360
You're making me sad.

309
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,289
I'm telling you the truth.

310
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,000
I'd like you to get over me.

311
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,679
I can't do that.

312
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,809
I'm going to wait for your return.

313
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:20,639
You have to be able to do it.

314
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:26,119
I'm not as tough as you are.

315
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,880
Don't call me

316
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,440
because I'm probably going
to be very busy.

317
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,000
Here's a Valentine's day flower.

318
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,480
Thank you.

319
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:30,840
Yum!

320
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,840
What? Is there something on my face?

321
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,360
Thank you for comforting me

322
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:48,679
when I was so sad.

323
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,920
When was that?

324
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,769
Right.

325
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,519
The time Artit broke your heart?

326
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:01,679
Right!

327
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:13,079
I'll repay you for your kindness.

328
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:24,239
This meal is on the house!

329
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:25,400
Gosh.

330
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,809
Alright. Thank you.

331
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,639
I'm so happy.

332
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,199
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

333
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:41,480
It's this one.

334
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,840
Sorry.

335
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,400
Before I take this bite,

336
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,639
can you be my girlfriend?

337
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,880
Paeng made this for you.

338
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,440
Oh, you're back.

339
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,639
What are you looking for?

340
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,039
Oh, I've made you some food.

341
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,119
Just like Miss Paeng
used to make, right?

342
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,519
She taught me how to make it.

343
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,960
I think you'll be happier
after you've eaten it.

344
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,400
You think so?

345
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,199
Why aren't you happy?

346
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:59,840
Well,

347
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:02,199
I'll take it back then.

348
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,960
I'll eat it myself.

349
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,519
Do you miss her like I do?

350
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,079
Of course.

351
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:20,440
I'd looked after her
since she was young.

352
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,880
We've rarely been apart.

353
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,239
Why wouldn't I miss her?

354
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,639
You don't seem sad
that she's not here.

355
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:31,400
Because I think that one day
she'll be back.

356
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:33,039
She has no one else.

357
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,360
Why wouldn't she come back? Right?

358
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
Another thing,

359
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:45,440
she told me to
take good care of you too.

360
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,000
That explains why
you're always bothering me.

361
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,960
I'm bothering you?

362
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,079
A bit.

363
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:57,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Artit!

364
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:00,280
It's okay.

365
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,360
I'll eat it myself.

366
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:08,719
I think it's quite tasty.

367
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,960
Why are you here?

368
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,119
I'm here to forgive you.

369
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,519
For everything you did,

370
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,199
I forgive you.

371
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:12,639
What happened in the past

372
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,480
will stay in the past.

373
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:16,960
We can't go back and fix it.

374
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:20,800
What you can do now

375
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,559
is move on from your mistakes.

376
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:27,920
After you've been granted parole,

377
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,480
you mustn't repeat
the same mistakes.

378
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:36,719
Do you pity me?

379
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,719
That's right. I pity you.

380
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,480
Actually, you and I are the same.

381
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,800
You're an orphan.

382
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,519
So am I.

383
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,440
Even though there's
no one to educate

384
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:00,360
orphans like us,

385
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:02,880
we can choose to be good people.

386
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:09,559
Because the best person to teach us

387
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,960
is ourselves.

388
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,480
I'm fortunate

389
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,360
that I know good from evil.

390
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,280
That's why I've
chosen the right path.

391
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,639
But even though you

392
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,480
already chose the wrong path,

393
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:31,719
you can still choose to
change the course of your life.

394
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,400
That's why I told you

395
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,159
once you've been granted parole,

396
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,440
you mustn't repeat

397
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,960
the same mistakes.

398
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,280
Don't feign sympathy.

399
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,320
No matter how my life turns out,

400
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,199
it's none of your business.

401
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:59,199
Actually, you and I are the same.

402
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:03,159
You're an orphan. So am I.

403
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:06,039
Even though there's
no one to educate

404
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,360
orphans like us,

405
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,960
we can choose to be decent.

406
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:14,559
Because the best person to teach us

407
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,000
is ourselves.

408
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:26,079
I'm fortunate

409
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,840
that I know good from evil.

410
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,039
That's why I've
chosen the right path.

411
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,360
But even though you
already chose the wrong path,

412
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,639
you can still choose to
change the course of your life.

413
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,000
That's why I told you
once you've been granted parole,

414
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,639
you mustn't repeat
the same mistakes.

415
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,519
Paeng!

416
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:01,199
Paeng!

417
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,400
You betrayed Dad!
You cheated on him!

418
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,400
You don't love us anymore!

419
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,039
We were happily in love,
but you blew it.

420
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,400
Thank you.

421
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,199
- Are you feeling better now?
- Yes, I am.

422
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:23,840
If you get blisters from
your shoes again, tell me.

423
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:26,519
So your beautiful feet
won't get hurt again.

424
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:27,679
Aww,

425
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,000
thank you very much for
taking care of me, even my feet.

426
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:32,280
My pleasure.

427
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:37,960
You look handsome today.

428
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:39,559
Are we ready to go?

429
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,960
I'm so ready. Let's go.

430
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,480
Artit! Artit!

431
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,519
Come here.

432
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:49,760
- Kot.
- What?

433
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,239
You're all dressed up.
Where are you going?

434
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:55,119
I'm going to receive the
Salesman of the Year award.

435
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,599
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

436
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,239
- Congratulations.
- Thanks so much.

437
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:10,880
Nang, what about Non?

438
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:13,480
He's in a meeting.

439
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,519
Then, can you give this to him?

440
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:24,559
- Congratulations.
- Thanks so much.

441
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:34,320
We're going public now?

442
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:38,960
- I feel sorry for Artit.
- What?

443
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,880
Nang, do you still like him?

444
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,119
Are you crazy?

445
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,000
You had me there.

446
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:08,719
Paeng!

447
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:12,719
Nang?

448
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,679
Why are you here?

449
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,360
This is Bangkok,
not the Amazon rainforest.

450
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,199
It's only a short drive away.

451
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:25,199
Actually, I'm on vacation

452
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,360
and I'd like to talk to you too.

453
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:33,199
Aren't you going
to go back to Artit?

454
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,920
Did you know that
you're actually pretty nice?

455
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:41,800
Don't you go faking it.

456
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,840
I'm serious.

457
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:46,679
When I see you,

458
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,039
it's like I'm looking in the mirror.

459
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:51,480
Right? I think so too.

460
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,079
That's why we ended up
having a crush on the same guy.

461
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:00,719
So? Just tell me already.

462
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,320
Are you really not going
to go back to Artit?

463
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,280
Don't call me nosy.

464
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:16,639
It's not easy to meet
the right person

465
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,199
and to fall in love with each other.

466
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:22,840
You brought him so much trouble

467
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:24,639
and yet he forgave you.

468
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,159
Are you really not going
to go back to him?

469
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,400
Who says I'm going to leave him?

470
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:43,119
Paeng,

471
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,800
has Artit called you at all?

472
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:50,280
He never calls me. Don't worry.

473
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,960
Auntie,

474
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,079
are you okay?

475
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:01,119
Well...

476
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,960
Paeng, can you go back to Artit?

477
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,199
What's wrong with him?
Did something happen to him?

478
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:15,880
Paeng,

479
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,639
I'm sorry.

480
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:20,639
I made a mistake.

481
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,679
I made my son sad.

482
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,960
I made everything worse.

483
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,920
I'm watching as my son

484
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:36,079
lives his life without
any happiness.

485
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,239
He spends all his time
working like a machine.

486
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,400
Auntie,

487
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,760
you have to give him time.

488
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,199
I can stand to watch it anymore.

489
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,400
I feel guilty
every time I see his face.

490
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:53,760
And today,

491
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:56,400
I feel ashamed of what I did.

492
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,840
I made you leave.

493
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,960
That's why today,

494
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,199
I have to be the one
to ask you to return.

495
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:10,840
Please come back to him.
I really did make a mistake.

496
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,519
Please?

497
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,599
Please don't blame yourself.

498
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,760
So that means...

499
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:30,639
I'm going back to Artit.

500
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,960
Whoo!

501
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,039
Simple as that.

502
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,519
What basket is that?

503
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:54,840
It's your present.

504
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,920
What is it? Are you
going to play a prank on me?

505
00:58:58,639 --> 00:58:59,920
No, I'm not.

506
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:02,519
The basket is moving.

507
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:03,800
What are you playing at?

508
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,480
Pick it up.

509
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,559
A puppy!

510
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:16,480
Wow!

511
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:18,400
How is it? Cute?

512
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,800
So cute! What's his name?

513
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,599
I was waiting for you to name him.

514
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,079
So cute!

515
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,599
What a cute puppy!

516
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,400
What should I name you?

517
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,199
Your name is...

518
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,039
Umm...

519
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,400
Dokya?

520
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,719
That's nice.

521
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,400
It sounds lovely.

522
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:45,639
Dokya!

523
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,920
Hello.

524
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:14,840
Hurry up and work! No lollygagging!

525
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:16,480
Artit!

526
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:18,840
We've been working
since five in the morning.

527
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,559
Can't we rest a little?
We're sore all over.

528
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:22,719
That's right.

529
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,639
Do you want to rest? Alright.

530
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:27,280
- Really?
- Really?

531
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:29,840
I'll have you rest
for a very long time.

532
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,199
A very long rest?

533
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,239
Why does it sound so strange, Saeb?

534
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:38,519
A very long rest.

535
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:40,559
Does that mean we won't
get to work anymore?

536
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:43,760
That's right. No work,

537
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,480
no pay,

538
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:47,480
and no roof over your heads.

539
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,239
Huh? What are we waiting for?
Get going!

540
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,679
Come on! Hurry up!

541
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:56,719
Quick!

542
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,039
Another one!

543
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,480
Don't go yet!

544
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:12,960
Miss Paeng!

545
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,000
Why did you have to leave?
Now we're all doomed.

546
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,400
Ever since Miss Paeng left,
Mr. Artit has become a workaholic.

547
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,480
He works from before
sunrise until sunset.

548
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,599
If this keeps going on, we're going
to die instead of him.

549
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,360
I miss you, Miss Paeng!

550
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,239
I miss you too, Miss Paeng!

551
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,639
I miss you too, Miss Paeng!

552
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,239
Who misses me?

553
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,639
- Miss Paeng!
- Miss Paeng!

554
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,199
Did you come back for
real this time?

555
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,480
And why wouldn't I?

556
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:13,679
Artit!

557
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,760
Who allowed an outsider
into the farm?

558
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,440
I'm going to deduct your salaries.

559
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:39,880
Are you still angry with me?

560
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,719
What was that noise?

561
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,400
It sounds like someone trying
to vie for my attention.

562
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:53,800
It's annoying.

563
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:58,920
Wow, your tongue is
as sharp as always.

564
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,920
Mr. Artit, this is Miss Paeng.

565
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,199
He's definitely sulking.

566
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,559
I know, Saeb.

567
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,639
What should I do?

568
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,320
- Try to make up with him.
- That's right.

569
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:34,800
But all of you have to help me.

570
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,559
How?

571
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,079
- Miss Paeng!
- Miss Paeng!

572
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,840
- Miss Paeng!
- What's going on?

573
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,840
- Mr. Artit's coming out.
- What are you waiting for?

574
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,320
And what are you looking for?

575
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:06,679
That's true, Miss Paeng!

576
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,400
Everyone, can you stop?
I'm getting confused!

577
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,519
Why did you get in the way?

578
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,400
Do you want me to run you over?

579
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,639
What should we do?

580
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:36,320
What are you doing?

581
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,280
(I'm sorry.)

582
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,280
(Let's make up.)

583
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:59,960
(Can I ride with you?)

584
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:04,559
(Can I ride with you?)

585
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:21,639
- What?
- Hey?

586
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:25,639
Oh?

587
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:26,920
Miss Paeng!

588
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:28,360
Miss Paeng!

589
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:51,280
Paeng is going to come back.

590
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,199
What?

591
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,880
What did you say?

592
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,119
Your mom went out of her way
to convince her.

593
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,119
Is that true, Dad?

594
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:26,360
- There's no insect problem, right?
- No, sir.

595
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,280
Good.

596
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:35,079
How many days until harvest?

597
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,519
You can harvest them
in about 60 days.

598
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,920
Yes, sir.

599
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,480
How long is their lifespan?

600
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:56,840
Once they reach 80 days, you have to
get rid of them. They're too old.

601
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,920
Yes, sir.

602
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:03,199
Artit!

603
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:07,159
Did you agree to make up with me?

604
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,840
Hey,

605
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,960
did someone let a fly in here?

606
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,679
I can hear it buzzing around my ear.

607
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,000
It's annoying.

608
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:26,840
I'm going home now.

609
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:29,239
Yes, sir.

610
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,519
Did you hear me that I'm going home?

611
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,679
Yes, I heard you.

612
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,119
I'm going to let you keep begging.

613
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:08,280
It's so hot.

614
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:21,359
Is it cooler now?

615
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:25,439
I'm thirsty.

616
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:27,569
Water.

617
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:38,439
Here's some water.

618
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:55,199
You can go now.

619
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:02,199
Artit,

620
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,039
when are you going to

621
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,960
give in and stop playing
pranks on me?

622
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:11,159
This isn't a prank.

623
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,840
I'm actually angry.

624
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,319
Please stop being angry with me.

625
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:05,569
This is a punishment.

626
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,119
So when are you going
to stop being angry with me?

627
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,000
I don't know.

628
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:16,960
Oh? What should I do then?

629
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:20,319
Paeng,

630
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:22,800
I told everyone on the farm

631
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:26,159
that I love you
and I wanted to marry you.

632
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:28,920
But you left me.

633
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,960
Now you're back and you
want me to forgive you.

634
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,880
How can I look everyone in the face?

635
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,880
So you're embarrassed?

636
01:10:43,649 --> 01:10:46,479
Then tell me what I should do.

637
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,649
You have to tell everyone

638
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,840
that you love me
and want to marry me

639
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,039
to restore my reputation.

640
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:02,119
And then I'll

641
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:04,479
forgive you.

642
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:07,479
It doesn't matter how, right?

643
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:09,840
That's right.

644
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:12,840
But you have to tell
every single person.

645
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,039
Every single person?

646
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,000
You're too scared, right?

647
01:11:22,609 --> 01:11:23,680
I knew it.

648
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,720
Let's see if you can
live up to your words.

649
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,569
Hey, don't tell me

650
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,000
that Paeng already told you.

651
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:58,159
That's quick.

652
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,680
There are 100 people on the farm.
Let's see if she'll tell everyone.

653
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,840
Artit Suriyasakul.

654
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:12,680
Can you hear me?

655
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,119
Hey.

656
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:19,680
- What?
- Where are you going?

657
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,840
- Artit.
- Let me go!

658
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,569
- I won't let you.
- I'm going to stop her.

659
01:12:22,649 --> 01:12:23,720
I won't let you.

660
01:12:24,529 --> 01:12:25,609
What?

661
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,760
I did what you asked me to.

662
01:12:31,529 --> 01:12:35,359
I'm sorry that I chose to leave you.

663
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:46,239
Please forgive me.

664
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,800
I don't know what to say

665
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:53,609
except that...

666
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:20,119
She's walking like she's a heroine.

667
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,399
I love you, Artit.

668
01:13:45,609 --> 01:13:47,399
I've loved you ever since
I first laid eyes on you.

669
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:53,159
You could say that I've been in love
with the same guy since I was 15.

670
01:13:56,529 --> 01:13:57,649
Artit,

671
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:03,680
you made me feel
like I had a reason to live

672
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:05,920
and to grow up beautifully.

673
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,529
I've grown up to be the person
I am today

674
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:15,359
because of what I learned from you.

675
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,119
You're like a friend,

676
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:22,479
a teacher,

677
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:26,649
and the person whom I love.

678
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:32,960
You're like the bright morning sun

679
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:36,239
and the warm evening sun.

680
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,439
Even though you can be
quite scorching at times,

681
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,569
you are my forever sunshine.

682
01:14:53,079 --> 01:14:54,159
Yes!

683
01:14:56,609 --> 01:14:58,319
I can't love anyone anymore.

684
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,840
I can only love you.

685
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,439
Please, marry me.

686
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:17,649
Yes! Awesome!

687
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,649
Marry her! Marry her! Marry her!

688
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,079
Marry her, Artit!

689
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,399
It's the guy
who should be proposing.

690
01:15:25,649 --> 01:15:26,920
Who asked you to?

691
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:35,279
Paeng,

692
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,199
will you marry me?

693
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,569
So beautiful!

694
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,569
I'm marrying Artit, everyone!

695
01:15:57,649 --> 01:16:00,680
- Yes!
- You go, girl!

696
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:49,319
Time sure flies.

697
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,439
I still feel like

698
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,079
our son is just a little boy.

699
01:16:55,529 --> 01:16:58,319
Because you're too worried
about him?

700
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,000
That's true.

701
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:05,479
Aren't you angry with me

702
01:17:06,199 --> 01:17:07,359
for trying to get in the way
of Artit and Paeng's love?

703
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:10,609
How can I be angry with you?

704
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,079
When you have

705
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,479
always loved me and Artit
more than yourself?

706
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:21,840
I actually have to thank you

707
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:25,279
for teaching these two kids

708
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,680
how valuable love is.

709
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,319
So they'll know how to maintain it

710
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:34,649
like the both of us.

711
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,439
Thank you for understanding me.

712
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:42,960
I want our son to get married
only once, like we did.

713
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,760
I'm lucky that Paeng understands me.

714
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:54,609
I've chosen the right life partner.

715
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,199
I'm happy that I've chosen you too.

716
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:06,279
Should you put on
a facial mask tonight?

717
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:09,279
Because tomorrow you're going
to be the mother of the groom.

718
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:10,960
- That's true.
- So that you'll glow.

719
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,800
It really is tomorrow.

720
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,649
I think the wedding will go well.

721
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:20,159
Did I forget anything?

722
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:22,279
I don't think so.

723
01:18:22,569 --> 01:18:24,569
I saw that you've
prepared everything.

724
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,760
Are you sure?

725
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,399
Come on. Don't worry.

726
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:33,569
Okay.

727
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,920
Hey, are you nervous?

728
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,039
Of course.

729
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:07,119
Then don't get married.
So you won't be nervous.

730
01:19:07,569 --> 01:19:09,399
You and your mouth.

731
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:11,079
I was only kidding.

732
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:02,239
You're so suitable together!

733
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:04,359
You're so beautiful!

734
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:42,079
Artit, from this moment on

735
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,119
Paeng is now your wife.

736
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,279
You have to love her

737
01:20:46,529 --> 01:20:48,529
and do your best
to take care of her.

738
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:50,199
Of course, Dad.

739
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,649
I will love her and do my best

740
01:20:55,529 --> 01:20:56,609
to take care of her.

741
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:48,800
Hey!

742
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:50,569
What?

743
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,279
- What?
- It's raining.

744
01:21:56,039 --> 01:21:57,609
What is this?

745
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:03,319
Saeb, I told you to
release the confetti!

746
01:22:03,479 --> 01:22:05,079
Why did you turn on the sprinklers?

747
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:07,039
I thought confetti meant water.

748
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:10,039
Oh, no. Go turn it off.

749
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:11,239
- I'm sorry.
- Go!

750
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:13,039
There's no time to say sorry!
Turn it off!

751
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,039
Oh, dear!

752
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,960
Oh, shoot!

753
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:26,159
Argh!

754
01:22:55,569 --> 01:22:56,760
Artit,

755
01:22:57,569 --> 01:22:59,199
I think it's heavier.

756
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,199
Should we take cover?

757
01:23:02,529 --> 01:23:03,720
Too late.

758
01:23:08,529 --> 01:23:09,609
Is it that funny to you?

759
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,039
Artit,

760
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,239
are our lives going to be chaotic
until the end?

761
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:24,569
It's quite fun, actually.

762
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,000
Our wedding is like no one else's.

763
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:32,000
But if it's going to be chaotic,

764
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:34,760
should we skip
all the ceremonial stuff?

765
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,000
What do you mean?

766
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:40,239
Well, let's consummate on marriage.

767
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:45,720
Artit!

768
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,279
It's against tradition!

769
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:53,359
But no one said
that it has to be in that order.

770
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:56,159
We probably can

771
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,039
adapt to the circumstances.

772
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,439
No one can tell us that
we will encounter in life.

773
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,609
We might do the right thing

774
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:19,399
and make countless mistakes.

775
01:24:23,239 --> 01:24:26,479
But if we're ready
to support each other

776
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:28,399
until the end.

777
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,569
We'll find that happiness
isn't far away.

778
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,159
We only have to open our hearts up

779
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,119
to the ups and downs in life.

780
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:49,609
And we'll be able to overcome
all the misfortunes.

781
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:00,720
Just as the sun rises each morning,

782
01:25:01,609 --> 01:25:04,569
we can start over once more.

783
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:08,760
The rain's stopped.

784
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,119
When did you start loving me?

785
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,920
Do we have to talk about that now?

786
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:26,960
Well, I want to know.

787
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,039
Umm...

788
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:33,609
I don't know when.

789
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,569
I just realized that I did.

790
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:18,039
I have to kiss you first.

791
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,609
So we'll be even.

792
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,760
Okay.

793
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:29,319
I love you, Paeng.

794
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,439
I love you too, Artit.

795
01:27:06,609 --> 01:27:09,609
Sorry. I didn't catch that.

796
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,760
Who wants them to kiss again?

797
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,039
Kiss!

798
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:18,359
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

799
01:27:18,439 --> 01:27:21,479
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

800
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:31,920
Okay.

801
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,279
Alright. Are you ready?

802
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:41,520
- Ready?
- Ready?

803
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,720
This way!

804
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,119
Nang!

805
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,640
Yes!

806
01:27:58,359 --> 01:28:00,039
Let's put it in the bag!

807
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:03,880
See? I brought a bag.

808
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,800
Awesome! Thanks so much, Paeng!
