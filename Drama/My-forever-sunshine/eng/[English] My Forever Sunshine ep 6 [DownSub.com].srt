1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,169
I have nothing to lose!
My parents are dead!

3
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,710
I don't need to care
about anyone anymore.

4
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,050
- He tried to rape me.
- Liar!

5
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,340
Hey!

6
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,550
Mr. Artit was in a car accident.

7
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,460
Go and live in Bangkok.

8
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,169
When things get better,
you can come back.

9
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,879
Live a better life, Miss Paeng.

10
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,500
He's very popular nowadays,

11
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,750
both in and out of the field.
Girls are clamoring for him.

12
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,629
Non, it's me.

13
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,300
I was the one who answered.

14
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,129
I heard everything.

15
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,340
Are you going to leave me?

16
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,629
You love him, don't you?

17
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,379
Do you know

18
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,210
that you're bad at lying, Ling?

19
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,879
- Paeng!
- Paeng!

20
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,090
Just a moment, Uncle.

21
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,960
Just a moment.

22
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,919
It's very delicious.

23
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,129
I've gained weight

24
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,419
because you feed me so well
every time I visit you.

25
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,459
A present for the new graduate.

26
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,920
Uncle!

27
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,879
Thank you so much
for always taking care of me

28
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,250
We're not strangers.

29
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,920
You're like one of my own.

30
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,839
How could I ever abandon you?

31
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
You've graduated.

32
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,339
What are you thinking of doing next?

33
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,300
Can I have a taste?

34
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:05,959
You've surprised me
with many things.

35
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,800
Ever since you chose
to study agriculture,

36
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,920
what have you been thinking?

37
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,170
I have you as my idol.

38
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,589
- Hmm?
- It's true.

39
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,800
I saw the flowers grow

40
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,129
and bloom.

41
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:25,879
It's like I've turned
over a new leaf.

42
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,589
Like what I once told you,

43
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,750
growing flowers.

44
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,629
is what I do best.

45
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,379
And flowers are
for women, aren't they?

46
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,959
I want to turn petals into perfume,

47
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,420
food, and tea.

48
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,800
Because I graduated
directly from that field.

49
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:52,879
I'm relieved.

50
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,420
I was worried

51
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,589
about how a little girl like you

52
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,379
could be a farmer.

53
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:05,800
I did that too.

54
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,129
Huh?

55
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,339
Ta-da!

56
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:18,089
This is the land that I bought.
Isn't it beautiful?

57
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,300
Very beautiful. Fabulous!

58
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,250
I'm thinking of
digging a pond there.

59
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,339
And grow some roses on that hill.

60
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,750
And build

61
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,209
a small factory over here.
Isn't it good?

62
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,209
It's good. But...

63
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,420
where are you going to sleep?
You need a house.

64
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,170
That's true. I forgot.
I kept thinking about roses.

65
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:42,459
Instead of
digging a pond over there,

66
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,300
why don't you build a small
a one-story house?

67
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,959
A cute little house like in
"Beauty and the Beast."

68
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,250
- Awesome, Sister.
- Isn't it?

69
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,879
Uncle,

70
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,709
do you like it?

71
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,839
You're a little girl.

72
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,800
How can you be a farmer?

73
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,959
I can do it.

74
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,129
Paeng, everything isn't
as easy as you think.

75
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:08,959
Being a girl

76
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:11,589
and living alone
on a farm isn't safe.

77
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,050
From now on,

78
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,750
I can't let you do things
on your own.

79
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,839
Is it that depressing?

80
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:31,800
Uncle made me agree

81
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,629
to do an experimental plot.

82
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,750
If I'm successful within two years,

83
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,959
he'll let me fly solo.

84
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,800
That's good. So you won't have to do
the trial-and-error run on your own.

85
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,920
Good my butt.

86
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,459
The people at her uncle's farm
don't like her.

87
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,550
They don't just dislike me,
they actually hate me.

88
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,879
Wow, trouble ahead.

89
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,800
How are you going to go back there?

90
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,879
I'll probably die if I do.

91
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,209
I won't survive.

92
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:02,209
What are you going to do?

93
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,750
I don't know!

94
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,000
Gosh!

95
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,000
This is giving me a headache.

96
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,379
Why did Master tell us
to clean this room?

97
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,500
I have a bad feeling that
rotten Paeng is coming back.

98
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,800
You're saying unlucky things.

99
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,879
I can't help but think about that.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,459
Master hasn't let us open up
this room for years.

101
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,799
Then suddenly, he calls and
tells us to hurry and clean it up.

102
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,669
It's like somebody's coming to stay.

103
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,879
Don't you agree?

104
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,169
I hope rotten Paeng is gone for good

105
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,460
and never returns. Sathu.

106
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Paeng, I'm hungry.

107
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,750
Please let me go my own way.

108
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,250
I really can do it.

109
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,549
But I can't.

110
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,629
Paeng, if it's like this,

111
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,169
how am I going to face
your dad when I die?

112
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,299
I'm only asking for two years.

113
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,840
I'm not asking for your whole life.

114
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,419
Let me keep my promise.

115
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:19,919
Let me look after you.

116
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,460
Let me repay your Dad.

117
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,960
But I really can't go back there.

118
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:30,049
You know why.

119
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,379
Why are you overthinking it?

120
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,710
No one thinks about it anymore.

121
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,590
But I still feel guilty.

122
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,629
Well? You can go back
and fix things then.

123
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,590
You have to go back and show
them that you've changed, right?

124
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,250
If you keep running,

125
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,419
you'll have to keep running

126
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,049
and feel guilty
for the rest of your life.

127
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,419
And in the end, the person
who feels guilty

128
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,710
is me.

129
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,710
Do you want that?

130
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,299
Uncle!

131
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,500
I've already prepared your room
for you.

132
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,210
You can go back tomorrow.

133
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,169
Uh...

134
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,840
What do you say?

135
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,210
Uh... then

136
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,049
I'd like some time to pack
and psych myself up.

137
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,250
Of course.

138
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,590
Well,

139
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:26,379
have you told the others?

140
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,960
Of course I have.

141
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,590
What did they say?

142
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:35,669
No one said anything.

143
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,340
Really?

144
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:42,210
And

145
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,299
what about the other others?

146
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:46,710
What did they say?

147
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,549
The other others?

148
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,049
They didn't say anything either.

149
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,710
No one complained at all?

150
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:01,129
Paeng, I've told you

151
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,090
it's been six years already.

152
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,590
Nobody's thinking about it anymore.

153
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,919
What do you say? When will you come?
Should I pick you up?

154
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,340
It's okay. I can get there myself.

155
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,049
But I...

156
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,629
I'd like to go on the 15th.

157
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,879
Okay.

158
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,669
Gosh!

159
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,419
Wanfahmai!

160
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:06,090
- What is it?
- A treasure map?

161
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:09,590
No, it's a map of Sunshine Farm.

162
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,840
If you can't contact me
for more than three days,

163
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:16,500
go and look for my corpse here.

164
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,629
My corpse should be buried there

165
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,210
because it's the back of the farm.

166
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,669
People don't go there often.

167
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,710
Is it that scary?

168
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:28,000
So are you going to start a new life

169
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,340
- or kill yourself?
- Right?

170
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,210
It's probably the latter.

171
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,000
Paeng,

172
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,710
- your former potential husb...
- Stop.

173
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,500
I really can't let you in
on any secrets, okay?

174
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:47,250
Alright, Artit. Is he that scary?

175
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,840
It's not him

176
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,299
but me. I've done
so many things to him.

177
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:53,419
Paeng,

178
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,590
if you know what you're
going to encounter,

179
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,629
- why would you go back?
- She is right.

180
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,669
I have to go no matter what.

181
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,379
To atone for my sins.

182
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,879
What sins?

183
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:13,879
Huh? I have to go today?

184
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,049
Yes, sir.

185
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,629
But my niece is coming today.

186
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,000
Let Pong go in my place.
I really can't go.

187
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,169
You can't do that, sir.

188
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,669
They want to talk to you alone.

189
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,500
If you don't go and see them today,

190
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,419
they'll cancel all orders
until the end of the year.

191
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,879
That's not good.

192
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,250
I'll go then.

193
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:43,250
You two,

194
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,500
can I get a hug?

195
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,419
It might be the last time we meet.

196
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:50,549
Of course!

197
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:54,799
You jerk, don't talk like that.

198
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,710
I'm about to cry.

199
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,299
Come on.

200
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,340
What do you want to eat? I can
make merit and send it to you.

201
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,799
- Jerk.
- I didn't really mean it.

202
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,299
I'm going now.

203
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,710
Hey! Paeng, call me
when you get there.

204
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,049
Okay.

205
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,460
Call me every day too.

206
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:15,710
Okay.

207
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,549
- Hey!
- Hey, Khanoon!

208
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,629
Enough or she might not get to go.

209
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,919
She's not going to face death.

210
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,460
Come on, Paeng. Get in the car.

211
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,919
Bye-bye.

212
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,169
Bye.

213
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,590
This is disastrous.

214
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,840
That girl's coming back today
and you're telling me now?

215
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,460
It's good that I tell you now
so you can't refuse.

216
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,629
Even if you tell me now,
I'd still refuse.

217
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:46,669
Paeng is coming.

218
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,000
Let her stay in the same room.

219
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,879
I'll be away for 2-3 days
and I'll hurry back.

220
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,799
I don't want to be a part of this.

221
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:53,710
Up to you.

222
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:55,549
But don't cause any trouble.

223
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,000
Go and tell that girl.

224
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,500
I won't be the one
who starts a fight.

225
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,879
I hope that's true.

226
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,500
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

227
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,250
- I have to go now.
- Hold on, Krongprateep.

228
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,049
Have you told Artit

229
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,549
that she's coming today?

230
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:10,629
I haven't. You tell him.

231
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,379
I have to go now or I'll be late.

232
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:13,960
Krongprateep!

233
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:15,919
I'm not a mailbox.

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,049
You keep asking
me to relay messages.

235
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:20,750
Big news, everyone!

236
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,000
- What?
- Big news!

237
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,629
What's the big news!

238
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,799
Let me breathe a little.

239
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,919
If it's not big, I'll kill you.

240
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,669
It's big! Really big!
Bigger than my face!

241
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,669
Listen carefully, everyone.

242
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,299
I'm going to say it once

243
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,799
and I won't repeat myself.

244
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:44,090
Because it might not be the same.

245
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,919
Come on.

246
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,090
Just say it already!

247
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,669
Miss Paeng is coming back!

248
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,129
Oh, oh!

249
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,299
You're all stunned! See?

250
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,960
Is the news big enough?

251
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:06,340
Where did you hear that from?

252
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,460
Straight from Madam's mouth.

253
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:10,250
Holy spirits save us.

254
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,590
The spirits won't be
able to save us.

255
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,299
I knew it.

256
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,960
That's why Master told us
to clean up her room.

257
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,210
Why isn't she leave for good?

258
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,840
Why is she coming back again?

259
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:23,129
What does Mr. Artit say?

260
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,129
Does he know?

261
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:27,049
It's not important
if he knows it or not.

262
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:30,590
Master actually ordered
Miss Paeng to come back.

263
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,169
Who's going to defy him?

264
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,000
Would you dare?

265
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,460
And she dares to come back?

266
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,299
I don't know about that.

267
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,500
But I know.

268
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,590
Huh? What do you know?

269
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,250
I know that from this day forward,

270
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:48,000
there won't be peace on our farm.

271
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,590
Come on, Pong!

272
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,549
Our farm has been quiet
for many years.

273
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,629
It might be entertaining and fun.

274
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,129
Paeng's return will be
la-la-la, la-la-la.

275
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,710
La-la-la. La-la-la.

276
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,169
Huzzah, huzzah.

277
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,880
Are you happy

278
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,089
that our farm going to be chaos?

279
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,799
What should we do?

280
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,210
Why would she come back?

281
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:21,630
Wait, you're not at the farm?

282
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,049
That's right. I have some urgent
business to attend to.

283
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,250
It won't take long.

284
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,960
How many hours?

285
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,960
Around two to three days.

286
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,250
Huh? That is long, Uncle.

287
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,670
Then, I'll...

288
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll return to Bangkok.
I'll be back in three days.

289
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,049
Paeng, Paeng! Hold on.

290
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,960
Paeng,

291
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,299
I've arranged everything.

292
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:48,670
They're probably
expecting you at the farm.

293
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:50,960
Just go and wait for me there.

294
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,170
I'll see you in three days.

295
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,250
(Sunshine Farm)

296
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,710
Three more days!

297
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,839
Will I survive?

298
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,210
Hey!

299
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,589
Just go ahead
if you're in such a rush?

300
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,000
Hey!

301
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,670
They're doing that on purpose.

302
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:45,210
What on earth is going on?

303
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,589
Your parents didn't raise you right!

304
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,420
(Sunshine Farm)

305
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,670
Who's here?

306
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:56,960
Madam Tubtim!

307
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,299
Madam! Madam!

308
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,549
If I'm carrying a bamboo basket,
then it's exactly like in the novel.

309
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:21,130
Why are you smiling at her?

310
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:24,339
I haven't seen her in a while.
I'm just being polite.

311
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,210
I haven't seen you in a long time.

312
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,210
You haven't changed.

313
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,750
Still ill-mannered as always.

314
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,670
Hello, Tubtim.

315
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,589
Who is she looking for?

316
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,210
I wonder.

317
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,750
Where's Artit?

318
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,670
- Oh?
- Where's Artit?

319
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,839
Oh!

320
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:52,420
Look at her, Madam.

321
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,460
She just got here
and already she's asking for him.

322
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,839
You're still haven't given up

323
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,130
to have Mr. Artit
as your husband, haven't you?

324
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,049
You're very brazen.

325
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,049
You only just arrived and you're
already asking for my son.

326
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,960
Please don't get me wrong.

327
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,920
I don't feel anything
for Artit anymore.

328
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,880
When pigs fly.
Who's going to believe you?

329
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,799
Krongprateep let you stay here

330
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:19,920
because he pities you.

331
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,630
Don't go asking
for anything from us.

332
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,880
I'm not going to ask for anything.

333
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,549
I came back
because Uncle asked me to.

334
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,049
Are you saying that

335
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,299
Krongprateep is the one
who told you to come?

336
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,250
I'm not talking down on him.

337
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:39,089
Madam, she's talking back at you.

338
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,130
What a rude girl!

339
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,630
You're still as bad as always.

340
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,500
You're not even remorseful
for what you've done.

341
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:46,130
And now you've brazenly
marched back here.

342
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,670
Your skin must be
as thick as concrete.

343
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,250
Madam, watch out.
She's clenching her fist.

344
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,130
She might hurt us.

345
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,799
I'll go to my room now.

346
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,630
Hold on!

347
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,000
What?

348
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,460
You go.

349
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:17,130
Go.

350
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,500
- Go on.
- Go.

351
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,049
Is she going to punch me?

352
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,750
Your room

353
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,799
is in the workers' shack.

354
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,339
I thought Uncle said
no one would mind if I came.

355
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,210
I think it's more like
no one has forgotten.

356
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,500
Whoa!

357
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,000
Come on, Paeng!

358
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,210
Keep your head down
and accept your fate.

359
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,130
You've done a lot to them.

360
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:02,630
Oh, no.

361
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,589
How are the ducks?

362
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,880
- Three eggs? How many ducks?
- Thirty.

363
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,210
Thirty ducks

364
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,210
- but only three eggs?
- Kaew!

365
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,339
Kaew!

366
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:39,210
Where's Mr. Artit?

367
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,799
- Why are you asking?
- Don't ask me.

368
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,339
Just tell me where he is.

369
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:00,920
You're good, Wanfahmai.

370
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,500
I'm so hungry.

371
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,170
Six years.

372
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:44,460
So many things have changed.

373
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,750
Uncle's pretty amazing to have
done so much.

374
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,960
I'm starving.

375
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,250
Where am I going to eat?

376
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,380
Are you that surprised?

377
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,089
Artit.

378
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,710
Uncle didn't tell me that you're...

379
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,880
Handicapped?

380
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,839
Artit, I'm sorry.

381
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,420
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

382
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,839
Can I exchange your apology

383
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,380
and break your legs instead?

384
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,089
If you knew what I lost,

385
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,960
you wouldn't have
said that stupid apology.

386
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,339
Then,

387
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,250
what do you want me to do?
You can tell me.

388
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,750
You're the one who made me
end up like this.

389
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:52,339
How are you going to repay me?

390
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,670
I'm happy to do anything

391
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:04,250
to make you feel better.

392
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,089
Anything?

393
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,500
Yes.

394
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
You said it yourself, Wanfahmai.

395
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:24,920
Don't say that I'm mean.

396
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,460
Artit, I'm sorry.

397
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,049
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

398
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,670
If you knew what I lost,

399
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,630
you wouldn't have
said that stupid apology.

400
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,500
Follow me.

401
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,000
Where are we going? It's still dark.

402
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,380
Oh? It's already morning?

403
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,089
Follow me.

404
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,299
What are you going to do?

405
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,500
Not me.

406
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:29,130
It's you who has to do it.

407
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,500
Clean it up.

408
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:36,460
But you have to
finish up before noon.

409
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,880
Because I have another job
for you in the afternoon.

410
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,880
But I'm not...

411
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,299
I thought you said you'll do
anything to repay for what you did?

412
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,589
I'm so hungry.

413
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,130
Gosh.

414
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:33,339
Grilled beef.

415
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,799
I'm sorry

416
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,880
for thinking negative
things about you.

417
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,210
So hungry.

418
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,130
Food's here!

419
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,170
- Food's here!
- Food's here?

420
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,250
Mister, you've brought food?

421
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,500
Thank you!

422
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,800
Why are you thanking me?

423
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,170
You're like an angel from heaven
blessing me with food.

424
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,630
These are for the cows.

425
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,880
For the cows?

426
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,920
Don't be sad.

427
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,670
Mr. Artit said to tell you to go
and see him at the canteen.

428
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,920
Canteen?

429
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,050
But the canteen is far away.

430
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,920
- Are there any bikes here?
- There aren't.

431
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,000
It's only a 20-minute walk.

432
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,630
A 20-minute walk?

433
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,380
It's so far.

434
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,500
There.

435
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,050
Eat up.

436
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,050
You're a laborer.
The food's nice today.

437
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,670
Why don't you let him
give the compliments?

438
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,710
What are you doing?

439
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,250
I'm here to eat.

440
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,880
Mr. Artit told you
to wash the dishes,

441
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,210
not to eat.

442
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,210
But I'm hungry.

443
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,920
It's your business, not mine.

444
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,460
What's that stench?

445
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,590
You stink of manure!

446
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,920
Yuck! Go away!
People will lose appetite.

447
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,170
What are you doing?

448
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,250
If you hurt me, Mr. Artit won't
let you get away with this.

449
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,630
I'm just going to say
that I won't put up with it anymore.

450
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,130
Right. Get lost then.

451
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,130
And don't ever come back.

452
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,750
She can't even take it.

453
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,130
That's right. Someone like you
shouldn't have come back,

454
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,460
since you were the reason
Mr. Artit got into a car accident.

455
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,920
She's got some nerve.

456
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,630
Duang,

457
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,710
if you don't say anything,
no one's going to call you a mute.

458
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,090
- Just eat your food.
- Oh?

459
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,710
Why bothering talking?

460
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,000
You're a busybody.

461
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,300
- And I let her get back at me.
- Yes.

462
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Go and get all the dishes and

463
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,800
pots and pans in
the kitchen for her to wash.

464
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,800
If she's going to be brazen and stay
then we should put her to work.

465
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,880
So she gets what she deserves
for hurting Mr. Artit.

466
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,630
Of course, Thongkhum.

467
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,550
I'll let her have it.

468
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,090
Keep an eye on her.
I'm going to see Madam.

469
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,090
I'm so hungry.

470
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,250
Whose dish is this?

471
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,960
They didn't even put it away

472
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,300
or wash it afterward.

473
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,210
See? There's a lot of leftovers.

474
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,250
I'll put it right here.

475
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,000
Uh...

476
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,420
Hurry up and eat. Take big bites.

477
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,050
Someone might see you.

478
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,090
Would you like anything else, Madam?

479
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,300
This is a lot. I won't be
able to finish it all.

480
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,710
Thongkhum, how is she doing?

481
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,130
Mr. Artit's coming down hard on her.

482
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,920
First, she has to clean
the cattle pen in the morning.

483
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,170
Then she had to wash the dishes
for the workers in the afternoon.

484
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,380
Now she's removing the grass
from the farming plots.

485
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,670
She deserves it.

486
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:16,920
Just let her bear with it
as she pleases.

487
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,880
Madam, I've heard

488
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,090
that Master is going to
let her stay forever?

489
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,130
Oh! I don't think so.

490
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,880
He told me she's going to be here
for two years and then she'll go.

491
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,420
Sathu. I hope it really
is two years.

492
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,300
If she stays forever,

493
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,590
my life expectancy will decrease.

494
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,800
I can't even stand seeing her face.

495
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,840
But I don't think she'll be
able to stay for two years.

496
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,670
I should've brought some sunscreen.

497
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,800
It's really hot, Artit.

498
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,420
What's stinky?

499
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,170
Cow manure?

500
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,210
I didn't even get to shower
or brush my teeth.

501
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,130
Now I stink of manure. Oh, well.

502
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,550
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

503
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,800
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

504
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,590
Miss Paeng!

505
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,420
Come on. It might be too late.

506
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,050
Paeng,

507
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,960
Mr. Artit is asking for you.

508
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,090
Not just yet. I'm not done here.

509
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,840
Can the other jobs wait?

510
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,960
I don't think it's about work.

511
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,710
He said for you to meet
him at the house.

512
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,590
- At the house?
- That's right.

513
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,000
What part of the house?

514
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,920
He said for you to go
see him in his room.

515
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,960
But

516
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,340
I can't remember

517
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,920
which room.

518
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,960
I forgot on the way here.

519
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,630
Oh!

520
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,550
Why did you come in here?

521
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,840
Uh...

522
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,250
Or are you going to do
something to my son again?

523
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,710
I'm not going to do anything to him.

524
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,550
Your mouth says you're
not asking for anything.

525
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,750
But your actions
don't go along with it.

526
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,250
I guess it's true,

527
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,250
personality can't be easily changed.

528
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,670
Before, you were just rotten
on the inside.

529
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,670
But now it's outside as well.

530
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,500
Well, Artit told me to come see him.

531
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,880
I don't believe you!

532
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,050
My son would never
call you into our house!

533
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,000
I told her to come.

534
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,670
Why did you do that?
Aren't you scared?

535
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,880
Mom, don't worry.

536
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,130
How can I not worry?

537
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,920
I can't even stand seeing her face.

538
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,550
Oh, dear. I have to go and
run errands too.

539
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,460
Let's do it this way.

540
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,590
I'll let Duang watch over you.

541
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,130
I don't trust her.

542
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,130
I'm going to give you a chance,
but only for today.

543
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,630
Go home.

544
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,050
But if you stay,

545
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,420
you'll face things
harsher than before.

546
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,130
When that time comes,

547
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,090
you'll have missed the chance
that I'm about to give you.

548
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,500
Yes, Dad?

549
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,090
Artit, where's Paeng?

550
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,960
She's right here with me.

551
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,090
I can't get a hold of Paeng.

552
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,670
I'm very worried about her.

553
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,880
No one did anything to her?

554
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,300
Your niece is perfectly safe.

555
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,880
Don't joke around with me, Artit.

556
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,800
Can I talk to her?

557
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,300
Artit, I'd like to talk to her.

558
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,380
Uncle.

559
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,090
Paeng, how are you doing?

560
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,340
No one did anything
to you, did they?

561
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,670
No one.

562
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:29,210
I told Artit to look after you
and help train you for work.

563
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,210
He didn't defy my orders, did he?

564
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,880
Artit,

565
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,840
is doing a good job
looking after me.

566
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,170
If anything happens,
just hang in there.

567
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,000
Promise me

568
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,550
that I'll get to see you

569
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,300
when I go back.

570
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,840
Yes, I promise.

571
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,750
Bye.

572
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,960
What did you promise my dad?

573
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,420
I promised him that
I'll wait here to see him.

574
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,960
Wanfahmai.

575
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,800
I'm just waiting for him.

576
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,590
Alright.

577
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:21,170
Then I'll consider it your refusal
to the chance I'm about to give you.

578
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,840
You'll die on my watch.

579
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,250
I'm going to tell Uncle.

580
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,550
Wanfahmai!

581
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,960
I can help myself.

582
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,920
It's like talking to a brick wall.

583
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,380
You can do anything you want to me.

584
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,590
I've already told myself

585
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,460
that I'll stay so I can pay you back

586
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,920
until you forgive me.

587
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,800
Okay, I forgive you!

588
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,960
Go home then.

589
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,460
If you actually forgive me one day,

590
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,880
I will go.

591
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,170
I'm going back to work now.

592
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,340
Hey!

593
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,630
Hey!

594
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,920
What's going on?

595
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,460
This is not the time to be broken.

596
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,250
What are you doing, Wanfahmai?

597
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,420
Stop it now! Stop!

598
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,920
Get your filthy hands off me!

599
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,380
Hey! Stop that!

600
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,340
Let me go! I can do it!

601
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:12,130
You're here, Mr. Artit.

602
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,210
His wheelchair broke down.

603
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,840
So I brought him here.

604
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,750
Have some dinner.

605
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,590
I'll go and eat at the canteen.

606
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,420
Don't go yet.

607
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,130
Take me to the table.

608
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,590
It looks delicious.

609
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:54,670
I've cooked all of your favorites.

610
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,960
I did my best.

611
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,000
You've been working hard all day.

612
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:01,590
I think you should eat now.

613
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,500
Thank you.

614
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,130
Wanfahmai!

615
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,460
Come and eat with me.

616
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,630
Is he possessed?

617
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,420
Come and sit over here.

618
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,920
What's wrong with him?

619
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,670
How should I know?

620
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,380
Come.

621
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,050
Sit.

622
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,670
Who told you to sit here?

623
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,380
- Duang.
- Yes?

624
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,300
Bring Dizzy's bowl.

625
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,880
Okay, sir.

626
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,380
Here you go.

627
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,710
Your place is right there.

628
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,920
Eat up.

629
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:22,800
Come on.

630
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,920
If you don't feel comfortable
eating with me,

631
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,420
I'll go.

632
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,960
Do you think you're going
to be able to trick me?

633
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,250
How am I tricking you?

634
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,550
You're not like this.

635
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:46,840
A person's personality

636
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,630
isn't something that can be
changed easily.

637
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,130
That's too polite, sir.

638
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,210
More like it's her true colors.

639
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:56,170
That's right.

640
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,920
Personality can be changed.

641
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,420
But true colors can't.

642
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,880
Have it your way.

643
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,840
If you want me to do anything,

644
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,880
just have someone fetch me.

645
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,130
Arrogant!

646
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:24,630
Darn it!

647
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,880
I was so satisfied

648
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,210
when Mr. Artit
threw the food on the floor.

649
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,210
Her jaw dropped.

650
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,960
I'm satisfied too.

651
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:42,550
Next time, I'm going to record
a video of her face.

652
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,670
Is there going to be a next time?

653
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,340
If she's still going to be
brazen and stay, there will be.

654
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,590
We have to let
Mr. Artit go hard on her.

655
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,840
I never thought he could
be this mean.

656
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,960
- That's true.
- It's so satisfying.

657
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,670
He really put a smile on my face.

658
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,000
By the way, do you think she'll
be able to endure it?

659
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,340
Come on. Even if she doesn't,

660
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,710
what else can she do?

661
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,380
Oh, did you forget
how evil she can be?

662
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,960
Beneath that calm

663
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,920
and innocent exterior,

664
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,420
she might be concocting something

665
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,590
or lose control of herself.

666
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,960
If she dares to do it,
then just go ahead.

667
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,250
There's Mr. Artit, Madam,

668
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,670
and all the farmhands here.

669
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:29,750
If she dares do it,
then come and get it.

670
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,840
That's true.

671
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,210
I'm so satisfied.

672
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,670
Gosh!

673
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,090
What am I going up against?

674
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:46,960
Oh! Uh.

675
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:48,630
Hi.

676
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,880
Hey! Oh my gosh,
what have you been doing?

677
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,300
- Why are you battered like that?
- Did you climb three mountains?

678
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,380
Worse.

679
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,590
I don't get to eat.
I'm sleep deprived.

680
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,460
I don't get to shower either.

681
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,670
Hey!

682
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,590
I don't want to get into details.

683
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,750
In short, I'm atoning for my sins.

684
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,500
I'll go and wash my face.

685
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,960
Come on! The water's not running!

686
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,500
Where's your uncle?
Why isn't he helping?

687
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,130
I know right!

688
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,960
I came when he's away for work

689
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,880
so they're hazing me.

690
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,460
I'm just unlucky.

691
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,960
What did you do to them?
Something serious?

692
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,340
I'm choosing not to answer you.

693
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,630
I'm starting to worry about you.

694
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,960
- Me too.
- Is it going to get any worse?

695
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,420
Right?

696
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,460
Is there going to be
anything worse than this?

697
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,000
Paeng! Paeng!

698
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:03,000
- The screen just went black!
- Paeng! Hello?

699
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,420
- Let's pack it up.
- Okay.

700
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,000
I'm so hungry.

701
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,460
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

702
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,250
I'll eat it.

703
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,210
Have you done packing things up?

704
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,000
Hey!

705
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,050
How come you allowed
her to eat my food?

706
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,460
She just came over and grabbed some.

707
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,500
Next time, don't let just
anyone come and eat my food.

708
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,380
People can be so shameless.

709
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,840
Well, I've already eaten it.

710
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,250
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

711
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,170
I almost didn't see you there.

712
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:39,250
You want to die?

713
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,920
I don't want to, sir.

714
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,250
Mr. Artit.

715
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,340
She didn't get to eat. She's
been working hard the whole day.

716
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,300
She doesn't have
access to utilities either.

717
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,550
She might not be able to make it.

718
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,460
Who told her to endure it?

719
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,210
But she's a woman living alone

720
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,090
in a dark room.

721
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,050
Should we let her have some light?

722
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,340
Just torture her during the daytime.

723
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,590
If you turn it on for you,

724
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,920
go and be on her team.

725
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,960
You left me some candles?

726
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,960
Do I have to be thankful?

727
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,920
My battery is dead.

728
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,250
Do not show her any mercy.
Do not help her.

729
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,460
Anyone who defies my orders,

730
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,710
be prepared to find a new job.

731
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:46,210
Whoever can chase

732
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,920
this woman out of the farm,

733
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,460
will be rewarded.

734
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:54,380
Whoa, right in front of me.

735
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,460
But if she's still being stubborn

736
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,170
and I lose control and kill her.

737
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,210
Just turn a blind eye,

738
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,380
understand?

739
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,630
Go back to work.

740
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:18,550
I mean you. Get to work!

741
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,630
But I haven't eaten.

742
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,590
How will I have the energy to work?

743
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,590
The grass you removed. Just eat it.

744
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,170
Artit,

745
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,250
you can make me work
as hard as you want.

746
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,840
But humans need food and sleep.

747
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,130
If I get to eat,

748
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,000
I'll have the energy to work.

749
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,800
So I can work for you.

750
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,590
Isn't that better?

751
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,550
But I don't want you to.

752
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,380
I don't want you to
set foot in here.

753
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,550
My family's already paid
off the debt to you.

754
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:52,840
Why are you still here?

755
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,550
Consider it my repayment to you.

756
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:00,250
I don't want it.

757
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,300
You really want me to go?

758
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,840
Artit,

759
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:11,960
there's not going to be a day

760
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,880
that you forgive me, is there?

761
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,880
Look at me.

762
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,380
And tell me

763
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,050
if you deserve forgiveness

764
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,300
for what you've done.

765
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,880
Promise me,

766
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,130
that I'll get to see you
when I go back.

767
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,590
I don't want you to
set foot in here.

768
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,420
My family's already paid
off the debt to you.

769
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,960
Why are you still here?

770
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,210
I'm only asking for two years.

771
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,670
I'm not asking for your whole life.

772
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,050
Look at me.

773
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,630
And tell me

774
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,590
if you deserve forgiveness

775
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,380
for what you've done.

776
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:58,420
You have to go back and show
them that you've changed.

777
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,380
If you keep running,

778
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,670
you'll have to keep running

779
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:05,250
and feel guilty
for the rest of your life.

780
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,300
Hiya! Hiya! Whoo!

781
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:27,880
Good vibes only! Today I,
I can do anything

782
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,840
to impress the ladies

783
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:33,460
Yo! Yo! Yo!

784
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:38,210
I'm single. I need love.
Anyone can come to me for love.

785
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,840
It's Paeng's car.

786
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,090
What's the rush?

787
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:46,170
Or maybe!

788
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:50,800
Duang, you have to be
my eyes and ears.

789
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:53,500
Artit is busy
trying to kick her out.

790
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,300
I'm afraid he might fall
for her tricks again.

791
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,000
Don't worry, Madam.

792
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:03,210
I'll be your ears, eyes, mouth,
hands, and feet.

793
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,630
Excellent.

794
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:10,300
Mr. Artit! Mr. Artit!

795
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,880
Mr. Artit! Madam!

796
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,250
I'm so tired! Where's Artit?

797
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,800
- What...
- What's up? Say it.

798
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,500
Well... Well...

799
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,590
- Come...
- Come on. Just say it.

800
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,500
- The thing is...
- Again?

801
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:26,880
Duang, you don't have to
be my mouth right now.

802
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:29,800
What's the matter, Saeb?

803
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,590
Paeng's left the farm.

804
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,960
Huh?

805
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,590
I'm so tired.

806
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,130
Why did you bring me here?

807
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,340
Why didn't you drive me?

808
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:54,340
Madam, you practically ran here.

809
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,170
Duang, check inside to see
if she's actually gone.

810
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,590
- Okay.
- Wait, wait.

811
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:03,800
I'll do it myself.

812
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:13,710
Gosh!

813
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:15,840
What's the matter, Madam?

814
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,880
Gosh!

815
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,800
- All her belongings are here.
- That's right.

816
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,710
Saeb, so what is it?

817
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,090
Is she gone or not?

818
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,250
I saw her. She's really gone.

819
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,380
Was she in a rush
and left her stuff?

820
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,590
Saeb, are you sure that you saw her?

821
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,800
With my own eyes, Madam.

822
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,500
She drove away so fast.

823
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,420
Let's do this. Move all her
things out.

824
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,630
I'll let Krongprateep send them
back to her by mail.

825
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,380
Should we just burn all of it?

826
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,960
That's going too far.

827
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:57,670
Go and pack up her stuff Go.

828
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:03,670
It wasn't that hard to
chase her out after all.

829
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,960
Right?

830
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,170
Who ordered that stuff?

831
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,800
What's all this?
Why did you bring them here?

832
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,250
Please sign for them, ma'am.

833
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,670
I won't. I didn't order them.

834
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,710
But the instruction
says to deliver here.

835
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,960
This is Sunshine Farm, isn't it?

836
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,210
That's right.
But I didn't order these.

837
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,250
Portable stove, plates,

838
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,880
a blender, and a lot of dried food.

839
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:32,000
You can just sign for them.

840
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:34,130
Everything's already been paid for.

841
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,710
Take them all back.
Don't try to con us.

842
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,960
People these days are sleazy.

843
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,420
But the customer's
name is Wanfahmai.

844
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,800
- Huh?
- It's mine.

845
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,210
Huh?

846
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,710
You came quickly. You got here
before me. The service is great.

847
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,090
But do you mind delivering
them to another location?

848
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:54,170
- I'll lead you there.
- Of course.

849
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,750
- This way, please.
- Okay, miss.

850
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,880
Move them all out.
I'm not allowing this.

851
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,500
Well, then. We can just
put them here for now.

852
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:20,840
Understood.

853
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:27,590
Duang, she got inside!

854
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,960
Oh?

855
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:32,380
Come here! Get out now!

856
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:35,960
Where are you taking that?

857
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,380
Madam won't allow this.
Give it to me.

858
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,670
But I bought it.
Why can't I take them inside?

859
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,420
No!

860
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:47,500
Ah! Madam!

861
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,420
It hurts!

862
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,460
Paeng,

863
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,880
how dare you hurt her?

864
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:56,750
If you weren't so biased,
you'd see that I didn't do it.

865
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,090
What should I do with you?

866
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:01,670
What are you doing to my mom?

867
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,920
I thought you were gone.

868
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,710
You're still being brazen
and staying?

869
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,670
I didn't say I was going.

870
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,170
I just went out shopping.

871
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,250
Take these things away.

872
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,880
You have no right to do
whatever you want here.

873
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,960
What do you want me to do?

874
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,090
I can't eat at the house.

875
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,550
I can't eat in the kitchen.

876
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,090
I can't use Thongkhum's
kitchen to cook either.

877
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,960
I can't eat via
photosynthesis either.

878
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,300
Are you being cheeky with me?

879
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,460
I wasn't. I was only explaining.

880
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:44,630
Cheeky!

881
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,300
You're deliberately
getting on my nerves.

882
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:51,340
I really came here to work.

883
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:53,840
And since I have to eat,

884
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:57,300
but everyone here won't let me
use anything from the farm,

885
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,840
I need survival gear.

886
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,460
You've gotten better
at talking back.

887
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,090
I'm not talking back.

888
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,250
I'm only explaining.

889
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,170
If there's anything you're upset
about, just tell me.

890
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,670
Or if you're still thinking
that I'm invading your farm.

891
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,500
If you want me to pay rent

892
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:21,920
and utility bills,

893
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,960
you can just tell me.
I'm happy to pay.

894
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:25,710
If it makes everyone happy.

895
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,880
I'll be happy

896
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,880
when you leave.

897
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,300
People don't want you here
but you're still being so brazen.

898
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:34,920
I have to stay here.

899
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,210
Look at her, Madam!

900
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,250
Don't you even have
a shred of emotion left?

901
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,960
I do.

902
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,130
I caused this to happen to you,

903
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:51,130
so I need to pay you back.

904
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:54,460
I know what I've done in the past

905
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,380
makes it hard for you to believe

906
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:58,210
that I'm truly remorseful.

907
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,250
But I will do it.

908
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,170
I will prove to you

909
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,210
that I fully intend
to apologize to you.

910
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:08,500
I don't need an apology from you.

911
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,590
I believe

912
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:16,050
that if I put my mind to it,

913
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:17,920
you'll see it.

914
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,380
Alright.

915
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,840
You said you won't be
a nuisance staying here.

916
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,300
Then I'll take back the house.

917
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,710
Go put up a tent and you there.

918
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,710
You're being sarcastic.

919
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,880
I'm not.

920
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,880
I'm just doing what you want.

921
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:38,800
How am I going to sleep tonight?

922
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,920
Think for yourself.

923
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,670
Aren't you good at problem-solving?

924
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,420
Artit, can you be
a little reasonable?

925
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:52,960
It's because I hate you,
that's my reason.

926
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,000
But you have no right to hurt me.

927
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,590
You have no right
to ruin my life as well.

928
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,340
But if you want to prove it,

929
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:19,340
I'll let you do it.

930
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,250
Do you dare?

931
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:28,300
Okay.

932
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:41,340
You want me to make some charcoal?

933
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,380
Not make charcoal.

934
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,130
I want you to make wood vinegar.

935
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,630
Don't tell me that
you don't know it.

936
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,090
Didn't you study agriculture?

937
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,000
I know it.

938
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,960
Wood vinegar is produced
from burning charcoal,

939
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:59,300
from the destructive distillation of
wood at 300-400 degrees Celcius.

940
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,960
It's very useful for agriculture
and livestock development.

941
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:04,250
It can be used
to kill microorganisms

942
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,500
and mold.

943
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:07,750
It can also kill many kinds of
plant diseases and insects.

944
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:09,800
Your theory is top-notch.

945
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:11,800
But I hope you're also practical.

946
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:14,210
I can do it.

947
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,710
If you can't,

948
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:18,340
you have to leave the farm.

949
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:21,710
Okay.

950
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,460
Good.

951
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:26,550
Consider it an agreement.

952
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,050
Here's the pail.
Find some soil yourself.

953
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,880
- Let me help, Paeng.
- No!

954
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:34,880
Let her do it alone.

955
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,460
And I'll be back to
check up on your work.

956
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,380
Move this wood to somewhere else.

957
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,250
Don't leave even a single stick.

958
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,960
Yes, sir.

959
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,420
Gosh!

960
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,170
What perfect timing!

961
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:22,340
They're out of wood
right when I need it.

962
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:26,960
Fallen branches.

963
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,670
Fallen branches in the woods.

964
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,630
That's it.
Fallen branches in the woods.

965
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,090
Fallen branches in the woods.

966
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,380
It's good I learned about this.

967
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,590
Oh, where's the wood?

968
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,800
What a bummer!

969
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:34,210
It's a bummer for me too.
I thought she's going away.

970
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,210
She's so shameless.

971
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:38,420
She knows people hate her
but she stayed anyway.

972
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,300
"I'm going to have my own kitchen."
"I won't bother Sunshine Farm."

973
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,630
She's rich. She can do anything.

974
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,500
She solves her problems with money.

975
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,550
I hate her.

976
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,710
Why doesn't she buy a fridge and
a washing machine then?

977
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,920
Hey, Thongkhum.

978
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,420
Has she bought them
but they haven't been delivered?

979
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,880
Then that means
she's staying permanently?

980
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,840
No! I couldn't handle it.

981
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,880
I couldn't handle it either.

982
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:07,550
What should we do?

983
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,170
I know. We can curse her

984
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,670
so that there's an incident that
forces her out.

985
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,670
Just go. Gone for good.
And never come back.

986
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,250
Sathu.

987
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:42,300
Stay here. Don't go anywhere.

988
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,550
I'm exhausted!

989
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,380
I'm going to whack you
to death if I catch you.

990
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,630
I'm mad now.

991
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:22,550
Hey! Oh, it's a kid!

992
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:26,170
- Come here!
- Let go!

993
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,050
Let me go!

994
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:31,670
Why, you little!

995
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,960
Who are you calling little?

996
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:38,340
The name's Madeaw, sister.
This is my turf.

997
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,800
Next time, address me right.

998
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,050
Okay, Madeaw.

999
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,800
Why are you stealing my sticks?

1000
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,130
I ain't stealing, fool.

1001
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:51,130
You didn't ask permission
to collect those sticks.

1002
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,840
So I've got to exert my power.

1003
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,050
Bro,

1004
01:13:57,130 --> 01:14:00,130
then I'd like your permission
to collect these sticks.

1005
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,710
Alright, sister. You're lucky
I'm fond of cute girls.

1006
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,960
There's a 20 baht concession fee.

1007
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,340
Twenty?

1008
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,630
Acting gangster at this age?

1009
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,420
When are you going to finish?
Working piece by piece like that.

1010
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,880
No one's helping me.

1011
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,920
Do you want to help me?

1012
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:34,420
It's five baht per stick.

1013
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:35,800
You're going to charge me?

1014
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,460
It's alright. I'll do it myself.

1015
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:40,670
Then, it's five baht
for the whole gig.

1016
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,460
Special promotion.

1017
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,300
Okay, deal.

1018
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,880
How do you know to do all this?

1019
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,750
With a pretty face like that,
you don't look capable.

1020
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:19,550
Madeaw, can you help me hold this?

1021
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,670
Right here.

1022
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,460
That's all?

1023
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,340
Yes, that's all.

1024
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:02,920
Wait for the furnace to cool.

1025
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,380
Tomorrow we'll be able
to collect the charcoal.

1026
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:06,630
That's impressive.

1027
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,590
I didn't expect this from a girl
with a pretty face.

1028
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,130
Don't underestimate me.

1029
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:14,710
Here. Take 10 baht.
Thanks for helping.

1030
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:16,710
Yes! I've got money!

1031
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,750
Later, sister!

1032
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,210
Let it be known.
Bring on the bullying.

1033
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,550
Endure it.

1034
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:57,960
I made Artit handicapped.

1035
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:03,460
That's why he's so angry.

1036
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:07,750
I ruined his life.

1037
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:10,670
I have to accept it.

1038
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,710
Just be patient.

1039
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:49,840
Mr. Artit's asking for you
to go to work.

1040
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,960
It's morning already?

1041
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,170
I feel like I haven't had any sleep.

1042
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:24,300
Oh, sir? Have you seen Paeng's work?

1043
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,880
The color's really nice.

1044
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:28,340
She definitely knows
temperature control.

1045
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:31,380
- It's just a fluke.
- I don't think so.

1046
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,710
I had to train for a while
to be able to do this.

1047
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,250
We even hid nearly all the wood.

1048
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,380
Should I fire you

1049
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,130
and hire her as your replacement?

1050
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,630
No, sir.

1051
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:45,050
- Just get lost.
- Okay.

1052
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:46,960
Hold on.

1053
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:51,170
I have an idea.

1054
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:54,130
I have a job for you.

1055
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,840
Give that back!

1056
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,130
Come on!

1057
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:54,750
Miss Paeng.

1058
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,340
Miss Paeng,

1059
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:58,340
Mr. Artit told you to go
and organize some stuff.

1060
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,500
Let's go.

1061
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:08,500
Please come in.

1062
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:12,630
He told you to organize
the stuff in this room.

1063
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,630
Where is it?

1064
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,090
Just inside.

1065
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,050
Hey!

1066
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,340
Hey! What are you doing?

1067
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:29,800
Why are you locking me in?

1068
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:31,340
Hey!

1069
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,420
Hey!

1070
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:42,750
You sicko!

1071
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,710
Mr. Artit!

1072
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,420
You seem very happy today.

1073
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:09,590
Your face was so red
with anger the other day.

1074
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:12,460
What are you happy about?

1075
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,340
- Do you want to know?
- Yes, I do.

1076
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,090
Give me 500 and I'll tell you.

1077
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,250
Whoa, 500?

1078
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,090
I don't have that much.

1079
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,630
I only have 50. Is it okay?

1080
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,300
Here, sir.

1081
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,250
I locked her up.

1082
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,460
I'm thinking of
leaving her for a couple of days

1083
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:34,300
and letting her starve.

1084
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:35,750
Gosh! Sir!

1085
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,300
What if she actually dies?
What are you going to do?

1086
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:42,210
You're now a co-conspirator.
Because you know everything.

1087
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,460
Mr. Artit!

1088
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:46,000
I didn't mean it!

1089
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,210
I didn't want to
conspire or anything.

1090
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,920
- Too late.
- Sir, can I have my money back?

1091
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:56,800
Sir, please don't hurt me!

1092
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,090
Please don't do this to me!

1093
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:03,050
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

1094
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:05,340
I'll give you another 100 baht.

1095
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:08,090
Everything will be silenced.
Take it, sir.

1096
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,090
- You know everything.
- Come on, sir!

1097
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:35,840
Car key.

1098
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:38,840
Toothbrush.

1099
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,380
Instead of bringing a phone!

1100
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,800
Jeez, Paeng!

1101
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,960
You're so unlucky, it's like
a TV show.

1102
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,500
Whoa!

1103
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,300
This is so high.

1104
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:38,710
Alright, then.

1105
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:55,170
I'd like to dedicate the merit made
from the offering this morning

1106
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:58,000
to all my karmic relations.

1107
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:01,880
Bogeymen, wicked ghosts with
no relatives, and wandering spirits.

1108
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:05,130
Please come and revel
in the merit I've made.

1109
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:06,920
Sathu.

1110
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,550
Do you know where Artit is?

1111
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:12,800
Dear, dear.

1112
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,050
You rushed over like
you're chasing merit.

1113
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:18,340
Look at you. You look like you just
left your grave.

1114
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,300
Are you a bogeyman
or a wicked ghost?

1115
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:23,000
Probably both.

1116
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:25,960
I have something
important to talk to Artit about.

1117
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:30,710
Madam, Madam! We just made merit.

1118
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,130
You have to calm down.

1119
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:36,170
Why would he be here?
He's in his office, of course.

1120
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,380
- Thank you.
- Huh?

1121
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,460
Why would you tell her that, Madam?

1122
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:45,000
- Oh, dear.
- You shouldn't have been stupid...

1123
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,420
What? Duang!

1124
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:49,460
Are you trying to say I'm stupid?

1125
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:52,000
No, I said I wanted
to have some stew.

1126
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,960
I'll smack you in
the head with this.

1127
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:56,340
See? I haven't even finished pouring
the ceremonial water yet.

1128
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,880
Let's finish it, Madam.

1129
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,340
- Why did you come in, Saeb?
- Let's let Miss Paeng out.

1130
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,460
- Are you that worried?
- Yes, sir.

1131
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:12,340
- Saeb!
- Sir,

1132
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,800
the pen broke.
Don't be angry, please.

1133
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,170
Think about it,

1134
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:20,000
you locked her up like that.

1135
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:21,960
What are you going
to do if she dies?

1136
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:24,050
If she's that weak,
then she's a lost cause.

1137
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:25,920
Come on, Mr. Artit.

1138
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:28,710
She's only a tiny girl.

1139
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,630
You being too harsh on her.

1140
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,590
If she got sick and died,

1141
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,170
you'll be cursed.

1142
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:35,340
Saeb,

1143
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,500
are you siding with someone else
more you do with me?

1144
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,880
No... No, sir.

1145
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,670
I'm only worried about you.

1146
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,050
If Miss Paeng dies,

1147
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,630
you'll get arrested.

1148
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:47,250
You're exaggerating.

1149
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,920
Come on, sir!

1150
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:50,920
- Sir...
- He's not exaggerating.

1151
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:55,550
I can press charges
for unlawful detention.

1152
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,050
Miss Paeng!

1153
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:59,920
You got out! I'm so happy!

1154
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,840
You're so good! She got out, sir!

1155
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:07,960
If there's anything,
please talk nicely.

1156
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:09,960
Calm down.

1157
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:14,090
No need to make those angry eyes.
Focus on reconciliation.

1158
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,050
Leave us, Saeb.

1159
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:20,090
Okay, sir. I'll go.
No need to shoo me away.

1160
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:23,550
Because I don't want
any part of this anymore.

1161
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:45,710
What should I do?

1162
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:51,420
Thongkhum, should I go to see my son
or wait for the news here?

1163
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,840
- Just wait here, Madam.
- Really?

1164
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,920
Paeng won't dare do anything to him.

1165
01:26:58,210 --> 01:26:59,670
It anything's going to happen,

1166
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:02,050
it would be Artit
who snaps her neck.

1167
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:05,050
So I don't have to be
worried about my son?

1168
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:06,630
- Don't worry.
- Don't worry.

1169
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,630
It's you who's being childish.

1170
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:12,840
Childish?

1171
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,920
Do you think I'm playing with you?

1172
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:17,590
That's right. You're being childish.

1173
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:19,460
A vengeful child.

1174
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,050
What did you say?

1175
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,420
Be careful or your heart
might shatter into pieces.

1176
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,750
Who caused me to end up like this?

1177
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,500
Artit, I know I was wrong.

1178
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,710
I'd like to atone for
everything I've done.

1179
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,800
But you have to
give me a chance too.

1180
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,960
Let me prove that I'm a new person.

1181
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,800
You can order me around
as much as you want.

1182
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:45,420
But not like this.

1183
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,880
I will do it until you're gone.

1184
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:50,590
I will tell Uncle.

1185
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:52,170
Go ahead.

1186
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:54,710
Anytime something happens
you just run to my dad.

1187
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,630
My dad believes
everything you say anyway.

1188
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,250
Do you want to have him then?
I'll give him to you.

1189
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:05,050
You're angry that he loves me.

1190
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:08,630
That's true.

1191
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:12,130
He loves you.

1192
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,250
But he has mercy on me

1193
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:16,250
because he's seen
what I've been through.

1194
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:18,630
I've been through a lot more
than what you've seen.

1195
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:21,090
Don't worry

1196
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,210
that he will love me more than you.

1197
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:25,170
Because that's impossible.

1198
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:30,960
He wants me here
just to learn the ropes.

1199
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:33,960
Once he sees that
I can manage things,

1200
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:36,210
he'll let me go my own way.

1201
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,090
It's only two years, Artit.

1202
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,130
Can't you just endure it?

1203
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:46,380
You ordered me around
for three days.

1204
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:49,090
it was exhausting
but I was able to withstand it.

1205
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:51,460
You can't compare
two years and three days.

1206
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,000
Look at me.

1207
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,800
If you were me, would you be able to

1208
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,460
put up with being like this?

1209
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:02,920
Both my dreams and my future
are ruined.

1210
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:06,210
Everything I'd accomplished was
ruined because of you!

1211
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:11,250
I needed therapy for years on end.

1212
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:12,840
I couldn't eat or sleep

1213
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,630
because I was afraid that
I'd be handicapped.

1214
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:16,960
Would you be able to endure it?

1215
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:20,090
Would you?
I almost became handicapped.

1216
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:27,590
Almost handicapped?

1217
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,380
That's right.

1218
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,090
But I'm sorry

1219
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,960
that I didn't end up that way.

1220
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:19,750
Kot!

1221
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,550
Are you happy to see me?

1222
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:22,960
I'm very happy!

1223
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,750
Seeing her be happy
with the person she loves

1224
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,050
makes me happy too.

1225
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:28,710
Wise but heartbreaking.

1226
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,210
You couldn't seduce me
so you're seducing my friend?

1227
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,920
You can't stand not
having a guy in your life?

1228
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:36,130
Snake! Snake!

1229
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:37,500
- Snake! Snake!
- Paeng!

1230
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:39,500
For some things,
if you wait too long,

1231
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:42,500
you might miss it. You might have
to wait for the rest of your life.

1232
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:43,670
I'm not eating anymore!

1233
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:45,800
Are you trying to be a ringleader?

1234
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,630
She started a mob.
I saw it with my own eyes.

1235
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:50,500
Where's Paeng?
