1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,810
Why don't you ask me nicely
what you want to know?

3
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,599
Do you know that I've waited
for the day for you to be here

4
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,560
with me for a very long time?

5
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,919
I'll try my best to be gentle.

6
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,199
You're as vile as your mom.

7
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,960
You have no right to
insult my mother.

8
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,199
Hey!

9
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,639
Restrain him!

10
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,599
You don't have to be
tough all the time.

11
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,800
Be vulnerable sometimes
so that I can take care of you.

12
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,879
I don't object

13
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,039
to accepting you as my niece

14
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,280
or a close relative.

15
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,240
But as for a daughter-in-law...

16
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,240
I can't have children.

17
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,400
If your family doesn't accept me,

18
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,759
then we can't love
each other anymore.

19
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,159
I'll explain it to Mom.

20
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,439
then we can't love
each other anymore.

21
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,479
I want you to believe in me

22
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,960
so that we'll be able to
get married.

23
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,360
Please wait for me.

24
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,199
I understand you.

25
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,079
Mom wouldn't let Non get married?

26
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,079
That's right. She won't allow it.

27
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,610
She was so happy yesterday.

28
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,959
She even wanted them
to get married within the year.

29
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,480
What happened, Kot?

30
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,839
Well, Ling...

31
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,839
can't have children.

32
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,000
What?

33
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,920
Non and I

34
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,199
are both hopeless romantics.

35
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,360
I'm also unsuccessful in love

36
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,480
because I loved someone
who didn't love me back.

37
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,959
Now Non as well?

38
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,959
It's not the same.

39
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,319
Those two are in love
and were about to get married.

40
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,959
What a shame.

41
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,120
That's true.

42
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
Non's probably going
to be devastated.

43
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
I understand the pain well.

44
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,439
My parents are being unreasonable.

45
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,240
I'll have to take matters
into my own hands.

46
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,839
How are you going to do that?

47
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,879
You don't have to know.

48
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,560
Nang, what on earth are you doing?

49
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,050
If you're going to get drunk just
because Mom said what she said,

50
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,519
you can resign
from being my brother.

51
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,120
Who told you? Kot, right?

52
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,279
Stay out of my business.

53
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,720
Get lost.

54
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,240
Non, don't call me nosy.

55
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,600
It was so painful when Artit
broke my heart.

56
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,480
So I don't want anyone
to feel the same pain I did.

57
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,480
You have some who loves you
and you love her.

58
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,639
Why don't you fight for each other?

59
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,959
This is a tiny obstacle and you
already backed down.

60
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,800
You're so not my brother.

61
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,600
You have to make a decision

62
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,519
whether you want
to keep going or stop.

63
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,480
Because if it's the former,
I'll go and pick Ling up myself.

64
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,240
I'll help you.

65
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,959
Thanks, Nang.

66
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,519
But let me tell you one thing.

67
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,680
Someone like me

68
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,920
never backs down.

69
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,160
- Hey!
- Hey!

70
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,360
You started this first!
The bed's all dirty!

71
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,800
- Ling! Ling!
- Keep it down, Nang.

72
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,639
Ling, you're here.

73
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,600
Ling, it's not easy for you and Non

74
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,399
to be in love with each other.

75
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,319
- You have to come with me.
- Hold on.

76
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,079
Let me finish up my work here first.

77
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,800
Why are you leaving my brother?

78
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,879
Do you know how sad he is?

79
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,040
Wait. I don't understand.

80
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,879
There are so many ways
to deal with infertility.

81
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,040
You can adopt as well.

82
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,839
As for Mom,
I'll deal with her myself.

83
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,560
You have to come with me right now.

84
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,199
Hold on,

85
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,839
where are you taking me?

86
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,639
To talk to my parents.

87
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,160
Let's go. We have to
help each other.

88
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,399
We have to join forces for this one!

89
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,600
- Let's go.
- Hey, Nang!

90
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,439
Right here.

91
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,959
- Sit down.
- Hello.

92
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,240
Why do you have to get in the way

93
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,360
of Ling and Non's love life?

94
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,759
You're being very mean.

95
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,319
You won't let Non marry Ling
just because she's infertile.

96
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,680
If they want children,
they can go adopt.

97
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,160
Parents

98
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,120
can only raise a child physically.

99
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,519
If you force them too much,
they could become delinquents.

100
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,959
Nang, I'm not a kid anymore.

101
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,519
What are you smiling about, Non?

102
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,319
This is your life.
Aren't you troubled at all?

103
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,000
You too, Mom and Dad.
What are you smiling about?

104
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,759
I'm being serious.

105
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,000
I was a little startled yesterday.

106
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,879
I wanted a grandchild so much,
so I said what I said.

107
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,519
Dad calmed me down, so I realized

108
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,079
that it's Non's life.

109
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,399
We have to let him choose
his own path.

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,399
We have no right to intervene.

111
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,399
That's right. I saw how much
they love each other

112
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,920
and how sincere their love is.

113
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,920
How can we possibly get in the way?

114
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,639
Whatever makes you happy,
will make us happy too.

115
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,240
Whomever you love,
we will love her too.

116
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,079
My son is now an adult.

117
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,480
I believe that you've chosen
the right person.

118
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,680
And the person he's chosen is you.

119
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,720
So you let me go
back and forth like crazy?

120
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
It's because of you, Kot.

121
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,450
You made it such a big deal,
saying that

122
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,759
you won't let them get married.

123
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,559
Kot, you're being overly dramatic.

124
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,450
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,399
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

126
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,759
Actually, there's
a silver lining to this.

127
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,279
Now I got to see

128
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,279
that my daughter can be smart too.

129
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,330
Don't take it off again.

130
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,639
Congratulations to you both.

131
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,360
Stay in love with each other.

132
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,720
Mutual love isn't that common.

133
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,600
Ling saw the goodness in Non,

134
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,210
unlike someone
who can't see the goodness in me.

135
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,679
But it's okay.

136
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,480
The matter of love
is not a big deal for me.

137
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,960
Others might not see
your goodness, but I do.

138
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,639
Thank you, Kot.

139
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,759
Nang,

140
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,039
you're still like a sister to me.

141
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,120
Artit doesn't love me
because of you.

142
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,559
Take care of him well.

143
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,210
If you didn't exist,

144
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,559
Artit would've laid eyes on me.

145
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,399
Since he's chosen you,

146
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,480
I'm strong enough to accept it.

147
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,450
Stop Press!

148
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,559
No need to cheer me up.

149
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,480
I'm much stronger than you think.

150
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,559
Oh, wow.

151
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,120
I think your sister has seen
one too many TV series.

152
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,919
Kot,

153
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,559
- take care of my sister.
- Okay.

154
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,120
Nang!

155
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,720
Artit,

156
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,279
when are you and Paeng...

157
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,039
When is it?

158
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,210
That's true.

159
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,559
Paeng,

160
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,519
you seem sad.

161
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,840
What the matter?

162
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,759
I...

163
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,279
I'm thinking

164
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,440
about Mark being punished
by the law.

165
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,679
I'm scared he might get away.

166
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,559
It hasn't happened yet.

167
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,559
Don't worry about it now.

168
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,039
Use the time you have to be happy.

169
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,440
Do you know

170
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,200
that you're my motivation?

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,080
Really?

172
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,320
Since I was young,

173
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,000
I begged for love from Mom.

174
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,720
Then I lost my parents,

175
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,600
the person who looked after me

176
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,600
and understood me

177
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,720
was you.

178
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,600
From now on,

179
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,720
this place is your home.

180
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,320
Everyone here is your family.

181
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,519
You're not alone anymore.

182
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,159
But I loved you in the wrong way.

183
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,159
And I made mistakes.

184
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,120
Back then,

185
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,960
I didn't understand you.

186
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,519
And I was very mean to you.

187
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,919
We've been through a lot.

188
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,799
I'm happy

189
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,440
that I have you supporting me

190
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,600
and always standing by me

191
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,080
until now.

192
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,919
I'll always be right beside you.

193
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,639
I know you well.

194
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,639
If you give your word,

195
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,279
you always keep it.

196
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,840
Oh, so sweet.

197
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,639
Aueng, you're here.

198
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,399
Miss Paeng,
what do you want me to do?

199
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,919
I have to talk to you.

200
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,720
Of course. Please have a seat.

201
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,240
Aueng,

202
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,600
are you happy living here?

203
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,799
Initially, I thought
I wouldn't like it.

204
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,440
But as time passed,
I became very happy.

205
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,519
I'm surrounded by nature.
I get to see flowers bloom

206
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,000
and plants bear fruit.

207
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,720
I'm happy that you like it here.

208
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,200
Why are you asking me this?

209
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,960
I just wanted to be sure

210
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,679
that you really are happy.

211
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,840
Miss Paeng!

212
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,240
Don't be worried about me.

213
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,000
Aueng,

214
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,559
can I ask you a small favor?

215
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,320
Small?

216
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,519
No need to be considerate.
Ask for more. Go ahead.

217
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,519
While you're here,

218
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,600
can you take care of Artit for me?

219
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,079
Take care?

220
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,440
Where are you going?

221
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,240
Promise me.

222
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,359
Uh...

223
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,079
Okay. I'll look after him.

224
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,319
No problem.

225
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,410
Look after him like you looked
after me, okay?

226
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,319
Of course, Miss Paeng.

227
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,799
Thank you, Aueng.

228
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,759
I love you the most.

229
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,759
Miss Paeng! I love you the most too!

230
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,890
What's up with you?
I'm having a bad feeling about this.

231
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,200
Are you anxious
about going to court?

232
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,200
No, I'm not.

233
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,799
Please don't cry.

234
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,079
I can look after him, no problem.

235
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,279
Promise me, Aueng.

236
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,410
I promise.

237
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,839
Miss Paeng!

238
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,319
Mom, Dad

239
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,279
it's almost the day of Mark's trial.

240
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,200
I will make him atone
for what he's done.

241
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,079
So you can finally rest in peace.

242
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,119
This is the only thing

243
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,799
that I can do for you both.

244
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,650
Please lead and guide me
in all that I do.

245
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,119
Artit.

246
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,559
I'm here to pick you up.

247
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,359
It's okay. I can go there myself.

248
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,759
I'm not going to let you do
what you want today.

249
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,359
You have to let me come with you.

250
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,410
Because your business

251
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,170
is my business.

252
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,039
Are you scared?

253
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,319
I'm not sure
if I'll be able to get him.

254
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,960
Mom's case was a while ago.

255
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,170
Even if you're not sure,
you have to try.

256
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,720
We'll fight together.

257
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,240
Oh?

258
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,410
Oh?

259
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,170
Do you have a meeting somewhere?

260
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,319
I'm not going to a meeting.

261
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,359
I'm going to court

262
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,440
for Paeng's case.

263
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,960
I have to go now.

264
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,960
Uh... Krongprateep?

265
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,519
Wait.

266
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,279
Paeng.

267
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,640
Non, Ling, Kot!

268
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,079
It's not just Artit
who's accompanying you.

269
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,920
We're also here to support you.

270
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,559
Come on, Paeng. Let's go crush Mark!

271
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,519
Hey!

272
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,799
You're crying.

273
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,720
Why are you crying?

274
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,440
The only person who's going to cry
today is that jerk, Mark.

275
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,440
Don't be afraid.
You've got so much support.

276
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,039
Thank you so much, everyone.

277
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

278
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,960
Please follow me, Miss Wanfahmai.

279
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,079
We have to get ready.

280
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,359
Can Artit join us?

281
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,400
Certainly.

282
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,200
No need to be nervous, Paeng.

283
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,559
Don't worry.
Good will always triumph over evil.

284
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,079
I need to pee. I'm so excited.

285
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,279
- I'll be right back.
- Mmm.

286
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,200
Please.

287
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,279
I'll be right back.

288
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,799
The other party has a lawyer who's
very skilled in cases like these.

289
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,039
He'll frame the question
in a way to humiliate you.

290
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,119
You have to control yourself
and don't be nervous.

291
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,759
If you are nervous,

292
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,160
he'll pressure you
into playing his game.

293
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,039
Okay. I understand.

294
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,400
Paeng,

295
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,920
we didn't do anything wrong.

296
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,480
Just tell the truth.

297
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,519
Mark should be the one
who's scared, not you.

298
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,160
Thank you very much

299
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,119
for being my witnesses.

300
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,440
You're welcome. It's our duty.

301
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,440
Even though it's your duty,
we'd like to thank you anyway.

302
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,079
Please go and wait
in the witness room.

303
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,440
I'll call you once the trial starts.

304
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,039
Okay.

305
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,599
Don't worry, Mr. Mark.

306
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,920
You'll be able to go home
in less than an hour.

307
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,920
Are you sure?

308
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,440
I'm more than sure.

309
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,960
Because she came to
see you in your room.

310
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,839
It's also visible
in the CCTV footage.

311
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,599
You're not at fault here.

312
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,759
Paeng!

313
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,279
Did you bring a guard dog today?

314
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,839
You brought so many people.

315
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,920
You must be very scared of me.

316
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,200
I was never scared of you.

317
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,960
Because I didn't do anything wrong.

318
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,839
Artit also isn't a dog.

319
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,640
You're the one who's the dog.

320
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:57,319
Because you like to bite people
behind their backs.

321
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,759
Today,

322
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
I'll try not to be angry with you.

323
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,839
But I'm furious

324
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:17,240
and I hate you. You scumbag!

325
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,759
Paeng, calm down.

326
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,359
Don't feed the howling dog, Paeng.

327
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,640
I can sue you all, do you know that?

328
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,720
Go ahead. We're not afraid.

329
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,160
You're all insane.

330
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,559
That's why you get along so well.

331
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,920
Oh, are you asking for it?

332
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,640
I think

333
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,519
you should return to where you were.

334
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,160
Are you scared of me?

335
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,480
Do you want it? Let's rumble.

336
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,960
Stay away from them, Mr. Mark.

337
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,119
It might affect the case
if you do something.

338
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,920
I would've kicked him

339
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,799
if we weren't at court.

340
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,839
Don't waste your time

341
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,400
with someone who doesn't have
a conscience. Scumbag!

342
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,920
What are you smiling, Non?

343
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,240
The way you cursed him was on point.

344
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,759
He's such a scumbag.

345
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,680
Let's go, Paeng.

346
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:52,640
(Courtroom 403)

347
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,400
Paeng.

348
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,559
Let's go.

349
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,519
Hello.

350
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,160
All rise for the judge.

351
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,759
On Monday, 16 March,

352
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,480
at around 10:00 a.m.,

353
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,440
you went to the defendant's condo,

354
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,559
which is Mr. Mark. Is that right?

355
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,000
That's right.

356
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,599
Can you state what happened
once you've got there?

357
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,680
I will.

358
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,440
When I arrived at the condo,

359
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,799
I told Mr. Mark
that I'd like to wait in his room.

360
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,240
So he told the staff to let me in.

361
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,960
What's your intention for going in?

362
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,079
I went there to find evidence.

363
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,799
Did you find anything?

364
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,079
I did.

365
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,519
I found a picture of Mark

366
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,640
with a tattoo

367
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,480
on the left of his back

368
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,000
and I found...

369
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:41,839
Your Honor,

370
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,640
I object.

371
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,200
The prosecutor's question

372
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,119
is not related to today's case.

373
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,559
Your Honor,

374
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,240
I'd like you to listen to
what the witness says.

375
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,240
Because it's the reason
why she went there.

376
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,200
Proceed.

377
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,400
So that I can prove

378
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,799
that this man

379
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,839
was...

380
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,720
my mother's lover.

381
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,839
I object!

382
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,920
Miss Wanfahmai
is accusing my client.

383
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,799
And her statement is not
related to the case.

384
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,400
Please be careful with your answer.

385
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,759
Did you know about this?

386
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:56,880
I know

387
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,599
that Pimnapa

388
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,359
was cheating on Tharathep.

389
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,920
But I didn't know that it's him.

390
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,880
Please state
what happened afterward.

391
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,559
Once I found the evidence,

392
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,240
Mr. Mark came in.

393
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,359
He ordered room service

394
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,599
and invited me to eat with him.

395
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,079
He also put something

396
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,759
into my drink.

397
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,279
He tried to coax me
into drinking it.

398
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,079
When I refused,

399
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,960
he drank it himself.

400
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,359
So I asked him

401
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,160
if he murdered my mother.

402
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,200
And he admitted everything.

403
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,839
I object!

404
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,799
You're accusing my client again!

405
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,240
I have evidence.

406
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,119
Your Honor,

407
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,519
I'd like to play an audio recording
which serves as physical evidence.

408
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,119
Are you sure that the recording
isn't incriminating?

409
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,480
You're going to make me talk

410
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,559
and then hand over the recording
to the police.

411
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,680
Even if it's been recovered,

412
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,359
I didn't say anything

413
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,799
because I didn't do anything wrong.

414
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,519
Would you like something to drink?

415
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:00,839
No.

416
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,680
How come?

417
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,720
What?

418
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,359
Why do you seem so stressed?

419
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,880
I ordered room service

420
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,680
because I was hoping
that we could relax, eat, and chat.

421
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,680
They're all your favorites.

422
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,519
I'm not hungry.

423
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,240
Ask me

424
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,880
what you want to know.

425
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,200
That tattoo.

426
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,640
You know about it now?

427
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:41,920
What did you put in there?

428
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,119
Calm down.

429
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:49,480
Do you know that
you're too stressed?

430
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,079
You'll feel better if you take
something for your nerves.

431
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,160
Drink it. You'll feel relaxed.

432
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,680
I won't.

433
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,519
But I want you to.

434
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,400
I'm not going to drink it.

435
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,720
Why are you so stubborn?

436
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,039
You're just as stubborn as your mom.

437
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,960
You said you didn't know her mother.

438
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,239
You have to order them
to turn it off.

439
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,239
You're starting to
get scared, aren't you?

440
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,400
Do you really want to know?

441
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,000
That's right.

442
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,769
I'm the one who killed your mom.

443
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,639
I killed Pimnapa.

444
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,159
Your Honor,

445
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,519
secretly recording a video

446
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:54,920
or audio during a conversation

447
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,719
without the other party's consent,

448
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,440
it is considered
unlawfully obtained evidence

449
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,159
according to Section 226 of the
Criminal Procedure Code.

450
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:05,480
An exception can be made

451
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,880
if the admissibility of the evidence

452
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,360
has more advantages towards the
procedure than disadvantages

453
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,679
towards the standards
of the criminal code

454
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:17,960
or basic rights and freedoms
of the people.

455
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:22,239
Didn't you follow the news
about the 30 million baht lottery?

456
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,639
I'd like to continue to
play the recording.

457
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,000
Proceed.

458
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,559
But I didn't plan to.

459
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,079
But do you know why?

460
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,559
Because she broke up with me.

461
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,159
She told me

462
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,960
she felt guilty about
her husband and daughter.

463
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,960
But she never felt any guilt
towards me.

464
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:55,920
Even though I was faithful

465
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,159
and was so nice to her.

466
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,840
But she didn't love me
like I loved her.

467
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,769
She didn't want me
like I wanted her.

468
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:09,289
She was going to leave me,

469
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:11,079
so I...

470
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,809
Enough!

471
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:17,360
You wanted to know how I killed her,

472
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,809
so I'm explaining it in detail so
that you'll be able to imagine it.

473
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,599
You killed her

474
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,559
just because she was leaving you.

475
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,329
Just because she's leaving?

476
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,920
Do you know

477
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,480
how does it feel to be abandoned?

478
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:36,559
It hurts more than death.

479
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,079
I've been abandoned too many times.

480
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,880
It will never happen again.

481
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:43,519
It won't happen to me ever again.

482
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,719
You have to tell me.

483
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,559
that you won't leave me.

484
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,239
Why does it have to be me?

485
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,679
Because

486
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,840
you're Pimnapa's daughter.

487
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:59,400
You live a similar life.

488
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:01,199
You're an orphan like me.

489
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:04,769
So I'm the one
who understands you the most.

490
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:07,679
I want to take care of you
and protect you.

491
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,769
I don't need a psycho
like you taking care of me.

492
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,079
I guess you want to know
how I got the recording.

493
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,719
Artit!

494
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,079
Artit!

495
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,000
Please help me!

496
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:22,769
I object!

497
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,400
You're accusing the defendant,

498
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,559
defaming him,
and causing misunderstanding.

499
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,679
Your Honor,

500
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,519
I'd like you to exclude
the recording and statement.

501
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:38,440
I'm sure that he's the one
who murdered my mother.

502
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:40,880
He's a murderer.

503
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:44,079
Please control yourself
and respect the court.

504
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,960
I am speaking the truth.

505
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,960
I wasn't lying.

506
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,039
He's a murderer.

507
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,960
You're accusing me.

508
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,360
You faked the recording.

509
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,480
I didn't know your mom.

510
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,360
I didn't kill her.

511
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,039
- You killed my mom!
- I didn't.

512
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:10,199
Stop. Or I'll hold you in contempt.

513
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,039
Your Honor,

514
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:26,199
I'd like to request a short recess.

515
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,880
So my client can calm himself down.

516
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,769
Then we can continue.

517
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,039
Recess has been granted.

518
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,960
Paeng! Paeng!

519
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,440
Are you okay?

520
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:52,000
No, I'm not okay at all.

521
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,289
I'm scared he might get away.

522
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,480
If he gets away this time,

523
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,920
we won't be able to get him anymore.

524
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:06,360
Paeng,

525
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,920
I believe in one thing.

526
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,519
No one can escape karma.

527
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,119
No matter what happens today,

528
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,639
that man has to atone
for what he did.

529
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,679
But I want it to be today.

530
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,639
Is that recording genuine?

531
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,599
If you did,

532
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,289
if you really did kill her mother,

533
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,769
you have to tell me.

534
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,599
I didn't kill anyone.

535
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,809
They couldn't get to me.

536
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,519
So they tried to frame me.

537
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,920
Besides,

538
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:53,239
I don't know who her mother is.

539
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,079
That recording

540
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,769
was fabricated.

541
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,239
Are you telling me the truth?

542
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,329
I am.

543
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:29,199
This is the test result
from the beverage

544
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:31,960
that the defendant tried to coax
the plaintiff into drinking.

545
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:36,840
The results indicate
that there is GSB,

546
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,360
more commonly know as

547
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,079
the date rape drug or

548
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,119
or a rohypnol.

549
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,039
According to all the evidence,

550
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,639
it can be confirmed

551
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,199
that the defendant

552
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,119
deliberately tried to drug

553
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:54,639
and rape Miss Wanfahmai.

554
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:57,159
As for the weapon she brought over

555
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:58,920
that was used to harm the defendant,

556
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,119
it was only in self-defense.

557
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,440
He won't be able to get away

558
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:12,840
with evidence this tight.

559
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,199
He's worse than I thought.

560
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,119
Miss Wanfahmai,

561
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,840
did you go to Mr. Mark's condo
without an appointment

562
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,079
and on your own accord?

563
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,199
I have stated that I went there

564
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:37,000
because I wanted to find evidence.

565
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,840
I'm only asking
whether you went there or not.

566
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,239
That's all.

567
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:50,079
So you

568
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:52,719
went to Mr. Mark's condo
on your own,

569
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,679
without any coercion,

570
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:56,599
is that correct?

571
00:42:58,679 --> 00:42:59,769
That's correct.

572
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,400
You intentionally brought a weapon

573
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,599
and used this knife to harm
the defendant,

574
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,079
is that correct?

575
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:11,079
I brought it for self-defense.

576
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,480
Yes, or no.

577
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,400
I'm going to repeat
my question again.

578
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,769
You arranged for a meeting
with the defendant

579
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,079
and you used this knife to hurt him,

580
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,880
is that correct?

581
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:31,840
Miss Wanfahamai,

582
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:33,519
please answer the question.

583
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:39,360
Please answer the question.

584
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,039
That's correct.

585
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:51,199
The recording
that you used as evidence,

586
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:53,559
did you fabricate it?

587
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:56,679
I did not. That recording
is genuine.

588
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,920
Deception in court is punishable
by a jail sentence.

589
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:03,840
I'm warning you.

590
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,119
I object.

591
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,880
The lawyer is threatening
the plaintiff.

592
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,199
Please be careful with your words.

593
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:18,880
I have a test result

594
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,079
which indicates that
the defendant was drugged

595
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:24,280
by Miss Wanfahmai,
who brought over the drugs.

596
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,480
The defendant was
coaxed into drinking.

597
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:44,960
There is no reason for
the defendant to drug himself.

598
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,199
Her evidence was fabricated.

599
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,880
No further questions.

600
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:57,960
Why was he beating around the bush?

601
00:44:58,159 --> 00:44:59,480
The evidence is tight.

602
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:22,079
Would you like to cross-examine
the witness?

603
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,400
(Courtroom)

604
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:28,239
- Sergeant Chakrapong?
- Yes, sir.

605
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,960
Please come to the courtroom.

606
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,320
Are you alright, Tubtim?

607
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,039
I'm okay.

608
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:59,599
It's time for Mark's
testimony now, right?

609
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:01,760
Mmm.

610
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,679
Please state the history
between you and Miss Wanfahmai.

611
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,119
Paeng and I

612
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:31,119
met just recently.

613
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:36,360
I was interested in her.

614
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,360
Apart from my interest,

615
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,039
I empathized with her

616
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,760
since she's also an orphan like me.

617
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,440
So I told her

618
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:47,519
that I'm also an orphan.

619
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,320
This might be the reason
why she's so fixated on me.

620
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:57,119
It became too much.

621
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:58,679
To the point, I felt uncomfortable.

622
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:02,559
She forced me to give her lifts.

623
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:06,599
That day, she wanted to
come over so she did so.

624
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,320
She forced me to return even though
I had business elsewhere.

625
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:12,599
You're lying!

626
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,360
Please be silent

627
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,440
until you're permitted to speak.

628
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,039
Please continue

629
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:23,880
as to why you allowed her
to wait in your room.

630
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:27,639
It was what she wanted.

631
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,559
And I had to comply.

632
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,440
Just like I had always done.

633
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,280
The more I got to know her,

634
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:40,320
the more I felt

635
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,320
that she was mentally unstable.

636
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:45,559
Your Honor,

637
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,880
I object!

638
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,400
Please don't make accusations
without evidence.

639
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:53,039
It's the defendant's
feelings towards her.

640
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,440
I'd like you to listen
until the end.

641
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,800
I'd like to continue
with the questioning.

642
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,400
As for the food and beverage,

643
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,039
you were the one who ordered them.

644
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:06,480
I did.

645
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,360
Because I thought it would be better

646
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,519
if we talked

647
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,039
once she had calmed down.

648
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:18,239
So I thought the food might help.

649
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,079
The beverage didn't contain alcohol.

650
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,119
It was just orange juice.

651
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,320
What happened afterward?

652
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:30,400
After that,

653
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,199
I intended to clear things up and

654
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,719
let her know that I didn't want this
relationship.

655
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,519
I intended to explain to her

656
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:42,480
that it was impossible between us.

657
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,599
And I asked to

658
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,199
end our relationship.

659
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,840
Why didn't you talk in the lobby?

660
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:54,599
I was afraid she might have
thrown a tantrum.

661
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,480
I was embarrassed.

662
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,920
You wished to end the
relationship with Miss Wanfahmai?

663
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,880
I was never
in a relationship with you!

664
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,920
Please calm down.

665
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,400
He's such a liar.

666
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:24,519
Who's going to believe him?

667
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,679
Be quiet for now.

668
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:34,760
Your Honor,

669
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:37,559
I tried to end things with her

670
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:39,519
as politely as I could.

671
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,800
Can you confirm that the drug
in the beverage wasn't yours?

672
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,679
It wasn't mine.

673
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,960
The knife she used to harm me

674
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,719
wasn't mine either.

675
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:54,559
Why did she harm you?

676
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,320
We couldn't talk it out.

677
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,599
And she wouldn't break up with me

678
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,599
so she attacked me with the knife.

679
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,239
After she drugged me,

680
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,159
she tried to have sex with me.

681
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,519
I tried to escape
but she threw a fit

682
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:17,480
and used the knife to harm me.

683
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:26,840
What about
the plaintiff's recording?

684
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:28,920
That recording also wasn't mine.

685
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,920
What about her accusation

686
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,440
that you killed her mother?

687
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,960
I didn't do it.

688
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:41,280
I don't know her mother.

689
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,320
I deny all accusations.

690
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,239
No further questions.

691
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:29,880
He's coming.

692
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:37,280
It's not easy to get to me.

693
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,440
Excuse me.

694
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,400
What are you doing?

695
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,400
Why are you here?

696
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:52,960
What right do you have to arrest
my client in the court?

697
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:55,039
The police have a court warrant.

698
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,800
And it has been issued.

699
00:51:58,039 --> 00:51:59,119
Why are you arresting me?

700
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,239
For the murder case
from eight years ago.

701
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,960
That's right.
For the murder of Ms. Pimnapa.

702
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,039
I didn't do it.

703
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:17,719
But we have a witness
who can testify against you.

704
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:20,639
It's Miss Wanfahmai.

705
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,320
What evidence do you have?

706
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:28,639
Did you think I went into your room

707
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,880
for a stroll?

708
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,519
The picture of your tattoo,

709
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:37,480
the picture of my mom,

710
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,800
and your hair,

711
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,519
I got them all.

712
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:07,320
The DNA on Pimnapa's fingernails
belonged to her husband.

713
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,639
But the DNA from your hair
that Miss Wanfahmai gave us

714
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,000
matches the hair
that forensics found

715
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,559
next to Pimnapa's body
eight years ago.

716
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,679
I've also taken the picture

717
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,400
of the woman who raised you.

718
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,079
Why did you take it?

719
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,159
You must really hate her, don't you?

720
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:54,880
Did you hate her so much
that you killed her?

721
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,440
The police have looked
into this as well.

722
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,360
You're not going to get away, Mark.

723
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,760
You're as vile as your mother.

724
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:21,719
Please.

725
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:13,360
It's all over, Paeng.

726
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,559
Paeng! Paeng!

727
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:29,280
Paeng! Whoa!

728
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,079
Paeng, it was so awesome!

729
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:35,880
You're were like a real detective.
You were so many steps ahead of him.

730
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,559
Because she's smart, Kot.

731
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,039
Oh, now I'm at a loss.

732
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,440
Hey,

733
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,519
he didn't show any guilt
or remorse at all.

734
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,440
There's probably
no humanity left in him.

735
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,880
Now it's all over.

736
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:57,000
Let's leave it to the police
from now on.

737
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:01,119
He said it himself,

738
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:04,519
it can be used against him.
He won't get away.

739
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,800
Okay. I hope
the punishment will fit the crime.

740
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,039
Paeng,

741
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,320
I'm happy for you.

742
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,960
I'm happy for you too.

743
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,599
You've been trying hard for so long.

744
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,159
Now I feel

745
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,119
like a huge weight has been
lifted off my chest.

746
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,079
I'm relieved that
everything ended well.

747
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,000
Alright.

748
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,239
I have to thank you all
for coming to support her.

749
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,519
There's no need to thank us.

750
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,840
Paeng is like our sister.

751
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,480
Everyone's had a long day.
Let's get some rest.

752
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:55,280
Especially you.

753
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:57,360
Tomorrow

754
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,400
I'll let you take the day off.

755
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,840
It's okay, Uncle.

756
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:05,639
I need to clear the backlog.
It will take a few days.

757
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,280
Once I've finished,

758
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:11,519
everything will be complete.

759
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,280
Why are you saying that?

760
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:19,360
Why are you in such a hurry?

761
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:56,679
I'd like to ask you
about what you said.

762
00:57:58,159 --> 00:57:59,679
What does it mean?

763
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:06,480
I want to fulfill the promise.

764
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,679
What promise?

765
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:14,440
The promise that we agreed upon.

766
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:19,000
Letting me train here for two years.

767
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:23,119
I actually thought

768
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,159
that you would want to stay here.

769
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,199
Aren't you happy?

770
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,360
I am very happy.

771
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:48,440
But I'd like to

772
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,239
start doing new things by myself.

773
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:57,719
Once I've finished up my work,

774
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:01,679
I'd like to get out of here.

775
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:51,199
Thank you

776
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:54,960
for intending to fulfill the promise
that you made to me.

777
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:01,159
I won't break my word to you.

778
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,960
I know that Artit will be sad.

779
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,159
But you're doing the right thing.

780
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,880
Because if we keep
prolonging things,

781
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:15,559
the more pain it will cause you.

782
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,000
I'm worried about both of you.

783
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,679
Doing this

784
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:30,119
is the same as hurting you.

785
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,239
I'm sorry.

786
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:36,480
Please don't say that.

787
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,000
I told you I understand.

788
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,039
If there wasn't
the issue with Artit,

789
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:46,840
I'd like you to stay forever.

790
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,360
Thank you very much

791
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:53,960
for showing me mercy.

792
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,039
Time will heal everything.

793
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,840
I will always support you.

794
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,559
I hope you have a bright
and happy future.

795
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,679
Thank you very much.

796
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,440
Dad,

797
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,039
is Paeng gone?

798
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:06,840
You haven't gone to sleep yet?

799
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,559
I was waiting to talk to you.

800
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:11,400
Please talk to me.

801
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,639
Let's save it for later. I'm sleepy.

802
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,480
Tubtim,

803
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:20,519
I don't want it to be too late.

804
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,599
What did you talk to Paeng about
that day?

805
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,360
What day?

806
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,119
The day we went to the temple.

807
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,840
Well,

808
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:40,880
I apologized to Paeng
for treating her badly.

809
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:43,320
What else?

810
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,519
That's all.

811
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:50,320
We've been together for 30 years.

812
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,920
Do you think I can't
see you through?

813
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,440
What?

814
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,239
You're not going to
accept her, are you?

815
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,079
I have my reasons.

816
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:08,639
I'm sorry

817
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:10,599
but I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

818
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,159
I called you here

819
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,679
because I wanted to talk to you.

820
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,760
I wanted to talk to you too.

821
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,559
Did I do something wrong?

822
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:13,920
Why didn't I know

823
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,239
that you were leaving?

824
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,719
I was so busy with the case.

825
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,599
So I didn't get
the chance to tell you.

826
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,920
Maybe I'm not important to you.

827
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,519
That's not true.

828
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,400
But that's how I feel right now.

829
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,519
Why do you have to go?

830
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,880
I don't want you to go.

831
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:21,159
But I've made my decision.

832
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:50,039
Don't go, Paeng.

833
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,360
It doesn't matter what
your reasons are...

834
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:06,199
apart from you not loving me.

835
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,039
You're angry.

836
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,880
I'm not.

837
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,920
I just don't understand.

838
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,000
But I'm not gone for good.

839
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:42,880
We still have a chance to meet.

840
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,960
I must've assumed that you love me.

841
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,559
If you insist on going,

842
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,479
then I have to accept it.

843
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,239
Don't go, Paeng.

844
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,199
It doesn't matter what
your reasons are.

845
01:09:31,649 --> 01:09:32,960
Can you promise me

846
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,880
that there's not going to be
anything between you and Artit,

847
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:39,079
other than being siblings?

848
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:41,609
I know you well.

849
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,199
If you give your word,

850
01:09:43,649 --> 01:09:45,159
you always keep it.

851
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:48,399
If it makes you happy,

852
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:51,479
then I promise.

853
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,840
Thank you very much
for understanding me.

854
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,119
But I'm asking you

855
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,800
to keep this between us.

856
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:00,880
Don't let Artit know.

857
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,479
What are you looking for?

858
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:40,649
I'm looking for Artit.

859
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,439
Why are you looking for him?

860
01:10:48,529 --> 01:10:49,609
Tubtim?

861
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,199
Alright. I'm worried about him.

862
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,479
He's not a kid anymore.

863
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:02,920
You've got a point.

864
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,880
He should be alright.

865
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,529
I meant that he's grown up now.

866
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:15,960
He should be able

867
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,239
to live his own life.

868
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,720
He should be able to choose
his own path

869
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:23,079
and learn his own lessons

870
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:26,119
whether they're happy or sad.

871
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:29,000
But I don't want it to happen.

872
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,199
Are you admitting it now?

873
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:35,920
That the reason Paeng's leaving
is because of you.

874
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,079
I'll admit it.

875
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:39,079
I don't want history
to repeat itself.

876
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,569
I'm afraid that Paeng
will become like her mother.

877
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,039
All this time has passed.

878
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,159
Hasn't Paeng proven herself enough?

879
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:54,439
I'm not angry with her anymore.

880
01:11:54,529 --> 01:11:55,840
But you're still scared

881
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,479
and have doubts about her.

882
01:11:59,529 --> 01:12:01,880
That's right. I admit it.

883
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:04,720
Artit is hot-tempered.

884
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,760
Paeng is also headstrong.

885
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:11,319
I can't see how these two
could make it work.

886
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:14,359
Am I wrong for worrying
about my son?

887
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,840
There are a lot of diseases that can
affect the roses.

888
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:31,079
It's even more difficult
to take care of them

889
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:32,439
when we don't use chemicals.

890
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,840
We have to check on them frequently
so we can catch it in time.

891
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:37,649
Yes, Miss Paeng.

892
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,840
Trimming is also important.

893
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:42,960
You need to let them rest

894
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:44,609
especially with the ones
that have just blossomed.

895
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,680
If small buds like these appear,

896
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,609
you have to trim them off.

897
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,920
Wait until they get stronger
and until a new bud starts blooming.

898
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,960
Right! Just like pigs!

899
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,880
Pigs?

900
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:07,680
How?

901
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:10,680
When a mother pig
gives birth too often,

902
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,279
she'll feel unwell.

903
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:14,720
You don't know
anything at all, Saeb.

904
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:16,529
Oh, really?

905
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,760
That's true.

906
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:22,680
Animals and plants are similar.

907
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,319
But I think

908
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,720
you're like the mother of the roses.

909
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,960
They'll be very lonely if you leave.

910
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:37,760
That's why I'm letting you all
take care of them.

911
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:43,279
If they die, what are
you going to do?

912
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,319
That's right. Aren't you
going to miss them?

913
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,569
Please don't go.

914
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:52,569
Of course, I'll miss them.

915
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:55,880
I'll miss everything

916
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,720
and everyone here.

917
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:03,159
Because this is
my first rose garden.

918
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:05,569
It's very precious to me.

919
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:09,649
It brought me
both trouble and happiness.

920
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:12,279
I'll never forget it.

921
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:20,399
And I know

922
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,960
that all of you

923
01:14:23,479 --> 01:14:25,239
will take good care of it for me.

924
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:29,920
Promise me.

925
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,279
- Okay.
- Okay.

926
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,680
You're heartbroken because of Paeng?

927
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:50,399
Pipe it down, Nang?

928
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:53,760
You blindly fell in love with her.

929
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,649
Now she's dumping you?

930
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,279
Oh, I'm so angry.

931
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,319
What are you laughing about?

932
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,319
I wasn't telling a funny story.

933
01:15:04,039 --> 01:15:06,529
I don't think the heartbreak
will kill him.

934
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:10,649
That's true. I didn't die
when Artit broke my heart.

935
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,720
I didn't die but it hurt.

936
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,479
How are we going to help him?

937
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:22,649
When is Paeng leaving?

938
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:26,159
Are you still thinking of
going back to Artit?

939
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,529
Come on, Non.
Someone like me? No way.

940
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:32,840
Okay? That's settled.

941
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,359
So? When is she leaving?

942
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:37,239
Probably in two days.

943
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:43,720
Simple. Just tell Artit
to make her his.

944
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,039
That's all. Can't you even come up
with a simple idea like that?

945
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,529
Just do what Paeng did
when she was young.

946
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:00,159
Hey, Artit's here.

947
01:16:01,529 --> 01:16:02,609
Watch your mouth.

948
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,569
I don't know why I used to like you.

949
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:15,239
You're so not the manly Artit
that I thought you were.

950
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,800
Honestly,

951
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,920
you're such a wuss.

952
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:20,569
So annoying!

953
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,760
Did your sister just insult me?

954
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,000
That's right.

955
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,039
Hey, Artit.

956
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:36,000
Let's do it this way. Why don't
you what Nang said?

957
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:37,800
If she won't accept your love,

958
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:39,960
then just make her yours.

959
01:16:40,279 --> 01:16:41,840
Kot, you jerk.

960
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,800
He'll end up in jail.

961
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:46,279
Hold on. What are you talking about?

962
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,960
Nothing. Nonsense.

963
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:51,569
Are you okay?

964
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:54,119
What do you think?

965
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,649
Oh? It's all gone, Miss Paeng.

966
01:17:05,649 --> 01:17:06,720
Let's go.

967
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,279
Hey, are you trying to pick a fight
by standing in our way?

968
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:18,239
Aueng.

969
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,079
Miss Paeng!

970
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:23,279
She beelined straight to you.
She must be looking for a fight.

971
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,039
Stay back. I'll deal with her.

972
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:30,439
I'm sorry.

973
01:17:35,529 --> 01:17:38,359
I told her to come
and apologize to you.

974
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,439
Well? Why are you standing there?

975
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,079
Just say what you want to.

976
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:47,920
Just a second, Thongkhum.

977
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,920
It's not as easy as hurling insults.

978
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:53,039
If you're quick to insult,

979
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:57,239
then you have to
be quick to apologize too.

980
01:18:00,279 --> 01:18:01,359
Alright.

981
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,800
When I saw you looking
after Thongkhum,

982
01:18:05,239 --> 01:18:07,479
even though we were just
unimportant workers,

983
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,039
you still cared.

984
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:12,569
And you didn't mind
that I was mean to you.

985
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,359
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you

986
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,760
and

987
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:20,920
for framing and bullying you.

988
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,199
Please forgive me.

989
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:25,239
It's okay.

990
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,609
I stopped being angry with you
a long time ago.

991
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,079
But you really get on my nerves.

992
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,159
- Aueng.
- Let me have my moment.

993
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,159
I'd like to apologize to you too.

994
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:49,840
Alright. I haven't been angry
with you for ages.

995
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:51,279
Really?

996
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,039
Really.

997
01:18:54,319 --> 01:18:55,399
Wow!

998
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,880
Your face was so serious.

999
01:18:58,279 --> 01:18:59,609
Just a little bit.

1000
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,840
I heard that you're leaving.

1001
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,609
I have a lot of things to do.

1002
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:13,529
And I know why.

1003
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,680
Please don't call me nosy.

1004
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:21,279
You have to stand for who you are.

1005
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,279
You're a good

1006
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,239
and lovely person.

1007
01:19:26,359 --> 01:19:28,960
Believe me. One day,

1008
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:32,079
you'll be able to prove yourself.

1009
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,800
Miss Paeng,

1010
01:19:42,359 --> 01:19:45,159
you're the best suited
for Mr. Artit.

1011
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:22,319
Artit?

1012
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:24,359
Since when did you arrive?

1013
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,800
For a while now.

1014
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:34,479
I'm sorry, Paeng.

1015
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,439
I was acting silly yesterday.
Don't be angry with me.

1016
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:39,479
I understand.

1017
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,279
You weren't acting
silly or anything.

1018
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,000
Do you want to go for a drive?

1019
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:07,569
Come on, Paeng.

1020
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,880
Don't be afraid.

1021
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:45,880
I won't drop off you somewhere.

1022
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:11,279
Hold on tight.

1023
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,569
Please don't pull a prank on me.

1024
01:22:18,609 --> 01:22:20,119
I stopped pranking you
a long time ago.

1025
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:18,720
Wow, just like that.

1026
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,880
Yum!

1027
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,319
Who made the dipping sauce?

1028
01:23:21,649 --> 01:23:23,720
- What should I eat first?
- The chicken looks tasty, Pong.

1029
01:23:29,479 --> 01:23:31,359
That's Mr. Artit and Miss Paeng.

1030
01:23:32,119 --> 01:23:35,279
Mr. Artit! Pull over!

1031
01:23:36,609 --> 01:23:37,680
Yes, Pong?

1032
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,319
Come and eat with us.

1033
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,239
Do you want to join them?

1034
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,119
Miss Paeng,
have some papaya salad.

1035
01:23:46,529 --> 01:23:48,880
That's right. Join us.

1036
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:54,079
Are you going to keep
the sticky rice for yourself?

1037
01:23:54,199 --> 01:23:55,840
Come on, Pong.

1038
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,760
Miss Paeng, eat up.

1039
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,399
Come on. Take a big bite.

1040
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:05,239
Let's consider this
Paeng's farewell party.

1041
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:10,840
Hey,

1042
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:13,319
nobody's going to call you a mute
if you don't speak.

1043
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:15,960
I shouldn't have said that,
should I?

1044
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:17,880
Do you even have to ask?

1045
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,529
I'll kick you down the hill!

1046
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:22,119
Give that to me.

1047
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:26,119
Eat up. Take a big bite.

1048
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,079
Paeng, sticky rice.

1049
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,199
The catfish is so good.

1050
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:35,760
Dig in, Artit.

1051
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:39,399
Here.

1052
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:41,199
Mmm, so good!

1053
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:43,720
The eggs have the perfect amount of
seasoning.

1054
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,609
This one. Chicken in Isaan dialect?

1055
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,239
What is it?

1056
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:49,479
Chick'un!

1057
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,039
Do you remember

1058
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:21,800
when you came back,

1059
01:25:25,479 --> 01:25:27,199
this is where we met
for the first time?

1060
01:25:35,279 --> 01:25:36,569
I do.

1061
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,359
You pranked me.

1062
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,319
You lied about being handicapped.

1063
01:25:57,279 --> 01:25:58,920
I didn't know how to send you away,

1064
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:02,399
so I decided to do that.

1065
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:18,479
But now,

1066
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:25,119
I don't know what to do

1067
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:29,479
to convince you to stay either.

1068
01:26:47,079 --> 01:26:48,239
Can you tell me

1069
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:52,609
what I should do?

1070
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,880
Artit!

1071
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,399
Paeng, you broke your promise!

1072
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,479
Don't feign sympathies.

1073
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,359
No matter how my life turns out,

1074
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,279
it's none of your business.

1075
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:03,520
Ever since Miss Paeng left,

1076
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,439
Mr. Artit has become a workaholic.

1077
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,159
He works from before
sunrise until sunset.

1078
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:09,760
Who misses me?

1079
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,680
Artit!

1080
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,199
Who allowed an outsider
into the farm?

1081
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:14,640
I'm going to deduct your salaries.

1082
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,840
When are you going
to stop being angry with me?

1083
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,039
This is your punishment.

1084
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,279
I can't love anyone anymore.

1085
01:28:22,439 --> 01:28:24,560
I can only love you.

1086
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,840
Please, marry me.
