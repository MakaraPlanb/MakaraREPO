1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,419
- Come with me.
- Paeng, come here.

3
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,250
Should we split me into two parts
so you can have each half?

4
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,710
Even when I'm this close to you,
I still don't feel anything.

5
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,960
I'm still waiting for your answer

6
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,500
Whether you want to be with me,
or not.

7
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,669
Paeng's with a guy.

8
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,590
They look really close.

9
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:54,879
It's like they agreed to meet.

10
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,250
Why do you have
to keep harassing me?

11
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,300
You're always harassing me

12
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,840
You hate me!

13
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,710
I hate you too!

14
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
But Miss Paeng wished inwardly.

15
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,210
And she said something about

16
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,710
"who killed you?"

17
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,629
"Who killed you?"

18
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,840
Did Paeng's parents
really die in a car crash?

19
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,800
Saeb.

20
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,500
- Yes, sir?
- Come here.

21
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,050
Have you seen her?

22
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,050
Who?

23
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,210
Oh! Miss Paeng?

24
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:41,250
I don't know where she is.

25
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,879
Isn't she around here?

26
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,340
I don't think so. You would've
seen here if she was.

27
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,000
Miss Paeng!

28
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,840
Oh?

29
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,750
Have you two seen Miss Paeng?

30
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,879
She's not home?

31
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:59,460
She isn't. I didn't see her
when I woke up.

32
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,840
I couldn't reach her
on the phone either.

33
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,840
I don't know where she went.

34
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,050
Aod! Kaew!

35
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,710
Have you seen Paeng?

36
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,960
Uhh...

37
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,170
- We haven't!
- We haven't!

38
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,750
Cut all the overgrown grass.

39
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,339
- There are a lot of snakes.
- Pong,

40
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,000
- have you seen Paeng.
- I haven't, sir.

41
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,089
What's up with him?
Why is he so agitated?

42
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,420
Get to work. Why are you
staring at my face?

43
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,670
No, she didn't come here.

44
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,170
Are you sure?

45
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,589
Of course.

46
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,879
I've been here the whole day.
I would've seen her coming in.

47
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,920
Why are you looking for her?

48
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,129
What are you going
to do to her again?

49
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:09,420
I'm not.

50
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,920
If there's nothing,
why are you looking for her?

51
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,920
There has to be something.

52
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:18,089
Artit, stop bullying her.

53
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,550
I think it's enough.

54
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:22,959
Whatever. So no one saw her?

55
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,209
No.

56
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,170
- I'm going.
- Where Are You Going?

57
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,050
Why are you looking for her?

58
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,300
He's been different ever since
he returned from the North.

59
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,550
Tell me. I don't want to miss out.

60
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,550
I think you missed out on a lot.

61
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,000
Non.

62
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,959
Tell me right now.

63
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,959
What happened? What's the story?

64
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,379
Tell me, Non.

65
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,800
What are you smiling about?

66
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,920
Ling! Ling!

67
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,050
What's up with them?

68
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:23,800
Paeng!

69
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,050
What are you doing?

70
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,459
What on earth are you doing?

71
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,300
You slacked off work

72
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,879
and now you're standing next to
a pond. Are you going to jump?

73
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,170
Who's going to jump?

74
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:35,670
I just want some peace and quiet.

75
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,129
And you're here to harass me again.

76
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,500
What on earth are you doing here?

77
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,089
I just want some peace and quiet.

78
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,379
Can't you understand human language?

79
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,129
It's good that you don't want to die

80
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:55,550
because you still have to stay here

81
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,300
until I forgive you.

82
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,629
Don't worry.

83
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,629
I'll hurry and finish my work
until you're satisfied.

84
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,670
I don't want to stay here
any longer anyway.

85
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,379
I'm sick of your face.

86
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,589
Then get back to work.

87
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,629
Miss Paeng, aren't you
going to rest?

88
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,000
It's okay. I don't want to get
scrutinized again.

89
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,750
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

90
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,839
I'm thinking that as well.

91
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,300
I don't understand why Mr. Artit
wants to scrutinize her so much.

92
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,129
Why are you stalking her?

93
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,299
Saeb,

94
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,250
I'm not stalking her.

95
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,549
I just want to be sure
that no one's slacking off.

96
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,879
You really are scrutinizing her.

97
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,710
Oh, hey! Where did she run off to?

98
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,379
Ouch. Please do it more gently.

99
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,169
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,460
This is the most gentle I can be.

101
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,669
I think you should stop
if you can't take it anymore.

102
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:23,000
It'll be bad if it gets inflamed
and you become feverish.

103
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:25,129
No.

104
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,669
I'm going to endure it.

105
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,419
I'm not going to show weakness.

106
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,419
I know

107
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,129
that your heart is strong.

108
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,710
But your body won't
be able to take it.

109
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,710
Look, your arm is tiny.

110
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,919
I'm okay.

111
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:45,590
The more it's used,
the stronger the body gets.

112
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,879
We'll see if I can die from this.

113
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,419
Miss Paeng!

114
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,379
I'm going back to work.

115
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,919
Oh?

116
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,590
Are you going now?

117
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,169
What do you want me to do now?

118
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:30,379
Follow me.

119
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,549
Have a seat.

120
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:48,549
I said have a seat.

121
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,549
Here.

122
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,590
What is it?

123
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,590
Liniment.

124
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,500
I want to know if it's effective.

125
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,960
If it is, I can put it up for sale.

126
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,669
What are you doing?

127
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:35,419
Your hair's all messed up.
I'll tie it up for you.

128
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,710
- I'll do it myself.
- Keep still.

129
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,460
Here. Take it to use at home.

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,549
I want to know
if it's really effective.

131
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,460
You can rest now.

132
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,919
But I might not finish work.

133
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,299
I order you to go home.

134
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,340
Hello, Mark.

135
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:48,210
Hey!

136
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,090
Talk here.

137
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,919
Just a second.

138
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:54,879
You just told me to go home.

139
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,500
I don't want you to be
on the phone during work.

140
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,960
But you told me to go,
so I've finished work.

141
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,129
But this is during work hours.

142
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,419
Artit.

143
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,169
Mark, I'm a little busy.
I'll call you later.

144
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,250
Why are you like this?
You're so rude.

145
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:23,879
I can do anything here.

146
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,549
You're the one who can't.

147
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,710
You have no right to use the phone
during work, understand?

148
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,879
Why are you such a brat?

149
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:36,799
How self-centered.

150
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,210
Will I be able to stand him?

151
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,750
Hey, my phone!

152
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,299
Artit! Artit!

153
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:46,960
Artit, you took my phone with you.

154
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,000
Artit!

155
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:53,879
Get on. I'll give you a lift.

156
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:56,250
No, I just want my phone back.

157
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,960
I'm going, then.

158
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:01,750
Hold on!

159
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,750
Do they really hate each other?

160
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:15,879
They really do.

161
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:19,250
They really do?

162
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:21,299
Really!

163
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,049
Oh?

164
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:02,629
Artit.

165
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,960
Artit,

166
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:07,500
give me back my phone.

167
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,710
And why did you come in my house?

168
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:17,049
I'm here to inspect if it's tidy.

169
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:19,919
What right do you have
to inspect my place?

170
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,840
Whose place?

171
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,090
I have to inspect
the employee's house sometimes.

172
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,169
But you've seen it before.

173
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:31,879
I didn't look carefully
at that time.

174
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,840
How is it?

175
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,799
Is it tidy enough for you, boss?

176
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,960
If it is, you can go now.

177
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:52,379
What do you have to eat?

178
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,919
How rude.

179
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,379
How did you turn out this way?

180
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,129
How long are you going
to keep harassing me?

181
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,750
Is there anything else
apart from oranges?

182
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:08,460
No.

183
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,879
If you want to eat, go home.

184
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:18,629
I'm going to do the laundry.

185
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,000
Should I help you?

186
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:27,879
Artit, are you feeling unwell?

187
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,549
Are you feverish?

188
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,879
Are you burning up? Are you sick?

189
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,919
Arirt, you're the weirdest
I've ever seen.

190
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,340
Even since you applied
the liniment for me.

191
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,840
You can go now.

192
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:51,750
Go!

193
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,000
(Sample product)

194
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,880
Does this kind of person even exist?

195
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:35,420
You think my place is a hotel?

196
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,339
Really. You tried to be subtle.

197
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:43,210
You followed me just to take a nap.

198
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,000
My phone.

199
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,630
Why is he in such a deep sleep?

200
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:29,500
He doesn't have a fever.

201
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,250
But he's really weird today.

202
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,210
Let's try again.

203
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,589
Are you trying to assault me?

204
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,839
I'm not.

205
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,380
The evidence is that
your hand is on my face.

206
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:00,339
I'm not trying to assault you.

207
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,500
Don't lie.

208
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:05,380
I... I just...

209
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:08,589
I just want to see if you're sick.

210
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,460
I didn't do it, Artit!

211
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:32,960
You pulled me in!

212
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,380
Artit, I'm sorry!

213
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,960
Paeng!

214
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,299
I...

215
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,049
I'm very angry!

216
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,589
- Dad!
- Hmm?

217
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,299
What's the matter with you?

218
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,670
Uhh... nothing.

219
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,880
What's up, Dad?

220
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,049
I heard you checked up on
Paeng's work at the rose garden.

221
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:09,670
That's right.

222
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:12,630
What's this?

223
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:17,750
Some soap and tea.

224
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,420
Whose are they?

225
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,089
They're probably Paeng's products.

226
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,589
- Thanks.
- No problem.

227
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,339
What are you thanking me for?

228
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,130
For being interested in her work.

229
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,299
I'm so happy because of that.

230
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,299
Have you taught her any work?

231
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,589
Not really.

232
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,049
It's okay. Let's take it slow.

233
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,589
So one day,

234
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,339
she'll be able to work alone
without me feeling worried.

235
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:02,710
I have to ask you to teach her
about marketing.

236
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,589
Okay, Dad.

237
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,880
This is a good idea.

238
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,089
Three two zero,

239
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,339
three two one,

240
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,339
three two two...

241
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:36,250
I'm sorry!

242
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,630
Paeng!

243
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,089
I'm very angry!

244
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,339
What should I do?

245
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,920
Miss Paeng, what's wrong?

246
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,920
I saw you counting here
four times already.

247
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,380
I can't concentrate at all, Aueng.

248
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,960
Then what's wrong?

249
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,710
Don't tell me you're thinking of
what happened with Artit yesterday.

250
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:06,339
Don't mention that name!

251
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,549
See? I told you not
to mention his name.

252
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:18,880
Oh?

253
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:24,750
What's up, Artit?

254
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,049
Come in.

255
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,000
You still look alright
after working in the hot sun.

256
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Did you fetch me
to give me a compliment?

257
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,049
Cheeky.

258
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,299
How is it? You've worked
non-stop. Is it fun?

259
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:57,170
It's alright.

260
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,920
You summoned me just to ask me this?

261
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,339
Wait.

262
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,339
I told you to come because
I'm going to give you more work.

263
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,299
My body near fuses with the bed
because of all the work nowadays.

264
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:14,750
What other work do you
want to give me?

265
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,549
Aren't you tough?

266
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,170
You have time to answer calls.

267
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,210
I don't think a little
more work would hurt.

268
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,799
Okay. Do you want me
to dig a pond for the tilapia?

269
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,960
Or do you want me to build
an elephant sanctuary?

270
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm going to let you work
with me closely.

271
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,299
I don't want to!

272
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:42,630
Why not?

273
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,049
It makes me stressed.

274
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:48,960
What is your position here?

275
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,049
An employee.

276
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,960
Can an employee choose
the work they want?

277
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,710
What do you say?
Are you going to do it or not?

278
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:09,750
But I haven't finished
counting the tomatoes.

279
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,710
No need.

280
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,920
Do you really want me to do it?

281
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,000
Really.

282
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,630
Aren't you afraid of me
harassing you anymore?

283
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,630
When do I start?

284
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,549
In five.

285
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,420
Okay, five days it is.

286
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,380
Four.

287
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,920
Three.

288
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:18,170
Two.

289
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,250
One.

290
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,549
Go make some coffee.

291
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,339
Too sweet.

292
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,920
Too bitter.

293
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,839
This is good.

294
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,880
Really?

295
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,839
It's nice.

296
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:48,670
It's exactly the same
as the first cup.

297
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,299
Do I have to stay like this
the whole day?

298
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,460
Are you done reading it?

299
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,960
Ages ago.

300
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,549
You can go now.

301
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,920
See you!

302
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,299
Where are you going?

303
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,299
To see the rose garden.

304
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,460
You have to go to a meeting with me

305
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:26,000
and write everything down.

306
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,460
Artit, but our agreement

307
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:38,589
is that I work on my stuff
in the afternoon.

308
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:40,880
Who made an agreement with you?

309
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:46,589
But my roses need care.

310
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,839
I'm working on
a new product as well.

311
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,250
If you do this,
you're delaying my work.

312
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,750
Aren't you afraid of me staying for
more than two years?

313
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:02,380
How do you know that the meeting
isn't useful for your rose business?

314
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,880
Or do you want to be here
for more than two years?

315
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,920
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

316
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,880
Aueng,

317
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:33,420
I think I'm more stressed than
when I was doing manual labor.

318
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:35,670
How come?

319
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,170
It's Artit. He uses me for work

320
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,339
and he claims that he's helping.
But I think it's a waste of time.

321
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:48,000
Oh? I thought you two have made up.

322
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,420
Why did it turn out like this?

323
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,250
Made up, you say?

324
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,750
It's actually worse.

325
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,339
I'm not going to put up with it.

326
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,250
Have you taught her any work?

327
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,630
Not really.

328
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,750
Let's take it slow.

329
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,380
So one day,

330
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,130
she'll be able to work alone
without me feeling worried.

331
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,589
Artit.

332
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,839
Why didn't you go to the office?

333
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,630
I'm going to do my work.

334
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:09,710
You can do it in the afternoon.

335
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,799
No.

336
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,880
Haven't you tortured me enough?

337
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,589
Are you saying that I'm
torturing you, Wanfamai?

338
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:21,420
That's right.

339
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,500
You can be angry, hate

340
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:26,839
deduct my salary, bully
or ruin me all you want.

341
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,839
Go ahead.

342
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,670
But I won't work closely with you.

343
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:35,130
I'm already going crazy as it is.

344
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,299
Hey!

345
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,750
Does being close to me
drives you crazy?

346
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,960
It does!

347
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,549
Very well!

348
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,549
I'd like to see someone
going crazy as well.

349
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,549
What is it?

350
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,549
All my possessions.

351
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,250
I'm giving it all to you.

352
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:04,630
So we can go our separate ways

353
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,170
and we don't owe anything
to each other anymore.

354
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,089
Or do you want me
to transfer all I've got

355
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,750
to compensate
for all the time you've lost?

356
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,460
I'm happy to do that.

357
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,630
So we can end it right here.

358
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,549
I want some peace and quiet.

359
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,590
Artit!

360
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,050
Sit down.

361
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,590
Here.

362
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,300
What?

363
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,750
The cards I confiscated from you.

364
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,630
I don't what you to misunderstand

365
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,800
that these things can atone
for what you did to me.

366
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,340
What do you mean?

367
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,460
I'm returning them to you.

368
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,050
Until now,

369
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,630
I've never accepted your apologies.

370
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,960
But now I'll listen to you

371
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,210
if you try hard enough.

372
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,920
Hold on.

373
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,670
You're not going to count

374
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,380
what I've been doing previously?

375
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,170
Don't you understand human language?

376
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,500
I just told you that
I'm including it now.

377
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,590
So until now,

378
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,210
I've been doing everything for free?

379
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,050
This is the worst.

380
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,960
What did you do?

381
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,710
I don't see you doing anything

382
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,750
but causing trouble.

383
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,630
Okay.

384
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,090
Then let's start now.

385
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,590
So we'll be done.

386
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,250
Alright.

387
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,380
Let's count from one right now.

388
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,210
Go make coffee.

389
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,550
Why did you let Paeng work with you?

390
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,960
I'm going to train her.

391
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,420
Just that

392
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,420
or do you want her to be close?

393
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,590
I'm going to train her.
Are you dumb?

394
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,960
So you're not angry
with her anymore?

395
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,630
He's not angry or he...

396
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,130
Stop. What were you going to say?

397
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,340
I haven't forgiven you
about the trip up North

398
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,550
that you lied to me
about you and Paeng.

399
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,960
Okay. I'm sorry

400
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,920
for making you jealous
about Paeng, okay?

401
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,460
Who's jealous?

402
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,380
I'm just going to train her.
Dad asked me to.

403
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,960
Ling, he seems too serious.

404
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,250
- Don't you think?
- That's true.

405
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,170
When is he going to stop
being angry with her?

406
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,590
What's so funny?

407
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,380
Come on, my simple girl.

408
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,170
He's trying to cover it up.

409
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,250
Cover what up?

410
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,960
Duang,

411
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,630
did you get any leads?

412
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,050
I did.

413
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,090
The workers said Mr. Artit has been
weird for the last three days.

414
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,340
He stalked Paeng.

415
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,670
He would go looking for Paeng.

416
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,500
And he brought her
to work in his office.

417
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,960
Today, he followed her.

418
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,250
Oh, dear.

419
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,960
How is this possible?

420
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,340
He usually hates her so much.
How did it turn out like this?

421
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,170
- That's true.
- It's possible, Madam.

422
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,170
She's evil.

423
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,420
She might've worked her charm on him

424
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,670
and used black magic on him.

425
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,710
That's possible.

426
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,090
Saeb told me he seems strange.

427
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,340
He has mood swings. He would
scold her then be worried about her.

428
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,000
He even summoned her
to work with him.

429
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,550
- He's even worried?
- That's right.

430
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,500
Oh, dear.

431
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,420
Is my husband home yet?

432
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,590
He is, Madam.

433
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,710
- Good. Duang,
- Yes, Madam?

434
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,630
Go fetch Paeng here right now.

435
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,090
We have to find out.

436
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,590
Whoa.

437
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,250
Duang, why are you here?

438
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,590
Do you really think I want to set
foot here and get it filthy?

439
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,420
Oh, you don't want to?

440
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,500
Come here. Get out!

441
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,800
- Get out!
- Let go!

442
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,380
Where's your boss?

443
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,210
Why are you asking about Miss Paeng?

444
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,300
It's none of your business.
Don't butt in.

445
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,590
Duang, you can be tough anywhere
but not here.

446
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,420
Why not? You want some of this?

447
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,630
Duang,

448
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,380
what's the matter?

449
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,050
Madam wants to see you right now.

450
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,550
Mom,

451
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,710
what are you moody about?

452
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,500
That's true.

453
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,000
Should we eat first?

454
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,300
Then we'll talk later.

455
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,920
No, I have to talk right now.

456
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,750
She's here, Madam.

457
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,210
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

458
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,920
Brat,

459
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,300
what did you do to my son?

460
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,300
What did I do?

461
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,170
You used black magic on him.

462
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,750
Huh?

463
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,500
You still want to get him, right?

464
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,000
Mom, what are you talking about?

465
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,380
I'm speaking the truth, Artit.

466
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,670
Tell her what you're
feeling about her now.

467
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,880
Are you head over heels for her?
Do you like her?

468
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,750
Mom!

469
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,210
I...

470
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,960
How can I like her?

471
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,050
You're having a misunderstanding.

472
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,380
I haven't allowed you to speak.
Don't interrupt.

473
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,960
Wait, Tubtim.

474
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,130
What's all this? I'm so confused.

475
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,210
It's your beloved niece.
She used black magic on him.

476
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,920
- Black magic?
- That's right.

477
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,960
If she didn't,

478
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,880
why would Artit be concerned about
her when he really hates her?

479
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,630
I don't have feelings for you.

480
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,340
I know.

481
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,050
Auntie,

482
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,750
it's not even possible as a thought.

483
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,880
This really is a misunderstanding.

484
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,170
Misunderstand?

485
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:04,710
Artit, you let Paeng helped you
in the office, didn't you?

486
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,920
Hold on. Hold on.

487
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,170
I think this is my fault.

488
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,960
I saw Artit being worried
about Paeng.

489
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,170
- Huh?
- Dad!

490
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,170
I wasn't worried about her!

491
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,920
Let me finish.

492
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,840
So I asked him
to train her. That's all.

493
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,630
Tubtim,

494
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,460
these two kids don't have anything
between each other anymore.

495
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,500
I'm glad that they're talking
nicely to each other.

496
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,750
You should forget the past

497
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,750
and forgive Paeng already.

498
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,050
So this is my fault
for not forgiving her?

499
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,710
You've forgotten everything she did?

500
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,590
And now you're letting
Artit be with her too.

501
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,300
From now on,

502
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,670
leave my son alone.

503
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,920
And I forbid Artit
to train her again.

504
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,050
If anyone defies my order,

505
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,920
you'll be in trouble.

506
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,420
I promise, Auntie.

507
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,380
I will leave Artit alone.

508
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,590
We'll mind our own business.

509
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,300
I'll focus on my work.

510
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,210
Don't worry.

511
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,550
You've given me your word, Paeng.

512
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,500
Yes, Auntie.

513
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,800
I'll have to excuse myself.

514
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,380
Oh?

515
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,090
Why are you two
listening in on this?

516
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,960
What are you thinking, Madam?

517
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,460
I'm thinking

518
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,420
that I can't leave
Artit like this anymore.

519
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,210
I have to do something.

520
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,500
What are you going to do?

521
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,380
Here.

522
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,000
What is this?

523
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,380
There's a new restaurant in town.

524
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,300
Take Nang over there tomorrow.

525
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,670
Why do I have to?

526
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,670
It's my order.

527
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:51,300
Mom, I told you I'm not
interested in Nang.

528
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,920
Then who?

529
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,670
- No one.
- That's good, then.

530
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,340
So take Nang out for lunch.

531
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:59,800
Mom!

532
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,840
You never forced me before.

533
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,500
You can't just change all a sudden.

534
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,340
Why can't I? I'm going to change
from today onwards.

535
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,210
Take her out tomorrow.

536
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,590
If you don't, I'm going to invite
her here for a meal every day.

537
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,250
Choose what you want.

538
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,590
Fine. I'll take her out.

539
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,420
Excellent.

540
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,630
Don't let me hear that you
didn't take good care of her.

541
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,340
Okay.

542
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,630
But can I ask you something?

543
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,050
Do you think this will work?

544
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,420
Do you think I'll love Nang?

545
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,710
Of course. Why not?

546
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,750
Initially, Dad didn't love me
when we were younger too.

547
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,130
But he changed his mind.

548
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,920
I promise, Auntie.

549
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,920
I will leave Artit alone.

550
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,460
We'll mind our own business.

551
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,250
I'll focus on my work.

552
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,130
Don't worry.

553
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,460
You've given me your word, Paeng.

554
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,590
Miss Paeng?

555
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:41,800
You're still not asleep?

556
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,210
If you're not, I'm going to
bed now. I'm sleepy.

557
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,550
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

558
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,550
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

559
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,380
What is it, Aueng?

560
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:19,840
There's some guy at the rose garden.

561
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,960
He's so handsome, tall,

562
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,380
fair and toned.

563
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,800
He's like a K-drama protagonist.

564
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,840
He looks like an Oppa.

565
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,590
He's that great?

566
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,340
Yes, he has stolen my heart!

567
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,210
Can you feel

568
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,550
how fast my heart is beating?

569
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,130
Oppa. Oppa.

570
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,340
Oppa. Oppa.

571
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,880
Oppa.

572
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,750
- Okay.
- I want him!

573
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,880
Mark?

574
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,590
Paeng.

575
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:23,300
Did you know that you're
the first customer

576
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,800
who came to my rose garden?

577
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,750
I'm not your customer yet

578
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,340
since I haven't bought anything.

579
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,250
I'm sorry for jumping
to conclusions.

580
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,130
I'm only joking.

581
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,750
Your joke

582
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
is really startling for the seller.

583
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,000
I saw pictures
on your social media page.

584
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,550
So I wanted to see the real thing.

585
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,090
It's really nice.

586
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,590
Are you taking care
of all of this by yourself?

587
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,210
That's right. I started out
with an empty plot of land.

588
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,460
I've never seen anyone your age
who works in agriculture like this.

589
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,130
It's very tiring and difficult work.

590
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,090
But you're doing so well.

591
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,880
I think your parents
must be very proud.

592
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,300
I guess so.

593
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,380
They passed away a long time ago,

594
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,800
even before I graduated.

595
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,050
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

596
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,550
You're not wrong for not knowing.

597
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,460
Should we have a look over there?

598
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,960
Okay. Please lead the way.

599
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,840
Aueng, how's your boss today?

600
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,000
She's very happy.

601
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:52,210
She's giving a customer
a tour around the garden.

602
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,800
Giving a customer a tour?

603
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,800
That's right. He seems to be
really fond of roses.

604
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,960
He's been here since morning and
they disappeared into the garden.

605
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,960
They haven't even returned yet.

606
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,800
The rose garden is not that big.
Why are they taking so long?

607
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,420
Are they inspecting the roots too?

608
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:15,960
Since he's that handsome, he can
inspect whatever he wants.

609
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,250
He can even inspect my heart.

610
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,420
Is the customer a guy?

611
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,590
Mr. Artit.

612
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,920
Oh?

613
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,250
Jeez, you're just going to
leave me here?

614
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,550
He's so quick.

615
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,590
No one's here now.

616
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,300
La-la-la-la.

617
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,420
It's so sweet.

618
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,340
- Let's do it that way.
- Sure.

619
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,500
- Mark.
- Yes?

620
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,380
I'm opening up a stall
at an event next Wednesday.

621
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,300
Please come if you're free.

622
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,460
I'll definitely be there.

623
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,050
Watch your step.

624
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,960
- Walk carefully.
- Thank you.

625
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:13,300
Wait, stay still.

626
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,340
There's a blade of grass
on your hair.

627
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,500
Thank you.

628
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,880
Paeng, you don't have
to thank me so often.

629
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,050
- Okay?
- Okay.

630
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,460
I'll notify you about the order

631
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,710
because the quality of your roses
is what I want.

632
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,960
- I have to go now.
- I'll see you later.

633
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,340
- Bye.
- Bye.

634
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,050
Was that your customer?

635
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,710
Yes, my most important
potential customer.

636
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,920
Miss Paeng!

637
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,250
He really is handsome!

638
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,630
He is definitely your type.

639
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,880
How do you know?

640
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:07,670
I've been with you for a long time.

641
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,920
Your type is handsome, fair

642
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,210
and likes to smile.

643
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,000
Maybe he's been sent
to you from above.

644
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:18,460
Aueng, come on.

645
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,090
Don't say this again.

646
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:21,800
Mark might hear it.

647
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,130
I'll be so embarrassed.

648
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,340
He might actually
like it, Miss Paeng.

649
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,670
How long have you been here,
Mr. Artit?

650
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,750
So he's your customer?

651
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,300
That's right.

652
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,750
I think he's lying.

653
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,630
He's actually after you.

654
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,210
I don't care what he's doing.

655
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,880
But he ordered my product.
So he's my customer.

656
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,590
You made a deal with someone

657
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,170
but why didn't you ask me first?

658
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,550
Do I have to?

659
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:15,090
You just started out
with running a business.

660
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,130
You don't know anything about it.

661
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,960
Next time, you can't
make your own decision.

662
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,500
You have to consult me first.

663
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:24,800
You don't trust me?

664
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,300
That's right. I don't.

665
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,590
But your mom told you
not to fraternize with me.

666
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,300
But this is

667
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,630
the farm's business.
I can't let it slide.

668
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:46,630
I might be too demanding
and not trusting you.

669
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,300
But I have to do it because
it's my duty, understand?

670
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,840
Your roses are grown
in Sunshine Farm.

671
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,800
I don't want you to tarnish
our reputation or ruin it.

672
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,750
I'll tarnish the farm's reputation?
I'll ruin it?

673
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:03,750
I can't be sure.

674
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,590
Okay. I understand.

675
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,550
Take this and read it yourself.

676
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,960
You can go now.

677
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,800
Here. I'll help you.

678
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,130
Thanks.

679
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,710
Here you are.

680
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,420
Is this one for you?

681
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,250
They're so lovely.

682
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,710
Wife and husband running
the business together.

683
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,460
We're not. Not yet.

684
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:51,800
We will be in due time.

685
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,340
What? Did I say anything wrong?

686
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:56,630
You still don't know?

687
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,920
What? I really want to marry you.

688
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,500
I've been saving up
since sophomore year.

689
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,460
Sophomore year?
But we weren't dating then.

690
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,340
Who were you thinking of marrying?

691
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:14,670
It's you.

692
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,880
I planned to keep wooing you.

693
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,840
Once you give in,
I would ask you to marry me.

694
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,210
You're crazy.

695
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,960
I'm not kidding, you know?

696
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,590
If I brought the ring,

697
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:29,090
I'd be on my knees
and proposing to you now.

698
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,800
You're in too much of a rush.

699
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:32,880
Give me a bit of time.

700
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,050
We haven't been together
for that long.

701
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,840
I'm still not used to it.

702
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,800
Then we should do this.

703
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,380
Hmm?

704
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,090
What are you doing?

705
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,920
Uhh...

706
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,590
Why do you look so serious?

707
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:01,750
What's wrong with him?

708
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,340
I think there's only one thing
that can make him like this.

709
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,670
I'm going to prove something.

710
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,840
Huh?

711
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,920
You might get as mad as a dog
eating too much dessert.

712
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,380
It's so cold!

713
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,090
Mom!

714
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,380
I almost took my towel off.

715
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,170
Go ahead. Why would you be afraid?

716
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,050
I've seen it ever since
it's as small as a flower.

717
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:51,750
Here.

718
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:53,670
Why did you come in here?

719
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,250
To pick out an outfit for you.

720
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,750
You're taking Nang out for a meal.
Don't forget that.

721
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,590
Okay.

722
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,920
Alright, Auntie Tubtim.

723
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,590
Don't worry. I'm all dressed up.

724
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:12,800
Once Artit's here, I'm ready to go.

725
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,300
Very good.

726
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,050
I'll usher him to go over soon.

727
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,590
Get dolled up and wait for him.

728
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,960
Okay. No need to worry.

729
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,920
I'll be the most beautiful tonight.

730
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:30,210
I wish you luck and happiness.

731
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,420
Have fun on the date.

732
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,630
- I'm not going anymore.
- You can't.

733
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,880
You can't. Don't embarrass me.

734
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,050
Hurry up. Put on your shoes now.

735
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,460
What's up?

736
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,880
Are you free right now?

737
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,000
Come to the party at Ling's.

738
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:57,630
What party?

739
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,880
Nothing. Just a gathering.

740
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,750
I can't go.

741
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,250
My mom forced me to take
your sister out for a meal.

742
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,420
I'm about to go pick her up.

743
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:08,090
She's good.

744
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,170
It's a shame though.

745
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,590
I told Ling to invite Paeng.

746
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,920
Huh?

747
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,050
I have to hang up now.

748
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,460
Wait, wait. Paeng's going?

749
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,800
Why did you invite her?

750
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,380
It's just an invitation.

751
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,960
So are you coming or not?

752
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:27,050
I'm not going.

753
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,550
- Ouf of the way, Non!
- I'll help you.

754
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,800
Artit won't come.
I can't find out now.

755
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,500
What do you want to find out?

756
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,420
Hello, Non and Ling.

757
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:59,050
- Paeng!
- Hello.

758
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,170
I told you that you didn't
have to bring anything.

759
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,960
I made this myself.
How can I not bring it?

760
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,630
Peek-a-boo, Paeng!

761
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,210
What did you bring?

762
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,880
- Something loud from the oven.
- Something loud? What is it?

763
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,840
- A bun!
- It really is loud! A bun!

764
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,460
It's so good.

765
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:24,210
I'll take home two pieces. We won't
be able to finish everything.

766
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,710
Definitely.

767
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,340
Kot, save some for me too.

768
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,800
Here. I saved you two pieces.

769
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,130
I'll take three.

770
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,210
You're the host. I'll serve you.

771
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,590
- This is not an ordinary fish.
- What is it?

772
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:45,590
A fish called love.

773
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,960
So lame.

774
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,590
Who made this?

775
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,840
It's so good.

776
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,340
Sho gud!

777
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,170
- The accent is not right yet.
- Your throat's full of phlegm.

778
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,300
You still can't land the accent.

779
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,840
- Sho gud!
- Nice.

780
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,670
Mmm! I'm so full. It's so tasty.

781
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:07,960
Thank you very much.

782
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:12,550
Here. Take a stick to
choose your team.

783
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,750
- Ta-da!
- Long stick!

784
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,340
I'm on your team, Paeng.

785
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,500
Alright!

786
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:24,250
A fruit. A yellow fruit.

787
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,960
- It's yellow.
- Pineapple?

788
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:29,960
Not pineapple. The tree
hat Nang Tani possesses.

789
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,130
- Monkey's favorite fruit.
- Banana!

790
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:32,300
Right!

791
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,550
It's so me. Which fruit
suits me best?

792
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:36,840
Strawberry!

793
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:40,130
See?

794
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,630
Papaya pok-pok. Papaya pok-pok.

795
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,460
- Pok-pok?
- Right. With fermented fish?

796
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:46,710
Papaya salad!

797
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,380
When you missed out on a meal,
what do you get?

798
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,630
- What is it?
- Stomachache?

799
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:51,920
What stomach?

800
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,840
Fish stomach!

801
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,210
That's right! Fish stomach!

802
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:58,000
Here! Here!

803
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:00,800
Who am I? Who am I?

804
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,590
- Non!
- Really, Non?

805
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,800
- What is it?
- "Non"

806
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,500
"loves"

807
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,130
Who?

808
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:10,090
- Who are you?
- I'm Ling.

809
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:13,630
"Non loves Ling."

810
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,590
Awesome, Ling!

811
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,500
Who's here?

812
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,250
I'll get it.

813
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,300
Nang, I can't make it anymore.

814
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,420
How come?

815
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,210
I'm ready to leave right now.

816
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,590
Something came up.
Let's do it tomorrow.

817
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:53,750
You can go wherever
you want tomorrow.

818
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:57,250
But I want to go today.

819
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,090
I'll give you the whole day.

820
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,210
From morning until evening.

821
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:06,050
- Okay.
- It's a deal.

822
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,840
Artit!

823
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,170
Well...

824
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:36,210
where did Paeng go?
She was just here.

825
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,710
Where's our happy Paeng?

826
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,250
Non, have you seen her?

827
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,090
- That's true.
- Where is she?

828
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:43,590
Is she here?

829
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:46,170
They're about to laugh
but they won't.

830
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,380
Oh, jeez.

831
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,630
Are you human or stone?
Why are you so stiff?

832
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:00,920
A gathering like this

833
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:03,170
reminds me of back then.

834
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,880
When we would sing karaoke.

835
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:10,710
Artit looked after Paeng
so well back then.

836
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:12,750
He looked after her,

837
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,210
took care of her,

838
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,880
entertain her,

839
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:17,960
and bought her anything
she wanted to eat.

840
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,670
Unlike presently.

841
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:27,000
Artit,

842
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,500
I'll get you some drink.

843
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,670
- I'll help you.
- Come on.

844
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:34,550
- Excuse me.
- Oh?

845
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,130
Then why am I staying?

846
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,460
I'll help you too.

847
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,750
I'll be back. Make yourself at home.

848
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:57,800
Artit,

849
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,420
why are you following me?

850
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:02,840
Who's following you?

851
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:05,340
This is my friend's place.

852
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:07,750
It's not strange for me to visit.
It's strange that you're here.

853
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,590
I didn't know
you were going to be here.

854
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,920
They said you weren't. So I came.

855
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:16,670
So should I go?

856
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:20,210
Do you know

857
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:23,420
what I had to do to come here today?

858
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,550
You stay. I'll go.

859
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:34,630
Why?

860
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,170
Why do you always make me angry?

861
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,670
I didn't do anything.

862
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,340
You got angry yourself.

863
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,920
I don't understand either.

864
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:43,960
You get angry every time you see me.

865
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:45,250
You harass me.

866
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:47,960
I didn't even do anything.

867
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:55,670
Paeng...

868
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,170
It's my phone. I have to take it.

869
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,420
Hello, Mark.

870
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,380
Give me back my phone!

871
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:15,710
She's busy right now.

872
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,300
Excuse me, who are you?

873
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,380
Someone Paeng has to obey.

874
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,750
Talking to me is the same
as talking to her.

875
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,420
What do you want?

876
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:31,710
It's private.

877
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:33,960
I'll call her later.

878
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,050
I have the right to everything
in Paeng's private life.

879
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,750
Hello?

880
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,090
So are you going to say it?

881
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,500
I'll hang up if you're not.

882
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:49,000
If it's not important,
don't ever call again.

883
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,460
Artit, what are you doing?

884
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,130
Ling, I have to go now.

885
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,000
I don't even have the right

886
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,920
to go home?

887
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,210
Have you gone crazy?

888
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,420
You've gone too far.
She went home crying.

889
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,590
Artit, why are you so harsh?

890
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,590
You can't have the right to
everything in Paeng's private life.

891
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,590
I agree.

892
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,960
You've gone too far.

893
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:19,710
Alright. Gang up on me.

894
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:23,300
Do you know who called her?

895
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,880
She said he's her customer.

896
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:30,500
Artit, I think it's too harsh.

897
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:32,800
If I were her, I'd be angry with you
being rude to her customer.

898
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,590
Listen to me.

899
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,210
He's the guy we met up North.

900
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,840
I saw him when we're at the first
mountain. Then later again.

901
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,880
He followed her here.

902
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:45,750
How can he be her customer?

903
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:47,250
I don't trust him.

904
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,090
Don't you think it's strange?

905
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,380
I don't.

906
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,630
How can it not be strange?

907
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,710
He came all the way from
another province to here.

908
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,130
To here?

909
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:03,000
That's right. This morning he met
her. And he called again just now.

910
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:07,000
He's definitely not her customer.
He's wooing her.

911
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:09,590
Then it's even less strange.

912
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,550
That's right. If it was me,

913
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:14,050
if I like someone,
I'll travel as far as I can.

914
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,300
That's right.
You know I'd do it too.

915
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,090
If someone did this
for me, I'd love him.

916
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,130
That's why you love me.

917
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,670
You can go being
lovey-dovey in the kitchen.

918
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,250
- So I'm wrong?
- You are.

919
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:32,500
You should go apologize to Paeng.

920
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:36,800
No, I won't.

921
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:39,380
Why are you so stubborn?

922
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:40,750
Really.

923
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,750
Hey, where are you going?

924
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:46,710
I'm going home.

925
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,840
The party is ruined.

926
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,300
Come on, Miss Paeng.

927
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,750
- Please.
- Thank you.

928
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,960
Miss Paeng!

929
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:45,800
Wow!

930
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:49,630
Artit, is this beautiful?

931
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:37,420
Artit,

932
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,960
let's go see a movie
after we're done.

933
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:43,920
You promised.

934
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:47,340
You have to be there
for me the whole day.

935
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:49,670
Nang,

936
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:53,500
next time you have to wait
for the guy to ask you first.

937
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:56,750
What day and age is it now?

938
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:58,840
I'm not going to wait.

939
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,960
Let's go listen to
some music afterwards.

940
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,590
We might end up going home late.

941
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:09,090
If it's late then
I don't have to go home.

942
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,880
I can stay over at your house.

943
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,550
Don't be too frank

944
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,500
when you're talking to a guy.

945
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,250
Behave yourself.

946
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,710
Did I come here with my dad

947
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,590
or Non?

948
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,000
Look at what you're wearing.

949
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,210
Cover up a little more next time.

950
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:34,340
If it's not me, it might be
dangerous for you.

951
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,840
It's too revealing.

952
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,630
How do you want me to dress then?

953
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,670
Let's sit at this table.

954
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,130
Should I dress like that

955
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,000
so I can go out with a guy?

956
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:58,130
Please have a seat.

957
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,130
Paeng, have a look
at the cream we bought.

958
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:14,460
- Good.
- See how the smell is.

959
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,380
Gosh.

960
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:27,710
They seem really close.

961
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,710
Who is he?

962
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,500
I've never seen him before.

963
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:35,630
He's her customer.

964
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,090
Oh, wow.

965
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,000
She can find a customer
this good-looking?

966
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:41,590
She's good.

967
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:48,880
That's the guy

968
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,960
I met up North. He knows her.

969
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:53,840
I recognize him.

970
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,250
She's good at getting guys.

971
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,300
They're being romantic in public.

972
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:22,590
They don't respect you at all.

973
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:27,750
Excuse me. Bill, please.

974
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,420
Nang, wait outside.

975
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,670
Are you going to scold her?

976
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:35,960
Don't be harsh, okay?

977
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,630
It might be embarrassing.

978
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:42,420
I'll wait outside.

979
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,210
How's the packaging.

980
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,590
It's beautiful.

981
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:22,750
How are you doing, Paeng?

982
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,210
Who is he?

983
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,130
You already know him.
Why are you asking?

984
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,710
Oh! He's your customer.
The one you told me.

985
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:45,210
I'm Artit.

986
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,000
I'm Mark.

987
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:49,460
- Nice to meet you.
- Gladly.

988
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,380
Make yourselves comfortable.

989
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,630
But don't take too long,
I'm waiting.

990
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:06,420
I'll see you at home, darling.

991
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:17,050
If you're not back home
within two hours,

992
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:18,750
You're toast.

993
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,630
Make yourselves comfortable.

994
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:39,670
Why did you come out so soon?

995
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:43,170
Have you dealt with her?

996
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:47,500
I'm going to give you a lift.

997
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:50,800
I'm not going home. I don't want to.

998
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:52,590
No one's home.

999
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,380
Then come to my place.

1000
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:58,630
Right away.

1001
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,300
Artit!

1002
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,550
Are you in a relationship
with Mr. Artit?

1003
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,500
No, I'm not.

1004
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:14,460
But he doesn't seem to like me.

1005
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,000
He doesn't like me.

1006
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:20,090
He wasn't trying to get to you.

1007
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:21,630
It's me.

1008
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,630
But I think

1009
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,590
I'm starting to understand him.

1010
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:32,840
You understand him?

1011
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:35,670
I see him almost every day and
yet I don't understand him.

1012
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:38,090
We're both guys. We know.

1013
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,960
What is it?

1014
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,170
Let's talk about you.

1015
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,250
You came to stay here.

1016
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:52,920
Does it have anything to do
with you being an orphan?

1017
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:56,250
Yes.

1018
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:59,380
But in a year or so,
I'll get to move out.

1019
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:01,130
I'm looking forward to that day.

1020
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:03,840
But it depends

1021
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:09,420
on my best customer.
Is he ready to support me?

1022
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:14,210
I'm starting to get scared now

1023
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:15,880
seeing the seller being
so good at sealing the deal.

1024
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:18,710
Don't be scared just yet.

1025
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,550
Why didn't Artit come inside?

1026
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:31,300
He dropped me off
and went back to work.

1027
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,460
Oh, really?

1028
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:33,800
Auntie,

1029
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,250
I saw Paeng today.

1030
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,840
She was with a guy.

1031
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,800
Can you believe it? Right in the
middle of a restaurant,

1032
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,380
they're kissing each other's hands.

1033
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:44,210
How dare she?

1034
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,050
She's so shameless.

1035
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,170
I was right for not
being able to accept her.

1036
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:52,750
Who's the guy she was with?

1037
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:55,500
I met him up north.

1038
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,050
She probably asked him to meet her.

1039
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,000
She's quite good.

1040
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,710
Really!

1041
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,960
I can't really accept a promiscuous
woman like her.

1042
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:07,460
But it's good she's got her own man.

1043
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,710
So my son is safe from her.

1044
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,340
What are you smiling about?

1045
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,170
I like watching you smile.

1046
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:32,920
When you smile,
the world gets brighter.

1047
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,880
I'll sell my smiles then.

1048
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:38,210
It'd sell well.

1049
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:39,710
I'll really buy it.

1050
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,800
I was only kidding.

1051
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,500
Who would sell their smiles?

1052
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,300
When I was a kid,

1053
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,710
I could only cry.

1054
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:56,420
I almost didn't know how to smile.

1055
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:04,170
Mark,

1056
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:06,800
would you like to tell me?

1057
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:10,670
But it's sad.
You shouldn't listen to it.

1058
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:16,090
I really want to.

1059
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,750
I'm an orphan like you.

1060
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:28,590
My parents died when I was seven.

1061
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,710
So I had to stay with relatives.

1062
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,590
But they never saw me as a nephew

1063
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:39,340
or even human.

1064
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,840
- I love you, Auntie!
- I didn't want to take you in!

1065
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:58,340
I don't love you!

1066
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:00,420
I love you, Auntie!

1067
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:19,840
How could you get through
those tough times?

1068
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:23,670
It's inevitable

1069
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:27,800
but it made me strong.

1070
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:32,750
It's because you didn't give up.

1071
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:34,960
I know

1072
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:38,210
how difficult it is to fight alone.

1073
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,340
What about you?

1074
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,670
How did you get through it?

1075
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,380
My dad told me

1076
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,090
that in life, we'll never know

1077
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,920
when luck will turn on you.

1078
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,050
But if we're strong enough

1079
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:02,670
and don't give up,

1080
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,210
the misfortune can't do
anything to us.

1081
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,960
And we'll eventually get through it.

1082
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,210
Your dad is very wise

1083
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,880
Can I use that as a reminder?

1084
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,300
Sure. I won't charge you money.

1085
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,590
You dared to refuse my call?

1086
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,380
Mr. Artit, should you go for now?

1087
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,960
Once Miss Paeng's back,
I'll tell her to call you.

1088
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:01,170
- Give me your phone.
- Sorry?

1089
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,170
Give me your phone.

1090
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,420
Yes, Aueng?

1091
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,590
Miss Paeng,

1092
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,500
where are you?

1093
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:29,130
I'm with Mark.

1094
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:30,500
I'll be home soon.

1095
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:35,340
Where are you? Tell me!

1096
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

1097
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:41,960
Which shop are you at?

1098
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,130
You're with Artit, aren't you?

1099
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,630
Yes. Oops.

1100
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,340
Why did I say yes?

1101
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:49,880
Shoot.

1102
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,750
Paeng, where are you?
I'm going to go and pick you up.

1103
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,880
I can go back myself.

1104
01:24:58,170 --> 01:24:59,250
What time are you going to be back?

1105
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,590
I'll hurry back once I'm done.

1106
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,750
Hello? Hello? Paeng?

1107
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:20,130
If you're unhappy,
we can hurry back.

1108
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:22,500
It's okay.

1109
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,050
No matter what time I go back,
I'll get in trouble anyway.

1110
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:27,670
Or maybe

1111
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:30,800
you and Mr. Artit are in love
but you're fighting.

1112
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,920
Am I causing you problems?

1113
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,250
Uhh...

1114
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:38,460
Artit and I will never be
in a relationship.

1115
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:39,920
Don't worry.

1116
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,880
Then if you're available,

1117
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,090
I still have a chance.

1118
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:52,210
Are you going to flirt with me?

1119
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,210
I don't want to be alone anymore.

1120
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:03,050
I want to have someone as well.

1121
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:10,670
I don't think it's difficult
for a handsome guy like you.

1122
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,750
Then I hope

1123
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:19,250
when I find that person,

1124
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,800
she won't refuse me

1125
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:24,550
like you said.

1126
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:33,710
I'll hurry up and drop you off.

1127
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:35,500
So you won't get in trouble.

1128
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:37,960
Okay.

1129
01:26:51,090 --> 01:26:52,960
- You can drop me off here.
- Okay.

1130
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,460
Paeng,

1131
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:03,000
you seem to really care about him.

1132
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:07,170
I just don't want any problems.

1133
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,800
You don't know the bottom of it.

1134
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:17,340
If there's anything,
you can call me anytime.

1135
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:19,460
I'll drive over
to pick you up right away.

1136
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:21,800
It's nothing.

1137
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:23,420
I'm saying it just in case.

1138
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,880
Thank you.

1139
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,840
- I'll see you later.
- Okay. See you later.

1140
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:48,550
Hold on.

1141
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:51,800
Are you so happy?

1142
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:56,000
The happiest in many months.

1143
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:59,550
Why did you hurry back?

1144
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,750
I have to be reserved
on the first date.

1145
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:05,840
I'll come back late on the second.

1146
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:13,170
He's your type? You like him?

1147
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,420
That's right.

1148
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,500
Very much.

1149
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,300
He's exactly my type.

1150
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:01,670
You had my background checked

1151
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,800
so naturally I had to
check yours too.

1152
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:05,920
You're embracing me like this.

1153
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:07,750
You're turning me on.

1154
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:10,880
I just want to
assault you right now.

1155
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:13,630
You haven't seen each other at all?

1156
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,090
I'm working

1157
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:16,420
at a mine nearby.

1158
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,300
You little!

1159
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:23,630
Don't be afraid.
You're safe with me.

1160
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:27,960
He came out of the blue to help

1161
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:29,300
so we didn't have a choice.

1162
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:32,090
Artit, you asked for it.

1163
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,590
Do you want me to
leave you here? No way.

1164
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,000
We have to get through this
together.
