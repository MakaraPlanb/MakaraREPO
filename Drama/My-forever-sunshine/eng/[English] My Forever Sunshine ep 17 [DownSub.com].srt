1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,090
I'm happy to wait
until you're ready.

3
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,240
Artit! Artit!

4
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,639
You have no right to do this to her.

5
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,879
Who has the right then?

6
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,759
Paeng wants to reopen

7
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,240
her mom's murder case.

8
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,439
Aunt Pimnapa
didn't die in a car crash?

9
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,400
I want to take care
of your daughter,

10
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,080
but she never thinks of me.

11
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,520
Mark?

12
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,159
The prime suspect in the
murder of Pimnapa was her husband.

13
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,199
That's not true. I don't believe it.

14
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,800
If someone accused Uncle,

15
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,280
would you just accept it?

16
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,639
I told you to leave her alone.

17
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm the one who asked him to come.

18
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,599
Are you only going to talk
about your own matters?

19
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Are you done talking? So we can go.

20
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,479
I have to go now.

21
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,599
You stuck your nose
where it didn't belong.

22
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,960
Wha's up, Non?

23
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,240
Have you found Paeng?

24
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,959
I have.

25
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,560
Mark brought her to the condo.

26
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,639
Thanks for sending me the location.

27
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,360
Mark is so sleazy.

28
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,279
He took her there. What would've
happened if you weren't there?

29
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,920
You have to be careful and not let
Paeng go anywhere with him again.

30
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,480
Okay, I'll try.

31
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,759
You can't just try.

32
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,120
You have to let Paeng see
how worried you are.

33
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,050
Okay, okay.

34
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,519
Just "okay"?

35
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,319
When they left together,

36
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,839
You were desperate when you called
me. Your voice was so shaky too.

37
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,439
When are you going to
reconcile with her?

38
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,680
Non,

39
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,959
I can't say much

40
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,639
because you're on speaker, okay?

41
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,959
Oh, really?

42
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,639
I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me?

43
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,839
Hello, Non.

44
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,000
Hello, Paeng.

45
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,959
You two can keep talking to each
other. I won't bother you anymore.

46
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,720
Artit,

47
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,279
don't you have anything
to talk to me about?

48
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,560
I don't.

49
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,800
No matter what I do,
I'm always wrong.

50
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,120
Artit,

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,759
I didn't want to argue with you.

52
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,959
I just

53
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,519
have to do what I have to.

54
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,079
Then can I ask you something?

55
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,759
Why did you go with him?

56
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,920
I can't answer you that.

57
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,600
Paeng,

58
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,600
I don't know if this is an excuse.

59
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,240
But the reason my dad tried to
stop you from opening this up

60
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,199
is because he's
very worried about you.

61
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,040
I know.

62
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,680
I know that Uncle is very worried.

63
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,759
I'm sorry for chastising him.

64
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,319
I didn't mean it.

65
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,040
I'm sorry

66
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,959
that I didn't know how much
you had been through.

67
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,920
I left you

68
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,600
to face this alone.

69
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,399
Paeng,

70
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,680
from now on, whatever
you want to do,

71
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,399
just tell me.

72
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,240
I will fully support you.

73
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,639
Really?

74
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,480
What if it is something you
don't agree with,

75
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,759
are you going to support me?

76
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,439
If it makes you happy,

77
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,319
I'll help you.

78
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,839
Why?

79
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,879
Because you're very important to me.

80
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,399
Can you tell me

81
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,639
what you want to do?

82
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,159
Last night, I couldn't sleep at all.

83
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,330
I kept thinking

84
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,210
about the conversation I had
with the officer all night.

85
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,330
He said

86
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,600
both the physical evidence
and eyewitnesses

87
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,279
indicate that my dad killed my mom.

88
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,919
So?

89
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,090
I want to meet one of the witnesses.

90
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,240
This is all the details that were
recorded that day.

91
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,399
Please have a look.

92
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,720
Is anyone home?

93
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,399
Hello.

94
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,210
Is anyone home?

95
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,090
Who are you looking for?

96
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,399
Hello.

97
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,559
- Hello.
- Hello.

98
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm here to see someone
named Sudjai.

99
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,330
Oh, that's me.

100
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,639
You used to work at a hotel
in Thong Lor, right?

101
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,840
What's the matter?

102
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,480
There was a murder case
and you were one of the witnesses.

103
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,960
Do you remember that?

104
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,279
Why are you asking me this?
It's all in the past.

105
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,759
I can't remember anything anymore.

106
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,360
I'm the daughter of the deceased.

107
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,279
And the person you testified
against was my dad.

108
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,879
I think that you
misunderstood something.

109
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,879
I didn't.

110
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,450
I already told the truth.

111
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,519
Please don't ask me anymore.
I can't remember anything.

112
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,960
Please help me.

113
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,519
Move! You're in the way!

114
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,600
Please go.

115
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,240
Ma'am, we come in peace.

116
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,240
- You can go now.
- Ma'am.

117
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,240
Just go.

118
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,759
Paeng.

119
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,720
Yes?

120
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,279
What's wrong?

121
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,360
Nothing.

122
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,440
We should go.

123
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,679
Come on.

124
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,600
We're here.

125
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,279
You've been silent the whole trip.

126
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,720
What are you thinking about?

127
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,039
Artit,

128
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,679
when we're at the house.

129
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,919
I...

130
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,039
I saw...

131
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,240
You saw what?

132
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,320
I saw Mark.

133
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,919
He followed us?

134
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,240
Is he insane?

135
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,519
Artit,

136
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,679
how does he know where we are
and what we're doing?

137
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,960
He might be watching you.

138
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,519
And

139
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,759
is he going to follow us everywhere?

140
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,600
Are you scared?

141
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,039
Who is it?

142
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,039
It's me.

143
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,639
I thought you returned to the hotel.

144
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,759
Why did you come back here?

145
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,960
Do you want me to keep you company?

146
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,519
I can sleep on the sofa.

147
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,639
Stop thinking about it.

148
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,759
You have to get some rest.

149
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,039
Do you want to take a shower?

150
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,320
You can shower first.

151
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,279
Go.

152
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,279
Do you have any sugar left?

153
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,720
It's so strange. We bumped into each
other two days in a row now.

154
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,679
From that mountain

155
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,279
to this one.

156
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,639
That's true.

157
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,960
There's a guy at the rose garden.
He's handsome.

158
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,120
Mark, why are you here?

159
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,960
I followed you from the festival.

160
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,480
Mark?

161
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,159
Mark, I'm here to meet a client.

162
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,639
Your client

163
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,320
is me.

164
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,000
It looks like a tattoo.

165
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,919
I've seen it on someone.

166
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,840
Please help me.

167
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,399
Move! You're in the way!

168
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,559
Artit!

169
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,759
Paeng, what's wrong?

170
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,559
Paeng?

171
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,399
Paeng,

172
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,919
what are you afraid of? Tell me.

173
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,279
Let me know

174
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,879
what you're afraid of.

175
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,039
I think

176
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,680
there's someone else involved
in my mom's case.

177
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,599
Who?

178
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
How are they involved?

179
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,650
I might be misunderstanding things.

180
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,359
I don't want to accuse anyone.

181
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,890
If that's what you believe, then we
have to find a way to prove it.

182
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,519
That's right. I have to.

183
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,839
Then tell me.

184
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,720
We’re going
to figure this out together.

185
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,720
I told you

186
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,720
I will fully support you.

187
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,720
Let me be a little certain first.

188
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,799
How are you going to do that?

189
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,720
Paeng.

190
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,410
Paeng, I'm sorry.

191
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,519
You must be so stressed.

192
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,519
I think

193
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,599
you should get some sleep.

194
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,599
Paeng,

195
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,480
I know this is a big deal.

196
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,319
But not sleeping and
thinking without any leads,

197
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,279
you're going to get sick

198
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,200
before you find out the truth.

199
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,410
Artit,

200
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,279
if we're scared of something,

201
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,079
we have to confront it, don't we?

202
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,960
That's right.

203
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,920
But that thing can't pose
any harm to you.

204
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,359
Go to sleep.

205
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,759
We can figure out what to do
next tomorrow.

206
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,759
That's enough.

207
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,170
You can stop thinking now.

208
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,960
Artit.

209
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,599
Hmm?

210
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,319
Can you hold my hand
while we sleep tonight?

211
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,319
Of course.

212
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,650
I'll hold your hand

213
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,960
for the whole night. I won't let go.

214
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,920
You can sleep now.

215
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,519
I promise

216
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,960
that I won't let go until morning.

217
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,650
You can go ahead and sleep.

218
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,480
I want to watch you sleep.

219
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,440
If I shouldn't blame her,
then who should I blame?

220
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,599
She's the reason
why Artit almost died twice.

221
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,039
I won't let you get into
trouble anymore.

222
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,319
I promise.

223
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,200
Artit,

224
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,200
if we're scared of something,

225
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,599
we have to confront it, don't we?

226
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,039
I think

227
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,960
there's someone else involved
in my mom's case.

228
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,400
If that's what you believe,

229
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,119
then we have to find a way
to prove it.

230
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,599
That's right. I have to.

231
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,440
I saw...

232
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,920
You saw what?

233
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,680
I saw Mark.

234
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,400
He followed you?

235
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,720
Mark!

236
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,279
What's up, Paeng?

237
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,920
Are you at your condo?

238
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm about to go over.
I'd like to talk to you.

239
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:40,960
What time will you be there?

240
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm on the way.

241
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,960
I'm out right now.

242
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,839
But I can come back to see you.

243
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,319
Am I bothering you?

244
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,519
I'm sorry for not telling you first.

245
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:57,880
I have something on my mind.
So I'm in a rush.

246
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,400
You're not bothering me.

247
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,480
I always have time for you.

248
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,279
How long will you be

249
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,960
before you're back at the condo?

250
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,759
About an hour.

251
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,640
I'll see you then.

252
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:16,200
If I arrived first, can I wait
for you in your room?

253
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,200
Well, I didn't tell Artit
that I was coming.

254
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,880
So I don't want to wait
at the lobby.

255
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,960
If he follows me here,

256
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,839
we won't get to talk
to each other again.

257
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,559
But if it's inconvenient for you,

258
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,319
- I'll...
- Of course, you can.

259
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,440
I'll let the front desk know.

260
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,839
Once you've arrived,
you can wait upstairs.

261
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,119
Thank you.

262
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,359
Okay.

263
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,240
Okay. Certainly.

264
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,920
Hello.

265
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,880
- Hello.
- I have a meeting with Mark.

266
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,640
I'd like to wait in his room.

267
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,039
I'm Wanfahmai. Paeng.

268
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,240
Oh, Wanfahmai.

269
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,720
Mark just called.

270
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,559
I'll get the lift for you.

271
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,039
It's on the fourth floor, Room 444.

272
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,440
Please.

273
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,200
Don't do anything crazy, Paeng!

274
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,119
(Paeng)

275
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,039
Why is he here so soon?

276
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,440
- What's the matter?
- Room service.

277
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,480
I didn't order any.

278
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,920
It's Mark's order.

279
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,240
Pick up, Paeng!

280
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,880
(Artit)

281
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,200
Oh, hold on.

282
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,680
Yes?

283
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,960
I forgot the covers.

284
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,440
- Here you are.
- Thank you very much.

285
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,880
It really is you.

286
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,759
Why don't you ask me nicely
what you want to know?

287
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,079
I know that you're still in here.

288
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,759
Just come out. Please?

289
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,480
Do you want to play
hide-and-seek with me?

290
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,809
- Artit!
- Paeng!

291
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,639
Please help me!

292
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,000
Where are you?

293
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,880
I'm in Mark's room.

294
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:06,199
I'm here to find evidence
but I couldn't get out in time.

295
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:08,119
Please come and help me. I'm scared.

296
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,679
Why did you go there alone?

297
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,239
I don't know.

298
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,679
Paeng, it's Mark's condo, right?

299
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,960
Send me the floor and room number.
I'll call the police.

300
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,159
Okay.

301
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,679
Why didn't you tell me that you
like playing hide-and-seek?

302
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,960
Don't you have something
to talk to me about?

303
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,809
I think we should talk outside.

304
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,079
It's uncomfortable in here.

305
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,599
Come on.

306
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,599
Come on, Paeng.

307
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,519
Let's go.

308
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,400
Walk carefully. Don't rush.

309
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,289
Okay. Stop there.

310
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,639
Do you want it back?

311
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:39,440
You have to talk to me first.

312
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,119
Why aren't you saying anything?

313
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,679
I thought you said
you wanted to talk to me.

314
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:52,559
Then I'll start.

315
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,679
Do you know

316
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,519
that I've waited
for the day to have you here

317
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,769
with me for a very long time?

318
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,329
Why?

319
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,679
Because you're important to me.

320
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,920
I've never waited
for anything before,

321
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,159
and definitely never this long.

322
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,329
But you're special.

323
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:25,360
Come on. Have a seat.

324
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:34,639
Calm down.

325
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,719
Here.

326
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,920
Would you like something to drink?

327
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,769
No.

328
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:18,079
Why do you seem so stressed?

329
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,360
I ordered room service

330
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,079
because I was hoping
that we could relax, eat, and chat.

331
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,289
They're all of your favorites.

332
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,719
I'm not hungry.

333
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,599
It's good.

334
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:06,840
Don't worry about the food.

335
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:11,719
Ask me what you want to know.

336
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,809
That tattoo.

337
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:20,400
You know about it now?

338
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:50,480
What did you put in there?

339
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,289
Calm down.

340
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,840
Do you know that
you're too stressed?

341
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,639
You'll feel better if you take
something for your nerves.

342
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,519
Drink it. You'll feel relaxed.

343
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,480
I won't.

344
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,360
But I want you to.

345
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,920
I'm not going to drink it.

346
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,039
Why are you so stubborn?

347
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,239
You're just as stubborn as your mom.

348
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,199
Your eyes are like hers.

349
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,599
They remind me of her.

350
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,599
It's okay if you don't drink it.

351
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,960
I'll drink it myself.

352
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,769
Let's exchange glasses.

353
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,440
Why did you kill my mom?

354
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,039
What are you talking about?

355
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,599
Me? Killed your mom?

356
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,329
If wasn't you, then who did it?

357
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,599
You're assuming things.

358
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,480
I didn't do it.

359
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,360
I remember that tattoo.

360
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:20,809
Why did you kill her?

361
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,719
You used to

362
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,440
mess around with my mom.

363
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,360
I'm not going to deny that.

364
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,360
Because your mom

365
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,769
was very charming.

366
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:48,039
And I really loved her.

367
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,809
But now,

368
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,679
I've given all the love I have

369
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:55,960
to you.

370
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,480
It must be destiny
that brought us together.

371
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,079
From now on,

372
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,079
I promise

373
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,289
that I'll take care of you.

374
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:24,000
Don't touch me.

375
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:28,400
Why not?

376
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:31,769
Didn't you have feelings for me?

377
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:35,519
I've done everything for you.
What else do you want?

378
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,840
Why are you talking to me like that?

379
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,559
Tell me the truth.

380
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,559
Why did you kill my mother?

381
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,119
You want me to say it?

382
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,880
Do you think I'm stupid?

383
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,000
Hmm?

384
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,199
You're going to make me talk

385
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,199
and then hand over the recording
to the police.

386
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,199
Do you really want to know?

387
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,519
That's right.

388
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,760
I'm the one who killed your mom.

389
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,519
I killed Pimnapa.

390
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,320
But I didn't plan to.

391
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,239
But do you know why?

392
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,840
Because she broke up with me.

393
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:22,599
She told me

394
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,239
she felt guilty about
her husband and daughter.

395
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:29,159
But she never felt any guilt
towards me.

396
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:33,159
Even though I was faithful

397
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:36,079
and was so nice to her.

398
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,239
But she didn't love me
like I loved her.

399
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,519
She didn't want me
like I wanted her.

400
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,199
She was going to leave me,

401
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,519
so I...

402
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:18,119
Enough!

403
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,840
Why?

404
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,880
You wanted to know how I killed her,

405
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,280
so I'm explaining it in detail so
that you'll be able to imagine it.

406
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,280
You killed her

407
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:38,760
just because she was leaving you.

408
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:49,719
Just because she was leaving?

409
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,559
Do you know

410
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,760
how it feels to be abandoned?

411
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,159
It hurts more than death.

412
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,400
I've been abandoned too many times.

413
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:09,360
It will never happen again.

414
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,119
It won't happen to me ever again.

415
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,360
You have to tell me.

416
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:20,119
Tell me and make me feel happy.

417
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:21,760
Tell me that

418
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,840
you won't leave me.

419
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:28,400
Say. Say it.

420
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:29,920
Why does it have to be me?

421
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:39,440
Because

422
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,679
you're Pimnapa's daughter.

423
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,199
You're her daughter.

424
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,719
You live a similar life.

425
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,320
You're an orphan like me.

426
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,519
So I'm the one
who understands you the most.

427
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,519
I want to take care of you
and protect you.

428
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,239
Okay?

429
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:10,719
I don't need a psycho
like you taking care of me.

430
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:23,599
Don't come any closer.

431
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,559
What can you do
with a knife that small?

432
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,199
You wanted me to tell you so
I did. What else do you want?

433
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,440
Psycho!

434
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,639
If you come any closer, it won't
just graze you this time.

435
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,320
You're so stubborn.

436
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,159
You and your mom
are so hard to understand.

437
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,639
Come here.

438
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:03,679
I didn't even want to hurt you.

439
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,519
But you forced me to.

440
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:09,679
Huh?

441
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,239
Let me go!

442
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:24,639
A card?

443
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,559
Miss, can I have

444
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,199
the keycard to the lift?

445
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,480
Who are you here to see?

446
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,840
I need to get upstairs
to Mark's room.

447
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,239
I have to call him first.
Just a moment, please.

448
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,440
That's okay.

449
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:44,199
- Just give me the keycard.
- I can't do that.

450
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,679
I need the owner's permission.
It's protocol.

451
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,079
Don't come any closer!

452
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,559
Don't be afraid, Paeng.

453
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:00,920
I'll try my best to be gentle.

454
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,199
He's about to kill my girlfriend!
What are you going to do?

455
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,760
The police are coming.

456
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:11,559
If you don't let me go upstairs,
you'll be arrested for conspiring.

457
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,719
- This way.
- Room 444.

458
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,079
Ouch!

459
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:41,280
Paeng!

460
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:43,599
Paeng!

461
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,440
Mister, I'll get it.

462
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,960
Paeng! Don't!

463
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,519
Paeng! Stop!

464
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
Let me go! I'm going to kill him!

465
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,639
He killed my mom!

466
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,480
Paeng!

467
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,639
Calm down!

468
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,840
Paeng!

469
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:11,400
You're always butting in!
What on earth is wrong with you?

470
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,360
Don't!

471
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,519
Paeng, run.

472
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:40,239
I said run!

473
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:43,760
No.

474
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:47,000
- Don't do this.
- It's you who shouldn't do this.

475
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:53,800
I've been so nice to you.

476
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,280
But in the end, you chose him.

477
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,800
You're as vile as your mom.

478
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,239
You have no right to
insult my mother.

479
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:03,760
It's you who's vile.

480
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:05,519
Do you want to die
with that mouth of yours?

481
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,119
Stop! Drop the gun!

482
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,920
Go!

483
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,360
Restrain him!

484
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,480
- Get off!
- Stay still!

485
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,440
Let go!

486
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,880
Stay still!

487
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:25,159
He lured her over to rape her.

488
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,679
This is my room.

489
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,840
I didn't lure anyone to do anything.

490
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:30,119
It's him

491
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:32,639
who barged in here and hurt me.

492
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,559
You're lying. He's here to save me.

493
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:39,840
All of you will need to go to
the station to give a statement.

494
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,039
So annoying.

495
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:47,280
- Go!
- Busybodies.

496
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,079
Please.

497
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,880
Wait.

498
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:53,880
I have to get my stuff.

499
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,360
I'd like to charge him with false
imprisonment and attempted rape.

500
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,559
Hey,

501
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:10,159
don't accuse me
if you don't have any evidence.

502
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:11,880
If you're going to charge me,

503
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:13,239
I'm going to charge you back.

504
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:14,800
Officer,

505
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,400
breaking and entering.
Look, she hurt me.

506
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:21,760
And she brought this guy
to beat me up too.

507
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,760
It was only self-defense.

508
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,199
You're such a scumbag.

509
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,559
I can sue you
in front of the officer.

510
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:32,400
Please calm down.

511
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,079
I'd like to know right from
the beginning. Who'd like to start?

512
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,320
I'm going to wait for my lawyer.

513
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:42,079
I'll start.

514
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,400
Please.

515
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,599
Artit! Artit! Artit!

516
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,199
Artit! I'm sorry!

517
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:57,719
Why did you do that?

518
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:00,159
Do you know how much
I'm worried about you?

519
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,760
I told you that I'm going
fully support you.

520
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,280
Why did you risk yourself?

521
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,079
I...

522
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,079
I didn't want to get you
into trouble.

523
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:16,000
And have you ever thought

524
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,280
how I would feel if something
happened to you?

525
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,960
How would I feel?

526
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,239
I'm sorry, Artit.

527
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,679
I won't do anything like this again.

528
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:34,119
Paeng,

529
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,840
Why would you do that?

530
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,559
Why did you go and see him?

531
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,719
I wanted to look for evidence.

532
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,920
What evidence?

533
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:51,960
Evidence that he murdered my mom.

534
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,840
Is that true?

535
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,440
Mark?

536
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:07,480
You got in a fight already? You've
only been gone a short time.

537
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,440
Who would want to be in a fight?

538
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:12,039
If I didn't call you,

539
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,920
I wouldn't have known
what you've been through?

540
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,400
Next time, call us.

541
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,800
So we'll know where you're
being beaten to death.

542
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,000
Right.

543
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:23,039
Paeng, don't listen to him.

544
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,320
Oh, I wasn't blaming you, Paeng.

545
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,960
It's just friendly banter.

546
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,599
Have you eaten anything?

547
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,519
I have.

548
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,920
Mark is so evil.

549
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,800
He's been arrested, right?

550
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,440
He made bail.

551
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:45,960
Can't we charge him at all?

552
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:48,159
We have to go to court.

553
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,400
He's very cunning.

554
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,519
It won't be easy to go after him.

555
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:56,440
This is what Paeng and I
are concerned about.

556
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,920
Artit, I'm not sick.

557
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,960
You look depressed.

558
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,000
I'm afraid you might get sick.

559
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,480
I'm just exhausted.

560
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,320
After what you've been through,

561
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,360
I'd be scared
if you still had energy.

562
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,840
You're still in the mood to joke.

563
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,639
Nothing good is going to come out
of being stressed.

564
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:21,440
You always get hurt because of me.

565
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:29,960
This is nothing.

566
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:32,360
Don't worry about me.

567
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,159
Let's sleep here tonight.

568
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:47,599
Why aren't you bringing me home?

569
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:51,960
It's late. You can go tomorrow.

570
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:57,519
I know that you're still in shock.

571
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,480
Thank you very much.

572
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:10,920
If you hadn't saved me in time,

573
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:14,960
I might have ended up becoming
a murderer.

574
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:19,400
Or if I couldn't fight him,

575
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,440
I would have...

576
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:28,159
I don't want to be so weak.

577
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,360
You don't have to be
tough all the time.

578
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,440
Be vulnerable sometimes
so that I can take care of you.

579
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:42,880
It's time to sleep now.

580
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:09,119
I know that you won't
be able to sleep.

581
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:13,079
I don't want you to think too much.

582
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:16,320
I'll watch over you.

583
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:39,159
I'll let you be paranoid about me

584
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,400
rather than being scared
of something else, okay?

585
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,840
I won't be paranoid of you.

586
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,559
I know you're a gentleman.

587
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,119
And I'll feel safe and warm

588
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:57,159
to be close to you.

589
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,519
You can't trust me.

590
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,239
Because

591
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,960
I can't even trust myself.

592
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,159
I'm kidding.

593
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,639
It makes me happy to see you smile.

594
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,039
Go to sleep.

595
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,639
I'll be right here
to watch over you.

596
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:09,239
Are you up now?

597
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,519
Someone woke me up.

598
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,880
Did you sleep well?

599
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:19,239
I did.

600
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,480
I've made you some food.

601
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:27,480
Let's go see my dad
after we've eaten.

602
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:31,639
Okay.

603
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,079
Dad must be waiting
for you on the balcony.

604
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:01,239
Paeng,

605
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:03,119
what's wrong?

606
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,480
I'm afraid
Auntie will get angry at me.

607
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,679
That's good. So I can talk it over
with her while you're here.

608
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,960
Don't.

609
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:17,440
I'm begging you. Not right now.

610
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:23,599
Paeng, what are you afraid of?

611
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:26,079
We've been through a lot.

612
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:27,920
It's only Mom.

613
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,639
We have to get through it as well.

614
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,559
Mr. Artit is right.

615
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,519
Thongkhum!

616
01:03:38,199 --> 01:03:40,719
- Hello.
- Have you recovered?

617
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,559
I'm fine now.

618
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,119
I really have to thank you
for not standing around

619
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:48,159
and letting me die.

620
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,280
Who'd do that?

621
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,360
How could I let
anything happen to you?

622
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:55,760
You're too kind.

623
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:59,440
Even though I was so mean to you.

624
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,559
I really

625
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,840
have to apologize to you.

626
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,639
Please forgive me.

627
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,480
Thongkhum, don't do this again
Because you're much older than me.

628
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:13,360
I don't know how to pay you back.

629
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,360
So I'd like to show you

630
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,400
how grateful I am to you.

631
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:20,760
Whatever you need me to do,

632
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,400
you can tell me right away.

633
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,079
I'd like to repay you
for what you did.

634
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,119
Then I'd like some of
your delicious food. That's all.

635
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,760
Roger that!

636
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:37,599
I'll get to that right away.

637
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:40,559
And you can eat with Mr. Artit.

638
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:43,039
I'll go to the market now.

639
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,679
Duang, come on.
Let's go to the market.

640
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,199
See?

641
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,800
Even Thongkhum loves you.

642
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,360
Soon, my Mom will love you too.

643
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,360
You found the murderer?

644
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:10,679
That's right, Uncle.

645
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:14,000
I wasn't expecting that he'd
be someone close to me.

646
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:18,679
What is this?

647
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,199
Did I misunderstand
everything all along?

648
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,519
At the time,
I believed all the evidence

649
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:33,199
to the point that I accepted
Tharathep was the culprit.

650
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,559
Why?

651
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,000
Why didn't I trust my friend?

652
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:45,960
Even though I knew
how decent of a person he was.

653
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,960
I'm so sorry for not believing him.

654
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,119
I understand.

655
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,280
Anyone would've misunderstood.

656
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,039
What if

657
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,000
you didn't try
to find out the truth?

658
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:09,599
It would never have been revealed.

659
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,280
I told Artit to try and stop you

660
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,280
from looking into this.

661
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,960
She understands
that you meant well, Dad.

662
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,679
That's right, Uncle.

663
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,039
Please don't overthink it.

664
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:30,159
I understand everything
you've done for me.

665
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,400
Why did I let my best friend

666
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,400
become the prime suspect?

667
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,039
Uncle, don't blame yourself.

668
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,000
I actually have to thank you.

669
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,360
Even though you believed that

670
01:06:58,039 --> 01:07:01,199
you still loved me
and showed me mercy.

671
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:03,239
You've always wanted
the best for me.

672
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:08,360
That means that deep down,
you knew my dad's a good person.

673
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,119
That's right.

674
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:15,880
I've always known it.

675
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,679
Your dad was a very good man.

676
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,760
And I owe a lot to him.

677
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,400
Uncle, don't speak
of the past anymore.

678
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,079
Okay.

679
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:40,079
And what are we going to do next?

680
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,880
We have to go through
the legal process.

681
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,079
We have to sue him for what
happened first.

682
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,199
And for Aunt Pimnapa's case,

683
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,480
evidence needs to be
collected first.

684
01:07:57,679 --> 01:07:59,800
I want to apologize to your dad.

685
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,760
I should find some time
to go to the temple

686
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,800
and make merit for your parents.

687
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,239
You can come with me.

688
01:08:12,519 --> 01:08:15,440
I intend to make merit for them too.

689
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,840
Hold on.

690
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:20,159
How can it be just the two of you?

691
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,479
Can I come along?

692
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,319
Very well.

693
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:25,529
Shall we go tomorrow?

694
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:27,399
Good idea.

695
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:38,569
Am I even visible?

696
01:08:39,609 --> 01:08:41,649
No one here seems to see me.

697
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:44,319
You all probably think
that I'm invisible.

698
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,800
Tubtim!

699
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,800
It's okay.

700
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,680
I'll go and explain it to her.

701
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,399
Tubtim.

702
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,529
Can you see me?

703
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,439
There are so many things

704
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:27,319
that I haven't told you about Paeng.

705
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,319
If I tell you everything

706
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,720
and you still hate her,

707
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:41,920
I won't complain anymore.

708
01:09:47,569 --> 01:09:48,649
Back then,

709
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:53,159
Tharathep and Pimnapa

710
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,319
didn't die in a car accident.

711
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,239
What?

712
01:10:05,529 --> 01:10:07,159
I found Paeng

713
01:10:07,649 --> 01:10:09,279
when she was in shock.

714
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,680
She had just found her dad's body.

715
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:14,199
He had just killed himself.

716
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:15,529
Oh.

717
01:10:16,529 --> 01:10:17,960
And what's worse,

718
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:21,960
the police called me to say that
they had found Pimanapa's body.

719
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,159
She was murdered
around the same time.

720
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:32,649
She was murdered
around the same time.

721
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,279
She was so traumatized
about her parents

722
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:39,960
that she ended up in the hospital.

723
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,319
When I was taking care
of her at the hospital,

724
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,359
her mental condition
deteriorated so much.

725
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,319
She had to remain
under the doctor's supervision.

726
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,680
Before she was able
to overcome the ordeal,

727
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:00,359
it was a very difficult time for her

728
01:11:05,649 --> 01:11:07,000
It's my fault

729
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,880
for bringing her here
without telling you and Artit

730
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:14,569
about the problems
that she was going through.

731
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:16,609
That's why she became

732
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:18,760
a troubled

733
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,000
and disobedient girl.

734
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,720
Because she thought
no one understood her.

735
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,920
Oh, dear.

736
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,319
A girl lost both her parents
at the same time.

737
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:37,680
And then she found out
that her mother was murdered.

738
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,119
It must have been such a shock.

739
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:45,039
And I was mean to her.

740
01:11:58,039 --> 01:11:59,479
It's not your fault
that you didn't know.

741
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:05,119
I didn't tell you the truth either.

742
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:09,880
I thought it her problem
to go through.

743
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,479
But I was wrong.

744
01:12:16,609 --> 01:12:19,680
When we don't know
about a child's problem,

745
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:22,199
we might misunderstand them

746
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,199
and think that they're a bad person.

747
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,359
Instead of looking after
her carefully,

748
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,399
we rubbed salt on her wounds.

749
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,529
We perceived her
as a disobedient girl.

750
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:36,119
So instead of getting better,

751
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,279
everything became worse.

752
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,569
Help! Anyone!

753
01:12:45,649 --> 01:12:47,239
- Let me go!
- Paeng!

754
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,079
I'm not going!

755
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:51,529
Mom!

756
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,239
You want this?

757
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:01,359
Stop! Stop right now!

758
01:13:01,569 --> 01:13:03,880
Who taught you to be so rude?

759
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,720
There probably wasn't anyone.

760
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,720
Because her parents are
dead already!

761
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:10,649
- Oh, my!
- You want another?

762
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,800
I didn't know that
she has been through so much.

763
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:19,039
Otherwise, I would've
understood her more.

764
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,960
Then,

765
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,960
please don't stay angry
with her for what's happened.

766
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,199
Come on. Do you think I'm that mean?

767
01:13:32,529 --> 01:13:34,920
I know that my wife
has a kind heart.

768
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:40,569
Tomorrow,

769
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,479
I'm bringing Paeng to make merit
for Tharathep and Pimnapa.

770
01:13:45,609 --> 01:13:46,680
Would you like to come?

771
01:13:57,359 --> 01:13:59,800
Back then, Tharathep and Pimnapa

772
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,439
didn't die in a car accident.

773
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,119
And what's worse,

774
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:07,479
the police called me to say that
they had found Pimanapa's body.

775
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,239
She was murdered
around the same time.

776
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:14,680
I now know

777
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:16,760
that she has someone she likes

778
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,840
and he's not Artit.

779
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,880
Who does she like?

780
01:14:21,529 --> 01:14:22,800
It's Artit's friend.

781
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,439
Non?

782
01:14:24,649 --> 01:14:26,880
But she came with a guy. Who is he?

783
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:29,880
I met him in the North.
She must've invited him.

784
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:31,960
I want you to give her a chance.

785
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:33,529
I'll never forgive her.

786
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,960
Even though she's the woman I love?

787
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:39,159
I love Paeng, Mom.

788
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,760
(Mrs. Pimnapa Wararit)

789
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:04,760
Mom, Dad.

790
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,960
I've found the murderer
who killed Mom.

791
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,880
I'm going to make him pay

792
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:16,649
for the sins he committed.

793
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:30,359
I'm sorry.

794
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,479
Please forgive me
for misunderstanding you.

795
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:44,159
Please don't worry.

796
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,920
I'll do my best
to take care of Paeng.

797
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,119
You can head inside.

798
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,649
I'll give Paeng a lift.

799
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,239
Artit,

800
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,159
I'd like to have a word with Paeng.

801
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:46,840
Then let Saeb give Paeng a lift.

802
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:48,800
Let's get back to work.

803
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:51,649
- Hmm?
- Okay.

804
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,880
Let's go.

805
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:01,609
It won't take long.

806
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,159
I'm sorry.

807
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:09,720
I didn't know
what you had been through.

808
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:12,609
Please don't be angry with me.

809
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:15,569
That's okay, Auntie.

810
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,609
I was never angry with you.

811
01:17:18,279 --> 01:17:19,720
I really feel sorry for you

812
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:22,529
for having to go through
all of those things.

813
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,960
But you were very strong
and resilient

814
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:26,800
for being able to get through it.

815
01:17:27,649 --> 01:17:28,960
It's very admirable of you.

816
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:31,479
I'm not strong at all.

817
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:34,920
That's why I acted up
like that when I was young.

818
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:39,079
It's me who should apologize to you.

819
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:41,359
I'm sorry.

820
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:44,569
Um...

821
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:47,239
You've apologized to me many times.

822
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:49,159
This time

823
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:51,279
I forgive you.

824
01:17:52,609 --> 01:17:56,079
Let's leave everything
between us in the past.

825
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:01,039
But

826
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:05,569
I'm still worried
about you and Artit.

827
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,399
I know that Artit loves you.

828
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,079
He told me.

829
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:17,039
But I'm still worried.

830
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:22,569
I think

831
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,359
that you pose a danger to him.

832
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,800
Whenever he's in trouble,
the reason is always you.

833
01:18:35,239 --> 01:18:37,920
I'm scared. I'm very scared.

834
01:18:39,319 --> 01:18:42,800
I still can't change my thoughts
and feelings about this.

835
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:46,399
Please don't say
that I'm superstitious.

836
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,960
But I'm very scared.

837
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:51,649
Do you understand me?

838
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,359
I do.

839
01:18:57,319 --> 01:18:58,399
Uh...

840
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:00,800
I don't object

841
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:03,760
to accepting you as my niece

842
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,840
or a close relative.

843
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,960
But as for a daughter-in-law...

844
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:12,359
I understand, Auntie.

845
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,760
Then,

846
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:18,760
can you promise me

847
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,800
that there's not going to be
anything between you and Artit,

848
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:24,960
other than being siblings?

849
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,279
I know you well.

850
01:19:35,569 --> 01:19:36,840
If you give your word,

851
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,479
you always keep it.

852
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,000
Well,

853
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:46,479
if it makes you happy,

854
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:49,569
then I promise.

855
01:19:52,569 --> 01:19:54,479
Thank you very much
for understanding me.

856
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,800
But I'm asking you

857
01:19:57,649 --> 01:19:59,439
to keep this between us.

858
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:01,399
Don't let Artit know.

859
01:20:05,319 --> 01:20:06,399
Okay, Auntie.

860
01:20:24,439 --> 01:20:25,920
can you promise me

861
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:28,920
that there's not going to be
anything between you and Artit,

862
01:20:29,529 --> 01:20:32,119
other than being siblings?

863
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:18,319
Are Non and Ling really
getting married?

864
01:21:19,569 --> 01:21:21,039
Why are you making that face?

865
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:22,439
Don't you believe me?

866
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,569
No, it's unbelievable.

867
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,439
Are you really going
to marry my brother?

868
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:32,840
You're not helping and
you're trying to be a killjoy too?

869
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:35,680
I'm joking.

870
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,399
Ling, you're so lucky

871
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:42,609
to have found a nice guy like him.

872
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,000
It's a happy ending.

873
01:21:46,279 --> 01:21:49,039
I'm very happy that
my daughter-in-law will be you.

874
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,880
Unlike the previous women
in his life.

875
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,000
Oh, Mom.

876
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,529
What were the other women like?

877
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,880
His type

878
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,960
is fair, plump, and curvy.

879
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,880
Dad,

880
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,479
you've ruined my reputation.

881
01:22:09,569 --> 01:22:10,649
Ling,

882
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:13,569
you know I've never laid eyes
on anyone but you.

883
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:15,479
I can vouch for that.

884
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:19,760
I'm sorry. I was only joking.

885
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,609
Have you found an auspicious date?

886
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:27,159
I was going to ask you for help.

887
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,239
Of course. I'll handle it.

888
01:22:30,649 --> 01:22:32,279
Let's do it soon.

889
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,399
Hopefully, it will be this year.

890
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,609
Why does it have to be this year?

891
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:41,079
So that I might get a grandkid
next year.

892
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:48,569
Do you really have
what it takes, Non?

893
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,960
What's wrong with him?

894
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:08,880
Are you going
to celebrate joy or grief?

895
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:12,680
You're getting married but you look
like you're drinking the pain away.

896
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,039
That's right. You look like
someone who's about to die.

897
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:19,609
Don't say that you're afraid of
getting married all of a sudden.

898
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:22,439
I'm not afraid of getting married.

899
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,880
I'm afraid of not being
able to do so.

900
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:27,439
Huh? How come?

901
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,359
You proposed to her.

902
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,079
Everything's ready to go.

903
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,609
My mom told me to cancel.

904
01:23:36,039 --> 01:23:37,119
- Huh?
- Huh?

905
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,920
- What happened?
- Right. What happened?

906
01:23:41,239 --> 01:23:43,359
When did this happen?

907
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:47,359
This afternoon, I took Ling
to meet my parents.

908
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:51,479
And? What's next?

909
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,920
Just tell us.

910
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:56,529
I think we should get on
with the wedding.

911
01:23:57,039 --> 01:23:59,359
So that we'll get to see
our grandkids soon.

912
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:03,159
What's wrong, Ling?

913
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,920
Why are you so pale?

914
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,840
Well...

915
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,880
I have something
important to tell you.

916
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,649
I can't have children.

917
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,529
I'm really sorry for not
telling you this initially,

918
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:31,359
and for disappointing everyone.

919
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:35,439
Why are you apologizing?

920
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:37,760
It's okay if you
can't have children.

921
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:40,319
But it's not okay for me.

922
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:47,399
I'm sorry for being frank.

923
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:50,199
I only have one son.

924
01:24:50,609 --> 01:24:52,479
I hope that he will bear children

925
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:55,239
to continue our bloodline.

926
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,359
But if it's like this,

927
01:24:58,399 --> 01:24:59,479
I'm...

928
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,319
I understand.

929
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:05,960
It's my fault.

930
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,039
Ling.

931
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:12,960
I understand everything.

932
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:15,569
You don't have to be worried.

933
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,960
Thank you for
understanding us so easily.

934
01:25:30,609 --> 01:25:31,680
Ling.

935
01:25:38,119 --> 01:25:39,399
I'm sorry

936
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:42,039
for not telling you about this.

937
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,840
I was being selfish.

938
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,960
I was afraid that if you knew,

939
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,800
I would lose you.

940
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:56,680
Ling,

941
01:25:58,649 --> 01:26:00,119
we've been through a lot together

942
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:02,609
and you still don't know me?

943
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,680
The only thing I want

944
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,039
is to marry you

945
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:11,479
and build a family with you.

946
01:26:12,279 --> 01:26:13,840
I don't want any children.

947
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:16,720
If it means that I have to lose you,

948
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,039
I'd rather not have any.

949
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:40,239
Thank you for loving me so much.

950
01:26:42,649 --> 01:26:44,079
But marriage

951
01:26:44,529 --> 01:26:46,569
isn't up to two people.

952
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,960
It also depends on your family.

953
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,529
If your family doesn't accept me,

954
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,880
then we can't love
each other anymore.

955
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,079
Of course we can.

956
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,760
I'll talk to my mom.

957
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:09,479
I'm only asking you for one thing.

958
01:27:10,569 --> 01:27:12,609
I want you to believe in me

959
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:17,000
so that we'll be able to
get married.

960
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:20,399
Please wait for me.

961
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:49,439
Did you bring a guard dog today?

962
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,520
You're the one who's the dog.

963
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,239
Because you like to bite people
behind their backs.

964
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,199
I have evidence.

965
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:56,640
I'd like to play an audio recording

966
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,399
which serves as physical evidence
in this case.

967
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:00,239
You organized a meeting
with the defendant

968
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:01,960
and you used this knife

969
01:28:02,199 --> 01:28:04,960
to hurt him, is that correct?

970
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:06,479
That's right.

971
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,880
I deny the accusations.

972
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:11,079
You won't get away with this, Mark.

973
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:13,479
You're as vile as your mother.

974
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,600
Once I've finished up my work,

975
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,199
I'd like to get out of here.

976
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:18,399
Don't go, Paeng.

977
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,159
No matter what reasons you have.

978
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,000
I've made my decision.

979
01:28:24,279 --> 01:28:25,359
Hold me tight.

980
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:27,079
Don't prank me, okay?

981
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:28,640
I don't know

982
01:28:29,239 --> 01:28:32,079
what to do to make you stay either.
