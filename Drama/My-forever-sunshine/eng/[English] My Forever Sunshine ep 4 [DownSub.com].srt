1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,210
Dad?

3
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,919
The only one I love

4
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,169
is you.

5
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,169
Artit is mine.

6
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,669
Stay away from Artit.

7
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,500
Paeng!

8
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,500
I'm crazy and I can be even crazier
than this.

9
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,590
Stop right now!

10
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,129
I'm not going!

11
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,000
I decided to let Artit
get engaged to Paeng

12
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,460
not because of the debt.

13
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,250
I will never marry her.

14
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,590
You have to be mine and only mine!

15
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,000
Get away!

16
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,669
Artit!

17
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,500
Artit!

18
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,590
Thongkhum, leave us.

19
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,919
Yes, ma'am.

20
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,879
- Paeng...
- If you're saying I'm in the wrong,

21
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,250
I refuse to apologize.

22
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,879
She came at me first

23
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,419
so I had to defend myself.

24
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,879
Self-defense using
this kind of savagery?

25
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,090
I just know that your parents
brought you up to be like this.

26
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,460
Don't you insult my parents!

27
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,710
Why not? You're getting
out of control.

28
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,050
I'm the owner of this house.

29
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,090
Have you forgotten?
It's not your house.

30
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,840
At least be a bit considerate
with whatever you do.

31
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:55,090
It's you who's forgotten.

32
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,550
Didn't Dad pay off your debt for
fifty-two million baht?

33
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,750
I heard Mr. Krongprateep said

34
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,919
that I can even become the owner
of Sunshine Farm.

35
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,840
Because I'm the creditor.

36
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,669
So who's actually
the owner of the house?

37
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,879
- Paeng said so?
- That's right.

38
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:32,209
I think that girl is a lost cause.

39
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,839
I'm very stressed right now.

40
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:35,959
It's good that you
returned to Bangkok.

41
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,589
I think you shouldn't come back
to the farm now

42
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,750
or she'll cause you trouble again.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,589
I'll deal with everything here.

44
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,420
If she starts wreaking havoc again,

45
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm going to send her
to a foster home.

46
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,339
Mom, calm down.

47
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,500
I don't think we should
resort to that.

48
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,589
No one's probably told her
what's right or wrong until now.

49
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,459
Besides, we owe a lot to her family.

50
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,709
I think it's a little too far
if we do that.

51
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,459
I think you should calm down
and we'll think about it.

52
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,879
I'll probably die
of anger before that.

53
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:16,629
Not only I'm angry at her,

54
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,420
I'm even angrier at your dad.

55
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,170
I have to go now, Mom.

56
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,879
I'll talk to you later.

57
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,209
Has Paeng already eaten?

58
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,170
Oh.

59
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,459
What's going on with you two now?

60
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,500
You're asking as if I'm the one
who started it.

61
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:27,709
Come on, Tubtim.
I didn't mean it like that.

62
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,920
Anyway, just keep eating.

63
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,500
If you're hungry,
just go ahead and eat.

64
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,879
I have no appetite.

65
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,920
Tubtim, what's going on?

66
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,959
It's because of you.

67
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,170
You promised Mr. Tharathep
about Paeng and Artit.

68
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,250
That's why things turned out
like this.

69
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,589
We're only tenants now

70
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,800
and Paeng is the actual owner.

71
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,500
That's why she dared to remind me
that we owe her.

72
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,420
Tubtim.

73
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,750
Paeng.

74
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:21,879
Can I come in?

75
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,209
I know that you haven't eaten.

76
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,170
I just got home as well.

77
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,420
So I brought dinner
to eat with you in here.

78
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,589
Here.

79
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,959
I'm not hungry.

80
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,339
Well, then.

81
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,089
You can watch me eat.

82
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,050
Mmm.

83
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:01,800
It's delicious.

84
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,339
Aren't you hungry?

85
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:08,550
If you want to scold me, just do it.

86
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,170
I'm used to it now.

87
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,500
And what would I scold you about?

88
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:14,709
What did you do wrong?

89
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,000
Huh?

90
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,459
I was rude to Ms. Tubtim.

91
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,129
You do know it.

92
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:29,670
That means you still have

93
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,959
common sense.

94
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,629
In fact,

95
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,710
what you said to her is true.

96
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,919
It's 52 million.

97
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,419
I don't even know if I can pay it
all back to you in this life.

98
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,250
Therefore,

99
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,169
this house,

100
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:56,919
my farm and all my stuff

101
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,629
belong to you.

102
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,549
Mr. Krongprateep...

103
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,710
I want you to know

104
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,169
that Tubtim scolded you

105
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,000
because she meant well.

106
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,549
And there's no one in this house

107
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,379
wants to kick you out.

108
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,419
Do you understand?

109
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,049
Here.

110
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm giving you this fried pork.

111
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,879
Because I love you.

112
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,169
Is it delicious? Come on. Let's eat.

113
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,250
Go on.

114
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,750
Do you want me to feed you?

115
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:09,710
Well?

116
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,419
Here's another bite.

117
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,500
Don't cry.

118
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,049
Eat with me.

119
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,919
It's really delicious.
I'm not lying.

120
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:36,129
Come on.

121
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Don't cry anymore, okay?

122
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,549
Don't cry.

123
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:16,590
I was rude to Ms. Tubtim.

124
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:18,750
You do know it.

125
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,919
That means you still have
common sense.

126
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,379
I'm sorry, Artit.

127
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,049
(I'm sorry, Artit)

128
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:35,669
Ms. Tubtim?

129
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:43,919
About yesterday,

130
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,250
I'm sorry.

131
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,169
You don't have
to apologize, LIttle Miss.

132
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:54,340
You were right about everything.

133
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,960
You own this house.

134
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,210
As for me,

135
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:00,169
I'm only a tenant.

136
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,629
- Ms. Tubtim, I...
- Stop.

137
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,210
Don't say anything.

138
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:09,210
Sometimes repeated apologies
don't make anything better.

139
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,500
What do you want me to do?

140
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,419
You don't have to do anything.

141
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,549
You just go on with your life.

142
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,960
I go on with mine.

143
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,129
I'll only ask you not to get
involved with Artit anymore.

144
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,960
That's all.

145
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:26,919
I hope you can do it.

146
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:41,419
Hurry up. That's it.

147
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,919
Nice. He's good.

148
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:45,750
Come on. I'm hungry.

149
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,500
Go, go, go.

150
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:10,549
I'm sorry.

151
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:13,750
Please stop being angry with me.

152
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,669
Kot.

153
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,500
Artit, please talk to me.

154
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:27,299
Please don't be mean to me.

155
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,669
Mr. Krongprateep,

156
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:29,500
when is Artit going to come back?

157
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,840
If you behave,

158
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,299
he'll be back.

159
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,590
(I miss you, Artit.)

160
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,340
(I'll behave.)

161
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:07,049
(When are you coming back?
I've missed you. I'm so lonely.)

162
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,000
You can have your lunch break.

163
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,710
We'll meet again
in this room this afternoon.

164
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:17,500
Everyone, express your gratitude.

165
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:20,879
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

166
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:34,750
Did I do anything wrong?

167
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,879
This time you didn't
do anything wrong.

168
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,340
But you are well-behaved.

169
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,250
You did really well this semester.

170
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:49,419
You've got good grades in almost
all the subjects.

171
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,419
Not just passing them,

172
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,419
but you almost got full marks.

173
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,129
Really, ma'am?

174
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,549
Really. I'm not going to lie to you.

175
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,919
And it's not just about studying,

176
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,710
your behavior has improved too.

177
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,670
Keep up the good work, Wanfahmai.

178
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,460
I will. Thank you very much.

179
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
Why are you standing here?

180
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:41,420
Oh!

181
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,839
Did you lose your shoes?

182
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,210
You already know it.
Why are you asking me?

183
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,210
You saying as if

184
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,670
she stole your shoes.

185
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,210
Is that a guilty conscience?

186
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,380
I haven't said a word about it.

187
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,000
So you're admitting it.

188
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,549
Give me back my shoes.

189
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,210
You're asking for your shoes.

190
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,670
I don't own a shoe shop.

191
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,339
Give me back my shoes!

192
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,630
Your behavior has improved too.

193
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,799
Keep up the good work, Wanfahmai.

194
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,250
What? Are you going to slap me?

195
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,839
Go ahead.

196
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:37,960
I'll be okay without shoes.

197
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:41,089
I can just walk like this.

198
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,250
A dog probably took them.

199
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,839
Paeng!

200
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,710
Why isn't she angry this time?

201
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:55,549
How should I know?

202
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,130
It's no fun.

203
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,299
It will be. There's another thing.

204
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,750
I guarantee that
she'll explode this time.

205
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,589
Call her.

206
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,130
You call her.

207
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,670
- Why me?
- No.

208
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,839
You call her.

209
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,170
Paeng, over here.

210
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,880
Come sit with us.

211
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:23,589
- You want me to sit with you?
- Yes.

212
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,089
Have a seat. Sit next to me.

213
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,420
Why do you want me to sit with you?

214
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,799
You ditched me and sat
with other people previously.

215
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,460
We feel guilty
for doing that to you.

216
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,049
Please don't be angry.

217
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,170
You know we didn't
want to do that to you.

218
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,960
All right. I forgive you.

219
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,750
I'm a new person now.

220
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,589
All right. Let's sit down.

221
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:05,420
Eat up. Why are you looking at me?

222
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,130
We have to go now.

223
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,380
We have an appointment
with the guidance counselor.

224
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,500
Nang put you up to this, didn't she?

225
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,000
We're sorry.

226
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,799
Please don't be angry with us.

227
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,839
Have you finished eating?

228
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:48,839
Then get up

229
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,670
so other people can sit down.

230
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,880
Oh, blood!

231
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:00,710
Ew!

232
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,460
So dirty!

233
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,299
Are you still using this trick?

234
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,630
It's old news.

235
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,960
Such a wimp!

236
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,380
Paeng!

237
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,250
Stop recording!

238
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,420
Paeng,

239
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,750
you might be lucky today.

240
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,750
But I won't let you go tomorrow.

241
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,589
Why did you lock the door?

242
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,549
I just want to talk to you.

243
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:03,170
I want to tell you

244
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,589
I never strike anyone first.

245
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,500
What do you mean?

246
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,960
I mean

247
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,000
if anyone hurt me first,

248
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,960
I'll get back at them
ten times more.

249
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,839
Let go! Have you gone crazy?

250
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:23,920
Let go of me!

251
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,880
I will.

252
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,710
But you have to apologize to me.

253
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,089
No!

254
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,799
I won't apologize.

255
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,589
You have such beautiful hair.

256
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,000
It would be a shame.

257
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,549
What are you going to do?

258
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,170
If I cut your hair,

259
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,839
are you going to feel sorry?

260
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:50,670
Don't you ever, Paeng.

261
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:54,630
Don't! Don't!

262
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,000
What happened this time

263
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,049
is too much for me to accept.

264
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,960
It already happened once.

265
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:27,630
Instead of feeling remorse,

266
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,670
she caused even more trouble.

267
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,960
I have to apologize to you
and Ms. Ladawan

268
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,299
that she acted without thinking.

269
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,250
The thing is

270
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,750
she lost her parents too suddenly.

271
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,049
Her mental state

272
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,960
can't be fully recovered.

273
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,500
So she became hot-tempered

274
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,549
and can't control herself sometimes.

275
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,880
The school is a safe space.

276
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,049
But this happened to Nang.

277
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,750
It makes me anxious.

278
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,750
I can accept it the first time.

279
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,170
But this time,

280
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,049
honestly

281
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,049
I'm rather apprehensive
about your family.

282
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,339
Even though Nang never
did anything to your niece.

283
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,880
Yes, I understand.

284
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,799
I'm really sorry, Ms. Ladawan.

285
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,750
Tubtim.

286
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:57,960
I have to go back to work.

287
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,960
Let's talk once I'm back.

288
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,130
Paeng,

289
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,130
I have to go now.

290
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:22,460
Okay. Please hurry back.

291
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:23,630
I will.

292
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:42,750
You could've
picked fights with anyone,

293
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:44,920
it has to be with
someone close to us.

294
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,210
I wasn't wrong.
She bullied me first.

295
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,420
She said she didn't bully you.

296
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,920
Don't blame others.

297
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,049
I didn't. I'm telling the truth.

298
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,210
She started it. She wanted to
embarrass me. She hates me.

299
00:25:58,339 --> 00:25:59,960
Stop. That's enough.

300
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:02,000
She did this and she did that.

301
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,880
You never blame yourself. Shameful.

302
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,299
Then what should I say
to not be shameful?

303
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,339
Do I have to sweet talk
and suck up to you?

304
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:12,500
Wanfahmai!

305
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:15,130
I'm almost at my limit for you now.

306
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,549
If you're not going to
be remorseful, then don't live here.

307
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,750
I won't raise you anymore.

308
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,839
Go wherever you please.

309
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:23,460
I'm not going.
What can you do to me?

310
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:26,049
Do you think I can't?

311
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,589
Duang!

312
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,839
- Duang!
- Yes, Madam.

313
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm coming.

314
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Go gather Paeng's things

315
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,750
and dump them outside.

316
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,250
Let's see if she'll
feel any remorse.

317
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:44,500
Right away, Madam.

318
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,589
Stop! Stop right now!

319
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,049
Hurry up, Duang!

320
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,299
Gather everything up.

321
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,630
- Stop right there.
- Stop!

322
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,089
Don't touch my stuff!

323
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,210
That's my stuff!

324
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:09,380
- Hurry, Duang!
- Don't touch my stuff!

325
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,839
Stop! I said stop!

326
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,049
Stop! Hurry up!

327
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,339
Bring them out!

328
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:20,339
Stop! Don't you follow!

329
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,670
Dump them all outside. Go.

330
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,299
Are you going to do it this way?

331
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,130
That's right. What are you
going to do to me?

332
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,130
Come on.

333
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,089
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

334
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,710
Miss Paeng! Hurry up, Jaem.

335
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,170
Dump them all.

336
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,460
If she dared to stay
after we've done this to her,

337
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:55,210
she must have very thick skin.

338
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:56,420
That's right.

339
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,799
It's so satisfying.

340
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,960
Duang!

341
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:04,750
- What's this?
- Whose top is that?

342
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,630
What?

343
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,630
This is mine!

344
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,960
Oh, dear!

345
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,210
Paeng!

346
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:15,500
Since you're throwing my stuff out,

347
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,460
I'm going to throw yours too.

348
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,250
Because I don't want you
to miss out on this.

349
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,420
You brat!

350
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:24,420
Paeng, stop that!

351
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:25,880
- I said stop!
- Madam,

352
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,960
how dare she! This is too far!

353
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:31,250
That's right! I said stop!

354
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:32,589
That's enough, Little Miss.

355
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,170
Things will be worse
if you keep this up.

356
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,500
That's true, Miss Paeng.

357
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,460
Why would they start it then?

358
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,630
I'm not in the wrong.
If you don't help, I'll do it alone.

359
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,750
- Miss Paeng!
- Are you trying my patience?

360
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,920
You brat!

361
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,250
What should we do, Madam?

362
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,420
She keeps throwing your stuff.

363
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,960
Go get your master and the workers.

364
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:54,380
Fetch them all. Hurry.

365
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,799
Quick!

366
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,920
Just you wait.

367
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,839
Paeng, come down right now!

368
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,960
This girl!

369
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,250
Why is she such a brat?

370
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,710
Miss Paeng, please come down.

371
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,500
Please come down
and apologize to Ms. Tubtim.

372
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,750
Why does everyone keep telling
me to apologize?

373
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:21,500
You force me to be like this.
Do you know that?

374
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:24,089
You always blame others.

375
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,670
You have no common sense.

376
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,880
Saeb, get her down.

377
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:30,460
I'm going to hit her.

378
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:32,339
- So she'll learn.
- Here you are, Madam.

379
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,210
Come down right now!

380
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,210
Paeng,

381
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:42,170
come here and let me hit you!

382
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:46,960
Saeb, help me catch her!

383
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:48,339
- Quick!
- Okay, okay, Madam.

384
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,630
- Don't, Saeb!
- Miss Paeng,

385
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,250
it's necessary. I'm sorry.

386
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:53,920
No! Don't!

387
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,380
Don't do anything to her!

388
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,839
Don't do anything to us!

389
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,000
Catch her!

390
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,710
Don't! Miss Paeng!

391
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,839
Come here!

392
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:11,799
You can't hit me

393
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,839
or I'll call the police!

394
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,210
Are you threatening me?
I'm not scared.

395
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,549
Calm down, Madam.

396
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,799
Come here right now!

397
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,380
Keep a good hold of her, Saeb!

398
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,549
Keep it tight.

399
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,049
Oh, no!

400
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,089
What is this?

401
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:31,130
You can't even catch a little girl!

402
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,630
Madam, please stop.

403
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,049
If Master knows what you did to her,
you're going to be in trouble.

404
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,210
So what if he knows? I'm not scared.

405
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,460
If he wants to keep her,

406
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,880
then he can divorce me.

407
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,460
Paeng!

408
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,799
- Madam!
- Miss Paeng!

409
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,299
Miss Paeng!

410
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,380
Miss Paeng, come back!

411
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,630
Stop right now!

412
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,420
- Hurry up, Saeb!
- Miss Paeng!

413
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,049
Stop right now!

414
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:02,250
Miss Paeng, wait for me!

415
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:03,960
- Stop right now!
- Miss Paeng!

416
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:05,299
Saeb, hurry up!

417
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,670
- Paeng!
- Miss Paeng!

418
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,089
You little brat!

419
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:11,880
Mr. Krongprateep!

420
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,299
- Mr. Krongprateep!
- What's going on?

421
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,210
Ms. Tubtim is going to hit me
but I ran away.

422
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:18,710
What's this? What's going on?

423
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,170
You have to help me!

424
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,460
Calm down. Tell me what happened.

425
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,210
Calm down.

426
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:28,960
Saeb, what's the matter?

427
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,380
Huh? Speak clearly.

428
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,210
What about you, Duang?

429
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,130
I asked you what happened.

430
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,210
Oh, Tubtim?

431
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,049
Paeng!

432
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,000
Hold on. I'm tired.

433
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,799
I can't breathe right now.

434
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,299
Go on. Who's going to start?

435
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,460
Paeng!

436
00:31:58,589 --> 00:31:59,960
Did she tell you everything

437
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,710
about what I did to her?

438
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,589
Tubtim,

439
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:13,500
you know that we can't kick her out.

440
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,750
Our house is on fire

441
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,380
ever since that girl
came to live with us.

442
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,710
Our son can't return home either.

443
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,049
She tears us apart.
Is that how it should be?

444
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,250
It's because we
don't understand her.

445
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,670
That's why she became angry
and defend herself.

446
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,589
Even though she's
actually very timid.

447
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,799
Huh?

448
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,000
Really?

449
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,960
That girl? Timid?

450
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,750
You're too gullible.

451
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,339
Be careful.

452
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,000
If you trust her too much,
she'll disappoint you later.

453
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,089
You'll be sorry and think you
shouldn't have sided with her.

454
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:52,170
It's okay if you don't believe me.

455
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,710
Just wait and see.

456
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,210
Saeb! Duang!

457
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,670
Yes, Madam.

458
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:02,880
Go get the car.

459
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:05,130
- I'm going home.
- Yes, Madam.

460
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:07,630
Let's go.

461
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,589
I'm going crazy.
I'm worried about Miss Paeng.

462
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,250
Oh, shoot!

463
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:23,000
Who got shot? Miss Paeng?

464
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:24,960
No, it's my husband.

465
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,460
Has your husband died?

466
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,710
He's still alive. He texted me

467
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,000
that he fell and broke his leg.

468
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:34,839
He told me to come
and look after him.

469
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,500
Oh, shoot!

470
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,920
Who got shot now?

471
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,589
It's going to be me!

472
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,799
If you're not here,
then what am I going to do?

473
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,960
You can handle it.
Believe me, Aueng.

474
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,460
I really have to go.

475
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:49,049
And you have to be strong

476
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,210
and tough.
Don't spoil Little Miss even more.

477
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,670
Do you know what are the cons of
spoiling someone too much?

478
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,500
Jaem!

479
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,799
I'm going to miss you so much.

480
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,839
Why did your husband
have to fall now?

481
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,380
How should I know?

482
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,670
Am I going to be able to handle it?

483
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,170
You will. Believe me.

484
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,340
There, there.

485
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,800
Mr. Krongprateep,

486
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,340
when is Artit going to come back?

487
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,130
You told me

488
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,380
if I behave,
then Artit will be back.

489
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,210
But this has been
so many months now.

490
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,590
Artit hasn't even come back yet.

491
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,210
Are you sure

492
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,590
that what you're doing right now

493
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,380
is living together harmoniously?

494
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,340
Other people provoked me first.

495
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,880
I have to do it or they will

496
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,710
keep bullying me.

497
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,170
I'll believe you about
what happened at school.

498
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,960
But why did Tubtim chase
after you and try to hit you?

499
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,090
Well,

500
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,420
she threw out my clothes.

501
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,710
So I threw out her clothes too.

502
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,800
Why are you laughing?

503
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,420
I'm not.

504
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,170
Well, I don't know

505
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,800
if I should laugh or cry about this.

506
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,380
But I think I should be laughing.

507
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,840
Do you know

508
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,670
ever since she was born, no one
dares to defy her like that?

509
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,460
You're the first.

510
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,380
And it's actually working.

511
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,420
See? She's so furious right now.

512
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,670
Unbelievable.

513
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,960
Is it difficult to grow grapes?

514
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,840
Anything is difficult to grow.

515
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,050
We have to be patient

516
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,670
keep taking care of it and
be careful about everything.

517
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,750
If we're too impatient,

518
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,880
anything we grow will die.

519
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,250
- I guess I'm quite good, actually.
- Hmm?

520
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,920
Artit let me grow some flowers.

521
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,300
And I was successful.

522
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,380
They all blossomed beautifully.

523
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,710
But not long after that,

524
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,170
they died.

525
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,500
It's the nature of flowers.

526
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,340
They're weak.
Don't think too much about it.

527
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,840
Oh?

528
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,840
- Come on. I'll help you.
- It's okay. I can do it myself.

529
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,130
Paeng,

530
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,500
if you're this lovely to everyone,

531
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,590
I believe they will all love you.

532
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,460
I'm always like this.

533
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,630
I didn't act any differently,

534
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,880
both in front of you and Ms. Tubtim.

535
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,300
But they've already made
judgments that I'm bad.

536
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,960
That's why she hates me.

537
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,500
So you have to prove yourself.

538
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,750
You have to win her heart.

539
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,800
I don't think so.

540
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,710
The only person I have
to win over is Artit.

541
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,750
Can you tell him to come back?

542
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,750
You've waited for so long.

543
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,050
Wait a little longer.

544
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,250
In two years,

545
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,340
Artit will graduate.

546
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,840
Once he graduated,
he will come back.

547
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,920
Two more years?

548
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,050
He'll be back to marry me, right?

549
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,550
Paeng,

550
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,340
do you know the word "patience"?

551
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,920
Like what Artit told me

552
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,380
to be patient
for the flowers to bloom?

553
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,590
That's right.

554
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,050
It's the same as me waiting
for the grapes to bear fruit.

555
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,800
Do you know

556
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,630
building relationships with people

557
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,420
is the same as growing trees?

558
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,050
We have to take care of them

559
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,130
and understand their feelings,

560
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,960
Tubtim's,

561
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,960
your friends'

562
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,630
or Artit's.

563
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,590
You have to put
yourself in their shoes.

564
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,250
If they do something they want

565
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,630
but you don't like it,

566
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,380
you have to endure it.

567
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,670
But if you've reached your limit,

568
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,170
you have to be mentally prepared
for the consequence too.

569
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,420
Because sometimes

570
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,250
the relationship can die

571
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,960
just like the tree that we grow.

572
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,920
Do you understand what I'm saying?

573
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,130
Yes.

574
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,050
Well, then.

575
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,090
Can I ask you one thing?

576
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,340
Put it down on the table, Non.

577
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,210
- Here it is.
- Here's yours.

578
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,960
Here's yours, Kot.

579
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,420
Whoa, whoa. That's persistent.

580
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,500
I thought it was someone else.

581
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,250
It's actually the same old person.

582
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,670
It's been so many months

583
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,250
that you've been quiet.

584
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,000
Paeng texts you every day.

585
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,750
Why don't you try
and change your method?

586
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,960
What method?

587
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,170
Reply to her sometimes.

588
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,550
Or just be clear that you
don't feel anything for her.

589
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,750
Her? I don't think she'd listen.

590
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,750
If I do that, she'll think
I'm leading her on.

591
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,130
Then don't lead her on.

592
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,880
Non's right.

593
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,340
You have to be firm.

594
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,210
Tell her to stop bothering you.

595
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,380
Make it clear.

596
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,710
Why didn't you go down for dinner?

597
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,710
Do you even have to ask?

598
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,800
Honestly,

599
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,920
I don't want to share
the same air with that girl.

600
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,960
I don't even want
to look at her face.

601
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,550
I hate her. You heard it.

602
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,840
Come on, Tubtim.

603
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,630
I've talked to Paeng.

604
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,210
I asked her to promise me that
she won't cause any more trouble.

605
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,500
That girl?

606
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,590
I don’t believe it even if
you swear on the Buddha.

607
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,630
How many times has she promised?

608
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,380
See how it turns out?
Everything's in vain.

609
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,210
So you're not going to forgive her?

610
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,420
No.

611
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,420
Well, then.

612
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,630
Let's get on with
each other's lives.

613
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,590
Oh? It's always been like that.

614
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,340
This time is her last chance.

615
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,460
But if she causes any more trouble,

616
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,800
I won't stand her anymore!

617
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,340
Miss Paeng,

618
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,130
I've brought you some warm milk.

619
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,380
Miss Paeng,

620
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,460
Jaem's going home tomorrow.

621
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,460
Her husband broke his leg
and couldn't walk.

622
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,380
So she'll have to go
and look after him.

623
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,000
Will she be back?

624
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,920
She will.

625
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,500
But I don't know when.

626
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,170
It's only the two of us here now.

627
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,590
Oh, Miss Paeng.

628
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,300
Don't feel lonely.

629
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,960
You still have me.

630
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,920
I'm lonely.

631
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,960
Because I miss Artit.

632
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,630
Oh.

633
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,420
If you miss him,

634
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,800
why don't you call him?

635
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,670
Come on. Just call him.

636
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,130
Well,

637
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:56,670
but Mr. Krongprateep said
I shouldn't bother him.

638
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,500
But if it's occasional,

639
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,710
he probably won't be annoyed, right?

640
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,960
That's right. If you already
know the answer,

641
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,840
then call him. No need to ask me.

642
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,500
Whoa.

643
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,460
Why aren't you picking it up?

644
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,710
Oh, wow!

645
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,130
I thought it was someone else.

646
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,460
It's your karmic relation.

647
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,420
- Reject it.
- Why?

648
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,420
I just told you
to talk to her sometimes.

649
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,800
That's right.

650
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,960
You should pick it up.

651
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,090
Aren't you afraid that she'll
come all the way to see you here?

652
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,090
What's going on?

653
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,300
Isn't he picking up?

654
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,750
He isn't.

655
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,460
What?

656
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,340
Artit?

657
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,130
Uhh...

658
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,750
It's nothing.

659
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,630
I just want to hear your voice.

660
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,500
When are you coming home?

661
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,380
I don't know.

662
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,380
You don't know
or you don't want to see me?

663
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,210
I don't want to see you!

664
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,250
Too loud! Turn it down.

665
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,380
I have practice every day.
There's a match coming up.

666
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
When is the match?

667
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,420
Can I come see you?

668
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,590
You can't!

669
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,050
Quiet!

670
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,050
You can't come.

671
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,050
It's a university match.
Other people can't come in.

672
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,380
I have to go. I'm very busy now.

673
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,460
And if there's nothing important,

674
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,500
don't call and don't text me.
Understand?

675
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,670
Oh, dear. Miss Paeng.

676
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,920
I shouldn't have...

677
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,800
Isn't it a little to harsh?

678
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,130
(Wanfahmai's flower bed)

679
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,920
Wanfahmai's flower bed.

680
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,500
This is your home.

681
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,210
You're not alone anymore.

682
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,960
If I grow some flowers again,

683
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,590
will Artit come back?

684
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,250
Chai's become Duen's husband now.

685
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,920
Huh? Someone like Duen?

686
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,300
Of course. She's such a flirt.
She gets any guy she wants.

687
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,800
How did she do it? I might be
able to learn a thing or two.

688
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,800
Calls the guy the whole day
if you want him.

689
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,960
Send texts to him often?

690
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,630
Send them.

691
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,500
Ask him out for a meal.

692
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,500
Artit, I'm sick.

693
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:11,050
I'm not a doctor.
Don't tell me that.

694
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,210
Artit, I ran away from home.

695
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,590
Go ahead.

696
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,090
Artit, I'm about to go and see you.

697
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,170
Go and see a shrink.

698
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,130
See?

699
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,670
Who told me to reply to her?

700
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,250
See what happens?

701
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:15,460
I think Paeng's quite stubborn.

702
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,590
But it's okay.

703
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:19,130
I know another method.

704
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,250
- You come here right now.
- What?

705
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,920
- Non, get out of the way.
- What's this?

706
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,550
You sit down.

707
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,840
Lean your head against each other.

708
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,500
Do as I say.

709
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,800
Smile. There!

710
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,420
Yes!

711
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,050
Ooh!

712
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,960
All done.

713
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,090
- Hey?
- What are you doing?

714
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,840
"I already have a girlfriend."

715
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,090
Huh?

716
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:48,960
- Hey!
- Kot.

717
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,380
What on earth are you doing?

718
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,130
There'll be trouble if you do this.

719
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,460
This is good.

720
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,380
So Paeng will be able
to get over you.

721
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,590
Isn't it good?

722
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,300
Aueng!

723
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,210
Artit's dating Ling.

724
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,880
He's cheating on me.

725
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,960
Do you want to pray with me?

726
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,960
No, I don't want to.

727
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,670
I'm not going to put up with this
any longer.

728
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,960
What are you going to do?

729
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:45,050
Do you know Artit
from the Faculty of Architecture?

730
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,750
Artit from Faculty of Architecture?
Everybody knows him.

731
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,500
Do you know where he is right now?

732
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,170
Go, Non! Artit!

733
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,050
- Go!
- Go, go, go!

734
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,840
Come on!

735
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:14,750
There!

736
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,710
Yes!

737
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,920
That's the boy!

738
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,500
Yes!

739
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,000
Awesome!

740
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,960
Hey?

741
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,550
Cool!

742
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,840
Hey! Artit!

743
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,750
What's going on?

744
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,550
Artit!

745
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,550
Aueng!

746
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,170
Hold on! What's going on?

747
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,670
Jaem, Paeng is...

748
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,050
How did you get here?

749
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:10,050
My husband was okay.

750
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,300
And you left me being all dramatic.

751
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,050
Why did you call me?

752
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,630
That's right!

753
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,590
Come on! Stop!

754
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,420
Why are you screaming? Just say it.

755
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,380
Miss Paeng, Jaem!

756
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,880
Is she sick?

757
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:27,550
No, Jaem. She's...

758
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:28,750
She died?

759
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,840
Hey! You big mouth.

760
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,960
She's just disappeared.

761
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,210
She's disappeared?

762
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,500
That's right.

763
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:38,050
She's disappeared.

764
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,210
Old news.

765
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,000
She's begging for attention again.
It's nothing.

766
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:45,250
Let's go back to work.

767
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,210
- It's no fun.
- Hold on!

768
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,550
You have to help us find her.

769
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:53,550
Aueng, where are we
going to look for her?

770
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,880
Don't help her, Saeb.

771
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,170
If she could go away herself,
then she can find her way back.

772
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,210
- But it'd be best if she didn't.
- Right.

773
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,670
What do you mean by that?

774
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,130
I was obvious but you still
don't understand? You fool!

775
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:05,840
Hey!

776
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,000
What now?

777
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,630
What's the ruckus?

778
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,000
Miss Paeng ran away.

779
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,590
Madam, you have to help find her.

780
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,670
I'm scared
something might happen to her.

781
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,840
Why should I?

782
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,670
It's good that the brat disappeared.

783
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,250
If she doesn't want to stay,
then she shouldn't stay.

784
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,630
I don't like forcing anyone.

785
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,000
- But...
- No buts.

786
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,090
You two as well. You can go now.

787
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,050
Your mistress isn't here.
Why are you still staying?

788
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,500
Pack your things and go after her.

789
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,340
Or do you want me to shoo you away?

790
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,670
Go!

791
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,170
What is this?

792
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,000
What's going on?

793
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,250
Master, please help us.

794
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,460
Artit! Artit!

795
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,800
Artit! Artit!

796
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:58,300
- Artit!
- You can't go in there.

797
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,750
Move away. I'm his girlfriend.
I'm going in there.

798
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,090
No means no! Don't you understand?

799
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,630
Is he okay?

800
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,550
He's awake!

801
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,960
Whoa!

802
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:28,380
He's strong. No need to worry.

803
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:29,670
He'll be okay.

804
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,460
Are you all right?

805
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,960
All right, then.

806
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,710
Are you okay?

807
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,460
If you are, then please stand up.

808
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,800
Okay, then?

809
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,550
Hey, hey?

810
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,750
Oh, it's raining. Let's move.

811
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:59,250
I'll borrow your umbrella.

812
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,340
Oh, jeez. Why does it
have to rain now?

813
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:08,090
Yes!

814
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,210
Nice!

815
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,000
Excellent! Applause!

816
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,250
Yes!

817
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,750
Awesome! Applause!

818
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,630
Again! Again!

819
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:03,710
Well done!

820
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:05,750
Yes!

821
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,340
Awesome!

822
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,380
You're so awesome!

823
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,130
You won for the third time.

824
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,460
Artit's good.

825
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,090
Hey, it's not just me.

826
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,380
It's the entire team.

827
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,750
Don't pass out like that again.
I'm worried.

828
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,000
All right. What about Ling?

829
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,170
She doesn't want to come in.
Or she'd be called a peeping tom.

830
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,210
She said all of us should
go celebrate.

831
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,920
It's her treat this time.

832
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,170
Is that okay?

833
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,210
Of course, it is.
We can't turn her down.

834
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,460
Hold on. Are you being nice
or just greedy?

835
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:36,800
I care about her feelings.

836
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,920
Hold on. You're going to argue
right after the match?

837
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,420
So you two agree to go.

838
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,630
Hurry up and shower.

839
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,670
- I'm hungry, understand?
- Okay.

840
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,340
Pick up, Artit.

841
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,210
Come on!

842
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,920
Oh, Dad?

843
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,960
- Yes, Dad?
- Artit.

844
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,710
Has Paeng called you?

845
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,500
- What's the matter?
- She ran away from home.

846
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,380
If she calls you,

847
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,250
you have to get a hold of her
and bring her back.

848
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:46,800
Dad,

849
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,840
if Paeng doesn't want to stay,
then why are we holding her back?

850
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:51,800
Artit,

851
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,920
you know I have to take care of her.

852
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:58,670
Why are you being quiet?

853
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,590
Or did Paeng call you?

854
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,050
Dad, let's do it this way.

855
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,800
If I found her, I'll deal with her.

856
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:08,670
Later, Dad.

857
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,550
Artit?

858
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,090
Artit's calling. Pick up.

859
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,960
Artit's calling. Pick up.

860
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:41,960
Artit's calling. Pick up.

861
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,920
Artit's calling. Pick up.

862
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,250
- Artit's calling. Pick up.
- Paeng!

863
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,800
- Artit's calling. Pick up.
- Artit,

864
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,050
what's that girl's voice?

865
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:52,670
Shoot!

866
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,500
What are you doing here, Paeng?

867
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,210
Why didn't you answer my calls?

868
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,920
Paeng,

869
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,920
you can't throw a fit here. Get out.

870
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:05,500
No. Why didn't you pick up?

871
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:08,670
My hands are cramping from
calling you. Are you dumping me?

872
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,960
Get out now, Paeng.

873
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,340
Not before I talk to you.

874
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,500
You have to go now.

875
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,000
Come here.

876
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,670
Artit, that hurts!

877
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,050
I told you not to get
together with a little girl.

878
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,170
Remember that.

879
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,880
Artit, it hurts!

880
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:37,090
Are you crazy? Why did you run away
from home and come here?

881
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,800
That's right! I'm crazy.

882
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,420
I'm crazy because of you.

883
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,500
I asked you nicely that I wanted to
watch the match but you said no.

884
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:46,130
So I had to run away.

885
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,880
Because I know it'll be
like this if you came.

886
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,420
Artit, don't you miss me at all?

887
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,300
We haven't seen
each other for a long time.

888
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,840
Don't babble. You can go home now.

889
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,800
Don't you know that you've
caused people trouble?

890
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,340
I do! So what? Who cares?

891
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,380
I'm not in the wrong. You are.

892
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,090
You told me you're going
to take care of me.

893
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,170
And you won't leave me.
Don't you remember that?

894
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,880
I don't. Understand?

895
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,340
I'll call a van to bring you back.

896
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,880
- Go.
- I won't!

897
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,920
If I go back, you have
to come with me

898
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:28,300
See? It's because you're like this.
That's why I don't want to see you.

899
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,920
Then prepare to be disappointed.

900
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:35,340
Because you have to marry me.

901
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:37,710
Mr. Krongprateep
gave my dad his word.

902
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,250
So it must be that way.

903
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,500
If you're not going back with me,

904
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:43,800
I'm going to run away

905
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,750
and make you feel guilty
for the rest of your life.

906
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,920
So that you'll know

907
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:51,550
that someone like me can be serious.

908
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,170
Go ahead! Don't threaten me.

909
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,300
Go wherever! Do whatever!

910
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,500
It's your business.
I don't care anymore!

911
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:00,800
Darn it!

912
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:06,750
- Non, get my stuff.
- Huh?

913
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,090
How could you say that to her?

914
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,250
What if she actually ran away?

915
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:14,170
I know her well. She wouldn't dare.

916
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,170
But anything can happen.

917
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,460
Haven't you heard

918
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:22,340
that humans can do anything
when they're cornered?

919
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,920
Artit, I think you
should go after her.

920
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,460
She's probably still on the campus.

921
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,210
I agree with Non.

922
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:31,050
Hurry up and call her.

923
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:55,000
A car key has been found in front of
the Faculty of Architecture.

924
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:58,380
You can retrieve it from
the first floor of the PR building.

925
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,630
Thank you.

926
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,670
She wouldn't pick up.

927
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:12,500
Shoot. What if she kills herself?

928
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,210
Potty mouth!

929
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,630
- But that hurts!
- It's all because of you.

930
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,960
Probably not.

931
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,920
Let's split up and look for her.

932
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,340
Come on.

933
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,750
Artit Suriyasakul,

934
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,670
the star of
the Faculty of Architecture.

935
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,840
Hey, Artit?

936
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:36,170
That's Paeng's voice.

937
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,590
I want to tell you

938
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:41,250
that

939
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,130
I love you.

940
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,920
I'm going to marry you and only you.

941
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,800
I hope everyone is aware

942
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:01,380
that he's taken.

943
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,090
Artit is mine.

944
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,800
Paeng's really harsh.

945
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,840
I thought she's looking for someone.

946
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:23,300
That's right.
That's a love confession.

947
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,250
That's all I have to say.

948
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,550
Thank you for listening.

949
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:29,880
Artit, well...

950
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,170
Calm down!

951
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,710
You're too late!

952
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,960
What are you waiting for?
Go after him.

953
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,880
Come on! Hurry!

954
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,960
You're here to see me now?

955
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:46,550
You've crossed the line!

956
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,840
You two, please leave us.

957
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:01,340
Do you think that I'll love you
by doing this?

958
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,800
It's actually making me hate you

959
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,170
and want to stay away from you!

960
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:08,750
Artit!

961
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:10,840
Artit!

962
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,000
Artit!

963
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,050
It's because of her, isn't it?

964
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,050
What does Ling have that I don't?

965
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:20,750
Why don't you love me?

966
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,090
Because you're not her!

967
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,550
Paeng, listen to me.

968
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:27,710
I won't!

969
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,460
What did I do to you?

970
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,550
Why did you have to steal
him from me?

971
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,710
Paeng, Artit and I...

972
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,420
Ling, don't.

973
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:40,210
Paeng,

974
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,420
I don't love you means I don't.

975
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,840
Don't rope other people into this.

976
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:47,710
It's Ling's fault.

977
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,380
Artit is mine.

978
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,050
We're engaged.
We're going to get married.

979
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,960
- Don't mess around with Artit!
- Wait, Paeng.

980
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:59,130
Calm down!

981
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,300
Paeng!

982
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,840
Paeng!

983
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,880
I told you to leave Ling alone!

984
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,800
You really want me to go back?

985
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,460
All right! We'll go now!

986
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,460
- Artit?
- Artit?

987
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,050
Are you hurt?

988
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:50,710
Miss Paeng is back!

989
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:53,250
I'm back, Miss Paeng!

990
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:57,090
Miss Paeng,
please don't do this again.

991
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:59,420
You almost broke our hearts.

992
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,300
I'm really sorry.

993
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,380
Artit.

994
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:11,800
Miss Paeng.

995
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:16,800
Artit!

996
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:18,670
Artit, wait for me!

997
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,130
Artit!

998
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:21,670
- Artit!
- What do you want now?

999
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:24,420
You can't behave normally.

1000
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:26,420
You keep causing trouble.

1001
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,300
Artit, how are you?

1002
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,500
Someone even stalked you there.
Are you exhausted?

1003
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,960
I think you should go and rest.

1004
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:40,880
Hold on. I'm not finished talking
to him. Don't interrupt.

1005
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:43,050
Stop right now, Paeng!

1006
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,960
Isn't it enough wreaking havoc
on the whole farm?

1007
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,960
The duty of the people here isn't to
suck it up to you.

1008
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,170
I'd like to know

1009
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,300
how your parents raised you

1010
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,960
to be this spoiled.

1011
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:59,210
You have no right
to insult my parents.

1012
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:01,800
- Do you want her to compliment?
- Shut up!

1013
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,750
Have you forgotten

1014
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,710
that Mr. Krongprateep promised
my dad to look after me?

1015
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,630
There's no need to
keep repeating that.

1016
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,130
I've given you whatever I can.

1017
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:11,960
I gave you a place to live
and send you to school.

1018
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,340
Honestly,

1019
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,130
if you behave and be polite to me.

1020
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,050
I'd treat you more nicely.

1021
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,300
But what is this?

1022
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:22,880
You bring us problems every day.

1023
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:27,420
And you? Who raised you?
Why don't you deserve any respect?

1024
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,960
- Paeng!
- Paeng!

1025
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:32,420
Don't be rude to my mom.

1026
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:35,340
I'm not. I'm telling the truth.

1027
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:43,460
Paeng!

1028
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:48,210
Oh, dear. My blood pressure
is through the roof.

1029
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,800
Duang, help her sit down.

1030
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,170
It's okay. I can do it myself.

1031
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,130
What's all this?

1032
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:01,170
- I feel like I'm going to faint.
- Are you okay?

1033
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,210
That brat has returned.

1034
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,380
What? She's back again?

1035
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,750
- That's right.
- I thought it'll be peaceful now.

1036
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,710
I don't think it will be.

1037
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,090
Once she's arrived, she attacked
Madam right away.

1038
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:17,210
She said Madam wasn't
properly educated.

1039
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:20,090
Oh, dear me. Is it true?

1040
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:22,340
She even said that
in front of Mr. Artit.

1041
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:25,420
She's just a tenant here. Brat!

1042
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,550
I don't like this girl either.

1043
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:29,840
She's a lost cause.

1044
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:31,550
No one likes her.

1045
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:34,420
Mr. Artit hates her. Everybody does.

1046
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,710
Except Master.

1047
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:41,000
He'll open his eyes and realize
how bad this ingrate is.

1048
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:43,750
Who are you calling ingrate?

1049
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,130
Your mistress.

1050
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:47,550
That rotten Paeng.
She's an unwanted kid.

1051
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:51,300
- Shut up!
- Why? I'm telling the truth.

1052
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,920
If you want me to stop,
tell her to behave.

1053
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,920
Oh? Come here.

1054
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,960
Come right here.
I'm going to slap you.

1055
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:00,920
Bring it on. Do you dare?

1056
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,380
Aueng! Did you slap me?

1057
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,840
That's right? Do you want to
know why I dare? Come here.

1058
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,920
Come on. Come on.

1059
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,340
- Do you think I'm scared?
- Stop!

1060
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,630
Stop!

1061
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,960
Hey!

1062
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,300
I said stop, you two!

1063
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,250
Stop! Hey!

1064
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,300
You've ruined the kitchen. Stop!

1065
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,170
I should've whacked her
in the mouth with a pestle.

1066
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,250
Jaem, that hurts!

1067
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:28,590
You're too hot-headed.

1068
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,000
I told you to endure or Miss Paeng
will face even more animosity.

1069
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,210
I can't stand it.

1070
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:37,420
They all talked down on her.
Would you be able to endure it?

1071
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,340
I don't want to either.

1072
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:41,170
I feel so sorry for Miss Paeng.

1073
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,550
Her life used to be so comfortable.

1074
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,380
Suddenly, everything's ruined.

1075
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:48,300
That's human life, Aueng.

1076
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:50,130
Nothing is permanent.

1077
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:53,670
Why does she have to live here?

1078
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,340
A house where everyone hates her.

1079
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,550
How long is it going
to be like this?

1080
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,590
Ouch, gently!

1081
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:11,960
Can I come in?

1082
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:45,750
Here's some water.

1083
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,960
Artit, I'm almost at my limit.

1084
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:52,250
Your dad keeps spoiling her.

1085
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,670
He never scolds her at all.

1086
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,130
Now she's becoming cockier.

1087
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:59,380
We're probably so deeply
indebted to her father.

1088
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,300
Dad probably feels like he has to.

1089
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,920
Her family helped us a lot.

1090
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,340
Can't even pay off
a one-time favor, can we?

1091
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:13,090
If I'd known this earlier, I won't
accept a single baht.

1092
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:18,880
But nothing is more worrisome than
that engagement promise.

1093
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,590
It's as if he's selling
his son for profit.

1094
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:26,630
Dad probably doesn't think that.

1095
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,130
Artit, don't give in to him.

1096
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:33,880
I won't accept her as
my daughter-in-law no matter what.

1097
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,210
Okay, Mom. I won't accept that.

1098
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,590
That's good.

1099
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:40,630
I'm going to be on your side.

1100
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,710
Don't care what your dad says.

1101
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,210
I won't let anyone

1102
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,960
ruin my son's happiness.

1103
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,380
I'm getting angry.

1104
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,000
Artit, you're early!

1105
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,590
You've come back here too?

1106
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,050
I'm worried about you.

1107
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,550
Thanks.

1108
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,840
Did you have a headache yesterday?

1109
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:37,340
Do you have to ask?

1110
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,500
Paeng seems really fixated on you.

1111
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,800
She's scarier than I thought.

1112
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:46,300
What are you going to do? Should you
just marry her to end it all?

1113
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,630
Non!

1114
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,380
Can you defy your dad?

1115
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,670
I can't accept this.

1116
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,170
What are you going to do then?

1117
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:01,750
But you keep telling Paeng

1118
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,050
that you don't love her.
But she never listens.

1119
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:05,800
Ling got roped into this too.

1120
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:10,880
If Pang can act up,
I can do that too.

1121
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:12,380
If I still can't talk sense
into her,

1122
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,420
I probably have to be mean.

1123
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,380
I won't be nice anymore.

1124
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,460
So Paeng will stop liking me.

1125
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:20,630
You're so cool.

1126
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,130
Coconut dumplings in coconut milk.

1127
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:35,750
It's an ancient recipe.

1128
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,300
Have you had it before?

1129
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,380
I haven't. Did you make it yourself?

1130
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:41,170
You're good.

1131
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:45,380
You have so much time that
you go around giving people dessert?

1132
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:48,380
You don't have to. There are
a lot of things to eat here.

1133
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,300
Don't be rude.

1134
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,630
It's okay, Artit.

1135
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,710
I just started learning
to make desserts.

1136
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:58,590
So I want someone to try them out.

1137
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,960
Oh? You see other people
as a lab rat?

1138
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,460
Let me have a taste.

1139
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:09,550
Yuck!

1140
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:12,630
What on earth are you doing?

1141
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:16,710
The coconut milk has gone bad.

1142
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,250
It really stinks.

1143
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,250
That's not true.

1144
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:22,380
I used fresh ingredients.

1145
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,550
I make the coconut milk myself.

1146
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:26,590
I know that you're faking it.

1147
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,420
I mean well, Artit.

1148
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,380
What if you had diarrhea
and had to be hospitalized?

1149
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,550
Apologize to her.

1150
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:36,710
Don't be rude to my guest.

1151
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,210
It's you who's rude.

1152
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:45,050
What decent woman seduces
someone else's boyfriend?

1153
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:47,590
You should know
if you had some sense

1154
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,460
except if you're promiscuous!

1155
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,550
Paeng!

1156
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,590
Then how should decent women behave?

1157
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,710
Go after a man and declare
ownership over him?

1158
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,840
Oh, my. That kind of woman exists?

1159
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,090
They do. Someone around here.

1160
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:07,670
Oh, dear.

1161
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,380
How brazen are they

1162
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:13,050
to be able to do that?

1163
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,380
Would you like to
change your hairstyle?

1164
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:17,960
Dear me!

1165
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,340
Nang, go home. I'll drop you off.

1166
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:26,340
It's okay, Artit.
I can go home myself.

1167
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:29,590
Just in case you have
anything to deal with.

1168
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,590
You're going to get it.

1169
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:35,800
Paeng!

1170
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,250
Paeng!

1171
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:53,050
If you do that again,
you're going to be in trouble.

1172
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,380
Why? I'm jealous.

1173
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:57,920
You have no right to be jealous.

1174
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:00,250
I do. You're mine.

1175
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,960
I've told you millions of times
that I'm not yours.

1176
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,380
Why aren't you? You're mine.

1177
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:10,750
Don't cheat on me. Don't talk to
other women. I won't accept it.

1178
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,000
Listen to me.

1179
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,050
I never love you.

1180
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,130
I never do. Do you hear me?

1181
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,840
But you promised me

1182
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,380
that you'll look after me.

1183
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:25,750
There's no such thing.

1184
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,420
You can't latch on to me like this.

1185
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,460
I have to. I don't have anyone left.

1186
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:32,460
I only have you.

1187
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:34,800
You can't break your promise.

1188
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,380
You're really not making any sense!

1189
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,840
It's like talking to a crazy person.

1190
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,750
Artit! I'm not crazy!

1191
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,670
Artit! Don't walk away from me!

1192
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,670
I'm not crazy! Artit!

1193
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,170
- Artit!
- Miss Paeng!

1194
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,460
Calm down.

1195
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:54,920
- Artit, I'm not crazy!
- No, you're not.

1196
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,800
- I'm not crazy.
- You're not.

1197
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:06,250
Little Miss.

1198
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,000
Don't cry, Miss Paeng.

1199
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:12,800
You're not crazy.

1200
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,630
You definitely aren't.

1201
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,050
Take a nap. Please don't
think too much.

1202
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:19,920
Please?

1203
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,630
Oh! Oh! Jaem!

1204
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,960
I'm going.

1205
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:02,170
(When are you coming back?
I've missed you. I'm so lonely.)

1206
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,420
Everyone here hates me.

1207
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,710
No one likes me.

1208
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,710
Who's going to love me?

1209
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:15,960
Even my parents left me.

1210
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,750
Your parents really loved you.

1211
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,710
They didn't want to
leave you like this.

1212
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,750
If they loved me,

1213
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,840
they wouldn't have left me.

1214
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,500
No one loves me.

1215
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,880
No one.

1216
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:55,460
Paeng,

1217
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,500
remember.

1218
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,250
No matter what happens,

1219
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,170
I promise

1220
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,380
I'll never leave you.

1221
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:13,880
I'll be with you.

1222
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,590
You have me.

1223
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,920
Oh, Nang?

1224
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,420
Is that all for your dessert?

1225
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:30,500
Did you eat it all up?

1226
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:31,670
Yes. It's very nice.

1227
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:33,210
It doesn't stink, right?

1228
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,750
It doesn't. I said it's nice.

1229
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,130
Why? Aren't you confident
in your own skill?

1230
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,420
I knew it. You rotten Paeng!

1231
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,550
I hope Artit breaks your neck.

1232
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:50,380
- Hello, Artit?
- Is Nang there?

1233
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,250
She is. Hold on.

1234
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:54,500
Here.

1235
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,210
Nang, I'm sorry.

1236
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:58,550
I already told Paeng off.

1237
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,300
It's okay.

1238
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:03,340
Were you harsh?

1239
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,170
I understand how you feel.

1240
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,590
You didn't have to tell her off.

1241
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,300
Or there'll be trouble again.

1242
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:15,960
Artit, when are you going
back to Bangkok?

1243
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,050
I'm about to.

1244
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,050
- I'll see you later, Nang.
- Okay, Artit.

1245
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:21,460
What about me?

1246
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,050
You never ask me that.

1247
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:26,670
You're such a jealous type.

1248
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:29,050
We'll see each other
in Bangkok anyway.

1249
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,380
It's only afternoon. You'll arrive
in Bangkok in the evening.

1250
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,210
Should we have dinner?
I'll ask Ling as well.

1251
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,920
- All right.
- See you then.

1252
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:41,170
Bye.

1253
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,800
What are you doing, Non?

1254
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,000
What?

1255
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:46,750
I haven't finished
but you cut it off.

1256
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,300
Don't be so protective of me.

1257
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,340
I'm not protective of you.

1258
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:53,300
I'm protective of my friend, okay?

1259
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:56,670
I'm your sister.

1260
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:59,250
That's right. So, be nice
so that I want to protect you.

1261
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:00,500
Or I'll...

1262
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:02,380
I won't make it for you anymore.

1263
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:03,710
I can buy it myself.

1264
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,050
You went all the way home

1265
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:13,340
but you don't have any souvenirs
for your friends at all.

1266
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:15,300
I go home every week.

1267
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:17,750
Should I bring you souvenirs
every week too?

1268
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,590
If you can, then that's good.

1269
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:20,800
Nex time,

1270
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,920
I'll bring you an invitation
to Artit's wedding.

1271
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:27,590
Non, Artit's stressed about it.

1272
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:31,170
You wait.

1273
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,670
I won't go home anymore

1274
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,170
until this stupid thing has ended.

1275
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:35,630
Oh, really?

1276
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,380
You said so last time.

1277
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,340
Artit, don't be stressed.

1278
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:43,750
After this, let's do some workout
to de-stress.

1279
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:45,300
All right.

1280
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:49,920
Here. I'll feed you.

1281
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,130
You're going to eat or not?

1282
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:03,000
I can't believe my own eyes.

1283
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:04,840
You're not just a normal guy.

1284
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:08,170
You're a special guy. Ling's usually
stingy about her snacks.

1285
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,090
That hurts!

1286
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:14,500
Can you hit me harder? Harder!

1287
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,170
Is that your best shot?

1288
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:19,130
- Non!
- Artit!

1289
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,250
- Non!
- Artit!

1290
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:23,000
- Non!
- Artit!

1291
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:25,340
- Go, Non!
- Go, Artit!

1292
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,380
- Go, Non!
- Go, Artit!

1293
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,420
- Go, Non!
- Artit!

1294
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:32,960
Go! Come on! Ling, cheer them on!

1295
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,170
Go, Artit!

1296
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,420
Another round!

1297
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,880
- Go, Non!
- Come on, Artit!

1298
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:48,210
- Non!
- Go, Artit!

1299
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,460
Non steals the ball back!

1300
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:57,710
Why was he so rough?

1301
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,920
Hey, aren't you
a little too serious?

1302
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:02,300
Some things are acceptable

1303
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:03,960
and some aren't, Artit.

1304
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:07,630
Hold on.

1305
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:10,050
Ling, Kot, do you want
to play with us?

1306
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:12,920
No, who's going to be able
to compete with you?

1307
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:15,630
It might interfere with digestion.
I've eaten a lot earlier.

1308
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:19,090
How about this? If you can take
the ball from us,

1309
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,050
we're happy to do everything.

1310
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:22,920
Don't challenge me.

1311
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:25,050
- Come on.
- Are you in?

1312
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,210
Artit pass the ball to Non.

1313
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,340
Don't be slow. Now who is
he going to pass to next?

1314
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:33,630
He passes to me
and I pass it back to him.

1315
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,460
Who's next? He passes it to Artit.

1316
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:39,590
Ling's being feigned repeatedly.

1317
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
He passes it to Non
and Non passes it...

1318
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:44,550
Watch the knees.

1319
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:46,800
The knees!

1320
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:48,590
I got it!

1321
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,880
Non,

1322
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:59,340
you shouldn't have promised Ling
that you'll do anything.

1323
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,500
I've made a mistake.

1324
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:02,710
I'm sorry.

1325
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,800
I'm the judge.
I'm not involved in this.

1326
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,630
Come on. Stop complaining.

1327
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:10,960
All right. Go!

1328
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,630
Whoa!

1329
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,920
Slap on the butt.

1330
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:26,170
Another slap.

1331
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,840
There! There!

1332
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:45,880
Yes, keep it going!

1333
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,550
Oh?

1334
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:57,170
I thought you went to school.

1335
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:01,300
No, I'm feeling sick.

1336
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,960
She's just pretending to be sick.

1337
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:05,300
What a lazy sloth.

1338
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:07,090
How many days have you taken leave?

1339
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:08,800
Be careful or you won't be
able to take the exams.

1340
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,590
I won't go and talk to
the school for you.

1341
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,800
You don't have to. I don't want to
take the exams anyway.

1342
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,380
Why did you say that?

1343
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,090
She's ungrateful, that's why.

1344
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:19,170
You can't even be responsible
with studying.

1345
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:21,420
Don't hope for any future.

1346
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,250
I already have my future.

1347
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:26,090
What future are you talking about?

1348
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,250
I'm getting married to Artit.

1349
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,880
Oh, dear! Paeng!

1350
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,340
Tubtim, come on.

1351
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:35,840
Paeng, you can't think that way.

1352
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:40,170
Your duty is to study hard
for your own good.

1353
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,550
I'll think about it tomorrow.

1354
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:46,960
Serve breakfast already.

1355
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:04,130
Of course. Just a moment.

1356
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:06,050
I can't stand it anymore.

1357
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,210
Let's brainstorm

1358
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:11,210
about how we can
get rid of that Paeng.

1359
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:12,630
Why? What did she do now?

1360
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:14,050
The same old thing.

1361
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:15,960
She talked back to Madam.

1362
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:19,090
And she declared that she'll have
Mr. Artit as a husband.

1363
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,800
Why do you have to be so loud?
Miss Paeng might hear you.

1364
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,000
- Keep it down.
- Who cares about her?

1365
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,380
I can't stand seeing
her face around.

1366
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,800
Or can you stand her, Saeb?

1367
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,170
I don't have to.

1368
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:32,460
Don't forget that
we're only employees.

1369
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,340
Miss Paeng is
Master's important guest.

1370
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,840
- Are you scared?
- Of course. Aren't you?

1371
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:40,590
But I'm not.

1372
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,800
Even though
she's got Master on her side,

1373
01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:45,840
I have Madam and Mr. Artit on mine.

1374
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,090
That's true.

1375
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:50,340
Are you going to
really get rid of her?

1376
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,630
If I know the way.

1377
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,670
If possible, I want to do it too.

1378
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:58,800
Honestly, I can't stand her anymore.

1379
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,420
Are you thinking
of getting rid of me?

1380
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:15,960
I have nothing to lose!
My parents are all dead!

1381
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,460
I don't need to care
about anyone anymore.

1382
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:19,750
- Artit was going to rape me.
- Liar!

1383
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,050
Hey!

1384
01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:24,210
Mr. Artit had a car accident.

1385
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:28,170
Go to Bangkok.
Stay there for a while.

1386
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:30,880
Come back until everything's better.

1387
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,630
Live a better life, Miss Paeng.

1388
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:35,300
He's very popular nowadays,

1389
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:38,460
in or out of the field. Girls are
clamoring for him.

1390
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,380
Non, this is Dad.

1391
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:43,800
I'm the one who answered the call

1392
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:45,880
and I've heard everything.

1393
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,300
- Are you going to dump me?
- You love Non, don't you?

1394
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,130
Do you know

1395
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:51,840
that you're bad at lying, Ling?
