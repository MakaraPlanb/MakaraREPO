1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,460
If I felt anything towards you,

3
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:39,960
my heart would tremble

4
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:41,340
with excitement, right?

5
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,669
But I don't feel anything at all.

6
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,710
You were so blindly obsessed
with me in the past.

7
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,960
Back then I was so stupid.

8
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,840
I was stupid like a donkey.

9
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:54,669
Why are you picking me up?

10
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,090
Are you crazy?
Are you planning to bite me?

11
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,710
From now on,

12
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,340
I will love you as a friend.

13
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,050
We're going steady.

14
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,419
Are you jealous of me?

15
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,050
Who'd be jealous of a jerk
of a friend like you?

16
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:12,840
If you're not,
then what's up with you?

17
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,840
- Show her some respect.
- Why should I?

18
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,960
Paeng's my girlfriend.
I have to protect her.

19
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,340
How did you get together with Non?

20
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,919
Answer me.

21
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,000
Artit, look after her for a bit.
I'll be back.

22
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,669
Oh?

23
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,250
Non,

24
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,800
you lied to me.

25
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,169
What did I lie to you about?

26
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:08,500
About Paeng.

27
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,550
You and her aren't a couple.

28
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,879
Think what you want.

29
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,670
Because if you are with her,

30
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,550
you wouldn't have gone after Ling.

31
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,920
I'm still adapting.

32
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:26,920
I'm not used to
not caring about Ling.

33
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,250
Because you love her.

34
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,089
I do love her.

35
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,959
Then why are you in a relationship
with Paeng?

36
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,589
I just want to try it out.

37
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,050
You can't do that to her.

38
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,800
You don't love her, so how can
you be in a relationship with her?

39
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,459
Ling won't accept my love

40
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,879
so I had to get over her.

41
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,209
And I think Paeng's lovely.

42
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:53,420
I can probably be with her.

43
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:57,589
You can't treat women as toys.

44
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,050
Or are you possessive of Paeng?

45
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,500
So you're admitting that you're not
possessive of me

46
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:04,709
bur actually Paeng?

47
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:10,209
Why would I worry about
someone like her?

48
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,129
Then stop getting in between us.

49
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,959
And stop making
those angry eyes at me.

50
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,339
I'm going to go shower now.

51
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,670
You're a jerk of a friend.

52
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,670
Do you have any sugar left?

53
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,839
Just a second.

54
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:25,129
- Here.
- Thank you.

55
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,839
Are you here with friends?

56
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,500
That's right.

57
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:43,839
It's pretty cold out.

58
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,129
Are you here with friends as well?

59
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,300
I don't like traveling alone.

60
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:55,089
I wanted to come with
friends but they were all busy.

61
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,589
What should I call you?

62
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,879
It's Paeng.

63
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,709
Paeng?

64
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,050
I'm Mark.

65
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,959
Do you go to university?

66
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,050
I already graduated.

67
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,750
Really?

68
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,300
You have such a babyface.

69
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:17,459
What's your job?

70
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,209
I work in a rose garden.

71
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,920
Unbelievable.

72
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,670
Don't judge a book by its cover.

73
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,129
You seduce everyone.

74
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,879
Are you sleepy, Paeng?

75
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,459
We got up early.

76
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,000
But we'll be arriving at
the school shortly.

77
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,840
I'm not. It's quite fun actually.

78
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,419
If you are sleepy,

79
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,299
you can lean on my shoulder.

80
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,340
What's wrong? Did you fall
asleep at the wheel?

81
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,799
No. I wouldn't be able to fall
asleep anyway.

82
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,590
Should we take
some photos, Non? I'm bored.

83
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,879
Okay.

84
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,169
I'm so sorry.

85
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,590
It's okay.

86
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:14,129
Hey,

87
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,750
thanks for the help.

88
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:19,250
Paeng,

89
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,960
are you hungry?
I brought french fries.

90
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:25,669
Yes, I'm hungry. You're the best.

91
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:27,960
Wow!

92
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,460
Would you like some, Ling?

93
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,340
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

94
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,379
You've got sauce on your face.

95
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,799
You're so funny. It's right here.

96
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,629
- Can you wipe it off for me?
- At the corner of your mouth.

97
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,549
Artit, can you drive more carefully?

98
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,500
Are you hurt, Paeng?

99
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,879
Right here.

100
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:55,960
It's all red.

101
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,500
I'm begging you, Artit.
I'm about to throw up.

102
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,590
Thank you very much.
The children will be very happy.

103
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:21,090
We brought some sports equipment
this time too. They might like it.

104
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,000
You come to donate every year.
It's been very helpful.

105
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,129
Don't hurry back yet.

106
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:28,549
We're not intending to anyway.

107
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:32,000
We'll throw you a Khan Toke Banquet
as a thank you.

108
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,669
That would be great.

109
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,629
There are two rooms available
at the teacher housing.

110
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,590
I'll have someone prepare
them for you.

111
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,840
It's okay. We can do it ourselves.

112
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:44,210
Is that okay?

113
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,299
We can do it, right?

114
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,879
- Let's sleep here tonight, Paeng.
- Okay.

115
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:51,840
It's time for the children
to have lunch.

116
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,210
Would you like to go now?

117
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,090
- Let's go.
- Please.

118
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,250
- Okay.
- Please.

119
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:58,090
This way, please.

120
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,919
- Please.
- Over this way.

121
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,129
(Eat hot food, use a serving
spoon, and wash your hands)

122
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,379
Who hasn't gotten any yet?

123
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,419
Would you like some?

124
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,379
Here you go.

125
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:19,750
Are they hungry?

126
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,169
Here it is.

127
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:25,879
Pass it on.

128
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,669
Pass this on to your friend.

129
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:54,460
Thank you.

130
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,129
Where's Non?

131
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,960
I don't know.

132
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,419
He's probably taking care of Ling.

133
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,169
I thought you liked Non?

134
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,919
Why are you indifferent
when I say that?

135
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:26,299
They're friends. It's not strange
for them to take care of each other.

136
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,460
Non loves Ling.

137
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:32,460
And why are you telling me this?

138
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,919
Well, I don't want to see
a dummy being fooled.

139
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,210
Paeng,

140
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:45,960
I think that you and Non
aren't really in a relationship.

141
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,960
Am I right?

142
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,590
I don't know.

143
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,840
Non asked me to be his girlfriend.

144
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,840
I like him so I said yes.

145
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,549
I'm telling you that he loves Ling.

146
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,629
If he does,

147
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,500
then why would he ask me
to be his girlfriend?

148
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,460
He's lying to you.

149
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,169
I'm okay with that.

150
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,919
So you want to be a donkey?

151
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,669
That's right. I'm okay
with being a donkey.

152
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,210
I can wait for him.

153
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:19,500
Hee-haw!

154
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,000
Non!

155
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,379
Non!

156
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,799
Where are you, Non? Are you around?

157
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,960
Nang, pretty lady.
What are you doing here?

158
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,840
Have you seen Non?

159
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,340
"Kot, you handsome guy.
Have you seen Non?"

160
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:11,590
Be polite to me first.

161
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,840
No!

162
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,049
Then I won't tell you.

163
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,549
Okay.

164
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,129
Kot, you handsome guy.

165
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,500
Have you seen Non?

166
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,879
I haven't.

167
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,549
You're being cheeky.

168
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:29,210
I'm not. I'm telling the truth.

169
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,129
You're his sister, so why
don't you know where he is?

170
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,919
I'm not his keeper,
I don't know his every move

171
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,960
I'm not either.

172
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,379
Jerk. I'm not talking to you.
What a waste of time!

173
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,299
Non!

174
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,960
"Jerk. I'm not talking to you.
What a waste of time!"

175
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:52,669
Walking away like that.

176
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,750
You think you're a model?

177
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,919
Oh?

178
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,840
- Hello, Auntie.
- Hello.

179
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:01,549
I made you some fish congee.

180
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,299
Thank you.

181
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,920
Is Artit still asleep?

182
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,339
Oh?

183
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:16,630
Didn't you know then he went on
a charity trip up North with Non?

184
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,960
- Oh? Did they?
- Yes.

185
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,049
I didn't know. Non didn't
tell me anything.

186
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,960
Who went with them?

187
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,339
I heard there are
four people on the trip.

188
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,750
There's Ling, Kot, Artit, and Non.

189
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:34,589
Why are you making that face?

190
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,920
Anything's the matter?

191
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,839
Kot didn't go with them.

192
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,670
- Huh?
- Who's the fourth person?

193
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,960
Oh?

194
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:44,750
It's Paeng.

195
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,549
What?

196
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,920
Non asked for my permission.

197
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,170
Kot! What do you have for sale?

198
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm not dreaming, am I?

199
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,799
Why did you slap me?

200
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,500
So you'll know that
you're not dreaming.

201
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,750
Whoa.

202
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,589
I've helped you.

203
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,880
It's time for you to help me.

204
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,130
Again? I don't want to.

205
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,000
No, you have to come
with me right now!

206
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:20,049
Nang, hold on. What's going on?

207
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,839
Do you see? Non
tricked you into coming on a trip.

208
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,380
Not at all, Ling.
It's fun. I like it.

209
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,089
Where is it?

210
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,750
I'll let Artit fix it for you.

211
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:42,380
Uh...

212
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,380
Here. There's a nail poking out.

213
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,670
I'm afraid it might snag someone
when they walk by.

214
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,880
Artit, can you hammer it down?

215
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,799
Paeng,

216
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,799
would you like some water?

217
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,960
My hands are dirty.

218
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:23,670
I'll help you.

219
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,089
It's so refreshing!

220
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,210
It's nice and cold. One more sip?

221
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,380
Artit, are you okay?

222
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,339
I knew it.

223
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,710
I'll go check on Artit.

224
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,130
I'll do it.

225
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:25,630
I think

226
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,000
maybe let Paeng do it.

227
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,339
Okay.

228
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,750
Uh...

229
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,130
Aren't you going to clean the floor?

230
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,130
Keeping cleaning.

231
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,380
Here. I'll wash it for you.

232
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,380
Paeng might overthink things
if you do this.

233
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,670
She won't.

234
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:08,420
Believe me.

235
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,250
What's up with you?

236
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,960
You're making me feel bad.
Do you know that?

237
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,250
What did I do?

238
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,960
Put it on.

239
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:16,630
Really!

240
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,549
I'll do it for you.

241
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,339
Hey!

242
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,130
It's not done yet.

243
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,380
Stay still.

244
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,920
Don't be nice to me.

245
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,920
I won't fall for you like Non did.

246
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,670
You don't have to fall for me.

247
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:10,130
Just stop hating me.

248
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:21,299
I'm probably hoping for too much.

249
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:24,380
Then,

250
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,000
I'd like to ask you

251
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:30,839
to hate me less. That's all.

252
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,250
I'm sorry.

253
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,210
That's virtually impossible.

254
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,630
Are you upset about me and Paeng?

255
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:22,170
I'm not.

256
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,089
Don't lie to yourself.

257
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,799
A person who runs away
from their feelings

258
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,210
won't be happy in life.

259
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:36,460
We've reached this point.

260
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,170
I think you should admit it.

261
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,420
I don't understand.

262
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,920
What are you doing?

263
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,960
I'm not trying to win over Paeng.

264
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,170
And I'm not in
a relationship with her either.

265
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,670
I'm doing this

266
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,250
because I want to know how you feel.

267
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,299
What about Paeng?

268
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,630
She's working with me.

269
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,960
You're so mean.

270
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,170
If I wasn't mean,

271
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,339
then I won't know how you feel.

272
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,299
Why did you have to lie to me?

273
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,750
It's you

274
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,460
who's lying to yourself.

275
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:31,710
Stop running away.

276
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,549
I know we feel the same way.

277
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,170
I don't want you to love me.

278
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,210
I can't do that.

279
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,170
And I don't want to love you.

280
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,299
Why not?

281
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,089
I'm afraid that

282
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,589
I'm not good enough to deserve you.

283
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,920
Ling,

284
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,130
I don't care about the future.

285
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,299
But I'm going to make
the best out of today.

286
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,750
When we reach our final day in life,

287
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,250
we're not going to be sad

288
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,880
over the mistakes we've made

289
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:29,710
but over the things we never did,

290
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,339
even though we wanted to.

291
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:36,420
I think

292
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,130
we shouldn't let our lives
go on like that.

293
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,670
If you don't love me,

294
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,339
I'll stop

295
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,589
and I'll let you go.

296
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,380
But if you do,

297
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,170
let's give it a go.

298
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,170
Are you cold, Paeng?

299
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,130
Put on a sweater.

300
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,339
Artit, have some
spicy Northern sausages.

301
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,250
I don't have an appetite.

302
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,549
Eat up.

303
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,920
You can always have more.

304
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:17,130
Thank you. Everything is so tasty.

305
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,049
Does it suit your taste?

306
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,799
I'd probably be so fat
if I stayed here for a month.

307
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,000
Please make yourselves comfortable.

308
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:26,250
Thank you.

309
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:29,170
Paeng,

310
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,920
do you want some spicy minced pork?
I'll serve you.

311
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,710
It's okay. I can do it.

312
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,170
Non, I think he's reached his
maximum hate level towards me.

313
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,670
Don't be afraid of him then.

314
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,250
Here you are.

315
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,130
Don't get full yet.

316
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,710
I've got you something good.

317
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:00,170
What is it?

318
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,000
It's a local drink.

319
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,839
It's unique to this place.

320
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,250
Okay.

321
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

322
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,049
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

323
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,549
It's so sweet.

324
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:16,960
Isn't it nice, Ling?

325
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,960
Very nice.

326
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:40,630
Hey!

327
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,500
Move out of the way!
I'm walking here!

328
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:46,339
Are you crazy?

329
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,250
Get out of the way!

330
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,630
You keep getting in the way.
Why are you like this?

331
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,000
Paeng, Paeng.

332
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,299
Are you okay?

333
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:57,420
You're picking a fight with a tree.

334
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,250
- Tree?
- Yes.

335
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,710
Tree!

336
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,460
I'm thirsty.

337
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:08,130
- I'm thirsty.
- Easy, easy.

338
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:11,630
You're such a lightweight.
I should have let you drink so much.

339
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,420
A lightweight?
Who are you calling a lightweight?

340
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,960
Who? Who?

341
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,920
I'm so thirsty.

342
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,089
Who turned off the lights?

343
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,500
She's wasted.

344
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,920
I'll look after her.

345
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,630
You? Looking after her?

346
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,089
Get lost. She's mine.

347
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,920
I mean she's my employee.

348
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,500
It's not working hours right now.

349
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,799
And this is not your farm.

350
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,839
Paeng, come with me.

351
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,380
Where are we going?

352
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,589
Paeng,

353
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,170
- come with me.
- I won't.

354
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:55,920
- Artit.
- What?

355
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:57,750
Come here, Paeng.

356
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,250
Paeng, Paeng.

357
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,500
Come on.

358
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,710
- Paeng.
- Don't pull me. It hurts.

359
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,210
Should we split me into two parts
so that you can have each half?

360
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,170
Really.

361
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,500
Paeng, where are you going?

362
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:20,839
- Paeng.
- Mister,

363
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,839
please check on your friend.
She's very drunk.

364
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,420
Okay. Artit.

365
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,920
I'm thirsty.

366
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,000
Ling?

367
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:37,130
How are you feeling?

368
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:39,420
Non,

369
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,380
I feel like throwing up.

370
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,839
Not yet. This way.

371
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,089
Here. This way.

372
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:01,630
Are you okay?

373
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,299
I don't usually see
you drink this much.

374
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,130
Why did you drink so much tonight?

375
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,380
It was so sweet.

376
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:14,339
Are you still feeling nauseous?

377
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,500
Would you like some water?

378
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,130
Don't worry about me.

379
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,670
I'm fine.

380
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,299
I can take care of myself.

381
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,130
I'm tough.

382
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:54,500
Ling? Ling?

383
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,170
Don't tell me you've fallen asleep.

384
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,880
Hey?

385
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,049
You've fallen asleep.

386
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,960
Come here.

387
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,960
Walk carefully

388
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,170
or you'll fall off a cliff,
you sassy girl.

389
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,460
Who's sassy?

390
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,250
Who?

391
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,920
- Huh?
- You're so tough when you're drunk?

392
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,210
Right. Yes.

393
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,380
Do you think I'm scared
because you're bigger?

394
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:44,880
Power-hungry jerk.

395
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:47,170
And you're still insulting me?

396
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,460
No, I wasn't.

397
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,670
I was insulting the wind, the sky,

398
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,420
and the water.

399
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,210
But if you want to take it,

400
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,670
I'll let you have it.

401
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,839
Cheeky.

402
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,750
Go to bed.

403
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:10,210
I won't. Non! Where are you?

404
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,630
Why are you calling him now?

405
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,170
- Stop! Stop!
- Non!

406
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,920
Let me go. I don't
want to be with you.

407
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,710
I don't trust you.

408
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,130
You're mean and narrow-minded.

409
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,550
You like bullying and tormenting me.

410
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,380
I hate you!

411
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,550
I hate you!

412
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,090
Hey, Paeng!

413
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,460
Do you think I want to have
anything to do with you?

414
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,960
Don't throw a fit around here.
It's embarrassing.

415
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,000
- Let's go.
- I'm not going!

416
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,090
Oh, you're not?

417
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,590
You're not?

418
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,880
Artit, let me go!

419
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,340
- Let me go! Non!
- Stay still!

420
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,420
You meanie! You bully women!

421
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,750
It hurts.

422
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,300
It hurts.

423
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,750
You wanted me to let you go,
didn't you? I have now.

424
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,340
You black-hearted person.

425
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,210
You're cruel

426
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,050
and inhumane.

427
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,210
Whoa, you're good at hurling out
the insults when you're drunk.

428
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,670
That's right. I'm good.

429
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:29,050
Do you think you're so handsome?
And that's why I'd want you?

430
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,590
I was just too oblivious
in the past.

431
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,340
Wanfahmai!

432
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,840
Hey!

433
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,630
You narrow-minded person.

434
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,920
You're fixated on the past.

435
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,380
I'm not the same person anymore.

436
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,840
Stop talking. It's annoying.

437
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,460
No, I'm going to talk.

438
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,710
You're not the same person.

439
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,960
You used to be so much better.

440
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,750
I used to be so in love with you.

441
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,340
But now,

442
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,460
even if I got paid 20 million to
marry you, I wouldn't take it.

443
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,130
Eww!

444
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,880
I said stop talking.

445
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,800
Or I'll find something
to tape your mouth shut.

446
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,920
I don't want to be near you.

447
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,340
I hate you.

448
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,250
It's my room.

449
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,500
Paeng?

450
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,340
Paeng?

451
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,840
I'll take you to your room.

452
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,800
Leave me alone!

453
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,500
Paeng, come on.

454
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,170
I'm sleepy. I'll stay here.

455
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,170
Why am I worried about her?

456
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,210
Nonsense.

457
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,340
How come I'm worried about her?

458
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,300
No way.

459
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,710
I don't feel anything at all.

460
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,590
I don't like you.

461
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,840
It's obvious.

462
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,170
Even when I'm this close to you,

463
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,300
I still don't feel anything.

464
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,500
You just provoked me,
you sassy girl.

465
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,420
Paeng!

466
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,170
I'm comfortable. Don't fret.

467
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,170
Kot, are we going the right way?

468
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,300
Of course. According to the GPS,

469
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,420
we'll make it there for sure.
Don't worry.

470
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,590
(Dead end)

471
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,000
Hey!

472
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,960
Kot, you jerk!

473
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,300
You said you were following the GPS.

474
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,590
I was but I...

475
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,380
I might have put
in the wrong destination.

476
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,090
I'm sorry! Stop! I'm sorry!

477
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:49,300
Reverse then!

478
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,340
Reverse? Okay.

479
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,920
- Oh, shoot.
- What?

480
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,590
What?

481
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,710
What's wrong with the car?

482
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,090
What's wrong with the car!?

483
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,130
Nang,

484
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,590
how long are you going to sit
like that?

485
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,460
Don't be angry or hate me.

486
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,920
The car just ran out of gas,
that's all.

487
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,960
Do you think the car running
out of gas is a small issue?

488
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,300
You're the driver.

489
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,710
Why didn't you check the fuel gauge?

490
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,420
You can't just drive and
not pay attention to anything else.

491
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,130
I'm sorry.

492
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,340
Nang, it's my fault.

493
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,090
Don't be angry or hate me.

494
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,420
No!

495
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,630
I'm not okay.

496
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,670
And I won't forgive you easily.

497
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,920
I think you should get some rest.

498
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,500
Tomorrow morning I'll hitch a ride
and get us some gas, okay?

499
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,630
Maybe not.

500
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,380
Non.

501
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,670
Did you go inside the room?

502
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,460
I went to grab some clothes
and then came here for a bath.

503
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,960
What did you do to Paeng last night?

504
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,380
Nothing.

505
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,050
I stayed with Ling
until I fell asleep.

506
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,500
Hold on.

507
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,210
You stayed with Ling.

508
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,050
But what about Paeng?

509
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,340
I thought you were her boyfriend.

510
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,210
Well, weren't you watching over her?

511
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,630
It's a nice view. Good location.

512
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,090
Take off your clothes and get in.

513
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,300
It's comfortable.

514
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,630
Whoa!

515
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,130
Whoa! It's so cold!

516
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,420
One, two, three!

517
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,750
It's not my room!

518
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,380
Did you stay with me
the whole night?

519
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:44,920
Where's Paeng?

520
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,050
Artit was with her.

521
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,920
What's up with those two?

522
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,000
Let them be.

523
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,590
I don't want to know.

524
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,800
I only want to know about us.

525
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,840
I told you everything last night.

526
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,420
I'm still waiting for your answer.

527
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,090
Whether you want to be with me,
or not.

528
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,710
Aren't you afraid that someday,

529
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,800
if we can't make it work

530
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,300
that our friendship

531
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,630
would also end?

532
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,670
If I'm afraid,

533
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,880
I wouldn't have waited
for you for so long.

534
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,500
Aren't you afraid someday

535
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,840
I'll make you feel sad?

536
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:02,800
I'm not.

537
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,340
Aren't you afraid someday

538
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,500
I'll leave you again?

539
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,920
I'm not.

540
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,840
I'm ready to face everything.

541
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,420
No matter what's going to happen.

542
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,750
I'm not afraid of things
that haven't happened yet.

543
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,670
I just want to be with you now,

544
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,210
to love you,

545
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,000
and to take care of you.

546
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,300
As long as I know that your heart
is with mine,

547
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,880
I don't need anything else.

548
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,920
Be with me, Ling.

549
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,840
Who should I ask?

550
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,000
What's up?

551
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:35,670
Well...

552
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,800
I was drunk last night.

553
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,710
I woke up in your room.

554
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:45,920
You don't remember anything?

555
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,880
Last night,

556
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:52,840
you were going to assault me.

557
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,550
- That's impossible.
- It's already possible.

558
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,630
- That's not true.
- It is.

559
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,500
I don't feel anything
for you anymore.

560
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:06,340
If you don't, then why
would you do that?

561
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,920
I didn't mean it.

562
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,300
Artit, I'm sorry.

563
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,880
I didn't know what I was doing.
I really didn't mean it.

564
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,460
It's because you want me.

565
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:27,840
I didn't know what I was doing.

566
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,380
How are you going to atone for this?

567
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,250
What do you want me to do?

568
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,460
I'll let you know.

569
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,340
You're going to be dead for sure.

570
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,250
Oh, shoot!

571
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,500
Don't ever drink again, Paeng!

572
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,500
Ahh.

573
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,840
You followed me here?

574
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:11,250
It doesn't matter if it's heaven
or hell, I'm going to follow you.

575
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,800
So cheesy.

576
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,800
- Paeng.
- Don't fight each other.

577
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,130
Get lost.

578
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,750
I'll go find some help then.

579
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,750
So who do you want?

580
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,630
Artit or Non?

581
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,630
It would be nice if I could get
the both of them.

582
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,880
I'm not going to let
you have anyone,

583
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,670
not my brother or Artit.

584
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,670
You'll never get either of them.

585
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:44,300
Are you finished?

586
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,250
You parentless child!

587
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,750
You orphan!

588
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:57,590
You should've died in the
car crash with your parents!

589
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:01,960
I want to know

590
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,550
how long you're going
to be this evil.

591
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,210
Thank you

592
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,210
for making me realize

593
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,880
that I don't feel any pain from
your words anymore.

594
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,090
Let her go.

595
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,550
Ouch! Ouch!

596
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,420
Who are you?

597
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:37,300
It's you who should to stay
away from her.

598
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:55,670
Are you hurt?

599
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,500
A little bit.

600
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,670
Thank you.

601
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,250
I'm Mark.

602
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,960
Mark,

603
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:08,210
so we meet again. Perfect timing.

604
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,380
Why is she bullying you?

605
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,550
We've been arguing for a while now.

606
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,590
But I don't want to make
a big deal of it.

607
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,420
Because if I want to fight,

608
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,300
she wouldn't stand a chance.

609
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,590
I'm serious.

610
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,880
Okay. I believe you.

611
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,210
It's strange though.
We've met two days in a row now.

612
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,840
That's true.

613
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,210
From that mountain

614
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,880
to this one.

615
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:43,800
That's true.

616
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,800
You told me you grow roses.

617
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,210
Is it for fun or business?

618
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,210
I turn them into products to sell.

619
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:56,800
Really?

620
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,130
I'm very good at marketing.

621
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,960
If you're interested,
I could be your consultant.

622
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,840
- Really?
- Yes.

623
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,460
Artit, hurry.

624
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:12,170
Nang, have you seen Paeng?

625
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,670
You just saw me, but instead
of being worried about me,

626
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,460
you're asking for someone else.

627
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,460
Artit, I wanted
to come on the trip too.

628
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,960
But Paeng...

629
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,050
Where is she?

630
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,340
Paeng's with a guy.

631
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,630
They look really close.

632
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:36,920
It's like they agreed to meet.

633
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,460
They're over there.

634
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,000
Go ahead. You might find them.

635
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,840
Come on.

636
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,170
Come on!

637
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,630
Let's go.

638
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,500
Here.

639
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,340
That's true.

640
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:05,800
Who is that, Artit?

641
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,460
You sassy girl.

642
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:10,800
- I'll have to excuse myself.
- Okay.

643
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,630
I'll see you later.

644
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,420
Come on. Time to go.

645
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,340
Paeng,

646
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,300
Ling will come with us.

647
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,550
Really? That's great.

648
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,840
Paeng, come to my car.

649
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,250
Come on, Ling.

650
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,500
Hold on. I just got here.

651
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,590
Kot, bring my sister home.

652
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:54,050
Can't we at least share a meal?

653
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:55,670
Non!

654
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,210
Really!

655
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,130
Is this even possible?

656
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,590
I haven't even had any sleep.

657
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,500
Do you know that guy?

658
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:21,090
I asked you a question.
Are you deaf?

659
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,380
I didn't know you're talking to me.

660
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,670
You just spoke suddenly.

661
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,710
There's only the two of us.
Who else would I be talking to?

662
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,300
Who is that?

663
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,630
It's Mark.

664
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,960
Who is he?

665
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,340
I don't know him.

666
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,000
You don't know him?

667
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,960
You look liked you were close.

668
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,130
That's impressive.

669
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,000
What is?

670
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,420
Your seduction skills.

671
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:01,960
I didn't seduce him.

672
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,000
Last night,

673
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,750
did I really do something to you?

674
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:20,920
Do you think I was lying?

675
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,460
Do you want to see the pictures?

676
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,960
I don't have any.

677
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,250
Who's going to take a selfie
during that kind of thing?

678
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,050
What did you do then?

679
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,840
I hurried out and slept outside.

680
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,500
I can't let my guard down
when you're around.

681
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,500
Miss Paeng!

682
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,630
Why did you come back
with Mr. Artit?

683
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,300
And why the long face?

684
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,710
Was he bullying you again?

685
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,380
What did he do to you?

686
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:58,750
Oh?

687
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,800
He didn't do anything to me.

688
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,500
But I did something to him.

689
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,710
What did you do to him?

690
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,500
He'll get you back again. Haven't
you learned your lesson?

691
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,920
He also threatened me

692
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,800
and said that I'll be dead for sure.

693
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,380
Dead?

694
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,710
What are you going to do?

695
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,250
I'll do anything.

696
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,300
Anything to atone for my mistake.

697
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,420
Huh? What did you say?

698
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,550
Artit came back with Paeng?

699
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,090
That's right. Just the two of them.

700
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,210
I couldn't stop them in time.
They just disappeared.

701
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:55,210
Krongprateep!

702
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:57,250
You said Paeng liked Non.

703
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:59,880
She's actually waiting for Artit.

704
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:04,210
What should I do, Nang?

705
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,750
Don't worry, Auntie.

706
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,630
I'll take Artit back.

707
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,210
What are you going to do?

708
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,090
You've made so many mistakes.

709
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,130
Auntie, trust me.

710
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,670
I won't lose Artit.

711
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,670
We'll fight together.

712
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,800
Okay. We'll fight together, right?

713
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,300
Yes.

714
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:51,250
Get off!

715
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,960
What are you thinking?

716
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:19,130
Oh!

717
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:21,250
I was thinking...

718
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:23,250
about work.

719
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,340
Since you got back,

720
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,340
I haven't seen you.

721
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:30,300
Are you trying to avoid me?

722
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,210
I'm not.

723
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:34,840
Why would I do that?

724
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,590
When you do something wrong,

725
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:43,170
you always avoid me.

726
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,380
I...

727
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,000
I just wanted to hurry back to work.

728
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:54,250
I was gone for so many days,
everything is backed up.

729
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:58,300
Are you sure that you're not going
to tell me the truth?

730
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,210
What truth?

731
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,800
Well, there's the fact

732
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,170
you came back with Paeng.

733
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,170
Who told you?

734
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,550
Nang did.

735
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:16,800
We live at the same place.

736
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,630
It's not strange to carpool.

737
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,210
But for people who hate each other,

738
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,090
isn't it uncomfortable

739
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,420
to sit in a car
together for that long?

740
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:28,130
I just put up with it.

741
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,550
Don't lie to me.

742
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:33,250
Artit,

743
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,420
I'm telling you now.

744
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,960
Don't you ever give in to her.

745
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,090
What are you doing, Miss Paeng?

746
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,710
Aren't you going to experiment
with the soap you made?

747
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,050
I tried it out.

748
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,300
My face was so soft.

749
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,340
Aueng,

750
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,250
I just tried making body soap.

751
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,170
It smelled so nice.

752
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,250
It's a waste to only use it
only on the body.

753
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,960
Your tea smells nice too.

754
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:44,670
It looks really pretty
and delicious.

755
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,800
Are you making some for me to try?

756
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,460
Wow, I'm so lucky.

757
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,550
Make lots of them, Miss Paeng.

758
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:58,750
Come in.

759
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,630
Miss Paeng made something for you.

760
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:13,920
In hopes that her punishment
might be less harsh.

761
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:16,630
Is she scared?

762
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,050
A little bit.

763
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:21,250
She said that

764
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,130
if you're not going to eat and
throw it away, she's okay with that.

765
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,250
Are these rose petals edible?

766
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,420
Of course.

767
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,420
She grew the roses just for this.

768
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:01,210
For food, desserts, and products.

769
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,920
This is her first product.

770
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:06,130
And you're the first to taste it.

771
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,670
So I'm the guinea pig?

772
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,170
Just to taste it.

773
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,710
"To atone for what I did.

774
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,340
This is for you, Artit."

775
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:20,170
Anyway, what did she do?

776
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,130
Something very severe.

777
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,800
And I'm very angry.

778
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,550
She guessed it right.

779
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,090
Guessed what?

780
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:34,800
That you're still angry.

781
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,630
But she also said,

782
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:40,170
that she'll be nice to you,
little by little.

783
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,300
So that I'll give in?

784
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,590
What if I don't forgive her,
what would she do?

785
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,340
She'll keep going.

786
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,380
What if she keeps going,

787
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,380
but I still won't forgive her?
What would she do then?

788
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,300
Uh...

789
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,960
I don't know anymore.

790
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,210
I have to go now. Goodbye.

791
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:44,800
What kind of guy would
eat something like this?

792
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,210
- Aueng!
- Miss Paeng.

793
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,840
Bad news?

794
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:15,460
Yes. It's a waste of time.

795
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:18,210
It's going to be difficult
to get him to forgive you.

796
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,340
Miss Paeng!

797
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:36,750
Artit,

798
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,380
you two left me with Nang.

799
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,130
I'm exhausted.

800
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,130
What a high-maintenance woman.

801
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:48,090
Can you believe that I felt like
I was in a living hell?

802
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:51,300
She wouldn't even let me stop for
street food.

803
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:53,750
She's angry with you and Non but
took it all out on me.

804
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,460
I don't understand it at all.

805
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,170
All the way from the summit
to the foot of the mountain,

806
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,880
my ears are numb.

807
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,880
I haven't eaten anything.

808
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,920
Hey!

809
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,800
I can't even eat this?

810
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,630
Why are you so heartless?

811
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,590
I had to put up with Nang's rant

812
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,920
- from the summit to the foot.
- Here.

813
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:26,710
Go buy something for yourself.

814
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,920
Now, this is what you call
friendship.

815
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,210
Would you like anything?
It's my treat.

816
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,630
No? I'm going then. Thank you.

817
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,630
This is the first rose
that blossomed in my garden.

818
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:16,590
Please wish me success, Mom and Dad.

819
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,300
You little rascal,
what are you doing?

820
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,340
I want a sibling.

821
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,000
Miss Paeng,

822
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,500
aren't you going to bed?
What are you writing?

823
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,840
I'm about to go to sleep.

824
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:35,170
Wait!

825
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:37,380
It's good that you're awake.

826
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,340
Uh... Well...

827
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:42,880
Let's go to the kitchen.

828
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,590
Why?

829
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,250
We're out of drinking water.

830
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,090
And I forget to get some.

831
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:52,840
The way to the kitchen is so dark.

832
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:56,050
I'm too lowly to walk
there by myself.

833
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:57,550
It's "lonely."

834
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,920
That's it.

835
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:01,130
You're afraid of ghosts.

836
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,800
Hey! Miss Paeng, don't say that!

837
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:05,550
Otherwise, they might come.

838
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,090
Okay, I won't mention them.

839
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:10,420
I'll keep you company.

840
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,590
You're the best.

841
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,210
- Let's go.
- Aueng,

842
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,670
you're this scared, huh?

843
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,130
Everyone, concentrate.

844
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:30,630
This is serious.

845
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:32,800
You can't be fooling
around with this.

846
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:36,300
Since you thought of doing it,
then you have to it.

847
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:38,000
Geeve mee the eensense.

848
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,880
Huh?

849
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,880
Geeve mee the eensense.

850
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,090
Huh?

851
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,960
Give me the incense!

852
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:48,300
Come on!

853
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:50,670
It's the language of
the divine spirits.

854
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:52,460
The loitair.

855
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,500
- Huh?
- Lighter!

856
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:58,420
- Oh, the lighter!
- Just say it!

857
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,340
Poot ye hans togezer.

858
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,550
Put your hands together.

859
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:09,460
You're such a know-it-all.

860
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:11,130
Of course.

861
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,920
Alright. Focus.

862
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,250
Concentrate.

863
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:34,800
Put your finger on the cup.

864
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:39,960
Phut-Tho-Tha-Ya

865
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:42,880
Phut-Tho-Tha-Ya

866
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,630
Phut-Tho-Tha-Ya

867
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,340
Phut-Tho-Tha-Ya

868
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,590
What are you doing?

869
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,670
Come on!

870
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:53,550
You startled us!

871
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:55,130
You came out of nowhere!

872
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:56,960
You might get possessed!

873
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:58,880
What are you doing?

874
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,750
Playing Hi-Lo, maybe?

875
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:11,710
Ouija board?

876
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,380
That's right. Oh yeah board.

877
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,380
Ouija board.

878
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,800
(Rest)

879
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,250
Do you know it?

880
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,340
I've heard of it.
But I've never used one.

881
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:27,340
What are you doing? It's insulting.

882
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,630
Aren't you scared?

883
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,670
I'm not.

884
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:35,210
Last time, my friend got
three numbers.

885
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,090
- The lottery?
- Puppies.

886
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,500
Of course, the lottery.

887
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:42,210
Then, I'm in.

888
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:43,960
Aren't you scared anymore?

889
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:48,210
If they're here to bring us good
luck, then don't need to be scared.

890
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,840
You're just like me, Aueng.

891
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,420
If we summon a spirit we know,

892
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:56,710
the winning numbers are going to
be even more accurate.

893
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,550
A spirit that I know?

894
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,550
I don't want to! I'm scared!

895
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:03,590
Is it really possible
to summon them?

896
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:06,210
It's up to each person's judgment.

897
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,670
It's just for fun, Miss Paeng.
It's nothing serious.

898
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,550
Miss Paeng,

899
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:14,460
you can ask anything.

900
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,630
Anything you'd like to know.

901
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,630
But on one condition,

902
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:22,710
if you're rude,
they might not answer you.

903
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,500
But if you want to ask, fire away.

904
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,550
So I can ask anything?

905
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:36,590
Then I'm in.

906
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,090
Alright!

907
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,840
Mom,

908
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:59,250
if you can hear me,

909
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,590
I'd like to talk to you.

910
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,880
Put your finger on the cup.

911
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:04,960
Phut-Tho-Tha-Ya

912
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,340
Phut-Tho-Tha-Ya

913
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:13,500
Phut-Tho-Tha-Ya

914
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:20,090
Whoa! Th-th-they're here?

915
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,000
Are you the person I summoned?

916
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,460
Don't tell me...

917
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,090
Miss Paeng, ask anything you want.

918
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,170
Can you tell me

919
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,340
who killed you?

920
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,300
Don't let your finger
get off the glass

921
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,840
Where is it going?

922
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:56,340
"A"

923
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:57,840
"M"

924
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,000
"A"

925
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,590
"N"

926
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,250
A man?

927
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,630
A man?

928
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,250
Do you know what his name is?

929
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,800
- What is it?
- Why is it going in circles?

930
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:19,500
What is it?

931
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,000
Oh?

932
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:28,460
What are you playing at?

933
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,880
Mr. Artit.

934
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:33,590
Pong, it's ruined.
Will we be possessed?

935
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:34,750
That's right.

936
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:38,090
Who's possessed? An ouija board?

937
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,960
Tell me who started it.

938
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:46,840
It's late. You should all be resting

939
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,210
so that you'll be energized
for work tomorrow.

940
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:49,670
What is this?

941
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:51,840
It's nonsense.

942
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:54,500
Pong,

943
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,380
you're the oldest.
Why didn't you stop them?

944
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,420
Uh...

945
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:02,210
It's Pong who asked us.

946
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:06,460
You too.

947
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,960
Are you crazy?
Why did you join them?

948
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:14,840
You have a bachelor's degree but
believe in something like this.

949
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,710
Did you ever consider
that you're a woman?

950
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:23,670
You got out late. People will say
you're out seducing men.

951
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,170
Do you want people to think
worse than they already do?

952
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:31,340
Isn't that too harsh, Mr. Artit.

953
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,500
No, it's not, Pong.

954
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,130
You're an adult now.
Can't you think for yourself?

955
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,250
You're in a circle of men.

956
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,130
There's probably only one thing
on your mind.

957
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:43,800
No decent woman would do this.

958
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,210
Go! Get back to bed!

959
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,880
Disperse.

960
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:52,670
Is it so wrong that
I wanted to know?

961
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:57,000
I haven't caused you
trouble for a while now.

962
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:00,170
Why do you have
to keep harassing me?

963
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:05,670
What did you want to know?

964
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:07,250
It's my business.

965
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:10,750
I don't care what people
think of me anymore.

966
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:12,880
Because I didn't do anything wrong.

967
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:17,050
It's you who keeps finding
fault with me.

968
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,460
Are you accusing me of doing that?

969
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:21,630
That's right.

970
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:24,420
You're always harassing me

971
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,050
because you hate me.

972
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,250
You hate me!

973
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,090
I hate you too!

974
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:35,090
I hate you, Artit!

975
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:36,920
And do you think I'm so into you?

976
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,920
Miss Paeng!

977
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,050
Miss Paeng!

978
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,630
Saeb, what happened?

979
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:29,420
Tell me.

980
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,590
Well,

981
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:33,670
Aueng and Miss Paeng
came to get some water.

982
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,880
Well,

983
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,800
we put out the ouija board to ask
for some lottery numbers.

984
01:23:40,710 --> 01:23:42,550
But when Miss Paeng came,

985
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:44,210
she asked to join.

986
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,590
- She summoned the ghost herself.
- That's right.

987
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,590
Who did she summon?

988
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,800
I don't know.

989
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:55,750
But Miss Paeng wished inwardly.

990
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:57,500
And she said something like,

991
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,210
"who killed you?"

992
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:03,880
"Who killed you?"

993
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:07,920
That's right.

994
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:11,050
And the ghost said "a man."

995
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,630
Enough! Nonsense!

996
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,590
Get back to bed.

997
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:56,090
You're an adult now.
Can't you think for yourself?

998
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,880
You're in a circle of men.

999
01:24:58,590 --> 01:24:59,750
There's probably only one thing
on your mind.

1000
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:02,380
No decent woman would do this.

1001
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:32,550
I haven't caused you
trouble for a while now.

1002
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,920
Why do you have
to keep harassing me?

1003
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,960
You're always harassing me

1004
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,590
because you hate me.

1005
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,880
I hate you too!

1006
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,130
I hate you, Artit!

1007
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:04,590
I hate you, Artit!

1008
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,500
And do you think I'm so into you?

1009
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,710
Dad.

1010
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:36,420
Where's Mom?

1011
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:39,710
She's probably in the kitchen.

1012
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:48,000
Dad,

1013
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:50,920
I have something to ask you.

1014
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,000
What is it?

1015
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:55,170
Well,

1016
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,380
didn't Paeng's parents

1017
01:26:58,590 --> 01:26:59,920
die in a car crash?

1018
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:09,210
Why are you asking me that?

1019
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:14,590
Did Paeng's parents

1020
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,550
really die in a car crash?

1021
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,000
What did you hear?

1022
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,420
Why are you mentioning this?

1023
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:28,710
It's none of your business.

1024
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,800
I want to know, Dad.

1025
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,170
Can you tell me?

1026
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:37,340
No.

1027
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,670
That's Paeng's private matter.

1028
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:45,340
And it happened a long time ago.

1029
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,670
It shouldn't be dug up.

1030
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:17,050
Some guy is at the rose garden.

1031
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:20,630
He's really handsome.
He's Miss Paeng's type.

1032
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:22,670
I told Lin to invite Paeng over.

1033
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:23,880
Are you going to come?

1034
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,250
I'm not coming.

1035
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:28,460
- Who are you?
- Someone Paeng has to listen to.

1036
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:30,630
Ling, I'm going home.

1037
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:36,550
They're being romantic in public.

1038
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:40,130
They don't respect
you at all, Artit.

1039
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,170
I'll see you at home, darling.

1040
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:46,800
Where are you? Tell me!

1041
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,750
He's your type? You like him?

1042
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:51,710
Very much.

1043
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:53,550
He's exactly my type.
