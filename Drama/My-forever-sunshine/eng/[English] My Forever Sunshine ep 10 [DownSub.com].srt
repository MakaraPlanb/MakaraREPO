1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,669
The first prize for
January 17, 2020...

3
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,669
You all lost!

4
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,750
It's called the men's way.
It's all about dignity.

5
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,629
Paeng, what are you doing to my son?

6
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,710
Who cued her in?
What perfect timing.

7
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,210
I haven't said anything
about being with Ling.

8
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,169
- Artit!
- Hey, hey, hey!

9
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,840
I'll prove your feelings towards me.

10
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:10,500
Ouch!

11
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,750
It must be Mr. Artit.

12
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,169
There's only one person who dares
to pull a prank like this on me.

13
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,250
Everything that has happened,
I'm behind all of it.

14
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,710
No matter how nice she is,

15
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,960
I won't forget what she did.

16
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,419
Aueng,

17
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,300
I don't have any more clean shirts.

18
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,710
Not just you.

19
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,090
Me neither.

20
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,879
I have to go shopping with Non.

21
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,919
He's taking me.

22
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,840
Miss Paeng,

23
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,879
there are two outfits here.

24
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,090
Here.

25
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:10,590
Just wear them for the time being.

26
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,710
See?

27
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,960
This too.

28
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,750
Aueng,

29
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:20,839
The skirt part on this one is short.

30
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,750
The other one has such a low-cut.

31
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,209
Do you want the dogs to howl at me?

32
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:29,379
Do you want to be naked instead?

33
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,920
Just wear it.

34
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:32,839
I'll do the washing for you.

35
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,379
Which one do you prefer?

36
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,089
I don't want you
to do something like that.

37
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,209
But I didn't come up with it.

38
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,920
Someone told me to do it.

39
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,129
That's right.

40
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:57,250
I told her to drive Paeng out.

41
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:20,800
What's up? Checking out
your masterpiece?

42
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,629
I'm sorry
but I've cleaned it all up.

43
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,839
I'm relieved to see
that you're okay.

44
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:33,879
Aren't you disappointed
that I'm not hurt?

45
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,420
It's good that you're not.

46
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,959
I never thought that you're
the backstabbing type.

47
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:47,000
Next time, man up

48
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:49,170
and don't do it behind my back.

49
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,209
It's my business whether I do it
in front or behind your back.

50
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:56,670
I forgot that you can do anything.

51
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,629
That's right. I can do anything.

52
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,550
I'm sorry that it failed.

53
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,209
It will be successful someday.

54
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,089
Non,

55
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,379
why are you here?

56
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,300
I'm taking Paeng shopping.

57
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:36,800
Huh?

58
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,170
Paeng, why are you so dressed up
just to go to the market?

59
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,589
I'll be back, Artit.

60
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,959
Come on.

61
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:56,129
Non, thank you very much.

62
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,879
It's no trouble.

63
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,920
What's wrong with Artit?

64
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,959
Ignore him. He's sick in the head.

65
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,959
Hey!

66
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:11,339
- Where are you taking my guy?
- Shopping, of course.

67
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,300
I didn't ask you.

68
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,959
I'm asking her.

69
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh? Non's your guy?

70
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,050
Non's my friend.

71
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,959
Are you jealous?

72
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,879
That's right.

73
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:30,209
She dressed up like this
to seduce you. Can't you see?

74
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:31,550
Artit!

75
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,800
Artit, I'm not your boyfriend.

76
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,670
And be nice to Paeng.
Give her some respect.

77
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,959
Why should I?

78
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,550
I think you should leave.

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,050
Artit, your dad told me
to look after her.

80
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm taking her to shop
for some agricultural tools.

81
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,459
You're taking it too far.

82
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,420
You intend on burning through
my farm's money, right?

83
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,379
Watch your mouth.

84
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,420
I won't do it to Uncle's money.

85
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,420
But I can't be sure about yours.

86
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,170
You don't have to.

87
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:12,709
She's my employee. I can take her.

88
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,250
Employee?

89
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,589
That's right.

90
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,250
And stop being overfamiliar
by calling me by my name.

91
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,129
- Artit.
- Again?

92
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm an only child.
I have no relatives nor siblings.

93
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,050
Artit, you've gone to far.

94
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,299
Do you want me to not
have any friends too?

95
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,299
It's okay, Non.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,879
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

97
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,500
Time to go or it might get too hot.

98
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,299
Go on.

99
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:05,379
Power-hungry jerk.

100
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,419
How am I friends with him?

101
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:55,629
Artit.

102
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,419
Mr. Artit.

103
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,840
You're annoying.

104
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:04,879
Are you here to keep an eye out
or to be cheeky?

105
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,049
I must approve of everything
that you're buying.

106
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:13,169
But this is Uncle's money.
I didn't ask for yours.

107
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,379
The rose garden belongs to my farm.

108
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:17,710
It needs my money.

109
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,879
So everything you're going to buy

110
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:22,879
must be worth the value.

111
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,340
I need to use this one.

112
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:43,250
Too expensive.

113
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,379
This one's better. It's cheaper.

114
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,379
You have money but no brain.

115
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,919
- I'm taking this one.
- Hold on.

116
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,750
Take a good look
at the expiration date.

117
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:06,129
This one is old.

118
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,169
Take this one. It was recently
produced, so it's newer.

119
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,090
What's up, Khanoon?

120
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,549
What?

121
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,669
Wait right there. I'll hurry back.

122
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:30,710
What happened?

123
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,799
My friend's in trouble.
I have to go to Bangkok.

124
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:38,379
Paeng!

125
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,590
Paeng!

126
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,960
Are you going to go in this state?

127
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,419
How are you even getting there?

128
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:48,710
I'll take you.

129
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,379
Your friend had an accident,
why didn't she go to the hospital?

130
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,340
This is the accident.
She got kicked out from home.

131
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,549
What kind of person gets
kicked out from home?

132
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,669
She's an adoptive child.

133
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,460
That's her family's business.

134
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:06,799
I thought she was going to die.

135
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,960
You brought me here
just for a small issue?

136
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,919
Who brought whom?

137
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:12,500
You volunteered to come.

138
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:14,379
Think about it and don't blame me.

139
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:15,840
And your small issue

140
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,049
is actually big for me
and my friend.

141
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,669
Khanoon!

142
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,299
She's an adoptive child

143
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:32,379
so you think you can
do anything to her?

144
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,799
She's not my child!

145
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:35,879
That's going too far!

146
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:37,669
- Paeng?
- Paeng?

147
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,460
Khanoon is not a pet.

148
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,169
You can't just adopt her

149
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,750
then abandon her
when you feel like it.

150
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,919
Even animals get treated
with love and mercy.

151
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,419
She's human.

152
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,210
But why don't you love her
or have mercy on her?

153
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:54,379
She's the person who's been calling
you her mother for 20 years.

154
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,799
So what? This is my family!

155
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,840
All of you should get lost

156
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,250
or I'm going to call the police.

157
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,879
Go ahead.

158
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,710
I actually want a cop as a husband.

159
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:07,000
What kind of parents are you
kicking your child out like that?

160
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:10,090
The Dream Team is here, huh?

161
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:11,250
Khanoon,

162
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,129
you're so ungrateful.

163
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:14,919
You told them to pick
a fight with me.

164
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,590
- Go away! You ingrate!
- Go!

165
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:21,129
Since you decided to adopt her,

166
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,750
then you should always
take care of her.

167
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,000
Not keeping the inheritance
for your own flesh and blood

168
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,460
and kicking her out.

169
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,799
Why? It's my money.

170
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,250
What's wrong with keeping it
for my own child?

171
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,590
What do you even have?

172
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:35,379
This old, run-down house?

173
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,460
Khanoon can find
a better home than this.

174
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:38,799
Rude brats!

175
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,299
If you can find a better one,
then go ahead.

176
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,629
Go and use that agricultural
knowledge to work in a rice paddy.

177
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,840
- Go!
- Go!

178
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,250
Let's have a fistfight
with that mouth of yours!

179
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,500
She's crazy!

180
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,129
Let me go!

181
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,549
Watch out, Paeng!

182
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,129
Stop, Wanfahmai.

183
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,879
You adopted her but have you
ever given her love?

184
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,129
You used her for work like cattle.

185
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,500
What's wrong with you?
Are you even humans?

186
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,750
Khanoon,

187
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,419
if you're unhappy, you can report
them to the authorities.

188
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,879
As far as I've heard,

189
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,169
you didn't adopt her
to be your daughter.

190
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,090
So why did you adopt her?

191
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,840
Please don't make me
uncover the truth.

192
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,169
Khanoon can ask for a compensation

193
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,960
and she can report you
to the authorities.

194
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:53,750
According to the law,

195
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:56,340
you can't cancel an adoption

196
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:58,379
unless there are compelling reasons.

197
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:01,250
Have a lawyer on hand.

198
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,049
Come on. Have a seat here.

199
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,340
Sit here for now, Khanoon.

200
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,340
I'll find some clothes
for you to change into.

201
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,049
Come on, Pony.

202
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,840
Okay, Paeng.

203
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,549
It's okay to feel sad

204
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,710
but spare some time to think about
what you're going to do tomorrow.

205
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:12,129
Think carefully.

206
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,879
This could be the chance

207
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:17,710
that you can have the freedom
you never had.

208
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:24,750
Do you know that nothing else
can make you as happy

209
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,299
as having control of your own life?

210
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,840
You can go anywhere and do anything.

211
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:32,710
Everything depends on your outlook.

212
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,129
You can't change others

213
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,379
but you can change yourself.

214
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,879
Here.

215
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:02,169
You won't be able
to wear my clothes.

216
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,380
So I borrowed some of
Phokin's clothes for you.

217
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,500
I'll hurry and wash
and dry your clothes.

218
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,460
Take them.

219
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,210
Go and change, Artit.

220
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,839
The bathroom's over there.

221
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,589
Go on. Leopard pattern is lovely.

222
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,549
Paeng,

223
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,549
I don't know if Artit's
well-spoken or good-looking.

224
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,460
I just met him

225
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,299
but I believe in everything he said.

226
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,750
Paeng, I know now

227
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,339
why you used to love him

228
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,630
and was so willing to
give him your virginity.

229
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,880
If I were you, I'd go for him and
I wouldn't make a mistake like you.

230
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,750
Pony, that's enough.

231
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,380
Well, he's so handsome!

232
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,089
Artit,

233
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:17,750
my clothes fit you perfectly.

234
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,380
The leopard pattern
looks really lovely.

235
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,920
Why are you scooting away?

236
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,920
Do you wear this regularly?

237
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,799
Of course I do.

238
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,210
It's my iconic pattern.

239
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:31,460
I always score with this one.

240
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,750
Actually, I'd like to score
with you too.

241
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,339
Hey,

242
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,130
you can go away now.
I'm going to talk to him.

243
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,960
You're always such a killjoy.

244
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,130
Artit, you can go home now.
I'll find my own way back.

245
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,920
Do you want me to go back
in this get-up?

246
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:58,670
The washing's going to take awhile.

247
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:00,549
It's okay. I can wait.

248
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,420
I'm hungry too.

249
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,299
Should we eat out?

250
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:10,960
You can go out in this too.

251
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:12,420
Wanfahmai.

252
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,960
I'll make you something simple.

253
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,839
What's something simple?

254
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,750
Well, what do you want?

255
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,460
Be polite.

256
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,420
What would you like, Mr. Artit?

257
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:32,380
A burger.

258
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,880
I don't have any.

259
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,380
- A lobster.
- Are you crazy? There's none.

260
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,630
Oh? Then why did you ask?

261
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,549
So I can order something for you.

262
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,500
No one lives at this condo.
There's no food.

263
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:57,380
Oh,

264
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,089
did I come to the wrong room?

265
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,420
You didn't, Auntie.

266
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,670
I'm not Auntie.

267
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,210
It's better if you call me Sister.

268
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,960
Okay, Sister. You're not wrong.

269
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,960
Your husband?

270
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,210
No, he's Paeng's.

271
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,880
Are you really Paeng's guy?

272
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,299
Oh, my. Leopard pattern.

273
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,460
Why? Does she usually
bring guys over?

274
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,799
My!

275
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,049
Never.

276
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:33,049
You're the first to be here.

277
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:34,549
I can guarantee it.

278
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,130
My little Paeng

279
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:40,880
has never been with any guy.
She's still pure.

280
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:44,500
Stop right now.
You always go overboard.

281
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:46,250
I only asked you
to deliver the food.

282
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:47,960
Stop being so extra.

283
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,339
Here.

284
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,799
How much is everything?

285
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,710
Let's calculate later.

286
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,960
You didn't tell me
you have a pet leopard.

287
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,170
I'm going now.

288
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,049
Just go. Hurry up and go away.

289
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,589
Hold on.

290
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,710
I guarantee.

291
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,299
I never lie.

292
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:08,630
- I'd like to scratch you.
- Okay.

293
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,000
Eat up, Khanoon.

294
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:19,130
Paeng,

295
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,839
she eats anyway
when she's stressed or sad.

296
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,500
If you keep urging her to eat,

297
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,500
she might explode.

298
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,920
I really don't have
an appetite this time.

299
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,000
Very good.

300
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,380
So you'll be slim with curves
in all the right places.

301
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:37,299
Look there. His plate is so empty.

302
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,750
Paeng, serve something for Artit.

303
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,170
He can use his own hands.

304
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,670
Just a little bit.

305
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,920
Hey.

306
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,089
What Sister said just now,
is it true?

307
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:54,670
About what?

308
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,049
The thing about no guys wanting you.

309
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,549
Says who? It's me
who doesn't want anyone.

310
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,000
You're waiting for me, aren't you?

311
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,799
Too bad. I don't want you either.

312
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,960
Or do you want it on the mouth?
So you can stop talking.

313
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,549
You can't quip back fast enough
so you resort to violence?

314
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,170
Power-hungry psycho.

315
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:25,170
Don't embarrass me.

316
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:27,170
Why?

317
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,960
Why do you have to fake it
in front of my friends?

318
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:32,170
They already know everything.

319
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,420
Know what? What did you tell them?

320
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,210
Nothing.

321
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,210
I think

322
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,710
Artit's not just her former
husband-to-be.

323
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:47,589
Oops.

324
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,299
Heard it with my own ears.

325
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,670
I think he's suitable for you.

326
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:56,130
That's true.

327
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,460
He's not scary at all.
He's actually delectable.

328
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:00,839
Look at the leopard pattern!

329
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:42,880
Khanoon.

330
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,339
I'm sorry for waking you up.

331
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,960
Just cry.

332
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,380
Cry as much as you want.

333
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:05,500
It might be really hard
for you today.

334
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,589
But once you get through it,

335
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:12,130
it'll be only
a tiny part of your life.

336
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:17,630
Khanoon, remember

337
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,880
that there's no one who can hug you

338
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,130
as warmly as you can hug yourself.

339
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,210
Khanoon, don't worry.

340
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,960
You can stay at my condo
as long as you want.

341
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,130
I'll be back
in a year and eight months.

342
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,839
Well...

343
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,210
I have to go. I've arrived.

344
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:28,420
Bye.

345
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,460
Thank you for going with me.

346
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,170
We've arrived for ages.
Get out of the car.

347
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,460
If you're so disgusted,
why did you go with me?

348
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:49,339
Artit, honestly

349
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,799
are you bipolar?

350
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,630
You're nice for a moment
and then you're mean again.

351
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,500
I'm starting to feel
like I can't take it.

352
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,210
I'm always like this.

353
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:58,130
You have to be able to endure it.

354
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,549
It's a year and eight months, right?

355
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,380
You'll see this everyday.

356
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,589
You can get out now.

357
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:29,920
Are you human or an evil ghost?

358
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,500
Hey!

359
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,630
Paeng!

360
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,589
Paeng!

361
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:41,210
Watch out. The clip might
end up on social media.

362
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,839
You sly girl,
open the door right now.

363
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,589
What's the matter, Artit?

364
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,089
Give me your phone.

365
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,210
Hey.

366
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,799
I won't give it to you.

367
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,089
You're not?

368
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:45,670
Hey, Paeng!

369
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:49,500
Delete that clip or you'll get it.

370
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,920
It's you. Go home

371
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,630
and don't provoke me again.

372
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,130
Or the whole world will see
your sexy dance moves.

373
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,670
It's not an empty threat.

374
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,839
You're not going to listen to me?

375
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,089
Give it to me!

376
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:07,500
Give the phone to me!
Don't run away!

377
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:09,500
Come here!

378
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,549
Artit, let me go! That hurts!

379
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,049
Let the phone go first.

380
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,170
I'm not giving it to you!

381
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,630
Artit, let me go.

382
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,170
- It hurts!
- You let go then!

383
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,049
What's the password?

384
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,960
Who would tell other people that?

385
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,299
Are you going to tell me or not?

386
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,799
I'm not.

387
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,250
Alright.

388
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,799
Come here you!

389
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:49,170
That hurts, Artit!

390
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,299
Stay still.

391
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,089
Simple as that.

392
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,549
Meanie.

393
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,549
You started it, so blame yourself.

394
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,380
Do you understand now

395
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,750
how it feels being secretly filmed?

396
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,299
Understand what?

397
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,380
I don't have to understand anything.

398
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,670
You deleted your clip.

399
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:25,089
You have to delete my pictures
in your phone too.

400
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:27,420
What pictures?

401
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,589
The ones you secretly took of me.

402
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,839
Paeng,

403
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,170
do you think I can stand
having your pictures in my phone?

404
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,839
I've deleted them ages ago.

405
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,799
Thank you, then.

406
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,500
Artit,

407
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,920
I'd like to make a deal with you.

408
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:53,670
What deal?

409
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:57,089
Can we live together peacefully?

410
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,960
If you really hate me,

411
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,960
then let me be.

412
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,880
We just mind our own business.

413
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,210
Because I have no hopes
in you anymore.

414
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,549
Do you expect me to believe you?

415
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:17,670
Paeng!

416
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,799
If I felt anything towards you,

417
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,339
my heart would tremble

418
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,299
with excitement, right?

419
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,670
But I don't feel

420
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,549
anything at all.

421
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,589
I'm holding your hand

422
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,339
but I don't feel anything.

423
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:02,799
So I won't do anything to you.

424
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,799
We should just mind
our own business.

425
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,380
You can just ignore me.

426
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,460
Isn't that good, Artit?

427
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:11,630
No.

428
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,710
Why not?

429
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:17,670
Because I don't trust you.

430
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,339
This is the new way
to seduce me, isn't it?

431
00:32:49,089 --> 00:32:50,250
I was so startled.

432
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,460
Paeng, you tricky girl.

433
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,670
If there's any problem...

434
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,210
Koi,

435
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,549
I have to borrow
your boss for a day.

436
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,839
Feel free to do so.
I'll take care of the shop.

437
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,000
Koi.

438
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,920
You're not going to stop, are you?

439
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,960
We haven't even started dating,

440
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,839
so how can I stop?

441
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,750
Even if we do,

442
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,589
I won't stop loving you.

443
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:02,549
Is this what you're talking about?

444
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:05,170
The thing you bought for me?

445
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:08,670
Are you admitting

446
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,170
that you feel the same way?

447
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,210
I'm not.

448
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,420
I'm telling you

449
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,630
the reason why I kept it

450
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,090
because I thought it's still useful.

451
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,130
But now,

452
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,590
I don't want to keep it anymore.

453
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,210
Ling.

454
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,960
Throw out the trash for me.

455
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,920
And don't let me see it here
when I come back.

456
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,130
Non, you're here.

457
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,960
I'm looking for assistance.

458
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,340
On what?

459
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,250
Try my rose tea.

460
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,170
If it's nice,
I'll market it right away.

461
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,750
It's delicious.

462
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,960
Are you okay?

463
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,250
You seem distracted.
Did something happen?

464
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,050
I don't understand women.

465
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,800
I don't understand them at all.

466
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,750
Non.

467
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,130
Who's the girl? Do I know her?

468
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,050
You do.

469
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,420
Who is it? I can't think of anyone.

470
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,050
Don't tell me that it's Ling.

471
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,380
Whoa!

472
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,500
What have I missed?

473
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,840
I'm quite sure

474
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,210
that she likes me.

475
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,050
But she won't admit it
and she always refuses me.

476
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,880
Really?

477
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,130
I thought Ling and Artit
are into each other.

478
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,710
They're not.

479
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,340
What should I do?

480
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,380
I have to go up North with them too.

481
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,590
Is there anything I can do to help?

482
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,500
If there is, will you help me?

483
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,960
With my utmost pleasure.

484
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,800
This rose tea is really nice.

485
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,500
It's good, right?

486
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,670
Yes!

487
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,550
- Hello, Uncle.
- Oh hello, Non.

488
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,710
Have a seat.

489
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,050
Are you here to see Artit?

490
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,630
I'm here to see you.

491
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,800
I have something to ask you.

492
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,170
Do you remember
the annual project I do with Artit?

493
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,960
The one where you donate stuff
to schools in the mountains?

494
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,960
Yes. I'd like to invite
Paeng too this year.

495
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,380
Of course you can.

496
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,500
I'm not worried if she's with you.

497
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,130
That's good. So she can
take a break as well.

498
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,460
Please look after her.

499
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,960
Thank you.

500
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,550
I got the green-light from Uncle.
You can come.

501
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,340
Okay. I'll help you the best I can.

502
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,460
I hope your plan works.

503
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,250
I don't know. But we have to try.

504
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,420
Let's do our best.

505
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,840
But you have to help me too.

506
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,250
Help with what?

507
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,170
Help protect me from Artit.

508
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,840
If he sees me, he'll snap
my neck for sure.

509
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,460
Artit's not that violent, I think.

510
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,710
You underestimate him.

511
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,460
Probably not just my neck,

512
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,590
he might also break my limbs

513
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,300
and chop me up.

514
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,840
Hey, is that even possible?

515
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,210
It is!

516
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,800
You just have to
dress up beautifully.

517
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,050
If he sees you, he might soften up.

518
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,340
I think an armor might
be safer for me.

519
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,710
If he knows that you're there
to help me,

520
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,170
he'll be okay with it.

521
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,590
I'll talk to him.

522
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,590
Let's eat dinner at Artit's tonight.

523
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,920
How come?

524
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,000
You invited Paeng over for dinner?

525
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,800
I invited both Non and Paeng.

526
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,210
You know I don't want
to see her face.

527
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,090
Tubtim, be reasonable.

528
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,710
If I wasn't, I would've
chased her out a long time ago.

529
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,630
If you're scared that Paeng might do
something to our son,

530
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,630
you can just forget it.

531
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,500
I won't.

532
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,710
I heard that

533
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,840
Paeng now has someone she likes

534
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,050
and it's not Artit.

535
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,000
Who is it?

536
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,920
Artit's friend.

537
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,920
Non?

538
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,880
But I saw him

539
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,500
with Ling.

540
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,670
What is it?

541
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,210
Who's coming to eat with us?

542
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,300
Hello.

543
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,340
Make yourself at home.

544
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,960
Who invited you?

545
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,210
I did.

546
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,170
Non hasn't been over
for dinner in awhile.

547
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,920
There's food at his place.

548
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,960
Why aren't you happy that
your friend came for dinner?

549
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,130
I'm just surprised.

550
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,130
Besides,

551
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,800
he's not here alone.

552
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,590
I invited both of them.

553
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,210
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

554
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,170
If it wasn't for your help,

555
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,050
Paeng's rose garden
wouldn't have been successful.

556
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,210
I don't think so, Uncle.

557
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,500
Paeng's already skilled.

558
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,800
The helper is the skilled one.

559
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,630
You're so good at
complimenting each other.

560
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,670
I'm happy that you're helping
taking care of Paeng.

561
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,960
Eat up.

562
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,300
- Enjoy.
- Let's eat.

563
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,380
Thank you, Non.

564
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,340
Are you handicapped?

565
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,710
Can't you do it yourself?

566
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,960
Artit.

567
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,420
Let them be.

568
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,380
Thank you.

569
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,590
What's wrong, Paeng?

570
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,090
He's staring. I shouldn't have come.

571
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,500
Ignore him.

572
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,090
Hurry up and eat.
I have to talk to you.

573
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,590
Non!

574
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,840
Hold on!

575
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,500
What's up?

576
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,170
Leave us. I'm going
to talk to my friend.

577
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,670
Please don't go yet. Wait for me.

578
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:45,800
What's up with you?

579
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,880
You liked Ling the other day.
So what's all this?

580
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,590
You think that Paeng and I...

581
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,250
It's not just me,
but my parents as well.

582
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,380
What did you do?

583
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,550
Paeng's like a sister to me.

584
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,380
I haven't done anything.

585
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:02,130
You haven't done anything,
then how did it turn out this way?

586
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,590
How should I know?

587
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,550
You should just stay away.

588
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,420
Don't give me anymore trouble.

589
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:13,630
Artit,

590
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,000
you don't seem like
you're possessive over me.

591
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,380
But you look like you're
possessive over her.

592
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,750
Possessive my butt. I hate her.

593
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,090
I just don't want to see her happy.

594
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,670
You're such a psycho.

595
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,210
I have to go now. Later.

596
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,960
Do you feel relieved now?

597
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,920
So you won't have to be worried
about Artit and Paeng.

598
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,590
I hope it's true.

599
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,090
I'll pray to the Holy Spirits
that Non will take her away.

600
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,750
That's good.
So I can have Ling back.

601
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:07,710
What does Ling have to do with this?

602
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,880
Oh? Non loves Ling.

603
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,500
I heard it with my own ears.

604
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,460
As for Ling, I'm not so sure.

605
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,380
I saw her walking away from Non.

606
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,670
Is that true?

607
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,960
Did I misunderstand something?

608
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:27,630
But your niece is really something.

609
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,960
She probably seduced Non

610
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,710
until he fell for her.

611
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,590
That's why he's taking care
of her so well.

612
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,670
I hope it's true.

613
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,090
So I can be relieved about Artit.

614
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,710
Who are you angry at?

615
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:53,210
Definitely Miss Paeng.

616
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,550
I probably give her
too much free time.

617
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,090
That's why she has time
to seduce other guys.

618
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,590
- Saeb.
- Yes?

619
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,420
Tell Paeng to come see me.

620
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,000
Where, Mr. Artit?

621
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,550
The cucumber patch.

622
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,920
What's the matter?

623
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,840
You have to work mornings again.

624
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,050
Bring it on. Do as you please.

625
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:44,210
You can work me as hard as you want.

626
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,960
I'll just die at most.

627
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,880
You probably won't die easily.

628
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,460
Why? Is it so tormenting

629
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,630
to see me being happy?

630
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,130
Sort of.

631
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,550
You have time to seduce my friend
and my parents misunderstood you.

632
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,590
I'm telling you,
Non doesn't like you.

633
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,590
I don't like...

634
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,090
I don't care

635
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:15,590
if Non likes me or not.

636
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,460
But I really like him.

637
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,750
Because he's cool

638
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,090
and a gentleman.

639
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,800
Unlike someone.

640
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,170
You were so blindly obsessed
with me in the past.

641
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,630
Back then I was so stupid.

642
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,550
I was stupid like a donkey.

643
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,750
Alright. I don't want
to argue with you anymore.

644
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,710
Let's get started.
What do you want me to do?

645
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,300
Follow me.

646
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,420
Nang, where have you been?

647
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,460
I really have to apologize to you.

648
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,210
I didn't mean to tell on you.

649
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,170
But you know

650
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,960
how scary Artit gets
when he's angry.

651
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:05,840
It's okay. I understand.

652
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,750
I know my son well.

653
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,090
I'm so relieved.

654
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,800
Why are you here today?

655
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:15,460
I wanted to ask

656
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,750
if Artit is still angry with me.

657
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,630
If it's about you trashing
Paeng's place, don't worry.

658
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,340
He actually said he was behind it.

659
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,750
That means he's not
angry with anyone.

660
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,630
If he's not,

661
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,210
then I still have a chance
with him, right?

662
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,500
Of course you do.

663
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,750
At least you have me on your side.

664
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,920
Honestly,

665
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:44,130
my daughter-in-law can be you
or anyone else,

666
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,590
except Paeng.

667
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,210
No, it can't be anyone else!

668
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,250
Then you have to keep up
and impress him.

669
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,670
I'm waiting to welcome you
as my daughter-in-law.

670
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:00,130
Thank you, Auntie.

671
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,590
You're welcome.

672
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,840
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

673
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,920
Count how many there are.

674
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,050
Count what?

675
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:10,670
These tomatoes.

676
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,880
Artit,

677
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,750
you can use me all you want.
I'm willing to do anything.

678
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,210
But you shouldn't
bully me like this.

679
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,840
Who's bullying you? This is work.

680
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,800
We have to know how many we have

681
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,880
so we can estimate the number
of customers who can pick them.

682
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,340
Is that true?

683
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,550
But there are so many!

684
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,550
I thought you're willing
to do anything.

685
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,090
If you can't do this,
then don't say so.

686
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,000
Artit, don't eat that!
I already counted over there.

687
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,170
I have to taste and see
if they're ripe enough.

688
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,250
You can taste somewhere else.

689
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:42,840
I have to taste everywhere.

690
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:44,590
Just subtract the amount
from what you've counted.

691
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,090
Where was I?

692
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,460
I forgot!

693
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:52,800
Start over.

694
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,250
Saeb.

695
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,340
You always bully her.

696
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,550
Do you want me to punch you?

697
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,460
Madam told me to fetch you.

698
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,460
Let's go.

699
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:36,210
He smiled!

700
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:46,170
Artit,

701
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,960
have a seat.

702
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,960
Here.

703
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,710
Would you like some dessert?

704
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,590
Nang made it.

705
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,250
Is Nang gone?

706
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,880
Yes. She's embarrassed
about the other day.

707
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,210
Don't be angry with her.

708
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,340
I just scolded her. I wasn't angry.

709
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,590
That's good.

710
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:12,630
So I can call and tell her that.
She'll be happy.

711
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,960
Actually,

712
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,130
Nang's quite lovely.

713
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,090
Do you have your eyes on her?

714
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,590
- Not at all.
- Dear me!

715
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,550
That's mean. You're so frank.

716
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:30,590
Or are you gay?

717
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:35,090
If I'm gay, would Madam Tubtim
be able to accept it?

718
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,460
I can as long as it isn't Paeng.

719
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,500
Five one nine,

720
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,340
- five two zero,
- You're here.

721
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,300
five two one,

722
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,670
five two two, five two three,
five two four, five two five...

723
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,000
Hello!

724
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,130
I was looking all over for you.

725
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,710
Did you come in peace or not?

726
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,750
You shouldn't ask.

727
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,630
Have I ever come in peace?

728
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,630
Don't worry. It's just warm.

729
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,630
I don't slap anyone
just for fun anymore.

730
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,090
Good.

731
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,420
People have to improve

732
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,960
and not always be a bad person.

733
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:47,800
Mostly, I'm only bad
to a bad person.

734
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,800
Mostly,

735
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,090
you started it.

736
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,920
Mostly, you provoke me first.

737
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,250
Five two five.

738
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,590
What?

739
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,880
Please help me memorize it.
Five two five.

740
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,420
Five two five.

741
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,170
What's up?

742
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,380
Artit's not here.

743
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,590
Don't pretend to be working hard.

744
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,000
You didn't come back to work.

745
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,340
You're just here to get Artit.

746
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,550
You want to provoke me,

747
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,300
but your brain is only capable
of thinking about this?

748
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,670
It's getting old.

749
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,670
Your behavior always
reminds me of it.

750
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,750
Who shamelessly

751
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,340
tried to assault Artit in his room?

752
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,050
It's already old news.

753
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,500
You're upset

754
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,420
because you want to do it too
but you were too scared, right?

755
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,590
That's right.

756
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,210
Oh, are you crazy?

757
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,380
I don't need to stoop
so low to do that.

758
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,170
Auntie Tubtim

759
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,750
approved of me being
Artit's girlfriend.

760
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,750
Really? Congratulations.

761
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,380
You can stop being jealous of me.

762
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:10,800
Use the time to book a hotel
for your wedding.

763
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,380
Or find a kindergarten
for your children.

764
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,210
There's a snake in the house.

765
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,340
How can I rest assured?

766
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,670
I can relax

767
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,960
when you packed your things
and get out of this farm.

768
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,920
I don't want him anymore.

769
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,380
Even if he was handed over to me
on a gold platter.

770
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,170
You can rest assured.

771
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,050
I don't believe you.

772
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,420
Have it your way.
It's none of my business.

773
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,960
You're done for today?

774
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,550
What was the number again?

775
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,090
Five two five.

776
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,210
Five two five. Thank you.

777
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,130
Five two five,

778
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,800
five two six, five two seven,
five two eight,

779
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,880
five two nine, five three zero...

780
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,590
You unpredictable psycho!

781
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,550
I was going to go
to the rose garden.

782
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,460
Why did I come home?

783
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,710
Is this the CCTV you talked about?

784
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,210
Are you going to
track my every move?

785
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,380
Ouch! That hurts!

786
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,550
Help!

787
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,960
Anyone, please help me!

788
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,670
How did you get here, Artit?

789
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,210
I drove here, of course.

790
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,550
I know you drove.

791
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,300
You probably wouldn't have
ridden a buffalo.

792
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,750
You're being cheeky.

793
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,500
I guess you've gotten better?

794
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:41,420
Why would you shout your head off?
I haven't done anything.

795
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:46,210
Excuse me, please keep
your voice down.

796
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,880
I'm sorry.

797
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,590
See? It's your fault.

798
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,590
It's your fault

799
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,170
for bullying me.

800
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,880
How did you know
I'm at the hospital?

801
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,090
Not just me,

802
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,880
but the whole farm knows.
You made quite a ruckus.

803
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,920
Wow, that was fast.

804
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,210
It's time to go.

805
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,500
Why aren't you careful?

806
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,380
You're crippled.

807
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,960
That's going too far.

808
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,460
Wait here.

809
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,460
I'll get you a wheelchair.

810
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:34,710
It's okay.

811
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,710
I don't want to be in a wheelchair.

812
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,800
I can just walk carefully.

813
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,420
Oh!

814
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,050
What are you doing?

815
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:02,340
Don't think anything of it.

816
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,250
I'm just annoyed.

817
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,050
Wait here.

818
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,750
Miss Paeng. Come, I'll help you.

819
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,420
Here. Slowly.

820
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,340
Watch your step.

821
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,590
Here's your boss's medicine.

822
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,050
Have her take it on time.

823
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:05,630
Okay, sir.

824
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,710
Use cloth over some ice and apply it
to the spot to ease the swelling.

825
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,460
Understood, sir.

826
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,050
Come on, Miss Paeng.
Let's get inside.

827
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,800
Walk slowly.

828
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,170
Step.

829
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,920
There.

830
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,000
Thank you.

831
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,460
Careful.

832
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,960
The steps. There.

833
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,630
There.

834
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,380
Walk slowly.

835
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,630
Why are you carrying me?

836
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,960
At this rate you'll reach
the house when it's night time.

837
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:02,210
It's like a groom carrying his bride
to consummate the marriage.

838
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,250
Aueng,

839
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,090
get me a piece of cloth
and some ice.

840
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,380
Yes, sir.

841
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,050
I'll show you
how you should apply it.

842
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:32,960
Artit,

843
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,340
I think

844
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,630
you don't have to show her
how to do it.

845
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,800
It's easy. Aueng can do it.

846
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,880
When you fell, you should've
landed with your mouth.

847
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,380
So you'd stop talking.

848
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,170
Bear with it.

849
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,840
I hung up some washings.
I have to go get them.

850
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:14,840
Aueng!

851
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,840
Are you crazy?

852
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,050
Are you planning to bite me?

853
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:49,500
Artit, are you crazy?
Are you planning to bite me?

854
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:55,300
You deserved it.

855
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:58,670
All done.

856
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,050
Why are you doing this?

857
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,670
Because I'm afraid you're hurt

858
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,840
and you won't work as much
as I'm paying you.

859
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,130
Get better soon.

860
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,090
So I can torment you again.

861
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,500
You're stingy and psychotic.

862
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,960
Thank you very much
for worrying about her.

863
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:41,420
Who's worried?

864
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,380
I don't want your boss to die here.

865
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,960
I don't want any trouble.

866
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,420
I thought Artit would
soften up to you.

867
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,750
But instead...

868
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,000
He's still as mean to me as always.

869
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,840
And he pretended to be good to you.

870
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,130
He still hates me

871
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,840
and keeps finding ways to bully me.

872
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,960
He's only afraid that I'm hurt
and I won't be able to work.

873
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,250
But they say

874
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,170
that you'll get what you hate.

875
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,750
Maybe

876
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,420
someday he might end up liking you.

877
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,130
You're delusional.

878
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,170
You can't be sure.

879
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:38,840
It's giving me goosebumps.

880
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,170
Make sure that you
don't forget anything.

881
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,420
I won't forget. I checked
three times already.

882
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,210
The sports equipment for
the school is in this one.

883
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,500
The medical equipment
is in Non's car.

884
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:59,880
I was just making sure.

885
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,590
Ling, I'd like to ask you something.

886
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,590
Why won't you ride in Non's car?

887
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,840
Are you disgusted by me?

888
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,920
I'm not. I just want to know.

889
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,210
Then I'll choose not to tell you.

890
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:34,380
It's so beautiful.

891
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,670
Why hasn't Non arrived?

892
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,000
We'll be late for the donation.

893
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:45,590
Give him a call.

894
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:51,300
Hey, Artit! Ling!

895
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,630
- You're here.
- Have you waited long?

896
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,460
Have you waited long?

897
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:58,210
Ages. Come on, let's go.

898
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,210
There's still one more.

899
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,750
Did you forget that Kot's
not coming this year?

900
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:04,840
I'm not talking about Kot.

901
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,380
Who is it?

902
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:08,460
Whoa!

903
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:16,920
Watch your step.

904
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,920
Paeng!

905
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,380
Come here right now.

906
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,460
What are you doing?

907
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,000
What did I do?

908
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,960
Why did you invite Paeng?

909
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,500
I saw her being lonely
so I felt bad.

910
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:43,000
So I brought her along
for some fresh air.

911
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:44,880
I don't feel good about this.

912
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:46,300
Why didn't you ask me?

913
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,000
- I'm not okay.
- But I'm okay.

914
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,630
If you have a problem with this,

915
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,920
then mind your own business.
I'll take care of Paeng.

916
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,750
I'm annoyed when I see her face.

917
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,340
And what do you want me to do?
We're already here.

918
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,340
- Well...
- Can you stop feeling annoyed?

919
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:02,750
We're here for the donation.

920
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,250
I'm happy that you came.

921
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:12,750
How come you're with Non?

922
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,000
Oh, he invited me.

923
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,460
But I don't know if I made
the right decision.

924
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,590
It's so upsetting

925
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,210
when Artit saw me.

926
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:28,710
Are you gossiping about me?

927
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,000
I was saying

928
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:35,460
that you saw me
and you're already upset.

929
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:38,880
You already know this.
But you came anyway.

930
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,300
Actually, I didn't want to come.

931
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,840
Then take a bus home.

932
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:44,710
Artit, enough.

933
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:50,210
Come on, Paeng.

934
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:54,170
You should get into my car.

935
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:15,840
Thank you very much
for donating these.

936
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:17,710
We were in dire need of them.

937
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,960
You've been here before
to give donation, correct?

938
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:23,170
That's right.

939
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,550
That's why we know that
this hospital needs

940
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:30,000
oxygen concentrators and many other
medical equipment.

941
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:34,050
That's true. We never have
enough for the patients.

942
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,800
We are only a small hospital.

943
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,590
But there are many patients.

944
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,550
For example, there are only five
oxygen concentrators

945
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:45,590
in the entire district and
we have to take turns using them.

946
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,500
Take turns?

947
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:52,380
That's right.
For the elderlies in hospice,

948
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:55,880
if they want to spend their final
moments with their family,

949
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:00,460
we'll give it to them
to use at home.

950
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:02,420
That way, they'll be able
to spend time with their family.

951
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:04,670
It's their final happiness.

952
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,300
And it helps with the overwhelming
number of patients at the hospital.

953
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,000
It's so sad.

954
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:12,670
But it's the truth
we all have to accept.

955
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:24,050
Wow! Everything looks so delicious.

956
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,340
I'm hungry. Can I dig in?

957
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:27,710
Glutton.

958
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:32,250
Who caused me this much trouble?

959
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,590
You did it to yourself.
Don't blame others.

960
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:37,750
Who told you to come back?

961
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,550
You should've stayed away.

962
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:48,170
You like this, don't you?
I remember.

963
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,420
Serve Paeng. I can do it myself.

964
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,050
Okay.

965
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,670
Here you go, Paeng.

966
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,960
Non, I'd like some shrimp too.

967
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:09,960
- Can you serve me?
- Sure.

968
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,500
Here.

969
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,960
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

970
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,630
How is it? Good?

971
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:25,800
It's so good.

972
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,050
It's probably because I'm hungry.

973
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:33,340
Actually, because you served me.

974
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:39,710
Eat up.

975
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:43,250
That's enough. I'm going to puke.

976
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,500
How did you two

977
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,670
get together?

978
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,670
Since we've come this far.

979
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,630
Paeng and I

980
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:09,590
are going steady.

981
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,210
I'll go check up on Artit.

982
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:55,590
Non, I was so shocked.

983
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:00,000
But I think Artit's
more shocked than you.

984
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:02,840
That's true.

985
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:04,960
I think I'll be dead for sure.

986
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,630
But Ling didn't react at all.

987
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:12,550
I won't survive the night.

988
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,340
I think Ling's face fell too.

989
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,050
Did you see that?

990
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,960
But I think

991
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,300
your face is worse than Ling's.

992
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,090
I'm scared Artit will kill me.

993
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,590
It's okay.

994
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,960
I'll protect you.

995
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:05,500
Artit!

996
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:07,750
Artit, what's wrong!?

997
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,090
How did those two become a couple?

998
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:15,920
I don't know either.

999
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,170
Do you like it here, Paeng?

1000
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:37,460
The atmosphere is so nice.

1001
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:47,590
Here. I'll do it.

1002
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,960
Go and help Paeng.

1003
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:52,630
She can wait for me.

1004
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:57,300
What are you smiling about?

1005
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:00,000
This is the guys' tent.

1006
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,380
Artit, help me set up this tent.

1007
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:15,050
I'll go and help Paeng with hers.

1008
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,840
Where are you going to sleep?

1009
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:20,880
With you, of course.

1010
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:22,800
I'm going to help the girls
set up their tent.

1011
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,210
Or should I sleep with Paeng?

1012
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,300
Non, are you kidding me?

1013
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,880
Why would I?

1014
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,880
It's normal. We're a couple.

1015
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,710
- You...
- Don't think dirty thoughts.

1016
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:39,550
There's nothing between us.

1017
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,840
But I'm not sure about later on.

1018
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,500
Ling, please come over to this side.

1019
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,000
What are you mad about?

1020
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,460
Are you jealous of me?

1021
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,590
Who'd be jealous of a jerk
of a friend like you?

1022
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,630
If you're not, then what's wrong?

1023
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:14,670
Here.

1024
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,920
Help me pitch the tent.

1025
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:18,960
So are you jealous or not?

1026
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:42,630
What are you looking at?

1027
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,170
The person I want to react
doesn't have a reaction at all.

1028
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:53,420
And the person I expected
to react the least is going crazy.

1029
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,960
It's so scary.

1030
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:07,550
Paeng, from now on you have to
watch your own back.

1031
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,380
Oh?

1032
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:12,130
You said you're going to protect me.

1033
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:16,090
He's this troubled.
I'm not sure anymore.

1034
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,050
Ling,

1035
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,840
are you still hungry?

1036
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:45,050
You didn't eat much earlier.

1037
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,800
I've brought some warm milk.
Would you like some?

1038
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:50,500
It's okay. You drink up.

1039
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,710
What's wrong?
You've been angry all day.

1040
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,960
Don't you see
what Non has been doing?

1041
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:13,250
You don't like Non
being close to Paeng, do you?

1042
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,130
It's his right

1043
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:24,000
to like anyone or flirt with anyone.

1044
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,170
The same goes for Paeng.

1045
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:29,130
If they like each other,

1046
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:32,420
and can be happy together,

1047
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:35,250
how is that bad?

1048
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,840
You don't feel anything at all?

1049
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,130
It has nothing to do with me.

1050
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,380
Paeng,

1051
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:13,170
help me and look at Ling's reaction.

1052
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,710
Nothing. It's just Artit.

1053
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,630
He's stretching his neck so much
he's turning into a giraffe.

1054
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:28,710
I'm probably going to get
my heart broken again.

1055
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,130
Don't give up yet.

1056
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,880
If I don't,
then I have to keep trying.

1057
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:41,800
Here.

1058
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:45,500
Again?

1059
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,000
Careful.

1060
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:13,750
You can sit here.

1061
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,050
You look like you're
herding a cattle.

1062
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,750
What? Isn't that true?

1063
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:28,630
Or have you suddenly
become paraplegic?

1064
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:31,130
Is that why you're acting all weak?

1065
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:33,210
Artit, give her some respect.

1066
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,380
Why should I?

1067
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,840
She's my employee after all.

1068
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:40,960
She's my girlfriend.
I have to protect her.

1069
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:54,250
How brave.

1070
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,840
You've successfully seduced
my friend. Were you that lonely?

1071
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,210
Artit, look after her for a bit.
I'll be back.

1072
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,920
Oh?

1073
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:13,750
Tell me,

1074
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:15,920
how did you get together with Non?

1075
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:19,460
Artit, let me go first.

1076
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,880
You tell me first.

1077
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,050
What does it have to do with you?

1078
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,550
I told you to stay away
from my friend.

1079
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,800
If you're not going to listen,
you're going to get it.

1080
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,050
You can tell Non yourself.

1081
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,130
Do you want to die by my hands?

1082
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:41,500
How did you get together with Non?

1083
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,050
Answer me.

1084
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,050
Hey, are you going
to tell me or not?

1085
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:56,840
Alright.

1086
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,250
Once we got back,
I'm going to work you to death.

1087
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:06,300
Go ahead. You're only
good at bullying me anyway.

1088
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,340
It hurts. Are you going
to let go now?

1089
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,920
You're only tough with women.

1090
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:18,300
Paeng!

1091
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:21,420
What? Can't stand the truth?

1092
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,170
I'm having a breakdown.

1093
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,460
Can you not make me angrier?

1094
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:34,590
You know yourself?

1095
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,420
Alright.

1096
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,670
Just choke me to death
with your own hands.

1097
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,380
You want to kill me anyway.

1098
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:43,460
Here's your chance.

1099
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,500
No one will miss me if I disappear.

1100
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:51,500
I'm all alone. I have no relatives.

1101
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,460
No one's going to save me.

1102
01:23:58,170 --> 01:23:59,250
Go on.

1103
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,340
Stop.

1104
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,130
I thought you've got guts.

1105
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:06,210
Put it on.

1106
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:08,960
You might get sick. It's cold.

1107
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:18,960
Go and take care of Paeng.

1108
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:21,800
I can take care of myself.

1109
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,460
I left Paeng with Artit.

1110
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,130
I'll go back later.

1111
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:35,420
And why did you come after me?

1112
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,880
It's a force of habit.

1113
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,750
I've been doing this for years.

1114
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,960
I'm afraid Paeng might
misunderstand me.

1115
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,630
She won't overthink it

1116
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:02,750
unlike someone.

1117
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,210
Why are you looking at me like that?

1118
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:36,300
I've always looked at you this way.

1119
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:44,590
We're friends.

1120
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:47,340
That's right.

1121
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,050
We're friends.

1122
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:55,210
From now on,

1123
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,800
I will love you as a friend.

1124
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:11,670
Hurry back to the tent.

1125
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:14,550
You might catch a cold.

1126
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:27,960
I'm telling you.

1127
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:30,130
The reason why I kept it

1128
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,380
was because I thought
it's still useful.

1129
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:33,750
But now,

1130
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:36,050
I don't want to keep it anymore.

1131
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:51,500
We're going steady.

1132
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,130
- Come with me.
- Paeng, come here.

1133
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,920
Just split me in two
so you can have each half?

1134
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:28,500
I don't even feel anything
being this close to you.

1135
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:30,630
I'm only waiting for your answer

1136
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,170
whether you're going
to be with me or not.

1137
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,380
Paeng's with a guy.

1138
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:36,250
They look really close.

1139
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:37,590
It's like they're on a date.

1140
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:41,050
Why do you have
to keep harassing me?

1141
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:43,050
You always nag me.

1142
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:44,630
You hate me!

1143
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,340
I hate you too!

1144
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,670
She wished inwardly.

1145
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,380
And she said "they've been killed."

1146
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,460
Who killed them?

1147
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,590
Did Paeng's parents
really die in a car crash?
