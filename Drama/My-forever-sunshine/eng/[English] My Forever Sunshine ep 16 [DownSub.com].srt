1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,159
- Artit!
- You called him. Do you miss him?

3
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,680
You toyed with my feelings.

4
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,090
You must be very satisfied.

5
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,639
It must've been fun, right?

6
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,319
Paeng should be with me and not you.

7
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,719
Artit, you don't hate me anymore.

8
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,240
I haven't hated you for a while now.

9
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,080
Are there any other surprises?

10
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,240
This is just the beginning.

11
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,400
Can you love me again?

12
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,719
If you're not going to answer,

13
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,560
I'll find out myself.

14
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,759
Paeng, don't be afraid.

15
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,599
I won't let go of your hand.

16
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,599
I'll be here

17
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,159
to protect you.

18
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,159
- Auntie.
- Why are you here?

19
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,719
Tubtim.

20
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,439
- Tubtim!
- Oh, no!

21
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,960
Here.

22
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,599
I think you've gone too far.

23
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,719
Why did you have to slap her?

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,439
Do you think I've gone too far?

25
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,639
What about you and Artit
not telling me

26
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,159
that she's the reason
Artit got shot?

27
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,840
Isn't that too far for me?

28
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,319
You made me look like a fool

29
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,840
who didn't even know
why her son got hurt.

30
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,680
I waited for him to come home
to ask him the reason

31
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,599
why he had to risk his life.

32
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,639
But he chose not to come home

33
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,280
and brought this woman here instead.

34
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,680
If you were me,
what would you do?

35
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,520
Tubtim,

36
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,599
our son was the one
who brought Paeng back here.

37
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,199
She never begged anything of him.

38
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,520
No, Uncle.

39
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,279
Auntie's right.

40
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,079
I'm the reason why Artit got hurt.

41
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,360
I'm really sorry.

42
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,800
The whole thing is my fault.

43
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,800
It's good that you know!

44
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,240
If you do, then you should be
remorseful of your mistake

45
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,120
and not show your face here!

46
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,730
Calm down, Tubtim.

47
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,170
Our son is a gentleman.

48
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,839
If someone in our house
is in danger,

49
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,360
he has to help and protect them.

50
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,839
I think that's the right
thing to do.

51
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,279
Is it right for me

52
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,199
to have to see my son almost die?

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,000
But

54
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,839
you shouldn't blame Paeng.

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,610
If I shouldn't blame her,
then who should I blame?

56
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,800
She's the reason
why Artit almost died twice.

57
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,050
What did I ever do to you
in my past life, Paeng?

58
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,680
So that you come after
my son in this life?

59
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,800
Please don't say that, Auntie.

60
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,170
Just tell me

61
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,120
what I have to do

62
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,560
to get you to let my son go?

63
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,879
Do I have to bow to you?

64
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,839
I can do that! I'll bow to you!

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,519
Auntie, please don't.

66
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,120
Please don't.

67
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,079
I'm begging you! Let my son go!

68
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,720
Please!

69
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,079
A mother's heart

70
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,279
can't stand seeing her child die!

71
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,720
You should at least
understand my feelings!

72
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,839
If something happens to Artit
because of you again,

73
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,079
he might not be as lucky this time.

74
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,240
Uncle,

75
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,240
I'm really sorry.

76
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,639
It's okay.

77
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,879
I'll talk to Auntie.

78
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,839
What's up, Saeb?

79
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,800
Artit, Madam slapped Paeng.

80
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,839
Where's Paeng right now?

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,720
She's gone home.

82
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,000
But I think you should
check up on Madam first.

83
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,800
Thanks so much, Saeb.
I'll talk to you later.

84
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,959
Mom.

85
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,399
You can still remember the way home?

86
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,759
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,680
Artit,

88
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,319
I can accept everything you do.

89
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,319
But one thing that I can't
accept is Paeng.

90
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,199
I really can't let
Paeng be alone, Mom.

91
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,959
What's happened to Paeng
is very serious.

92
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,480
We don't even know who's behind it.

93
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,720
We can just request help
from the police or something.

94
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,720
I want to see that she's safe
with my own eyes.

95
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,959
Huh?

96
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,160
Are you that worried about her?

97
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,279
Mom,

98
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,959
I want you to give her a chance.

99
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,000
Can you?

100
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,759
Never.

101
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,160
I'll never forgive her.

102
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,450
Even though she's the woman I love.

103
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,210
Artit,

104
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,000
what did you say?

105
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,679
I love Paeng, Mom.

106
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,399
If I shouldn't blame her,
then who should I blame?

107
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
She's the reason
why Artit almost died twice.

108
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,799
What did I ever do to you
in my past life, Paeng?

109
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,210
So that you come after
my son in this life?

110
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,450
Paeng?

111
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,039
Miss Paeng?

112
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,120
Paeng?

113
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,519
Paeng?

114
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,679
Please come out and talk to me.

115
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,240
I know you can hear me.

116
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,159
Please come out and talk.
I want to talk to you.

117
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,519
If you're not coming out,

118
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,720
I'll wait right here

119
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,210
until you do. So that we can talk.

120
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,039
Paeng.

121
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,519
Yes?

122
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,600
I'll talk to you.

123
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,600
I'm sorry on my mom's behalf.

124
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,120
But I've explained to her
why I took you away.

125
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,159
- And...
- Artit,

126
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,759
I want to ask you a favor.

127
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,720
Of course.

128
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,399
Can I go back to

129
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,240
being your sister?

130
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,440
What?

131
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,519
When we were at Jaem's,

132
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,559
I was very happy.

133
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,600
I was so happy that I reminisced
about moments from the past

134
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,480
when I was staying here

135
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,120
and when I met you.

136
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,159
I'm glad

137
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,279
that I got the old Artit back.

138
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,919
If you've really forgiven me,

139
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,440
can we go back to being
like siblings again?

140
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,320
Paeng,

141
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,720
- I don't...
- Can we be the same as before?

142
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,840
Please, Artit.

143
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,080
I can't go back to
being your brother.

144
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,240
Starting today,

145
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,039
the two us

146
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,399
will no longer have any ties
to each other.

147
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,279
Miss Paeng,

148
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,320
why did you snip the blossom off?

149
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,480
Aueng!

150
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,639
Miss Paeng, that's enough.

151
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,320
What's wrong?

152
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,840
What are you thinking about?

153
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,559
Uh...

154
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,679
It's nothing.

155
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,080
I think that's enough
for today. Come on.

156
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,399
Walk carefully.

157
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,519
Have a seat.

158
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,240
- Saeb.
- Hm?

159
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,599
She's very distracted today.

160
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,200
It's really bad.

161
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,079
How can it not be?
Madam slapped her really hard.

162
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Huh? She got slapped?

163
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,319
How are we going to help her?

164
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,920
Should we do a comedic sketch?

165
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,650
A comedic sketch? Get lost.

166
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,410
You're not making any sense.

167
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,720
Just a second.

168
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,359
Yes, Mr. Artit?

169
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,839
Miss Paeng is at the rose garden.

170
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,799
Don't worry, sir.
I'll keep my eyes on her.

171
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,039
Yes, sir.

172
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,960
Saeb, can you watch over
Miss Paeng for a bit?

173
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,359
I have to do the laundry.

174
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,240
Sure. Don't worry.
I'll watch over her.

175
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,720
I can trust you, can't I?

176
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,000
Of course, Aueng.

177
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,279
Keep an eye on her.

178
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,170
Mark.

179
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,799
Did I startle you?

180
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,960
Artit.

181
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,410
Here's some dessert.

182
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,720
Artit?

183
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,279
What's wrong?

184
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,410
Are you angry with me?

185
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,000
Nang, I'm working.

186
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,170
I need to concentrate.

187
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,720
If it was Paeng, would you
act like this?

188
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,319
I wouldn't.

189
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,920
I wouldn't act like this.

190
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,650
Because I want Paeng to
be the one who comes to see me.

191
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,720
But if she doesn't,

192
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,039
I'll finish up my job quickly
and go see her myself.

193
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,410
What are you talking about?

194
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,440
I love her.

195
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,410
You're crazy to love her.

196
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,410
Don't let me hear
that word ever again.

197
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,119
Nang,

198
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,559
please don't wait for me.
It's a waste of time.

199
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,359
You're making me sad.

200
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,519
I know.

201
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,119
But I love you!

202
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,119
But I don't love you.

203
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,359
I love Paeng.

204
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,890
I told you not to say that to me!

205
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,519
I'll say it every time
I see your face, okay?

206
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,440
You're mean.

207
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,240
It's the only way to make you stop

208
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,960
and get over me.

209
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,759
Where are you going?

210
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,839
You can go home now.

211
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,960
Artit!

212
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,440
Nang.

213
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,119
I love Paeng.

214
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,170
Alright.

215
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,279
Starting today, we're broken up!

216
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,559
Turn left, Nang.

217
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,890
Jeez.

218
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,759
Yes, Artit.

219
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,039
Where are you?

220
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,799
Should we eat together?

221
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,240
I'm going to eat with Mark.

222
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,880
Paeng, how could you go with him?

223
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,759
You have to come back right now.

224
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,400
I want to go out and eat him.

225
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,759
You're doing this
to get on my nerves

226
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,160
I'm not.

227
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,160
I have my reasons.

228
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,000
What reasons?

229
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,680
I want to open up my heart to him.

230
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,960
I'm hanging up now.

231
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,640
Please, Paeng.

232
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,920
This is Non's hotel.

233
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,319
I like the food here

234
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,759
and it feels private. But I just
found out that it's Non's.

235
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,119
Let's go.

236
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,119
It's Mark and Paeng.

237
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,640
Wait here for a moment, Ling.

238
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,200
What is it, Non?

239
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,759
Just wait for me for a bit.

240
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,839
- Non?
- I saw Mark and Paeng at my hotel.

241
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,160
Paeng,

242
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,119
the thing you said to Artit

243
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,039
about opening up your heart to me.

244
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,920
Do you really mean it?

245
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,000
Uh...

246
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,000
I...

247
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,359
I wasn't that serious.

248
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,799
I just didn't want him to follow us.

249
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,960
That's upsetting.

250
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,559
I was actually happy just now.

251
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm not ready to be with anyone.

252
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,640
I'm sorry.

253
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,319
It's okay. I can wait.

254
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,359
Because

255
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,480
I really like you.

256
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
And I'm happy to wait

257
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,519
I'm happy to wait

258
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,759
Artit!

259
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,160
Artit! Don't! Artit!

260
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,359
You have no right to do this to her.

261
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,640
Who has the right then?

262
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,680
You?

263
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,400
Paeng!

264
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,039
- Paeng!
- Artit!

265
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,039
If you don't stop, I will stop
talking to you.

266
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,480
But he harassed you.

267
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,640
If I'm getting harassed,
I have to deal with it myself.

268
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,559
You have no right to intervene.

269
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,839
Paeng.

270
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,599
Have you forgotten that we're
nothing to each other?

271
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,039
- I don't...
- Can we be the same as before?

272
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,680
Please, Artit.

273
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,759
I can't go back to
being your brother.

274
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,559
Then from today,

275
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,559
the two of us

276
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,160
have no ties to each other.

277
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,599
If you can't be like a brother,

278
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,200
then there's nothing between us.

279
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,200
Therefore,

280
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,000
you have no right to
intervene in my life.

281
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,279
You're really going to force me

282
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,000
to be your brother again,
aren't you?

283
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,799
Yes.

284
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,240
I want it that way.

285
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,400
Okay.

286
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,960
I'll be your brother again.

287
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,519
I'm bringing you home.

288
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,839
As a brother,

289
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,759
I am ordering you to stop
fraternizing with him.

290
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,759
Paeng.

291
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,799
I'm sorry.

292
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,799
Why did you bring me here?

293
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:37,400
I want to know what you're doing
and where you are 24 hours a day.

294
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,160
Artit.

295
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,039
You wanted me to be your brother.

296
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,519
I am now.

297
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,759
So

298
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,440
you have to do what I ask of you.

299
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,440
Don't you see me as your brother?

300
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,200
Why are you scared?

301
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,960
I'm not.

302
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,880
Because it's not good

303
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,519
for me to stay here with you.

304
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,559
Auntie is still angry.

305
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,680
You're scared of me,

306
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,720
and my mom.

307
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,680
Or isn't it just you're scared
of your heart?

308
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,119
Since you want me
to be your brother,

309
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,240
then let me prove that

310
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,680
that's the way you really feel.

311
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,400
Artit, let me go!

312
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,559
Artit!

313
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:24,880
Paeng,

314
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,440
I'm sorry.

315
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,039
You're satisfied now?

316
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,160
You do whatever you want

317
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,759
without thinking about me.

318
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,200
I hate you, Artit.

319
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,039
Paeng,

320
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,400
I don't know if you believe me,

321
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,480
but I did it
because I'm worried about you.

322
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,160
Right now,

323
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,359
you must really hate me.

324
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,079
But I'm asking you to stay here

325
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,799
until I can be sure
that you're really safe.

326
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,400
That's all I'm asking.

327
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,759
Tubtim. Tubtim.

328
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,200
Please don't be like this.

329
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,920
Just forgive everyone.

330
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,480
I don't want to talk to anyone.

331
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
I don't want to
see your face either.

332
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,680
Since I don't mean
anything to anyone,

333
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,440
I'm not going to care
about anyone anymore.

334
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,240
You can do whatever you want to.

335
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,119
Bear with her.

336
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,799
She won't stay angry for long.

337
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,680
Okay.

338
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,799
Did you fight with Paeng as well?

339
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,440
It's nothing, Dad.

340
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,519
I'm not buying it.

341
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,559
Just tell me. Maybe I can help.

342
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,559
You still don't trust me,
do you, Paeng?

343
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,920
I made such an effort

344
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,840
but you still don't trust me.

345
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:55,880
Hey, it's me.

346
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,519
- Yes, sir.
- I want you to do something.

347
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,679
If you want your family
to live happily,

348
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,360
I have a proposition for you.

349
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,119
Miss Paeng, do you want
to do something?

350
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,960
Should we make some soap?

351
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,960
Or a new flavor for the rose tea?

352
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,679
Miss Paeng,

353
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
you've been sitting in silence
for a while now.

354
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,809
I don't feel like
doing anything at all.

355
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,199
I don't know what I should do now.

356
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:44,519
But you have to find
something to do.

357
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,400
I agree with Aueng.

358
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,000
Uncle?

359
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:07,769
Hang in there.

360
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:10,840
I believe that one day

361
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,239
Auntie will come around.

362
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,599
You've won nearly
everyone's heart by now.

363
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,679
Artit's very worried about you.

364
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,559
He asked me to look after you.

365
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,400
I don't want anyone
to worry about me.

366
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,840
I understand how you're feeling.

367
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:43,639
My niece is
always strong, isn't she?

368
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,480
But I'm so weak right now.

369
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,639
Uncle,

370
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:55,679
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

371
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,199
Now that there's
something on my mind,

372
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,199
the past keeps coming back to me.

373
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:07,480
Are you having nightmares again?

374
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,960
Yes.

375
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,809
Take it easy.

376
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:17,400
Hang in there.

377
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:20,289
I believe that they'll
go away eventually.

378
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,960
I don't want it to be like this.

379
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,329
I think I'm like this

380
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,719
because I try to repress it.

381
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,679
The more I try to forget

382
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,400
and avoid it,

383
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,400
the clearer it keeps getting.

384
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,199
I think it's time I confronted it.

385
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,880
What do you mean?

386
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,159
I want to open up
my mom's case again.

387
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,039
I want to find the culprit.

388
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,880
You have to help me.

389
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,119
My mom's case was with
Thong Lor Police Station, right?

390
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:15,480
What was the name of
the officer responsible?

391
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:19,809
You already got through the pain.

392
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,400
Why are you going back
to hurt yourself again?

393
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,039
Uncle, I was very young at the time.

394
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,000
But now that I've grown up,

395
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,599
I can handle it now.

396
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,159
I don't agree with you.

397
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:40,719
If you don't,

398
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:43,159
I'll handle it myself.

399
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,840
I've talked to Paeng.

400
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,809
But there's something else that we
should be even more concerned about.

401
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,679
What is it?

402
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,880
Paeng wants to reopen
her mom's murder case.

403
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,159
Aunt Pimnapa

404
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,559
didn't die in a car crash?

405
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,159
I'm the one who covered it up

406
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:41,719
because Paeng asked me to.

407
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:46,519
But now it's necessary.

408
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,559
I have something to ask of you.

409
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,769
What is it?

410
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:57,679
Do whatever you can

411
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,809
to stop her from reopening the case.

412
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,440
Why, Dad?

413
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,289
Because

414
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,360
all the evidence back then

415
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:19,239
pointed towards

416
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,329
Tharathep being the culprit.

417
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:21,639
Paeng!

418
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,289
Paeng! Paeng!

419
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,039
Paeng!

420
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,880
Wait for me here.

421
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,289
I'm calling from
Thong Lor Police Station.

422
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,119
Pimnapa's body was found.
She was murdered.

423
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:21,480
I'd like you to confirm
her identity, Tharathep.

424
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,239
Paeng,

425
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:41,289
wait for me here.

426
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,800
What's your relation
with Miss Wanfahmai?

427
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,480
I'm her father's close friend.

428
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:11,320
Thank you.

429
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,840
Miss! Miss!

430
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,039
What's wrong!?

431
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,119
Paeng!

432
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:28,280
Paeng, what's wrong?

433
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:30,679
Paeng! Calm down!

434
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,840
Calm down, Paeng!

435
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,800
Uncle Tharathep

436
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,199
murdered Aunt Pimnapa?

437
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,639
I don't really want to believe it.

438
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,199
But the evidence
indicates that he was the culprit.

439
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,880
Now you understand

440
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,119
why I can't say anything.

441
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,840
Nothing good will come

442
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:08,400
from talking about it.

443
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,559
And the person who'll
get the most hurt

444
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,960
is Paeng.

445
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,480
That's why I really
feel sorry for her.

446
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:22,840
And I let her act up as a child

447
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,000
without telling anyone
what happened to her.

448
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,760
I'm partially responsible

449
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,719
for her being a disobedient child.

450
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,559
Artit,

451
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:38,519
now do you understand

452
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,239
what she's been through?

453
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,280
I didn't expect this.

454
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,519
She's a very strong girl.

455
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,599
Think about it.

456
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,639
It took her many years
to get through this.

457
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,519
So

458
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,280
I don't want her to face
the darkness from the past again.

459
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:16,119
What if she finds out that
her own father murdered her mother.

460
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:19,159
Think about what's going to happen.

461
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,719
It took many years for her
to get through this.

462
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,559
So

463
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,559
I don't want her to face
the darkness from the past again.

464
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,960
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

465
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,239
I'm about to.

466
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,719
Well, sweet dreams,

467
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,920
Paeng.

468
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,519
Paeng,

469
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,320
don't be afraid. I'm not
going to do anything.

470
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,400
I just want us
to understand each other.

471
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:41,559
I understand.

472
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,480
You're still angry with me.

473
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:49,719
I'm not angry with you.

474
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,760
I want to apologize
on my mom's behalf.

475
00:47:58,599 --> 00:47:59,920
I want you to give her some time.

476
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:01,679
I'm not angry with her at all.

477
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,400
And I don't want to talk
about it anymore

478
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,599
because I still have many
other things to think about.

479
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,199
What are they?

480
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:14,920
You can tell me if you need help.

481
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,440
I can handle it myself.

482
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:24,719
Then let me help

483
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,239
as a brother.

484
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,239
It's okay.

485
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,719
I can take care of myself.

486
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:55,760
You're the ones who shot Artit?

487
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,199
Yes.

488
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,719
We don't want to be
on the run anymore.

489
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:04,800
So we decided to turn ourselves in.

490
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,159
What's the reason to do it?

491
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,039
Is there anyone behind this?

492
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:18,440
Hey, Artit.

493
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:20,960
I was just about to go and see you.

494
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:24,119
What's wrong? You look stressed.
What's the matter?

495
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,000
I was just at the police station.

496
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:29,119
What for?

497
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,280
To identify the suspects who
kidnapped Paeng and shot me.

498
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:35,599
The police have caught them.

499
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,760
They turned themselves in.

500
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:40,719
They're Dandin's subordinates?

501
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:43,920
Yes, they are.

502
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,280
Why would they do it?

503
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,199
They said they were angry

504
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,280
and did everything just
to frame Dandin.

505
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,760
So it's the same as
what the police told us initially.

506
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,199
But why did they have
to go that far?

507
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:57,679
That's the strange thing.

508
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:00,320
And they just turned themselves in
all of a sudden.

509
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,679
What are you going to do now?

510
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,760
I'm going to keep being careful.

511
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:10,679
I guess overall you don't have
to worry anymore.

512
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:12,719
Because the police
have caught all of them.

513
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,079
Anyway, why did you want to see me?

514
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:20,599
I want to talk to you
somewhere private.

515
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,079
I don't want anyone else to hear it.

516
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:30,639
You already got through the pain.

517
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,880
Why are you going back
to hurt yourself again?

518
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,519
What's up?

519
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:54,679
You came all the way here.
Can you tell me now?

520
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:56,480
I need your help with something.

521
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,880
It's the most important
thing in my life.

522
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,679
What? You're going to
propose to Ling?

523
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,039
How did you know?

524
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,960
Did I guess it right?

525
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:12,199
Awesome. You really
are my best friend.

526
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:15,840
I'm happy for you.

527
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,800
I've asked my parents

528
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:19,360
and they're okay.

529
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:20,719
They're very happy.

530
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,360
So I want to surprise her

531
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:23,760
and I want your help.

532
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:25,800
How can I help?

533
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:29,480
I want to impress Ling
since it's a big deal.

534
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,480
But she doesn't like
things to be extravagant.

535
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:34,000
So I want you
and Paeng to help me think

536
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,559
about something that's not simple
but not too extravagant either.

537
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:47,280
Okay. I'm happy to help.

538
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:49,800
But you have to tell Paeng yourself.

539
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,280
How come? Are you two fighting?

540
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:56,280
A little bit.

541
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:59,239
Paeng.

542
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,719
Non?

543
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,039
What are you doing?

544
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,960
Nothing really.

545
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,119
Are you free to talk?
I have a favor to ask you.

546
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,920
What is it?

547
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:14,880
I'm going to propose to Ling.

548
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:18,440
Congratulations!

549
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,199
How can I help?

550
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:24,239
I want you and Artit

551
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,880
to help me come up with a plan.

552
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,760
If you're uncomfortable,

553
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,679
you don't have to do this.

554
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,599
I'll tell Non for you.

555
00:52:57,559 --> 00:52:58,800
I'm going to help him.

556
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:04,800
If you're going to help, then we
have to work together,

557
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:06,599
discuss things,

558
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,280
and plan it out together.

559
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:12,079
Yes, I know.

560
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:15,159
We have to keep
this a secret from Ling.

561
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,079
I can do it.

562
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:20,519
What are you worried about?

563
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:28,199
Can you really pretend to be happy?

564
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:33,840
I can do it.

565
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,599
I want to see Ling and Non happy.

566
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,039
You're always putting others
before yourself.

567
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,199
You're nice to everyone

568
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,519
except me.

569
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,679
A pre-wedding shoot?

570
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:39,199
That's right. This is the theme
the client requested.

571
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,320
Wow. Apart from growing roses,

572
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,719
you're organizing a wedding too?

573
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:46,559
The client requested it.

574
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:49,079
So I'm making an exception.

575
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:51,400
It's also a way to promote my roses.

576
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,559
Awesome.

577
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,360
- Kot.
- Hmm?

578
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,239
Help with the furnishings
and be the photographer.

579
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:59,760
- Piece of cake.
- As for you, Ling.

580
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,760
Can you help with catering?

581
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:04,239
Sure.

582
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,880
The client also asked that we
be the extras, Ling and Kot too.

583
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,719
Easy. I'll do anything that
brings in the dough.

584
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:14,440
It sounds fun.

585
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:48,679
Here's some water.

586
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,280
Ling's wedding dress
will be this style.

587
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:56,320
And I'd like it

588
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:59,400
to be consistent with the theme.

589
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,239
And what about the location
where Non proposes to Ling?

590
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,440
Here.

591
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,039
Are you really disgusted by me?

592
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,199
I'm not.

593
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,039
If you're not,
why are you scooting away?

594
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:29,480
I'm not disgusted by you.

595
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:34,239
But I think there should be
some distance between us.

596
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,840
You're very beautiful, Ling.

597
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:34,840
Hold on, Paeng. We're just extras.
Do we have to dress up this much?

598
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,199
The client is
very serious about this.

599
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,840
I have to dress up as well.

600
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,760
Everyone's going all out for this.

601
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,719
You remember all the cues, right?

602
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,119
I do.

603
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,960
And you didn't tell me
that you like Paeng.

604
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,159
How's that your business?

605
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:07,840
Take all the shots and don't miss
any important moments.

606
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:11,360
I know. You keep repeating it.
Don't you trust me?

607
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:12,800
Come on.

608
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,119
Really.

609
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,119
Artit, hasn't
the client arrived yet?

610
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,159
He'll be here.

611
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,280
Kot, have you rehearsed
what photos you need to take?

612
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,239
Do I really have to?

613
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,519
I completely forgot.

614
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:54,880
Let's check the lighting, Ling.
Come on.

615
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:57,719
Here. Let's rehearse.

616
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,039
Let's see if the makeup
is alright now.

617
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:03,199
Here. Turn around.

618
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,159
There. Look impassive like a lady

619
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,840
Try striking a pose.

620
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,880
- Paeng, can you help Ling?
- Of course.

621
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:16,119
Ah.

622
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,639
This way.

623
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,159
We're just rehearsing.
Why do we need music?

624
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,519
Non, why are you here?

625
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,800
Leave me for now. I'm working.

626
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,960
You still don't know.

627
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,840
I know

628
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,760
that you don't like things
to be extravagant.

629
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,440
But this is an important moment
for both of us.

630
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,039
I want to be with you.

631
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,039
And the most important person
in my life is you.

632
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:18,239
I love you, Ling.

633
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,440
Will you marry me?

634
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,239
Are you sure that it's me?

635
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:31,760
I'm sure.

636
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,440
You're sure that there's
only going to be me

637
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:39,840
in your life?

638
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,039
I'm sure

639
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:49,079
that the only person
I want in my life

640
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:51,280
is you.

641
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:55,599
I don't need anyone else.

642
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,599
Will you marry me?

643
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,920
Yes, I'll marry you.

644
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:29,760
I'm getting married! Kot! Artit!

645
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,599
Congrats!

646
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,079
Get closer!

647
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,039
Alright!

648
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,079
I'm so envious.

649
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:26,800
I envy them too.

650
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,000
If you envy them,

651
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,199
then why don't you make
your life happy like theirs?

652
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,400
Artit,

653
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,360
it's not as easy in real life.

654
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:47,199
That's right.

655
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,519
There are obstacles in real life,

656
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,320
big and small,

657
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:55,639
but we have to get through them.

658
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,800
We also have to stay grounded

659
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:04,920
and know what's possible

660
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:06,880
and impossible.

661
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,760
And what's impossible?

662
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,519
Have you tried?

663
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,199
I know about the police
catching the culprits.

664
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,039
You don't have to worry
about me anymore.

665
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:28,159
But I do.

666
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:31,960
You have to try not to.

667
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,239
Can I go back and stay
at my place now?

668
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,119
When?

669
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:46,760
Today.

670
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,239
There! That's pretty.

671
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,360
You two still don't have
a picture together.

672
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,639
I'll do it for free. Okay?

673
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,360
It's alright, Kot.

674
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:10,559
Come on. It's only free for today.

675
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:13,079
Paeng, you stand next to Artit.

676
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:17,480
You're siblings from childhood.
Come on, just one photo.

677
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,639
That's right.

678
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:23,280
Okay. One, two...

679
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,360
Are we taking a passport photo?

680
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,079
Show some emotion. Be happy.

681
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:29,559
It's a happy day today.

682
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:32,800
Be like Paeng. Smile a little.

683
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:34,760
There.

684
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:38,880
Your pose is right
but you have to smile, Artit.

685
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,519
There.

686
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:43,800
What about your arms?
Get close to each other.

687
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:56,519
Put your arms around her
like you're close.

688
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,280
You're like siblings.

689
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:20,760
What are you looking at?
Look at the camera.

690
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,920
Gosh.

691
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,360
Or your face will be dark.

692
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,400
(Mark)

693
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:03,159
As a brother,

694
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,760
I am ordering you to stop
fraternizing with him.

695
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:15,159
I want to take care
of your daughter,

696
01:08:17,649 --> 01:08:20,239
but she never thinks of me.

697
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:23,399
Never,

698
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:26,760
Pimnapa.

699
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:52,319
You've been so busy lately that you
haven't had any time to talk to me.

700
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,529
I'm sorry, Uncle.

701
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:01,079
I need to ask for your permission
about something.

702
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:04,569
What for?

703
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:07,159
Tomorrow morning,
I'm leaving for Bangkok.

704
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:12,039
Why are you going there?

705
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:17,529
I have a meeting with a client
who's interested in the products.

706
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:22,760
It's only for work, right?

707
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:28,439
I'm also going there to look into
my mom's case.

708
01:09:33,079 --> 01:09:34,159
Paeng!

709
01:09:37,529 --> 01:09:39,199
Are you sure

710
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:41,840
that you want to reopen the case?

711
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,119
Yes, Uncle.

712
01:10:31,609 --> 01:10:33,569
- Mark?
- Paeng.

713
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,529
Did you come to Bangkok too?
What a coincidence.

714
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,199
Mark, I'm here to meet a client.

715
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,359
Your client is me.

716
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,119
You won't answer my calls

717
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,159
so I had to do it this way.

718
01:10:57,399 --> 01:10:59,800
I've been very busy lately.

719
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:01,359
There are many things I have to do.

720
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:03,479
Don't forget

721
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,649
that I'm also one of your clients.

722
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:14,159
Mark,

723
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:17,399
are you really doing
this because of work?

724
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,159
You probably know

725
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,609
the reason why I'm doing this.

726
01:11:28,529 --> 01:11:29,609
Is it because of Artit?

727
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,439
- How is he involved?
- It's because of him.

728
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:36,680
That's why you're ignoring me.

729
01:11:38,609 --> 01:11:41,760
I told you I've been busy lately.

730
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,279
No one has anything to do with this.

731
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:50,399
Speaking of the devil.

732
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:57,479
(Artit)

733
01:12:02,649 --> 01:12:03,720
Paeng,

734
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:06,880
what picture is that?
It looks familiar.

735
01:12:10,279 --> 01:12:11,649
It's familiar to you?

736
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,920
Can I have a look?

737
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,239
It looks like a tattoo.

738
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:27,529
I've seen it on someone.

739
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,760
You've seen it?

740
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,569
It's very familiar.
But I can't remember who.

741
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:42,609
Mark, if you remember,

742
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,760
please tell me right away.

743
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:48,529
Is it that important?

744
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,760
It's very important to me.

745
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,079
Then,

746
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,319
should we eat first?

747
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,079
In the meantime, I'll try to
remember where I've seen it.

748
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,840
Okay.

749
01:13:06,609 --> 01:13:07,680
Excuse me.

750
01:13:19,649 --> 01:13:20,720
I'll give you a lift.

751
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:22,399
It's okay.

752
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,159
I drove myself here.
Let's part ways here.

753
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,760
Mark, once you remember,

754
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,279
please contact me.

755
01:13:30,569 --> 01:13:32,960
Okay. I'll walk you to your car.

756
01:13:33,529 --> 01:13:36,319
Okay. I parked over there.

757
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,529
Where are you going next?

758
01:13:39,569 --> 01:13:41,760
I'm going to the police station.

759
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,319
What's the matter?
Why do you have to go there?

760
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:47,529
It's only a small matter.
It's nothing really.

761
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,279
But if you need any help,
you can let me know.

762
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:53,199
Thank you.

763
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,079
Let's go.

764
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:01,529
I'm here to see
the investigation Inspector.

765
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,000
Please head to the second floor.

766
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,960
Artit, why are you here?

767
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:17,359
Why didn't you answer my calls?

768
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:20,800
Did Uncle ask you to come?

769
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,239
I have some business to attend to.

770
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,529
Let's leave it for later.

771
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:26,319
Why?

772
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:29,039
Uncle asked you to stop me?

773
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,039
Why would he do that?
I don't understand.

774
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:36,239
Paeng,

775
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:38,649
please don't reopen the case.

776
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,239
You know about it?

777
01:14:44,569 --> 01:14:45,720
Uncle told you.

778
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,529
I'm sorry that my dad
broke his promise.

779
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:53,239
But believe me, he means well.

780
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:55,920
I don't understand his reasoning.

781
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:57,680
It's okay if you don't.

782
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:00,000
Just trust him.

783
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:03,479
No.

784
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,359
I have to know about this.

785
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,079
Paeng!

786
01:15:11,649 --> 01:15:12,720
Paeng!

787
01:15:15,609 --> 01:15:16,680
Excuse me,

788
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:18,649
what else would you like to know?

789
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,880
Have you talked to each other?

790
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:29,439
You're Wanfahmai who called about
the case from eight years ago?

791
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,119
Hello,

792
01:15:36,359 --> 01:15:39,479
I'm Wanfahmai.
I'm Pimnapa's daughter.

793
01:15:40,609 --> 01:15:42,159
What would you like to know?

794
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,609
I'd like to know all the details
about my mother's case.

795
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:49,119
Have the police
caught the culprit yet?

796
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:53,359
I think we should give her
all the details.

797
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,840
About what?

798
01:15:58,609 --> 01:16:01,649
About this case being
closed eight years ago

799
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:03,960
And we've found a suspect.

800
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,529
Who? Is it the person with
the tattoo?

801
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,359
Based on the crime scene,

802
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:11,840
the motive,

803
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,800
and the witnesses,

804
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:16,279
we believe that there's one culprit.

805
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,199
Please go on.
I want to know the truth.

806
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,960
Have you caught the culprit?

807
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,079
He's already passed away.

808
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:31,760
He's dead? Why?

809
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:34,720
Did he try to escape?
What's his name? Who is he?

810
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,800
- Stop, Paeng.
- Leave me alone!

811
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,079
Yes?

812
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:41,960
I'd like to know the truth.

813
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:43,840
I have the right to know.

814
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:49,000
The prime suspect in the
murder of Pimnapa

815
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:52,039
was her husband.
His name was Tharathep.

816
01:16:59,609 --> 01:17:00,680
That's not true.

817
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,960
I don't believe it.

818
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,239
He really loved her.

819
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,039
He would never hurt her.

820
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,720
We think it was him,
based on the evidence we found,

821
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:18,239
whether it was physical
evidence or from eye-witnesses.

822
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:19,569
It all indicates that

823
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:23,159
Tharathep murdered Pimnapa.

824
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,569
What evidence?

825
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,479
The evidence is

826
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,529
the DNA found on her fingers.

827
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:37,079
It's not true. I don't believe it!

828
01:17:37,159 --> 01:17:38,439
I won't believe it!

829
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:40,840
Paeng!

830
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,239
Paeng! Paeng! Hold on!

831
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,960
Do you and Uncle really
believe that my dad did it?

832
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,319
Do you really believe it?

833
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:53,609
Paeng, pull yourself together.

834
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:56,279
The police aren't framing your dad.

835
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:01,079
But the evidence and witnesses
indicate that is the case.

836
01:18:03,649 --> 01:18:05,159
Your parents had an argument

837
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,800
before your mom...

838
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:10,529
before she died.

839
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:14,880
Uncle Tharathep might
have lost control.

840
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,609
Dad didn't kill her.

841
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:22,479
He loved her so much.

842
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:26,920
That's why my dad
didn't want to tell you.

843
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,319
He's afraid you wouldn't accept it.

844
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,000
And you can?

845
01:18:31,609 --> 01:18:33,920
Do you believe what Uncle believes?

846
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,159
I don't want to believe it either.

847
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:40,880
Don't want to believe?

848
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:43,800
It means that you believe it!

849
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:47,479
Then stay out of this!

850
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,239
Stay away from me!

851
01:18:50,529 --> 01:18:52,239
I'll find evidence

852
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:54,199
to prove that my dad was innocent.

853
01:18:56,039 --> 01:18:57,119
Enough, Paeng.

854
01:18:58,279 --> 01:18:59,760
I don't want to see you sad anymore.

855
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:02,649
But I'm sad right now.

856
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:06,529
Do you know why?

857
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,760
Because you and Uncle are so mean.

858
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,960
Uncle's always known about this
but he never told me.

859
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:23,079
He's my dad's best friend.

860
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,359
My dad ended up getting accused

861
01:19:26,439 --> 01:19:27,649
even though he didn't
commit the crime!

862
01:19:28,649 --> 01:19:31,319
Hasn't he ever thought
about vouching for him?

863
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,159
What do you want him to do?

864
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,479
If someone accused Uncle,

865
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,359
would you just accept it?

866
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,609
I'm not angry with him.

867
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,960
But I'm sad. I'm sad for Dad

868
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,960
because the person who knew him
his whole life

869
01:19:56,319 --> 01:19:58,279
doesn't believe
that he didn't do it.

870
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:09,399
I don't want to see your
face anymore.

871
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,119
Don't follow me.

872
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,039
Paeng.

873
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:46,319
Paeng,

874
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,479
what picture is that?
It looks familiar.

875
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,159
It looks like a tattoo.

876
01:20:55,079 --> 01:20:57,239
I've seen it on someone.

877
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,319
If someone accused Uncle,

878
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,239
would you just accept it?

879
01:21:31,569 --> 01:21:34,649
But I'm sad. I'm sad for Dad

880
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,840
because the person who knew him
his whole life

881
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:41,000
doesn't believe
that he didn't do it.

882
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:49,479
What's the matter, Paeng?

883
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:51,529
Mark,

884
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:55,239
are you free to meet me?

885
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,649
I'm always free to meet up with you.

886
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,920
Where are you? I'll pick you up.

887
01:23:20,439 --> 01:23:21,529
Please.

888
01:23:22,279 --> 01:23:23,359
Thank you.

889
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,479
What would you like to ask me?

890
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:44,920
Do you remember

891
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:48,079
where you saw the tattoo?

892
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,479
I'm trying.

893
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,359
But why does it seem like you're
in a hurry?

894
01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:58,079
Because you're my only hope.

895
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:01,439
I'm searching for a murderer.

896
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:03,479
A murderer?

897
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:06,439
Who was murdered?

898
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,840
Paeng!

899
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:16,920
Why didn't you listen to my warning?

900
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,760
What about you?
I told you not to follow me.

901
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,119
And why did you?

902
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:23,439
I'm worried.

903
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:29,159
Come with me. We'll talk later.

904
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:30,529
No.

905
01:24:31,609 --> 01:24:34,079
Let me go. Give me some respect.

906
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,000
How am I disrespectful to you?

907
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,569
What about him?
You trust him more than me?

908
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:49,960
I told you to leave her alone.

909
01:24:50,569 --> 01:24:52,039
Ask her yourself.

910
01:24:54,359 --> 01:24:56,159
I'm the one who asked him to come.

911
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:58,399
We have something we need
to talk about.

912
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:01,319
And it's private.

913
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:03,840
Is that clear?

914
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,840
It's none of your business.

915
01:25:06,529 --> 01:25:07,609
Paeng.

916
01:25:08,279 --> 01:25:10,920
Once I'm done,
I'll go home by myself.

917
01:25:21,319 --> 01:25:22,399
Then I'll wait.

918
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,479
Let's continue our
conversation elsewhere.

919
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:40,960
I don't think you should follow us.

920
01:26:07,319 --> 01:26:08,649
Don't worry, Paeng.

921
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:11,319
Now that I know how important it is,
I want to help.

922
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,000
I'll try to remember
where I've seen that tattoo.

923
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:16,479
I'll tell you right away.

924
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:18,439
Thank you.

925
01:26:21,649 --> 01:26:23,079
But you seem really stressed.

926
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,609
Should we go up to my room
and have a drink?

927
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:36,159
I think I shouldn't.

928
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,079
I'm not that stressed.

929
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,039
I think I should go home now.

930
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:45,609
I'm worried about you.

931
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,960
Thank you for coming to see me.

932
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,569
Why are you in such a hurry?

933
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:05,609
I haven't talked about
what I want to say to you yet.

934
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,119
What's the matter?

935
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:10,649
We can just talk here.

936
01:27:11,569 --> 01:27:13,609
I don't think this is
the right place.

937
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:16,199
Uh...

938
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:18,439
Why not?

939
01:27:19,649 --> 01:27:20,720
Then

940
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:23,880
if we can't talk here,
I'll have to excuse myself.

941
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:27,439
I have a lot of things to do today.

942
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,880
I really can't talk right now.

943
01:27:34,119 --> 01:27:35,199
Paeng.

944
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,560
Are you only going to talk
about your own matters?

945
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:10,760
It really is you.

946
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,439
Why don't you ask me nicely
what you want to know?

947
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,119
Do you know that I've waited
for the day to have you here

948
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:21,159
with me for a very long time?

949
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:22,319
Why does it have to be me?

950
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:23,680
I'll try my best to be gentle.

951
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,479
I have something
important to tell you.

952
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,800
If your family doesn't accept me,

953
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:34,199
then we can't love
each other anymore.

954
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:36,800
You don't have to be
tough all the time.

955
01:28:37,239 --> 01:28:39,000
Be vulnerable sometimes
so that I can take care of you.

956
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,680
I don't object to accepting you
as my niece

957
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:43,920
or a close relative.

958
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:45,880
But as for a daughter-in-law...

959
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:48,439
Thank you very much
for understanding me.
