1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,210
Miss Paeng!

3
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,669
Watch out!

4
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,300
Have a think about how you're
going to get back to me.

5
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:45,460
Psycho!

6
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:48,460
I'm not paying.

7
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,840
Because these three
aren't my employees anymore.

8
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,000
Stay with me. I'll look after you.

9
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,550
You only have money and no brain.

10
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,300
I'm going to show you that

11
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,960
I can survive without money,

12
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,210
If Paeng works for you,

13
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,250
then that means she's
my subordinate.

14
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,460
If the recipient has
committed a grave sin,

15
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,669
these merits can help them, right?

16
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,840
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

17
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:15,500
Dad!

18
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,669
A grave sin

19
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,590
is committed by murdering someone

20
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,129
or killing oneself, I think.

21
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,050
- Non!
- Hey!

22
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,379
- Nang.
- Help me!

23
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,590
- Nang! Nang!
- Help me!

24
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,129
Non, move!

25
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Don't Non. Kot's going to kill me.

26
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,340
Hold on. What's up with you two?

27
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,460
Well, it's her. She hid the stuff
I have to deliver this afternoon.

28
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,879
You owe me for accommodation, food
and beverages costs.

29
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,379
It's nearly been a year already.

30
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,129
Nang, it's only a year.

31
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,840
I promise I'll pay next year.

32
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,879
I'd be crazy to believe you.

33
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,050
- Give it back now.
- No.

34
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,379
Stop!

35
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,250
Stop fighting like children!

36
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,750
Your sister is the child.

37
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,960
- It's you!
- That's right.

38
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:04,500
You're a grown-up but leech on
to your friend like a parasite.

39
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,669
Hey.

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,210
Nang!

41
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,960
Hey! Kot! Kot!

42
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,129
- Come here!
- Kot, enough!

43
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,709
I can't let her go.
This is Mahan's order.

44
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,750
I'm begging you.

45
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,959
It's me who's begging you.

46
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,050
You have to go and pick Ling up
from the hospital for me.

47
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,209
Hey, hey.

48
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:25,800
What's wrong with Ling?

49
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:27,550
I don't know. Probably just a cold.

50
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,339
Hey, Nang!

51
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,750
What you do think, Ling?

52
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,209
I've made my decision.

53
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,629
Certainly. We still have time.

54
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,879
Please carefully consider

55
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,629
what the best choice is for you.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,629
At the moment, you've gotten better,

57
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,300
but it might only be temporary.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,750
Removing the tumor

59
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,170
is the only way for you
to fully recover.

60
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,670
I know you're anxious,

61
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,000
but I'd still like you to consider
whether your life

62
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,589
or the thing you're worried about
is more important.

63
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,339
Mootoo.

64
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,839
Mootoo.

65
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,339
Where has he gone to?

66
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,050
Mootoo.

67
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,500
Not just you who's disappeared,
you took your baby too.

68
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,129
Where did you come from?

69
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,459
Don't you dare tread on
my bed of roses.

70
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,129
Ahh!

71
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:51,920
Little pig.

72
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,129
Oink-oink. Oink-oink.

73
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,800
Little pig, come out.

74
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:01,420
Come out now. Come out.

75
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,709
You little rascal.

76
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,589
Yes! You're so hard to catch.

77
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,839
You dare to tread on
my bed of roses?

78
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,250
Where did you come from?

79
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:22,050
Huh? Where did you come from?

80
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,589
Hey.

81
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,300
Are you really that angry with me?

82
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:27,959
Is that why you're
taking it out on my pig?

83
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:31,959
I'm not crazy enough
to take it out on a pig.

84
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,300
Here. Take him back to his mom.

85
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,959
Why are you handing him to me?

86
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,420
You caught him. You take him back.

87
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,629
Don't run away again.

88
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,629
Your mom's worried about you.

89
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,670
Only a crazy person
would talk to pigs.

90
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,050
I'm not crazy.

91
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,379
You heard me?

92
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,920
You're so loud. If I didn't hear,
I'd have to be deaf.

93
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,709
What are you doing to me?

94
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:18,089
Let me go right now.
Where are you taking me?

95
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,550
Stop being so squeamish.

96
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,459
Do you think that I'm going
to assault you?

97
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,879
Didn't you know that
there's a cut on your elbow?

98
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,300
Not only you're crazy
but you also have thick skin.

99
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,169
Let me go. I can walk on my own.

100
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,669
Why?

101
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,669
Do you feel something
when I touch you?

102
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,799
Pervert!

103
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,919
I meant that you feel angry.

104
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,960
What did you think?

105
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,629
Here. Do it yourself.

106
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:54,840
I don't want to get close to you.

107
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,419
You might try to assault me again.

108
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,590
That will never happen again.

109
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:03,250
I'm sorry but I don't think
I can believe you.

110
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:05,500
Should I swear on my life?

111
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,750
You'd probably end up dying.

112
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:14,629
Paeng.

113
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,629
- Hello, Non.
- Hello.

114
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,379
A first aid kit?

115
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,000
What did you to her?

116
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,879
Oh,

117
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,299
he didn't do anything. I just fell.

118
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:30,379
You're so mean.

119
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,379
Crybaby.

120
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,750
You're heartless, Artit.

121
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,799
Paeng, let me clean
the wound for you.

122
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,840
Why did you come here anyway?

123
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,210
To see you, actually.

124
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:00,879
Why aren't you taking care of Ling?

125
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:02,710
Why should I?

126
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,250
She's sick.

127
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,090
Oh? What's wrong?

128
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:09,129
Kot said she's sick.

129
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,379
What kind of boyfriend are you?

130
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,000
Non, I can do it myself.

131
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,169
It's okay. I'll do it for you.

132
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,000
You should pay attention
to Ling too.

133
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,049
Ling didn't tell me.
What should I do?

134
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:26,629
You're such a...

135
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:29,129
Non,

136
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,840
it's alright.

137
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,879
- All done.
- Okay.

138
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:37,000
- I'm sorry.
- Finally.

139
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,049
Thank you very much.

140
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:41,669
I have to excuse myself now.

141
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:43,710
Let me give you a lift.

142
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,299
Oh,

143
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,919
didn't you come here to see me?

144
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:49,379
I'm done with you.

145
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,090
Come on, Paeng.

146
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,169
Put it away.

147
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
- Is Ling sick?
- Yes.

148
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,669
And why isn't Artit
taking care of her?

149
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,669
That's why I'm angry
at him right now.

150
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh.

151
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,250
Artit's such a bummer.

152
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:15,460
Instead of spending his time
taking care of Ling,

153
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,169
he's scrutinizing me.

154
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,500
That's right. He's such a bummer.

155
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,210
Ling must be blind.

156
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,250
How can she like Artit?

157
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,169
Didn't you use to be blind too?

158
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,169
Non! I'm begging you.

159
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,799
Please don't talk about
that anymore.

160
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,250
It's such a tainted part
of my life's history.

161
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,840
Thank you very much
for being kind to me.

162
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,840
No need to thank me.

163
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:48,299
You're like my other sister.

164
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,299
That's nice.
I've always wanted a brother.

165
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,669
Don't be afraid of Artit.

166
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,460
He might say mean things
but he's got a good heart.

167
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,340
I think he says mean things
and has a black heart.

168
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,840
Let's do it this way.

169
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,049
I'll help you get back at him.

170
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,169
I've been annoyed at him for a while
now. He won't stop being cheeky.

171
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,919
You said it.
Don't ever take it back.

172
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,049
For sure.

173
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,590
Let's go.

174
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:27,710
Gosh!

175
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,049
I only have 250 baht left.

176
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,549
I don't have my credit cards or
ATM cards.

177
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,299
Jeez.

178
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,879
It's okay, Miss Paeng.

179
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,590
We'll be careful.
It should be enough.

180
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,879
By the way,

181
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,379
do you have enough money
for my salary.

182
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,549
Darn.

183
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,879
Aueng, what should we do?

184
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,000
How are we going to feed ourselves?

185
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,340
It's still a long time
before I get paid.

186
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,299
I'll be dead for sure.

187
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,419
I'll be dead too.

188
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,629
What should we do?

189
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,460
Actually, there's a way
to earn some money.

190
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,750
But it might be a bit risky.

191
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:26,210
I don't care if it's risky

192
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,250
as long as I earn money.

193
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:29,840
It's for your own sake too.

194
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:49,419
Miss Paeng!

195
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,879
Miss Paeng!

196
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,379
- Miss Paeng!
- Aueng,

197
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,629
come and see my babies!
They're blooming!

198
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,090
Save it for later.

199
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,919
Our time has finally come!

200
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,379
Huh? It's time?

201
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,549
Yes!

202
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,590
You're not going
to wait for me at all?

203
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:09,960
Miss Paeng, wait!

204
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,960
The 88th fifth prize.

205
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,250
Come on! Come on!

206
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,090
Zero-eight-eight-seven-six-zero.

207
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,960
Zero-eight-eight-seven-six-zero.

208
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,129
What is it?

209
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,169
Miss Paeng, it's our joy in llife.

210
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,840
Why are you getting in the way?

211
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,549
That's right. I have a hunch
that I'll win big.

212
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:34,919
Let me listen to it.

213
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,299
Please don't get in
the way of my happiness.

214
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,590
Quiet. I'm listening.

215
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:43,379
Zero-five-zero-nine-three-eight.

216
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,379
Zero-five-zero-nine-three-eight.

217
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,799
Paeng bought a ticket too.

218
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:50,090
Are you joining us too?

219
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,129
Can you be quiet?

220
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,840
Sathu, Holy Spirits.

221
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:58,340
Let me win something this time.

222
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,169
I've given my everything.

223
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,460
It was 200 baht. I hope I win!

224
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,129
Come on, everyone. Keep going!

225
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,250
For the three digits prize.
First time.

226
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:11,090
The winning number is

227
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,590
one-three-two.

228
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,379
One-three-two.

229
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,710
I repeat.

230
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,129
First three digits prize.
First time.

231
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,129
- The winning number is one...
- Hold on a second!

232
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,000
What now? I'm busy
listening to this!

233
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:38,299
Don't! The number might change.

234
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,460
I'm busy!

235
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:47,250
What is it?

236
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:50,799
What?

237
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,090
Mr. Artit.

238
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,090
Isn't it this considered
working time?

239
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,500
Is it time to be listening
to the lottery numbers?

240
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,500
- Artit, can I have...
- No.

241
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,169
- The equipment will be used...
- Get back to work.

242
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:08,629
- The equipment will be used...
- Hey,

243
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,879
you too?

244
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:16,549
- Pong.
- Yes?

245
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,919
Turn the radio off right now?

246
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,549
Come on.

247
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,879
Don't.

248
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,419
It's an order.

249
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,629
Hey!

250
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,879
Final three digits prize.
First time.

251
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,710
The number is...

252
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,000
Whoa!

253
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,840
Give me that!

254
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,000
Mr. Artit!

255
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,250
Come on.

256
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:47,129
Artit,

257
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:50,340
you don't understand people who
are trying to make a living like us.

258
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,879
The lottery is our hope

259
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,340
to become rich.

260
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,629
We only ask for 10 minutes or so

261
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,710
the 1st and 16th day of every month.

262
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,750
Are you that heartless?

263
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,549
Hear, hear.

264
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,460
The numbers are now
ready to be displayed.

265
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,089
The first prize

266
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:17,549
for January 17, 2020.

267
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,089
The winning number is...

268
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,920
I'm going to win for sure.

269
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:43,500
You all lost! See?

270
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,710
Okay. Are you ready
to go back to work?

271
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,049
Get back to work now.

272
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,089
I told you not to rely on this.

273
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,589
Hold on.

274
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,380
Feel to mock me. I'm ready.

275
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,049
Do you have money to feed yourself?

276
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,049
I'm not hungry yet.

277
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,880
I thought you said
you're not hungry.

278
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,210
What was that sound?

279
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,000
You're a killjoy.
That's why I didn't win.

280
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,380
Don't blame it on me.

281
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,750
If you didn't buy a lottery ticket,
you would've had money for food.

282
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,049
Am I right?

283
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,250
It's okay. I'm on a diet.

284
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:31,750
I don't want to eat too much anyway.

285
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,500
Let's go, Aueng.

286
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,799
Goodbye.

287
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,210
You dare to smile?

288
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
- Saeb!
- Yes?

289
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,500
Get back to work.

290
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:49,630
Yes, sir.

291
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,839
You're eating the ticket.

292
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,089
Is that filling for you?

293
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:56,589
Come on, Aod. Work.

294
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,549
Get going.

295
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,839
- Pong.
- Yes?

296
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,000
Did you win?

297
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:04,250
I got six but didn't win anything.

298
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,880
Get going. Don't buy it next time.

299
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,250
Every single time.

300
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,460
There are two options today.
Help yourself.

301
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,089
- Take as much as you want.
- Okay.

302
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,710
Miss Paeng,

303
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:23,500
are we really going to do this?

304
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:29,630
It's better than starving to death.

305
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:33,960
I know we're both hungry

306
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,500
but if we go in,

307
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:37,960
Dung's going to beat us up.

308
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,210
Not only will we not get to eat,

309
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,549
but we might not survive either.

310
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:52,960
Let's go!

311
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,630
I'm not going to eat anymore!

312
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,710
Come on!

313
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,210
Whoa.

314
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,839
I told you to come and eat here
but you wouldn't.

315
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,210
You must be very hungry.

316
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:09,839
I was being considerate.

317
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,049
But I think

318
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,710
let's just forget it
for the time being.

319
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,630
Tubtim,

320
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,839
she's only here to eat.

321
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:20,630
I'm full now.

322
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,170
Then I'll have the fried fish.

323
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,460
Alright. Getting beaten to death is
better than starving to death.

324
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:54,549
Thongkhum!

325
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,920
Duang!

326
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,589
Is she possessed?

327
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,880
Creepy.

328
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,500
What are you doing?

329
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,339
Is there anything I can
help you with?

330
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:09,670
- No!
- No!

331
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,089
Oh, dear.

332
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,500
Are you malnourished or something?
Disgusting.

333
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,420
You're okay with eating here now,

334
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:35,460
next time you can
sleep here as well.

335
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,589
- Huh, Krongprateep!?
- Huh, Dad!?

336
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,049
Gosh!

337
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,839
You're fast asleep.

338
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,210
You got away with it without me.

339
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,210
Aueng!

340
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,960
Thank you.

341
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,589
Get back to work.

342
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,339
Oh? Oh?

343
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:42,339
Here. It's yours.

344
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,710
Wow.

345
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,960
What is this? Why is it 1,200 baht?

346
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:54,130
You have to pay
for the stuff from Kot.

347
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:55,670
I deducted it.

348
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,670
I also charged you for the food
you've eaten at my place.

349
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,089
You charged me for that?

350
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:07,170
Greedy!

351
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,339
Aueng,

352
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,089
a mean man deducted all of my money.

353
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,960
I don't have enough money to pay
for your salary.

354
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,250
Why aren't you sad?

355
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,839
Uhh...

356
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,839
Because she has her own salary.

357
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,000
Aueng.

358
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:38,880
Thank you!

359
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,170
What's the meaning of this?

360
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,589
She'll starve to death if she waits
for you to pay her.

361
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,210
Please don't be angry at me.

362
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:49,210
I have to do it for my own survival.

363
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,750
Please forgive me.

364
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,130
If you still can't look
after yourself,

365
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,049
don't think about looking
after others. Understand?

366
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,380
Aueng, go back to work.

367
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,460
Yes, Mr. Artit.

368
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,130
Is this your plan to bully me?

369
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,920
How am I bullying you?

370
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,549
Nonsense.

371
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,299
Tubtim,

372
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,170
I'd like some fried boiled egg
with tamarind sauce today.

373
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,299
We're out of eggs.

374
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,000
Because you let Paeng eat here.

375
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:52,880
If you want her to eat here,
find something to eat yourself.

376
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,170
She's is really
hard to control, isn't she?

377
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,630
Don't underestimate me.

378
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:11,250
Oh! Krongprateep!

379
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,500
I told you not to get up too fast.

380
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,839
- Okay.
- Let's get you to the sofa.

381
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,670
Artit, help Dad.

382
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,589
It's okay. Don't bother.

383
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,920
Don't you have
a meeting in town today?

384
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,210
Get going.

385
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,380
Okay. Let me get changed first,
then I'll go.

386
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:35,630
Go on. Go on.

387
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,500
Do you want to go rest inside?

388
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:41,670
- Slowly.
- I'll sit here.

389
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,130
Really.

390
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:45,839
I'm sore right here.

391
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,250
- Are you?
- Yes.

392
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,670
Turn this way.
I'll give you a massage.

393
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,549
I'd like to present this year's
concept for the festival to you.

394
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:56,130
It's zero-waste, environmental
and agricultural tourism.

395
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,839
Namely, it won't produce
any garbage.

396
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,799
Which is a priority worldwide.

397
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,339
Starting from transportation,

398
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,089
tourism, accommodation,

399
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,130
food, and beverages.

400
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,839
As for the walking street festival,

401
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,880
there will be local
agricultural products.

402
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,130
All the packages must be

403
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,000
made of natural materials,
such as banana leaves.

404
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,710
The products being sold will be
iconic to each province.

405
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,750
The event will emphasize

406
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:27,589
the district's products.

407
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,839
Each community

408
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,130
will get to propose
new ideas and concepts,

409
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,799
which will make it more interesting.

410
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,500
Yum!

411
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,170
Hey, Madeaw.
Where did you get that phone?

412
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,710
It's mine. Mr. Artit gave it to me
a while ago.

413
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,089
Wow, Mr. Artit gave it to you?

414
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,630
That's odd.

415
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,460
Take a look at it for me.
It's busted.

416
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,839
What?

417
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,210
Oh, right.

418
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,750
It just needs an update, see?

419
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,630
Your storage is also full.

420
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:08,380
You have to delete some things.

421
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,049
Do it for me.

422
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:13,920
Alright, alright.
I'll delete some pictures.

423
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,210
Hey!

424
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,549
Madeaw, how did you take
these pictures?

425
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,170
Hey, give that to me!

426
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,710
No, Madeaw.

427
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,799
How did you take these?

428
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,799
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

429
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,210
You have to see this.

430
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:34,839
What? I don't want to.

431
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,460
You have to see this.

432
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,299
Madeaw, why were you
taking photos of me in secret?

433
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,960
Just for fun.

434
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,210
Madeaw,

435
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,549
tell me why you took
these right now?

436
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,210
Or I'll tell your mom to punish you.

437
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:00,380
Mr. Artit ordered me to.

438
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,339
Oh, shoot.

439
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,339
Miss Paeng.

440
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:18,250
We're collaborating with the hotel.

441
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,710
We'll arrange for them to stay
at the hotel

442
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,130
and take them sightseeing
in the province.

443
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,170
As for organization,

444
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:30,460
Artit will be the representative
for the private sector.

445
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,630
And I will be responsible
for tourism.

446
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,089
As for the style of the event,
I'll inform you again later.

447
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,089
I'm glad to see the new generation
has ideas to develop our province,

448
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,880
strengthen our community,
and make it sustainable.

449
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,549
Thank you all very much.

450
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,630
As for representatives from
the subdistricts,

451
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:52,130
local municipalities,

452
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,799
Provincial Agricultural Association,

453
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,710
Chamber of Commerce Association,

454
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,420
and public health.
What's your opinion on that?

455
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:01,380
Excuse me.

456
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,049
Something urgent came up.
I have to excuse myself.

457
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,420
I'm sorry.

458
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,589
Please take over for me.

459
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,549
(Saeb)

460
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:25,500
Artit, tell me right now
why you did this.

461
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,380
I don't have to.

462
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,339
You have to.

463
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:32,130
That is a photo of me

464
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,049
and my private life.

465
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:37,210
You have no right to
invade my privacy.

466
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,380
Why don't I?

467
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,049
This is my farm

468
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,670
and you're my employee.

469
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:47,799
There are over
100 security camera's here.

470
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,000
I see everyone and what they do.

471
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,799
Why are you so concerned about
a kid taking photos of you.

472
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,250
At least I didn't take photos
of you in the bathroom.

473
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,839
I guess you don't know
about Privacy Laws.

474
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,420
It might be during work hours
on the farm,

475
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:08,500
but that doesn't mean you
can invade my privacy.

476
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,799
If I go to the labor court

477
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:13,960
and file a report that
my employer is harassing me,

478
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:15,460
you're going to get arrested.

479
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,049
I know about labor laws.

480
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,339
But you can't use that as an excuse

481
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,880
because of the promise
you've given me.

482
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,630
You promised that you'll do anything

483
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,960
to atone for what you did.

484
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,250
So how is it? For this case,

485
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,549
which court should I go to,
Miss Lawyer?

486
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,880
Cluck-cluck-cluck.

487
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,710
Artit. Artit. Artit.

488
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,880
Can you help me? I haven't reached
my monthly sales target.

489
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,750
All of my regular customers
have also canceled.

490
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:05,670
You always use that excuse.

491
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,210
How many times have I helped you?

492
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:10,130
I've taken out nearly ten life
insurance policies on my family,

493
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,460
and that's not including
the farmhands either.

494
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,250
What are you on about? What life
insurance? I've quit that.

495
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,000
I didn't want my friend
to feel uneasy.

496
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,250
You've quit?

497
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:22,049
Then who's going to
look after my family?

498
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,839
Well... well...

499
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:27,299
It's alright. Someone has taken
over my job.

500
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,250
She's more skilled than me.
Don't worry.

501
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,170
- What's her name?
- Paweena.

502
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,049
Or is it Kanchana?

503
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,960
Sopa?

504
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,750
Supassara?

505
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,549
Anyway, if you need anything,

506
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,460
just tell me. I'll contact her.

507
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:45,589
Friends never abandon each other.
We're best friends.

508
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,380
But for now, come and take a look.
This is really interesting.

509
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,049
- Not interested.
- Come on. Aren't we friends?

510
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:56,420
I said I'm not interested.

511
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,460
What's is this?

512
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,250
Why are they all mixed up?

513
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,299
Miss Paeng said if Mr. Artit ask,

514
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,880
I should tell you that
it's "mixed fruit flavor."

515
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:28,839
It's mixed fruit flavor, Artit.

516
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,000
What is it?

517
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,880
The product report that you
told Paeng to do.

518
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,630
She's drawn pictures?

519
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,299
Yes, sir.

520
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,299
Did she think this was
just playtime?

521
00:33:58,089 --> 00:33:59,920
What are these codes?

522
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,130
Paeng is very good at drawing.

523
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,380
There's a drawing of your face too.

524
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,840
It's quite cute.

525
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,420
Pong!

526
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,050
How is it? You've seen
my awesome work skills.

527
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,210
You're confused, aren't you?
You deserve it.

528
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,710
You sassy girl.

529
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,960
It's the afternoon.
I have to do my job.

530
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,460
Fix it.

531
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,500
I don't have time to play with you.

532
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,880
I wasn't playing.

533
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,340
And I finished the work
according to your order.

534
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,840
You're deliberately being cheeky.

535
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,300
Why?

536
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,500
You're getting back at me
because of yesterday?

537
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,590
You know it. So please go.
I'm going to keep working.

538
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,750
What work?

539
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,960
Taking care of these roses?

540
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,590
What are you doing?

541
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,670
I don't think they've been trimmed.

542
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,050
Don't cut it!

543
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,750
Artit! Artit!

544
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,170
Artit! Don't!

545
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,090
I've been putting up with you.

546
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,960
But if you keep making
fun of everything,

547
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,380
I'm going to cut all of your roses.

548
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,920
Do you want to see that happen?

549
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,960
Answer me loudly.

550
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,630
- I don't.
- Louder!

551
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,750
- I don't!
- Good!

552
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,170
Come with me.

553
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,050
Where?

554
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,880
Are you going to play football
with that space?

555
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,130
No, I'm going to play tennis.

556
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,170
Cheeky.

557
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,250
My cheeks are cute.
No need to compliment me.

558
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,840
Did you just smack me in the head?

559
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,750
Are you crazy? Don't blame me.

560
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,750
You fell asleep and
your head hit the window.

561
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,420
If you break or crack the window,

562
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,800
I'm going to deduct it
from your pay.

563
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,920
Artit,

564
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,130
can you stop at a gas station
if we pass one?

565
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,460
What now? Why?

566
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,550
Just please stop.

567
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,710
You can't order me around.

568
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,840
I'm not your driver.

569
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,840
Turn, Artit!

570
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,000
- Turn!
- Okay.

571
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,880
A gas station! No!

572
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,050
Artit,

573
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,050
why didn't you believe me?

574
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,170
I can't hold it in anymore.
I need to pee.

575
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm going to pee right here.

576
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,000
Wait! Paeng! Stop! Hold it in.

577
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,630
You can't pee here. Stop!

578
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,880
Stop!

579
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,960
Stop at a gas station!

580
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,750
You're crazy.

581
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,550
How is it?

582
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,210
Feeling comfortable now?

583
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,800
I am.

584
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,840
It's afternoon now.

585
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,460
We should find something to eat.

586
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,960
What would you like?

587
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,590
I can choose?

588
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,840
Yes.

589
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,550
I can choose anything?

590
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,960
That's right.

591
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,210
After we leave here, tell me
which shop you'd like to go to.

592
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,840
It looks so delicious.

593
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,050
I haven't had food
this nice for a while.

594
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,630
Really?

595
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,800
Is there anything else you
want to eat? Just order.

596
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,380
Go on, you can order
everything you want.

597
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,800
This is enough. I don't think
I'll finish everything.

598
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,920
Can I start now?

599
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,380
Aren't you going to eat?

600
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,210
I'm happy to see you eat.

601
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,880
Yum.

602
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,750
Are you full? Should we
get the bill?

603
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,340
Excuse me, can I have
the bill, please?

604
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,710
Thank you.

605
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,880
Artit,

606
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,960
thank you very much
for being kind to me.

607
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,300
Don't thank me.

608
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,050
I wasn't being kind to you.

609
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,920
Here.

610
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,050
A keepsake. So you'll know
how much you've eaten.

611
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,300
What do you mean?

612
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,420
I mean next week when
you get your paycheck,

613
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,380
you'll know how much has been
deducted for this meal.

614
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,800
Hold the fort. I'll take the
tour group to see the farm.

615
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,960
Absolutely.

616
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,420
Let's go.

617
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,960
Ling.

618
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,960
Koi, what's going on?

619
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,960
She forgot her purse.
I have to stay here too.

620
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,590
- I'll take it to her.
- Okay.

621
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,500
Oops.

622
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,250
It was on sale,
so I bought it for you.

623
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,880
Do you like it?

624
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,050
I do.

625
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,170
What's up with you?

626
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,380
- Kot.
- What's going on?

627
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,550
- Tell me the truth.
- What truth?

628
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,210
Did you all lie to me?

629
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,590
What lie? No way.

630
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,300
About Artit and Ling.

631
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,130
They aren't a couple.

632
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,960
- How do you know?
- I know it because...

633
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,340
- It's just a guess.
- See? You don't actually know.

634
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,250
That's why I'm asking you.

635
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,250
I told you I don't know.

636
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,550
But I agree with you.

637
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,090
If you want to know,

638
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,090
why don't you ask Ling

639
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,800
or Artit?

640
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,880
You're so slow.

641
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,500
That's right.
Ling and I aren't together.

642
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,420
And what was it in the past?

643
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,050
It was only

644
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,590
your assumption.

645
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,590
I haven't said anything
about being with Ling.

646
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,210
- Artit!
- Hey!

647
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,670
If you punch me, I'll punch you.

648
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,500
But you made me assume things.

649
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,170
That's right. I used to like her.

650
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,050
But she doesn't like me.

651
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,960
We worked it out.

652
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,340
And now she and I are just friends.

653
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,090
Why didn't you tell me?

654
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,420
Ling asked me not to.

655
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,880
And why did she do that?

656
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,460
I don't understand either.

657
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,750
And you didn't even tell me!

658
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,250
Well, you didn't ask and you're
always assuming things.

659
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,920
Cheeky.

660
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,880
You're also dumb.

661
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,130
You only assumed and didn't ask.

662
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,420
- You traitor!
- Hey, hey! Non, enough.

663
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,050
Or my office might get trashed.

664
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,960
What are you going to do?

665
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,210
You know it now. Are you
going to woo her over?

666
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,170
Stay out of it. It's my business.

667
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,840
Ling and I are just friends.

668
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,590
Why didn't you tell me?

669
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,960
She asked me not to.

670
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,710
Let it be known.

671
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,050
Pon, I don't like to brag
but look, it's so thick.

672
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,130
- So thick.
- Mine's thin but huge.

673
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,250
It's probably just
a 1,000 baht note.

674
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,340
Honestly, I don't know
if I'll finish counting tonight.

675
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,590
I'll help you.

676
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,500
Mind your own envelope.

677
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,630
- Yes! Yes!
- Whoo!

678
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,550
- Whoo!
- It's here!

679
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,250
We've been paid.

680
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,380
I'll survive! I've been
struggling a lot lately.

681
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,670
I was so broke.

682
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,590
Saeb!

683
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,090
Miss Paeng, we've been paid.
Let's go hangout.

684
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,550
Yes, I'll go with you.

685
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,880
- Come with us, Aueng.
- I won't miss it.

686
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,920
Let me come with you too.

687
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,920
Of course.

688
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,300
They're at it again, Dad. Look.

689
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,670
They're always like this
whenever they get paid.

690
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,300
Of course. They want
to rest sometimes.

691
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,710
- Pull over!
- Pull over!

692
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,880
Miss Paeng, the truck is here!

693
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,420
- Miss Paeng!
- Coming! Coming!

694
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,960
Miss Paeng!

695
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:19,840
Come on, Miss Paeng.

696
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,960
Hold it there right.

697
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,710
Hey, what are you doing?

698
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,840
Getting in the truck. I got paid,
I'm going to spend some money.

699
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,800
Hurray!

700
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,550
There's a big flea market today.

701
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,170
Work hours have ended.
It's my private time now. I'm going.

702
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,050
I'm not stopping you.

703
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,380
But you're going in
the truck with them?

704
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,630
That's right!

705
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,340
Paeng, why don't you take your car?

706
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,590
It's out of gas

707
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:53,340
and I can't refill it
because I don't have any money.

708
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,250
Someone deducted most of my salary.

709
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,630
But it's okay. This is fun too.

710
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:02,460
We're carpooling.
It's better for the environment.

711
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,380
Hurray!

712
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,460
- Uncle, may I?
- You can go.

713
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,050
Drive carefully.

714
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,340
Take care of my niece.

715
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,090
Yes, Sir. Thank you very much.

716
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,170
Go! Go! Go!

717
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,750
That looks really fun.

718
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,090
Come on. Teenagers like us
should stay back and man the fort.

719
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,960
Can we try this out?

720
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:49,960
We're already doing it.

721
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,460
I'd like a pair of earmuffs.

722
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,550
When will you use those?

723
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,750
Aueng.

724
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,750
- Is it that cold?
- Saranghae, Miss Paeng.

725
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,960
What about this? Will I look good
showing off my muscles?

726
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,550
You'll look so good
that dogs will howl.

727
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,130
What do you mean?

728
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,210
- No, it doesn't look good.
- It doesn't.

729
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,500
- Why not?
- Your looks don't go well with it.

730
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,960
Wow!

731
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,800
That's my type!

732
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,300
- Really?
- Really.

733
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,000
- This.
- What? What?

734
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,500
A bag?

735
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,590
A woven bag.

736
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,840
It says it's handmade too.

737
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:28,670
Hey!

738
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:33,880
- Let go.
- Have some manners, Duang.

739
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,710
Don't you see that
you're grabbing my hand?

740
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,750
I do.

741
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,090
So what? Who cares?

742
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,130
I saw it first. So it's mine.

743
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:45,630
Let it go now.

744
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,630
Don't give in to her.

745
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,090
Why are you looking at me like that?

746
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:53,880
Should we fight then?

747
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:59,250
You're good at
provoking people, right?

748
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,920
Team up if you want. I'm not scared.

749
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,170
Don't give in to her.

750
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,590
Come on, Miss Paeng.

751
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:09,710
Oh!

752
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,380
Let's go, Aueng.

753
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:17,920
We'll see about this!

754
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,920
- Right.
- Miss Paeng, wait for me.

755
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,170
I thought you had guts.

756
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,590
Miss Paeng!

757
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,960
Miss Paeng!

758
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,460
Why didn't you slap her in the face?

759
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,250
If you do this, she'll think
we're scared of her.

760
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,420
You have to show her who's boss,
just like in the past.

761
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,250
So that she won't dare to
provoke us.

762
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,800
Do you really want me
to be like before?

763
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,920
Hot-tempered to the point

764
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,880
that I can't control myself when
someone says something I don't like?

765
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,550
Oh? Miss Paeng.

766
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,710
Just give it to her if she wants it.

767
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,130
It doesn't mean we're going to die

768
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,630
if we don't get that bag, does it?

769
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,340
But she was disrespecting you.

770
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,340
Other people might think
that you gave in to her.

771
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,500
How other people think about us

772
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,960
isn't as important as us
knowing ourselves.

773
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,050
Hearing you say that,
I feel like I'm a bad person.

774
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,840
It's okay.

775
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,590
You're angry
because you care about me.

776
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,420
Ignore her and don't be angry.

777
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,210
We're on an outing.
You have to smile.

778
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,090
Smile! Please?

779
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,420
You're so cute.

780
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,250
Okay, then.

781
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,250
Very good. Come on.

782
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,880
Aueng, it's Saeb and the guys.

783
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,800
Come on.

784
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,550
Miss Paeng, what did you buy?

785
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,420
So much food.

786
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,130
- A lot of things.
- Let's go for a walk.

787
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,210
I'll take you somewhere. Come on!

788
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,170
Hurry! Follow me!

789
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,210
Whoa!

790
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,000
- It's so beautiful!
- Wow!

791
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,750
What do you think, Paeng?
The food is around a hundred.

792
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,710
The view is worth a million.

793
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,960
And the service is about a ten.

794
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,500
Why is the service only a ten?

795
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,960
Because it's self-service.

796
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,920
But their food is awesome.

797
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,460
They have hot pot,

798
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,880
mala, Spicy minced pork,
and papaya salad.

799
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,750
So many things!

800
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,590
- That's right.
- Saeb,

801
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,300
I'm still full.

802
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,880
If you're not going to eat,
you can drink with me.

803
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,300
There are so many tonics here,

804
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,500
including herbal liquors.

805
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,000
It will energize you up real good.

806
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:48,880
Why am I getting goosebumps

807
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,050
from this conversation?

808
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:54,000
Hey! Aueng is mine!

809
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,170
Aueng, please have
your eyes on me only.

810
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,340
Alright.

811
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,000
Hold on, Saeb.

812
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,880
What's the different
between each tonic?

813
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,420
They're basically the same.

814
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,460
Like Viagra.

815
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:09,880
It will keep you up all night.

816
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,880
Saeb, you perv!

817
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,420
Smells nice!

818
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:15,710
Aueng!

819
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,500
Mr. Artit's here.

820
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:33,130
Great! Someone's here to treat us.

821
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,210
Why is he following me?

822
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:37,210
Who's following you?

823
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,300
I'm a regular here.

824
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,630
You're the odd one out.

825
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,300
Are you all ready?

826
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,550
Whoa.

827
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,250
I was born ready!

828
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,420
Then bring it on.

829
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,750
- Come on!
- Kaew, come.

830
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,550
Alright!

831
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,500
I've been itching for this!

832
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,670
Give it to him!

833
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,590
Alright, Sir!

834
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,460
Aod, what are they doing?

835
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,750
It's called the man's way.
It's all about dignity.

836
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,750
How does it work?

837
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,210
- It's all about dignity.
- Dignity?

838
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,920
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

839
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,710
Start!

840
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,840
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

841
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,630
Scissors! Scissors! Scissors!

842
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,340
Alright!

843
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,550
Rock, paper, scissors!

844
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,880
Scissors! Scissors! Scissors!

845
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,050
Yes!

846
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,670
You always win.

847
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,800
Bro, give us the big set.

848
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,460
- It's dignity.
- Dignifying indeed.

849
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,460
Let's toast to another round, pal.

850
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,500
- Another round?
- Smash it.

851
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,050
Alright, pal.

852
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,550
Hey, hey!

853
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,420
The two of us have to drive.

854
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,920
Come on.

855
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,000
Wow, you intend to drink
until you drop, don't you?

856
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,250
- Easy, easy.
- Saeb,

857
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,630
- have you tried this?
- I'll try, pal.

858
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,500
Then take a bite, pal.

859
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,880
What are you looking for?
Having dirty thoughts about me?

860
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,710
Saeb, buddy.

861
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,380
Keep an eye on her.

862
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,380
- Keep an eye?
- She might assault me again.

863
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,300
I can do that for you, pal.

864
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,460
Right!

865
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,210
Stay away from my friend.

866
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,630
He's a decent guy.

867
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,920
Don't seduce him, understand?

868
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,340
Oh no.

869
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,670
I told you.

870
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,170
He's really fixated on that.

871
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,920
Look at yourself.

872
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,840
I wouldn't take it,
even if you were free.

873
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,130
What did you say?

874
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,550
Come here!

875
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:46,840
Say that again.

876
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,420
I said

877
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,550
I wouldn't take it,
even if you were free.

878
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,460
You still want me.

879
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,050
Who says I do?

880
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:00,340
Even if you were stark naked
in front of me,

881
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,130
I'm not interested

882
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,170
Miss Paeng, but I do.

883
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,420
Aueng!

884
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,210
Right away, Aueng!

885
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,050
- Take a look!
- Bring it on!

886
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,340
Are you challenging me?

887
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,300
Here you go!

888
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:19,500
Enough! Enough!

889
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,300
No, you can't.

890
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,340
A six-pack is boring.

891
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,500
Take a look at a one-pack.

892
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,050
No!

893
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,090
Look at him. It's normal.
Don't worry.

894
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,000
Miss Paeng.

895
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,170
Can you do us a favor?

896
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,460
Can you drive us home?

897
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,210
Please? Please?
I really want to drink.

898
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,050
Please, Miss Paeng!

899
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,210
Okay, okay.

900
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,340
They won't last much longer.

901
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,800
Look at Saeb!

902
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,590
Let me dance too!

903
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,960
Move it! Shake it!

904
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,750
Shake! Shake! Shake!

905
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,420
Do a spin!

906
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,340
- Artit, you have to sleep inside.
- What?

907
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,750
I'm not going. I'll sleep here.

908
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,500
The mosquitoes will bite you
if you do.

909
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,460
I can't stand it.

910
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,630
Just one push, come on!

911
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,460
This way.

912
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,630
- Are we home yet?
- Not yet.

913
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,460
Hang in there.
Just a few more steps.

914
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,590
This way! This way!

915
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,000
It's that way. There!

916
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,380
No, this way.

917
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,670
That way!

918
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,300
Okay. That way then.

919
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:43,130
Whoo!

920
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:46,670
Here!

921
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,920
Okay. You sleep here then.

922
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,880
Let go!

923
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,130
My darling!

924
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:12,840
No, I'm not.

925
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,090
- Come here.
- I'm not.

926
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,630
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Come here.

927
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,840
- I'm not.
- Come here.

928
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,250
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Come here now. Don't be naughty.

929
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,300
Artit, you jerk!

930
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,420
Paeng, what are you doing to my son?

931
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,920
Who cued her in?

932
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,590
What perfect timing.

933
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,130
What?

934
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,670
I just remembered that I have
something to do.

935
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,460
Oh, my.

936
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,340
Here's the car key.

937
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,880
I'll leave it here.

938
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:17,840
Good night.

939
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,130
Paeng! You pervert!

940
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,090
I'm so dizzy!

941
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:44,170
Mom!

942
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,090
Why did you come home with Paeng?

943
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,920
I can't remember anything.

944
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:07,050
How could you get that drunk
with her?

945
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,250
I got carried away.

946
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,130
And why was she with you?

947
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:13,250
Did she force you to drink?

948
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,380
No one forced me.
It was my decision.

949
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:20,460
Artit, I told you many times
to stop drinking.

950
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,380
Why don't you listen to me?

951
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,710
Okay. From now on,
I'll stop drinking.

952
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,550
She harassed you again.

953
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,210
I didn't think she would dare
do anything.

954
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,380
You know how she is.

955
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,800
Why haven't you learned your lesson?

956
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,420
I have.

957
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,670
How could I let this happen?

958
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,920
Artit,

959
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,630
do you have feelings for her?

960
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,840
Me? Having feelings for her?

961
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,170
You know how much I hate her.

962
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,500
Artit,

963
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,340
just be honest to me.

964
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,960
I'm being honest with you.

965
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:03,380
I never lie to you.

966
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:05,710
I'll swear on it.

967
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,840
But why did you ask me that?

968
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:13,750
Last night, I saw...

969
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,420
I saw you pull her into for a kiss.

970
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:22,420
What?

971
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,630
- Really, Mom?
- Really.

972
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:25,090
Mom's eyes were probably
playing a trick on her.

973
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,800
Stop thinking now, Paeng!

974
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:09,630
Shoot!

975
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:12,880
Why did I do that?

976
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,500
Paeng,

977
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:24,420
I'm going to kill you!

978
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:36,250
Holy Spirits, please make it so
I don't have to see him again.

979
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,840
It will be so awkward.

980
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,380
Why are you getting in my way?

981
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,000
Who's actually in the way?

982
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:02,460
If I didn't grab you,
you would have fallen over.

983
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,500
I guess it was deliberate.

984
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,210
I can't let my guard down.
You're always trying to assault me.

985
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:09,590
Who assaulted who?

986
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,420
I'm going back to work.

987
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,250
I'm going back to work too.

988
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,750
Hey, stop!

989
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,340
Turn around.

990
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,460
And keep walking.

991
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,420
Wait.

992
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,250
What now?

993
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:45,250
From now on, work at the rose
garden. You don't have to work here.

994
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:47,750
Thank you!

995
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,050
I've been waiting for such order
for a while now.

996
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,340
But I will

997
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,420
install more security cameras
to keep an eye on you.

998
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:55,800
Psycho.

999
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:57,250
Jerk.

1000
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,840
Are you feeling warm?

1001
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,550
I'll turn the AC down.

1002
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:47,960
It's okay.

1003
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,250
I'm not warm physically.

1004
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:52,090
But mentally, I'm quite worried.

1005
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,380
What are you worried about?

1006
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,960
About Artit.

1007
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:01,920
I came here today
to talk to you about this.

1008
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:03,710
Uh...

1009
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,750
Ling,

1010
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,670
would you like to marry
Artit right now?

1011
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:11,210
Excuse me?

1012
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,920
Please marry him.
I'll find an auspicious date.

1013
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,710
Well,

1014
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,550
we're just friends.

1015
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,000
Come on.

1016
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:24,500
Don't lie to me. It's obvious.

1017
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:27,800
You run this restaurant together.

1018
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,550
How can you be just friends?

1019
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:33,800
Artit and I really are just friends.

1020
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,340
Why?

1021
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,380
You both are suitable
for each other.

1022
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,050
Or maybe...

1023
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,250
Maybe you're not ready?

1024
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:48,130
Why aren't you ready? Tell me.

1025
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:52,800
Oh! Maybe you're afraid of marriage.

1026
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,670
Dear,

1027
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,170
there's nothing scary about it.

1028
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,800
Please marry him.

1029
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,960
Believe me. Please?

1030
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,500
Auntie, I really can't.

1031
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,880
I'd like you to consider my son.

1032
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,630
He's a decent man.

1033
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,420
He's financially stable.

1034
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,000
He's hardworking.

1035
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:18,590
He's faithful. He doesn't smoke.

1036
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:21,420
He only drinks a little.

1037
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:24,800
He's this good.
If you don't take him,

1038
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,340
someone might take him instead.

1039
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:31,170
Well, I...

1040
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:34,210
No need to think anymore.
Just marry him already.

1041
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,550
No, she can't.

1042
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,630
If she's getting married,

1043
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,340
she has to marry me.

1044
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,710
Non, what are you talking about?

1045
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:59,250
You and I are only friends.

1046
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,300
I don't have feelings for you
like that.

1047
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:03,960
If there really is nothing,

1048
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,090
why did you keep that thing
I gave to you for so long?

1049
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,050
I'm really sorry.

1050
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,550
But she can't marry Artit.

1051
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,050
Ling!

1052
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,800
Ling and Non?

1053
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,800
Oh? What about my son?

1054
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,550
Ling, hold on. Listen to me.

1055
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:36,500
Why did you do that?

1056
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:38,170
Do what?

1057
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,590
What you said to Auntie.

1058
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,800
There's nothing going on between us.

1059
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,420
Then there should be.

1060
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,920
Non.

1061
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,340
I won't let you marry Artit

1062
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,920
or anyone else for that matter.

1063
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,250
I'm protective of you.

1064
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,960
Do you know what you're saying?

1065
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,300
I've known it myself
for a while already.

1066
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:10,590
It's you who doesn't know.

1067
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,670
What do you mean?

1068
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,000
You tried to make me believe

1069
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:19,710
that you and Artit are a couple.

1070
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,550
Why would you do that?

1071
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,960
You're trying to hide
your own feelings towards me.

1072
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,840
I wasn't hiding anything.

1073
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,550
Then why would you keep the thing
I gave you?

1074
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:46,750
It's still in good shape.

1075
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,630
Why should I throw it away?

1076
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:53,960
Don't side with yourself.

1077
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,250
It's okay if you're not
going to admit it.

1078
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:05,300
I'll prove it.

1079
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,800
I'll prove that you feel
the same way.

1080
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:44,090
Am I going to lose Artit to Paeng?

1081
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,170
Come in.

1082
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:52,460
Madam, Nang is here.

1083
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:54,800
Can you tell her to go home for now?
I'm in a bad mood.

1084
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,960
- Go on.
- Yes, Madam.

1085
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,000
Hold on.

1086
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:00,170
Nang's here?

1087
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,550
Yes, Madam.

1088
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,750
I made it for you.

1089
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,960
You've always been so lovely to me.

1090
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:19,170
Auntie,

1091
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,460
I've never thought of us
as simple acquaintances.

1092
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,170
You, Uncle, and Artit

1093
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,090
have always been like family to me.

1094
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:30,420
You're such a lovely girl.

1095
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:34,210
It would be so nice if you were
my daughter-in-law.

1096
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,590
Auntie, why are you saying that?

1097
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:41,210
I never thought that far before.

1098
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:43,920
Think about it sometime

1099
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,960
because he's still available.

1100
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:50,670
Oh? Artit is with Ling, isn't he?

1101
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:52,840
I thought so too at first.

1102
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,670
But in fact, they're not together.

1103
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:56,670
They're just friends.

1104
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,710
This morning,
Ling strongly denied it to me.

1105
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,000
Yes!

1106
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,960
Hm? What did you say?

1107
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:07,630
Oh, I said, that's a shame.

1108
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:11,460
Nang, you have to help me.

1109
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:13,750
Please?

1110
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,050
Paeng dared to go that far?

1111
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:18,800
I'm so anxious.

1112
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,670
I don't know who to turn to.

1113
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,840
Don't be anxious.

1114
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,670
I'm happy to help you.

1115
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,460
Because I can't stand having

1116
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:30,340
Paeng harrass my Artit!

1117
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,380
Oops.

1118
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:35,050
I psyched myself up

1119
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,800
so that I would understand
how you feel.

1120
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,630
That's good, honey.

1121
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,340
You have to help me
solve this problem

1122
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,130
before Artit falls prey to her.

1123
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,130
Don't worry.

1124
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:50,210
In this day and age, the protagonist
should fight the villain.

1125
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:53,420
I won't let a villain like her

1126
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,670
to steal my Artit.

1127
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,050
What are you going to do?

1128
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,550
I will have to teach her
a lesson first.

1129
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,170
Is it going to work?

1130
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:11,550
A clever person like me?
No need to worry.

1131
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:12,840
Okay, okay.

1132
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,420
Please trust me again.

1133
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,670
I've come back.

1134
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:22,670
Alright.

1135
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,960
What should I do to Paeng?

1136
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:28,460
It has to be harsh so that

1137
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:31,050
she'll leave the farm right away.

1138
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:34,340
I'm having fun just
thinking about it.

1139
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:40,750
Who's that?

1140
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,090
I ask who it is.

1141
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:44,670
Come out right now.

1142
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:52,250
- Ghost! Ghost!
- Ghost? Where is it?

1143
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,550
Ghost? Where is it?

1144
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,670
Nang.

1145
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:02,670
Kot!

1146
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,210
Ouch!

1147
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:06,170
Why did you kick me?

1148
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:07,340
Really!

1149
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,800
What mask are you wearing?

1150
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,090
You startled me.
I thought you were a ghost.

1151
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:14,710
Hold on. This is not just a mask.

1152
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:18,630
It's called the
multipurpose-super- awesome mask.

1153
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:20,050
If you'd like one,

1154
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:22,420
I have a promotion for you.
Buy one get two!

1155
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,590
Use it to cover your face up.

1156
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:26,960
I don't need to.
But I think you should.

1157
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:31,130
- Kot!
- What?

1158
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,840
- I'll give you three!
- I don't want any.

1159
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,000
- Three?
- No!

1160
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:36,210
Four?

1161
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,340
If I buy the mask,

1162
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:43,500
will you really give me four more?

1163
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:45,500
Really.

1164
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,130
What if I buy a dozen?

1165
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:48,500
Take another box.

1166
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:50,880
No! I don't want free stuff.

1167
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,960
I'd like something else.

1168
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,800
This doesn't sound good.

1169
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,420
Aueng,

1170
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,420
my face looks like
it's getting melasma.

1171
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:08,710
Really?

1172
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,800
Aueng, why did the lights go out?

1173
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,380
Right?

1174
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:29,840
Paeng,

1175
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,170
there usually aren't any
dogs around here.

1176
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,630
Where's that howling sound
coming from?

1177
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:48,960
All done. I shut off the power.

1178
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:52,090
Although,

1179
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,550
is it okay for you to do this?

1180
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,340
Of course.

1181
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:00,050
Or don't you want to make any sales?

1182
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,420
I do! But I don't feel comfortable
pulling a prank on Paeng.

1183
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,210
What prank?

1184
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:09,960
It's called helping her change
her mind and go home sooner.

1185
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:13,630
But there are many ways to do...

1186
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:16,090
Uh-uh. Don't say anything.

1187
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:17,880
You wait here

1188
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,210
and keep a lookout for me.

1189
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:22,300
What if...

1190
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,380
Nang!

1191
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,090
Nang!

1192
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:29,250
Nang!

1193
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:31,670
What should I do?

1194
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,050
It's getting closer.

1195
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:40,300
I'm scared.

1196
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,920
What are you scared about? Nonsense.

1197
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:29,750
Aueng! Aueng!

1198
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,090
Aueng! Aueng!

1199
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,630
Aueng!

1200
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,920
Aueng! Aueng! Help me!

1201
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:43,800
Aueng!

1202
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:47,300
Ouch!

1203
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,210
Paeng!

1204
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,090
Wait for me!

1205
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,500
Aueng!

1206
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,920
Holy spirits!

1207
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:16,130
It's me, Aueng!

1208
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:17,420
Miss Paeng!

1209
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,210
You ran so fast I couldn't catch up.

1210
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,210
Let's keep going

1211
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:24,840
until we can see a Buddhist image
or a Buddhist monastery.

1212
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,340
- Let's go now!
- Hold on, Aueng!

1213
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,460
I think it was apparent

1214
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:31,630
what we saw.

1215
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,840
I don't think it was a ghost.

1216
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,380
Somebody's probably pulling a prank.

1217
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,000
Let's go and have a look.

1218
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,630
Have a look?

1219
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,420
Oh, Miss Paeng!

1220
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,750
Your legs don't hurt anymore
from running away from the ghost?

1221
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:52,710
That's true.

1222
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,710
They don't hurt anymore.

1223
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,000
Hey!

1224
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,250
Everyone.

1225
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:05,210
What's going on? Why are you here?

1226
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:08,960
We heard screaming
so we came to check.

1227
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,380
The lights were out because
the power was shut off.

1228
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:13,880
But when the light was on, we saw...

1229
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:15,420
Saw what?

1230
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,170
I think you should see for yourself.

1231
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:28,840
What!?

1232
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,210
Who did this?

1233
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,170
Does anyone know who did this?

1234
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,550
No one saw anything.

1235
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:46,840
Your place was in a mess like this
when we arrived.

1236
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,960
It must be Mr. Artit.

1237
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:52,210
There's only one person

1238
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:54,460
who would dare pull
a prank on me like this.

1239
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,710
Paeng,

1240
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,380
I'll help you clean up the place.

1241
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:03,340
Thank you, Saeb. But it's okay.

1242
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:05,090
It's my place. I can do it myself.

1243
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,960
Paeng,

1244
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,130
we'll be up all night.
We won't get any sleep.

1245
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,500
Her place was trashed.

1246
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,960
Really?

1247
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:27,590
Mom.

1248
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,880
What's going on?

1249
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,460
Nothing.

1250
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:41,840
Saeb.

1251
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,710
Someone trashed Paeng's place?

1252
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:50,840
Why does it have to be her?

1253
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:52,300
Or maybe...

1254
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,880
Maybe what?

1255
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:57,960
Do you think I did it?

1256
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:59,460
I didn't say that.

1257
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,460
How come it's not safe on the farm?

1258
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,000
Who did it?

1259
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:06,630
- You.
- Right.

1260
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,090
Hey!

1261
01:21:08,590 --> 01:21:09,670
Saeb, you...

1262
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:57,670
It's not trashed.

1263
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,420
Or is Paeng gone?

1264
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:16,000
Do you want to die? Sleeping
in there with the engine on.

1265
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:20,090
The car might be new but you
shouldn't do that. Silly girl.

1266
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:40,590
Hello?

1267
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:43,380
Wake up and get to work.

1268
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:00,170
Aueng! Aueng! Wake up!

1269
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,340
What is it, Paeng?

1270
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:04,300
We've been photographed.

1271
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:12,500
I think we need to clear things up.

1272
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,590
Your pen was found
near Paeng's place.

1273
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,880
It's not mine.

1274
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:31,380
Busted.

1275
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:35,880
Why were you there?

1276
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:40,300
I went to make some sales.

1277
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:43,460
Kot, if you don't tell me the truth,

1278
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,340
I'll tell Non to kick you
out of the resort.

1279
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:51,960
I'll get kicked out
whether I tell or not.

1280
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:53,590
Why would you get kicked out?

1281
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,420
Uh...

1282
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:08,920
Come here!

1283
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:10,960
- Tell me! Tell me!
- Artit! Artit!

1284
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:13,420
I surrender!

1285
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,250
I surrender!

1286
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,670
Tell me now!

1287
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:19,380
Nang dressed as a ghost
to trick Paeng.

1288
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:22,300
That's right. The original deal
was to only trick her.

1289
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:25,130
I didn't know that she's going
to trash the place too.

1290
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,340
I tried to stop her

1291
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,710
but I couldn't.

1292
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:30,670
Why would Nang do that?

1293
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:32,460
How should I know?

1294
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:35,460
You conspired with her, jerk.

1295
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,460
Uncle, are you busy right now?

1296
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,090
What's the matter?

1297
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:50,920
I have something to tell you.

1298
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:57,590
I knew you'd betray me!

1299
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,550
Nang, stop! Listen to me!

1300
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:00,710
Nang!

1301
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:06,750
Why did you do something like that?

1302
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:10,000
Uh... Well...

1303
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,920
Paeng...

1304
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,630
You're siding with her!

1305
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,960
I'm not.

1306
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,050
You're like a sister to me.

1307
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:20,380
I don't want you to do
something bad like that.

1308
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:22,500
It wasn't my idea.

1309
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:27,920
Someone told me to do it.

1310
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:30,130
Who?

1311
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,050
I asked you who.

1312
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,500
It was your mom.

1313
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,130
Huh?

1314
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,210
That's right. I told her
to drive Paeng out.

1315
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:47,800
Mom,

1316
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:51,800
if Paeng died from extreme
shock, what would you do?

1317
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,500
She won't die that easily.

1318
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,840
Wait.

1319
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:58,550
Are you worried about her?

1320
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,420
I'm not. I'm worried about you.

1321
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:05,170
I don't want you to
do something like that.

1322
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:10,710
Okay, okay. I'll leave her alone.

1323
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,300
But you have to promise me

1324
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:14,630
that you won't mess around
with her like the other night.

1325
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:17,250
Tubtim,

1326
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:18,800
Artit.

1327
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:22,630
Who trashed Paeng's place?

1328
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:25,920
What if I did?
What are you going to do?

1329
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,880
If you did it, I'd know

1330
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:31,710
that you're a decent adult

1331
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,340
but likes to bully kids.

1332
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:34,840
Krongprateep!

1333
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:38,880
I've asked you and Artit

1334
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:42,670
that if you can't live together
harmoniously, then just stay away.

1335
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:47,000
Paeng never did anything to you.

1336
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:48,960
Why do you have to
cause her trouble?

1337
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:52,130
Really? She never
did anything to me?

1338
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,460
Did you forget what happened
six years ago?

1339
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:59,170
I'm a mother.
I can't forget about that.

1340
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,800
Our son nearly died because of her.

1341
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:05,630
Tubtim, she didn't
mean it at the time.

1342
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:06,880
She did.

1343
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,750
She meant to assault Artit too.

1344
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:12,250
She came back this time
to do it again.

1345
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,920
Tubtim.

1346
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:17,130
Krongprateep,

1347
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,550
he's my only son.

1348
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,420
I won't let her hurt my son again.

1349
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,380
You don't think of forgiving
her at all, do you?

1350
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:30,840
I'm not a saint like you,

1351
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:32,920
who can forgive people for anything.

1352
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,170
I'm telling you now.

1353
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,500
No matter how nice she is,

1354
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:41,250
I will never forget what she did.

1355
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,340
Don't blame her, Dad.

1356
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,250
It's not her fault.

1357
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,050
Everything that happened...

1358
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,090
I'm the mastermind behind all this.

1359
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:00,550
I'm very disappointed in you.

1360
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:03,000
I thought that you and Paeng

1361
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:05,050
could live together
harmoniously now.

1362
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:06,960
Never.

1363
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:10,500
If you hadn't brought
that woman back

1364
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,210
none of this would've happened.

1365
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:16,420
But you promised me that you'd
allow Paeng to live here.

1366
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,590
You remember that, don't you?

1367
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,880
I do.

1368
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,380
A man

1369
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,590
must be true to his words.

1370
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,380
Since you gave me your word,
you must do it.

1371
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:33,170
Go and apologize to Paeng.

1372
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,050
Don't, Artit.

1373
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,130
Tubtim,

1374
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,420
let him make his own decisions.

1375
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:44,380
He's matured enough to be reasonable
rather than rely on his feelings.

1376
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:00,460
If I feel anything towards you,

1377
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:01,840
my heart would tremble

1378
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,250
and beat rapidly, right?

1379
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:05,670
But I don't feel anything at all.

1380
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,550
You were so blindly obsessed
with me in the past.

1381
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:10,840
Back then I was so stupid.

1382
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,750
I was stupid like a donkey.

1383
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,170
Artit!

1384
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:16,550
Why are you picking me up?

1385
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:18,960
Are you crazy?
Are you planning to bite me?

1386
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:22,670
From now on, I will love
you like a friend.

1387
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:27,250
Paeng and I

1388
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:28,880
are going steady.

1389
01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:31,300
Are you jealous of me?

1390
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:32,960
Who'd be jealous to a jerk
of a friend like you?

1391
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:34,750
If you're not, then what's wrong?

1392
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,710
- Show her some respect.
- Why should I?

1393
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,920
Paeng's my girlfriend.
I have to protect her.

1394
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:40,170
How did you get together with Non?

1395
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:42,800
Answer me.
