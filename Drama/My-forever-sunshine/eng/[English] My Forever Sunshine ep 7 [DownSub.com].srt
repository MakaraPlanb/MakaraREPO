1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,050
(My Forever Sunshine)

2
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,590
They're doing that on purpose.

3
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:41,879
I haven't seen you in a long time.
You haven't changed.

4
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,500
If you knew what I lost,

5
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,710
you wouldn't have
said that stupid apology.

6
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,340
Keep your head down
and accept your fate.

7
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:48,669
You've done a lot to them.

8
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,419
Get your filthy hands off me!

9
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,129
Your place is right there.

10
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,550
I locked her up.

11
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:00,300
I'm thinking of
leaving her for a couple of days.

12
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,550
What if she actually dies?
What are you going to do?

13
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:04,879
There's not going to be a day

14
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:06,669
that you forgive me, is there?

15
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,090
If you were me, would you be able to

16
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,300
put up with being like this?

17
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,379
Both my dreams and my future
are ruined.

18
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,879
Everything I'd accomplished was
ruined because of you!

19
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,210
I almost became handicapped.

20
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,590
Almost handicapped?

21
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,500
You're not handicapped?

22
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:42,960
But I almost died because of you.

23
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,590
What are you afraid of?

24
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,419
I thought you said you were going
to make amends for what you did?

25
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,379
You've gone crazy.

26
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,669
That's right.

27
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,879
I will get even crazier
if you stay here.

28
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,250
What are you doing?

29
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,919
You came in yourself.

30
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,340
You locked the door yourself.

31
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,340
Stay and talk then.

32
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,959
I'm here to officially welcome you,

33
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,379
Wanfahmai.

34
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:38,129
This is your last chance. Go.

35
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:40,800
Artit, you've gone too far.

36
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,209
How have I gone too far?

37
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,550
What happened to you,

38
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:45,800
I didn't mean it.

39
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,750
But everything you did to me

40
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,209
was deliberate.

41
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,170
It's very different.

42
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,920
I'm already this harsh

43
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,500
but you're still stubborn.

44
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,920
How harsh should I be

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,339
so you'll leave?

46
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,129
Where's your car key?

47
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,050
Instead of bringing a phone.

48
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,339
Jeez!

49
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:15,379
Paeng!

50
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:18,589
I asked you where your car key is.

51
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,209
Uhh...

52
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,300
In the storage room.

53
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,589
Darn it!

54
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,920
Should I just choke you to death?

55
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:33,800
What's going on?

56
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,379
So? Who's going to start?

57
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,000
Hello.

58
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,839
Saeb, you then.

59
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,300
Tell me what's happened
when I wasn't here.

60
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,050
Why me, sir?

61
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,800
Can I leave?

62
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,839
But we've made an agreement.

63
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,209
You heard him, Artit?

64
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,629
If you can change Uncle's mind,
I'll leave immediately.

65
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,709
What's really going on here?

66
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,459
Artit,

67
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,050
did you try to chase her out?

68
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,959
Artit had someone train me.

69
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,129
Harvesting grapes. weeding,

70
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:45,920
making wood vinegar,
burning charcoal,

71
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,500
cleaning the cattle pen.

72
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,500
I think it was too tough.

73
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,709
So I don't want to stay.

74
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,420
Artit, didn't I tell you

75
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,670
to just let her do her work?

76
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:00,959
Now, what did you make her do?

77
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,500
Even though you had to
harvest grapes or weed,

78
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,750
it's not in your nature to give up.

79
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,550
So what really happened?

80
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,050
I don't want her to stay.

81
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,879
If my return is causing problems,

82
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,250
please let me go.

83
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,879
So everyone here will be happy.

84
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:22,839
Now you're just trying to be nice.

85
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,209
You're just playing the victim.

86
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,420
If you go,

87
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,500
I won't be happy.

88
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:34,800
So you have to stay.

89
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,879
Okay.

90
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:43,670
Then I'll go.

91
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,129
Artit.

92
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,589
- Where are you going?
- Don't.

93
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,339
I'll handle him.

94
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,209
Dad!

95
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,379
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,300
Artit,

97
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,129
I'm begging you

98
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,920
to give Paeng a chance.

99
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,750
Give her a chance?

100
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,459
Maybe next time,

101
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,379
I'll end up handicapped or die?

102
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,550
But if you can overcome
your pride a little,

103
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,299
you'll see that she's not
the same person anymore.

104
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,879
You're probably blind.
That's why you can't see.

105
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:41,460
Then prove to me

106
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,879
that she hasn't changed.

107
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,500
But I think she has changed.

108
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,049
Let time prove it.

109
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,710
Prove who's correct.

110
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:53,549
Why should I do that?

111
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,549
Don't try to convince me.

112
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,590
If you go,

113
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,919
then I have to take care of
the farm like before.

114
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,549
I'm already old.

115
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,049
Aren't you worried about me?

116
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,629
You can let your
darling niece take care of things.

117
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,960
If you think so, then go.

118
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,710
But I don't know

119
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,049
what you've done either.

120
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,960
Because I let you be
for so many years.

121
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,340
Anyway,

122
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,879
I'll try to take care of the farm.

123
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,299
Are you choosing her?

124
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,049
Why don't you choose me?

125
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,169
I told you

126
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:51,669
that you're prejudiced.

127
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,799
You're full of pride.

128
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,629
Alright. Maybe if I let
you go for a few days,

129
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:01,299
you'll calm down a bit.

130
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,710
You'll realize it and come back.

131
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,460
I know you won't leave
what you've built here,

132
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:09,460
right?

133
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,379
But it's better

134
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:20,460
if you don't go.

135
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,250
Think of it as

136
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,000
you giving me a chance.

137
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:29,629
I asking you.

138
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,169
Okay, Dad.

139
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:41,840
But she and I will
go our separate ways.

140
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:43,750
Don't let her approach me.

141
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,299
Tubtim.

142
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,960
- Thongkhum.
- Yes?

143
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,250
There's really
one downside to Artit.

144
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,840
Do you know what it is?

145
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,460
What, Madam?

146
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,129
Ever since he was young,
he has never defied his parents.

147
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:31,460
I probably raised him too well.

148
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,590
But from now on, I have to teach him

149
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:38,500
that he doesn't have to listen
to everything his parents say.

150
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,049
Paeng, I'm sorry for lying to you.

151
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,250
It's okay, Saeb. I understand.

152
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,340
But don't ever let
that happen again?

153
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,840
I'm only joking.

154
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,250
My heart felt heavy
for a moment there.

155
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,799
Paeng,

156
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,419
please wait here for a bit.

157
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,049
I'll go and get some stuff.

158
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,799
Then I'll give you a lift home.

159
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:20,799
I'm already this harsh

160
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,299
but you're still stubborn.

161
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:23,799
How harsh should I be

162
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,169
so you'll leave?

163
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,549
Such an everlasting grudge, Artit.

164
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,840
Were you Chucky in your past life?

165
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,299
That number plate.

166
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,460
This is it. It's the same vehicle.

167
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,710
- Saeb.
- Yes, Paeng?

168
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,379
Whose truck is this?

169
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,250
It's Artit's.

170
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,460
Why are you asking?

171
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,879
Artit's car.

172
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,299
They're doing that on purpose.

173
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:19,840
What on earth is going on?

174
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,879
Apart from Artit,

175
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,419
who drives it?

176
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,090
No one.

177
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,419
This is Artit's most
beloved possession.

178
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,000
He's the only one who can drive it.

179
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,669
But why is it parked here
when it's his?

180
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:48,460
I saw him drove it out
three days ago.

181
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,250
The day you came.

182
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:53,129
He was driving so fast,
there was dust all over.

183
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,669
I just washed it for him.
It's all shiny now.

184
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:58,629
Then he told me to park it here.

185
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,419
Most importantly, he said to
keep everyone away from it.

186
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:07,750
You're so evil, Artit.

187
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,669
What did you say?

188
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,919
Oh, nothing.

189
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,799
Uncle?

190
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,750
Did you just get to shower?

191
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:34,250
Yes.

192
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,379
Are you really going to live here?

193
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,590
I think you should
go back to my house

194
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:43,210
and stay in your old room.

195
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,129
In the same house as Artit?

196
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:49,590
I don't think so. I don't want
to cut my life short.

197
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,250
Are you still angry with him?

198
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:55,049
I have no right to
be angry with him.

199
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,090
I have to apologize
on behalf of him and Auntie.

200
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,549
I shouldn't have
gone to see the client.

201
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,590
If I'd know I...

202
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:08,750
Uncle,

203
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,049
if you can see the future,

204
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,629
you have to open up
an astrological shop

205
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,419
or a live telephone hotline.

206
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,169
Cheeky.

207
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,419
I'd like everyone to get to know you
and see you as I do.

208
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,799
It's okay.

209
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,340
No one needs to see me.

210
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,629
Only you seeing me is fine already.

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,090
Hey!

212
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,129
Are you going to crack
the chopping board?

213
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:52,299
Why are you taking it out
on the pork?

214
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,250
I'm so annoyed.

215
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,629
Master sided with her again.

216
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,669
It's always been like this.

217
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,629
That's why Mr. Artit
was in an accident.

218
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,340
I don't understand why
he hasn't learned his lesson.

219
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,210
You're this angry.

220
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,210
Do you know how angry Madam must be?

221
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,710
Whatever. I'm on Madam
and Mr. Artit's side.

222
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,169
We have to find a way
to kick that rotten Paeng out.

223
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,340
Just you wait!

224
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,500
Hey!

225
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:23,460
All minced up!

226
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,960
Mom,

227
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,799
what are you doing?

228
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:30,250
Tonight Dad has to sleep outside

229
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,840
for siding with her.

230
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,000
Mom, calm down.

231
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,340
Don't do this.

232
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:39,669
I know you're angry.

233
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:41,340
I'm angry too.

234
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,629
But we shouldn't fight
amongst each other.

235
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,000
What do you want me to do?
I'm so angry!

236
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,960
Be patient, Mom.

237
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:50,840
I'll deal with Paeng myself.

238
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,549
But you must stop fighting with Dad.

239
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,669
We can't let Paeng
have the satisfaction

240
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,250
that she has successfully
created a rift between us.

241
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,000
Alright.

242
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,669
I'll try.

243
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:08,250
How much longer do I
have to keep seeing her face?

244
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,000
Dad told me to prove it to him.

245
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,880
I'll do it.

246
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,799
I'll make him see
who his darling niece really is.

247
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,880
Paeng, what do you
think if this land?

248
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,130
It's quite nice.

249
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,170
What are you planning to do?

250
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,210
I'm going to give it to you.

251
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,049
Come again?

252
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:48,750
I'd like to you plant a rose garden,
just like you wanted to.

253
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,170
So you can finally
follow your dreams

254
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,380
without having to
be involved with Artit.

255
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,670
Do you trust me?

256
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,049
What if I failed?

257
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,839
I thought you said you wanted me
to learn the ropes a lot first.

258
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,299
You can learn by doing.

259
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,339
I'll be your consultant.

260
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,420
It's better for trial and error that
you do it here, am I right?

261
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,549
And if you're successful
with the project,

262
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,880
I'll give you this
whole plot of land.

263
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:19,250
You can't do that, Uncle.

264
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,089
If you do that,

265
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,630
Artit will kill me.

266
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:27,339
- Paeng...
- Uncle,

267
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,549
don't talk about the debt.

268
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,799
It ended a long time ago.

269
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:36,000
Actually, I owe you right now.

270
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,460
If you didn't look after me,

271
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,339
who knows where I'd be.

272
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,380
I've survived this long

273
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,130
because of you.

274
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,380
So you don't want it?

275
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,460
No, it's okay.

276
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,170
Then you work for me.

277
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,549
I don't think there's
a problem with that.

278
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,049
Think of

279
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,960
what you want to do with the land.

280
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,960
How many farmhands you'll need,
and what's your budget.

281
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,750
From now on,

282
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,799
consider yourself my employee.

283
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,460
You work for me, is that okay?

284
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:22,339
Okay, then.

285
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,250
That's my girl.

286
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:28,880
Careful, careful.

287
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,589
Oh.

288
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,210
Pong! Saeb!

289
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,670
- Yes, sir?
- Yes?

290
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,299
Come on.

291
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,460
Quickly now.

292
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:43,839
From now on, Paeng's working for me.

293
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:45,549
Tell everyone

294
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,049
to help her with work.

295
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,920
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

296
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,710
You can go now.

297
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,210
Let's go.

298
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,000
Very good.

299
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,170
Miss Paeng!

300
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:08,549
I bring you over some assistants.

301
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,299
Thank you.

302
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,380
We've met but I don't
know your names yet.

303
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,049
I'm Kaew.

304
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,299
I'm Aod.

305
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,299
Miss Paeng,

306
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,420
please don't be angry about today.

307
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:24,380
I understand.

308
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,549
If I did anything wrong,

309
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,170
please don't be angry with me.

310
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,710
It was Artit's order,
so I had to follow it.

311
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,250
But you haven't done anything wrong.

312
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,500
By the way, what do you
want me to help?

313
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:39,670
That's right.

314
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,380
I'd like you to collect
some dirt samples

315
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,089
to be checked for minerals
and the pH value,

316
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,250
to see whether
it's suitable to grow roses.

317
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,549
Here.

318
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,460
- Go on.
- Okay.

319
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,670
- Dig it up.
- Help her.

320
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,049
Here you go.

321
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,170
- One for each of us.
- Here.

322
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,250
Saeb, please drop this in the mail.

323
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:38,130
Right away.

324
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,299
Let's go.

325
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,839
Oh? Whoa.

326
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,960
It's already 11:00 p.m.?

327
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,750
When did I fell asleep?

328
00:22:58,089 --> 00:22:59,170
My stomach's grumbling.

329
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:00,670
So hungry.

330
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,630
Good thing I bought
something to eat.

331
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,339
What?

332
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,630
Where's all the food?

333
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,130
If I did anything wrong,

334
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:24,750
please don't be angry with me.

335
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,170
It was Artit's order,
so I had to follow it.

336
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,670
You stole it?

337
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,710
I'll reclaim it then.

338
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,839
Hungry are you?

339
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,589
Just die of hunger right there.

340
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,299
Oh, Mom.

341
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,670
I knew you're still working.

342
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,750
It's late. Have a shower and rest.

343
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,299
Okay.

344
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:47,130
It's all gone.

345
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:21,960
Where is it hidden?

346
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,670
I feel like a burglar.

347
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:33,170
I'm hungry!

348
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:35,589
Gosh! I can't take it anymore!

349
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,960
I'm sorry. I really don't
want to do this!

350
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:42,460
But I really can't

351
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,299
handle this hunger!

352
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:48,500
Excuse me, Uncle and Auntie.

353
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,210
I've survived!

354
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,589
Oh, shoot!

355
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:02,670
Oh!

356
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,839
Now can you tell me
why you came in here?

357
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,710
I asked you a question.
Are you deaf?

358
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,710
I was only looking
for something to eat.

359
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,130
If you're going to lie,
try harder then.

360
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,960
You're always concocting something.

361
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,210
Do you think that you can forget
all the evil deeds you've done

362
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:35,630
and other people
will forget them too?

363
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,589
I really want to know

364
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,500
what your face is made of.

365
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:42,299
That's why you dare
to set foot in here again.

366
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:47,420
I'm not lying.

367
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,339
I'm just hungry. So I'm looking
for something to eat.

368
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:53,960
Because someone's
being a snake in the grass.

369
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,299
They threw out all my food.

370
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:00,130
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have set foot here.

371
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,500
You!

372
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:08,920
Whoa.

373
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,960
His arms are really buff.

374
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:13,549
I'll definitely die if he chokes me.

375
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:16,880
Sicko!

376
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,549
You're staring at me, aren't you?

377
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,750
I didn't mean it.

378
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:23,130
Do you

379
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,000
still dare to have feelings for me?

380
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,130
Artit, don't flatter yourself.

381
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,799
A shirtless guy won't make
me feel anything.

382
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,210
I've seen a lot already.

383
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,799
That's right.

384
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,130
For a greedy woman like you,

385
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,299
I don't think it's that surprising.

386
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,380
Artit, if I'm such an eyesore,
I'll be gone now.

387
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,589
Wench.

388
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,799
Artit, I'm only looking
for something to eat.

389
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,960
Do you really have
to call me a wench?

390
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,880
I think it's a little too harsh.

391
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,130
I wasn't referring to this.

392
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:22,460
I'm talking about six years ago.

393
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,839
Hey,

394
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,380
what I've been doing to you isn't
even harsh enough.

395
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,880
You're lucky that I haven't
murdered you yet.

396
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,299
Isn't your dad's inheritance

397
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,710
enough for you to start a new life?

398
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:40,299
Or did you spend it all up?

399
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,960
Or do you want something
else from here

400
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,460
that isn't money?

401
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,549
And what is that?

402
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,839
Even if I don't say it,
you probably already know.

403
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:58,630
I won't make my mouth filthy
by saying it.

404
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,460
If you don't want to, then don't.

405
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,210
If there's nothing else,

406
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,710
I'm going now.

407
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:29,670
Whoa!

408
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,589
Saeb! Why did you creep up on me?
You startled me.

409
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,089
Miss Paeng,

410
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,960
you had your earphones on.

411
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:40,960
I was calling but you
didn't hear me. So I had to do this.

412
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,250
What's the matter?

413
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,880
Master told me to bring you

414
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,130
to go eat at the house.

415
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,960
It's okay. I'll eat here.

416
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,130
If I go,

417
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,920
your boss Artit

418
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,130
will have my head instead of food.

419
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,339
Miss Paeng!

420
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,210
My boss isn't a zombie.

421
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,920
Please go.

422
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,049
If you don't, I'll be
reprimanded for sure.

423
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,170
Please, Miss Paeng?

424
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,670
Please? Please, go?

425
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,670
You don't have to
eat that. I'll help you.

426
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,960
- Come on.
- Okay.

427
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,839
Oh, Paeng. Come here.

428
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,880
Come.

429
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,250
You invited her?

430
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,500
Tubtim,

431
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,549
she's only here to eat.

432
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,299
For you, that's all it is.
But for me,

433
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,000
honestly,
I have no appetite anymore.

434
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,670
I think I'll go back
and eat at home.

435
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,210
- Good.
- Don't go.

436
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,799
Paeng,

437
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,500
come here. Sit down.

438
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,549
Come on. Have a seat.

439
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,250
Quickly.

440
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:04,380
Very good.

441
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,960
From now on,

442
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,630
you have to come
and eat with me every day.

443
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,250
Huh? Teep!

444
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:13,130
If she comes,

445
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:14,460
I won't eat.

446
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:17,380
You can eat with your darling niece,
just the two of you.

447
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,210
Mom,

448
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,630
please don't do that.

449
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,710
This is our house,
why do we have to leave?

450
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:30,839
The person who should go
is the outsider.

451
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,549
Artit, talk nicely to her.
I'm asking you.

452
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,960
I've also asked you

453
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,049
to not let this woman
come close to me.

454
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,960
Last night, your darling niece

455
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,670
sneaked into our house.

456
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,880
Huh?

457
00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:50,250
What were you planning to
do to my son?

458
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,880
You've only just arrived.

459
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,130
Your true colors are
already showing?

460
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:54,920
It's not like that, Auntie.

461
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,130
Why did you have to
come in late at night?

462
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,630
Don't ask for the truth from a liar.

463
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,630
It's easier to just kick her out.

464
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,799
Artit.

465
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,880
Last night, I came here

466
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,750
because I was hungry.

467
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:12,630
So I was looking
for something to eat.

468
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,170
Don't try to put on an act.
I know it.

469
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,339
It's been six years

470
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,589
and your tongue has gotten
sharper than a woman's.

471
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,880
Or maybe you are...

472
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,500
What am I?

473
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,250
Uncle,

474
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,339
I really came here
to find something to eat.

475
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,839
Maybe I was wrong

476
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,630
for coming in unannounced.

477
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,420
But there's nothing more to do.

478
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,420
You're the best at making excuses.

479
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,839
Your second-best is

480
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:49,380
minimizing your own fault.

481
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,710
Artit, that's enough.

482
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm sorry, Dad.

483
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,710
I'm not going to eat today.

484
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,799
I don't have an appetite.

485
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:05,630
I don't have one either.

486
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:06,880
Oh?

487
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,630
See, Uncle?

488
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,500
It's because of me.
I'm such a killjoy.

489
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,920
Don't mind them.

490
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,420
They're just not used to it.

491
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,960
You have to eat with me every day
so that they'll get used to it.

492
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,130
Alright, let's eat.

493
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,300
Eat up. It's only me now.
Eat with me.

494
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,170
Pong!

495
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,880
Pong!

496
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,500
Where is he?

497
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,750
Pong!

498
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,710
Mr. Artit.

499
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,130
How was breakfast?

500
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,420
What's up with you?

501
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,340
Miss Paeng went to
eat breakfast with you.

502
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,800
So I figured that

503
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,670
breakfast must've been
even more delicious.

504
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,170
It was.

505
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,960
It was delicious to the point
that I want to kick you.

506
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,250
Calm down, sir.

507
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,880
It's still early.

508
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,550
Don't be angry yet.

509
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,920
Where's Pong?

510
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,300
Oh? You don't know?

511
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,130
Know what?

512
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,670
Your lips are quivering.

513
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,090
Tell me what you know.

514
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,550
Here I'll put some rose beds.

515
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,460
Over there

516
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,960
I'll have a nursery for seedlings.

517
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,300
There, it's going to be an office

518
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,050
and a research lab
for rose products.

519
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,050
Wow.

520
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,670
You came up with all of this
in a day?

521
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,880
I already had these ideas.

522
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,590
I just made a sketch of them.

523
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,550
By the way,
do you know any contractors?

524
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,050
So I can start with my rose garden.

525
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,550
What's the hurry?

526
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,000
You can rest a little bit.

527
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,460
No rest for the wicked.
I'd like to get going with it.

528
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,340
So you can leave?

529
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,880
I have to go over there now.

530
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,750
Artit might see me
and I'll be in trouble.

531
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,460
Get on with it.

532
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,460
Are you in a hurry to leave

533
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,050
because of Artit?

534
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,050
Partially.

535
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,340
But I don't want to
bother you any more.

536
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,750
You keep saying that.

537
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,630
It's like I'm a stranger to you.

538
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,460
I'm feeling sad now.

539
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,130
Uncle, please don't be upset.

540
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,590
If you are, I'll be dead for sure.

541
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,130
I only have you left.

542
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,500
Okay.

543
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,550
I'll look it over again tonight.

544
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,500
But at a glance,

545
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,800
it looks really great.
You're talented.

546
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,340
Thank you!

547
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,960
Paeng,

548
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,300
I'm very happy

549
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,840
that you came back here.

550
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,050
No matter what anyone says,

551
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,300
please think of this place

552
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,750
as your home.

553
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,130
I'll try.

554
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,420
I have something to give you.

555
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,210
You're giving this to me?

556
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,500
Yes.

557
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,170
It's for you to ride
around on the farm.

558
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,590
So you won't be tired from walking.

559
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,960
Do you know how to ride it?

560
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,960
I don't think it's too difficult.

561
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,500
Thank you.

562
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,250
So lovely.

563
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,050
Ma'am,

564
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,210
how long does it take before
the grapes can be harvested?

565
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,590
She seems promiscuous
judging from her face

566
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,050
- Are you talking about me?
- No.

567
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,420
Then why are you looking at me?

568
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,500
You're overthinking it.
I wasn't looking at you.

569
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,170
I was looking at the grapes.

570
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,460
Then stop looking
and get back to work.

571
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,420
Or do you want me to tell my uncle

572
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,340
that his workers are gossiping
and slacking off at work?

573
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,920
It's you who has to leave.

574
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,670
I haven't even done anything.

575
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,130
Those two were gossiping about me.

576
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,590
No one would believe

577
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,550
a girl who cried wolf like you.

578
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,340
And I'm not stupid.

579
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,500
Most importantly,

580
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,840
even if they were gossiping,

581
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,130
it wouldn't have been that
far from the truth.

582
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,590
Okay, then.

583
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,420
You can insult, slander, or gossip
about me as much as you like.

584
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,880
I don't care

585
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,800
because I'm not like what you said.

586
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,750
- Keep working.
- Yes.

587
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,250
How much do you want?

588
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,090
I asked how much you want

589
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,090
so that you will leave this place.

590
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,920
I have money.

591
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,250
You're very rich, aren't you?

592
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,710
You probably want to disappear
from here mysteriously.

593
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,590
I'm telling you

594
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,300
that I can make that happen.

595
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,800
If you can't contact me
for more than three days,

596
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,000
go and look for my corpse

597
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,420
here.

598
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
My corpse should be buried there

599
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,170
because it's the back of the farm.

600
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,550
What?

601
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,000
Scared?

602
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,420
If you stay,

603
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,880
I'll scare you even more.

604
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,090
Keep your guard up.

605
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,960
Should I cut off your arms,

606
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,210
your legs,

607
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,300
skin you,

608
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,920
or cut off your head first?

609
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,250
Go!

610
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,090
Oh, Dad?

611
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,630
Can you take a look a these plans

612
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,960
and see if they're okay?

613
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,670
Here.

614
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,130
From that woman?

615
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,630
A nursery for roses.

616
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,250
She drew it up herself.

617
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,710
If you're looking for something
for her to do to kill time,

618
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,050
or to keep her here,

619
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,670
you should keep it small.

620
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,420
This is too big.

621
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,090
It will cost a fortune.

622
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,210
I'd like her

623
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,590
to use this time to learn

624
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,750
and get the most out of it.

625
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,550
But it takes time
for a plan this big.

626
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,300
Or are you thinking about that?

627
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,920
About arranging
your marriage together?

628
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,920
I've stopped thinking
about that for a while already.

629
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,750
Do you think

630
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,670
I love my niece
more than my own son?

631
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,710
Since you're really against it, to
the point you risked your own life,

632
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,340
I'm not going to force you.

633
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,250
It's not your responsibility either,

634
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,500
to have to repay for someone's
gratitude in my place.

635
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,500
Thank you, Dad.

636
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,000
But I have to let Paeng stay here

637
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,250
no matter what.

638
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,130
Until there's someone who can
look after her better than me.

639
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,840
Tharathep

640
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,710
asked me two things.

641
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,920
I already broke one promise,
that is the one about you.

642
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,090
Don't make me break another.

643
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,840
Please help me look at it.

644
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,920
So I can talk to her
about the contractors tomorrow.

645
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,840
I don't want to be a part of this.

646
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,000
You don't trust me?

647
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,380
I trust you.

648
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,300
But I don't trust her.

649
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,840
About what?

650
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,210
That she wants to be my wife.

651
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,630
Dad, It's not funny.

652
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,170
I really mean it.

653
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,210
Artit,

654
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,670
humans must learn to adapt.

655
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,130
If Paeng

656
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,550
is willing to adapt, change herself,

657
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,380
and become a different person,

658
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,750
all of us should forgive her.

659
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,500
Forgiveness

660
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,550
is a great merit.

661
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,800
Don't you agree, Artit?

662
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,670
If you're afraid

663
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,800
of Paeng clinging to you again,

664
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,300
you should look for someone

665
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,130
and get married, no?

666
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,000
Who?

667
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,170
You saw it. I spend
my days with the trees.

668
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,630
Ling.

669
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,460
She's still single, isn't she?

670
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,750
Ling

671
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,380
is my friend.

672
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,800
We really are friends.

673
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,550
Ling is here.

674
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

675
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,550
Did everything go okay
when I wasn't here?

676
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

677
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,380
Did Korakot help with
looking after the shop?

678
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,840
We haven't seen him at all.

679
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,710
Thank you so much.

680
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,800
You can get back to work now.
No need to take care of me.

681
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,050
Okay.

682
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,500
Hello?

683
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,130
What's the matter, Ling?

684
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,500
I've really missed you!

685
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,630
How are you? I haven't seen you
since you got back from England.

686
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,550
Hold on. Hold on.

687
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,550
My ears are going to explode.
Tone it down.

688
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,130
The thing is, I wasn't there
to supervise the shop

689
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,130
because I'm working with Mahan
on a big business deal.

690
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,670
If I can successfully import
the goods from China this time,

691
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,050
you can start calling me Boss Kot.

692
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,090
Okay, okay.

693
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,670
Alright. I'll see you at the shop.

694
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,000
Later.

695
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,670
You're still the same, Ling.

696
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,340
If you could've come out
of the phone,

697
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,920
you would've done it.

698
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,250
What a complainer.

699
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,250
Kot!

700
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,590
Oh!

701
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,130
Nang, honey!

702
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,380
Don't you honey me.

703
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,550
Oh?

704
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,840
- Pay up.
- Do I need to pay up?

705
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,210
This is a resort, not a charity

706
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,090
where you to eat and drink for free.

707
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,880
Look at what you've been eating.

708
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,550
Those are all expensive.

709
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,000
Don't think because you're Non's
friend that you don't have to pay.

710
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,000
I won't let you do this anymore.

711
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,840
You want me to pay up?

712
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,500
Stop right there!

713
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,210
Don't tell me that you
forgot your wallet.

714
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,500
I know what you're playing at.

715
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,460
Nang, you're so lovely.
You know me well.

716
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,550
Let's do this. I've got something
to show you. I present to you the

717
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,800
stress-relief bra.

718
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,170
No, it's a stress-relieving bra.

719
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,340
It makes you feel refreshed like
you're standing on top of the Alps.

720
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,750
Kot! That's pervy!

721
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,590
What's pervy? It's really good.

722
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,840
I have a promotion for you.

723
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,750
Buy three get three
for only 499 baht.

724
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,130
I'm not buying it!

725
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,630
I don't want it!

726
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,840
Pay up!

727
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,960
Alright. I need to go to
the ATM first.

728
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,300
I'm going. I'm going.

729
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,550
- I'm going! I'm going!
- Kot!

730
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,880
Don't run away!

731
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,710
Oh, shoot.

732
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,000
Kot!

733
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,960
I'm not staying here anymore!

734
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,880
Oh, you're done with work?

735
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,460
Well, Mr. Artit said
we can't help you anymore.

736
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,250
If he sees us, he will fire us.

737
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,920
What about Kaew?

738
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,920
Him too. He left already.

739
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,460
I have to go now.

740
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,300
If he sees us, he will fire us.

741
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,710
If you stay,
I'll scare you even more.

742
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,300
Oh, oh! Mister!

743
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,670
- Are you okay?
- Leave me alone!

744
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,210
Is that how you drive?
Don't you use your brakes?

745
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,550
If my face gets ruined,
who's going to take responsibility?

746
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,550
You're such a bad driver.

747
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,840
- Hey?
- Kot!

748
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,340
Paeng!

749
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,670
Since got to the farm, I never
walked over to this area.

750
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,300
I just found out it exists.

751
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,130
This zone is for shops
and outdoor activities.

752
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,130
As for this shop, Ling and Artit
started it together.

753
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,880
Ling's here as well?

754
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,750
For almost a year now.
She came back from England.

755
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,590
If she sees you,
she'll be very happy.

756
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,380
This way. Please come back again.

757
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,670
Please come back again.

758
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,210
Ling, hello.

759
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,420
Ling,

760
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,880
I'd like to apologize for what
happened in the past.

761
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,590
Are you happy to see me?

762
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,170
I'm very happy!

763
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,550
Have a seat.

764
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,840
I'm really happy to know
that you're here.

765
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,170
Now I have a friend.

766
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,960
You've faced
Artit's wrath, haven't you?

767
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,000
Well, what do you think?

768
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:16,880
His wrath was so cruel
I almost couldn't handle it.

769
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,750
But it's understandable.

770
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,750
What I did is unforgivable.

771
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,000
But it's been a while already.

772
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,210
Artit should forget about it.

773
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:37,050
Ling, but you know what he's like.

774
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:40,090
It's hard to make him angry,

775
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,210
but once he's angry,
he never gets over it.

776
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,960
He's the type to
hold grudges for ages.

777
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,590
Don't say that.
She might feel disheartened.

778
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,920
Just kidding.

779
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,670
Let's change the subject.

780
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,710
Have you walked around here yet?

781
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,300
Not yet.

782
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,750
The huge expansion

783
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:03,500
is all Artit's work.

784
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,050
Really? I thought it was Uncle's.

785
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,170
Not at all.

786
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,960
When he had to defer his studies,

787
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,550
he nearly went crazy.

788
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,300
So he used all his time
to develop the farm

789
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,000
because he wanted to forget...

790
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:19,250
Oops.

791
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,090
I'm sorry for having a big mouth.

792
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,050
Don't listen to Kot.

793
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,250
It's okay.

794
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,500
I know Artit hates me.

795
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,210
He probably won't ever
forgive me in this lifetime.

796
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,840
But I'll try.

797
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,670
I'll try to make him see

798
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,250
that I really want
to atone for my sins.

799
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,380
Why are you applauding?

800
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,960
That was really touching.

801
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,050
If you want me or Kot to help,

802
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,460
you can tell us. No need to worry.

803
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,550
Or if you need anything else,

804
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,420
like a rice cooker, a sauna cabinet,

805
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,460
a frying pan, a fishing sieve,

806
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,590
tom-yum noodles, sweet palm...

807
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:12,960
Enough, already?

808
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,800
You can tell me. I sell everything.

809
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:21,920
By the way, do you know
where Artit is right now?

810
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,710
Around this time,

811
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,500
he's probably at the wooden shack
in the back of the farm.

812
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,250
Or you can call it
Artit's safe house.

813
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,630
It's probably this shack.

814
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,090
When was it built?

815
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,500
Saeb!

816
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,630
Saeb!

817
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,000
Yes, sir. I'm here.

818
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,250
Restrain the dog.

819
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,460
Dog?

820
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,960
Where's the dog?

821
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,500
It's you.

822
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,340
Why are you here?

823
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,300
To seduce me?

824
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,340
- No.
- Liar.

825
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,960
You're definitely here to do so.

826
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,590
Why do you have such a
one-track mind?

827
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,250
Wanfahmai!

828
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,710
That's right. Wanfahamai

829
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,750
doesn't want you to be
husband anymore.

830
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,590
Please reprogram your brain.

831
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,130
Remember your own words.

832
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,340
Okay. I'll remember it well.

833
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,050
I'll etch it onto
every cell in my brain.

834
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:47,090
Don't worry that I'll forget.

835
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,960
I came to see you
because I have a question.

836
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,750
Why won't you allow
Aod and Kaew to help me?

837
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:59,500
Do you have to ask me that?

838
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,420
It's because I hate you.

839
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,250
I already showed you mercy

840
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,170
by allowing you to be on my farm.

841
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,050
So you shouldn't be using my people.

842
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,460
Kaew and Aod have
their own work to do.

843
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,130
Unlike someone

844
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,090
who's got way too much free time.

845
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,460
I don't have free time.

846
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,300
I still have a lot of things to do.

847
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:22,500
That lame rose garden?

848
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,960
I've seen the plans.
I can tell you in one word,

849
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:28,750
lame.

850
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,920
Yes, it's lame.

851
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,750
But I'll improve it.

852
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,800
And I won't use your people anymore.

853
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:40,750
Good.

854
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,710
Now just get out of here.

855
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,960
Don't worry.

856
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,130
I won't come back here anymore.

857
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,840
Just leave the farm.
So I'll be happy.

858
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:56,880
I'm not going.

859
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,460
Saeb,

860
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,460
tell our farmhands

861
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,420
to remember that
this woman's dangerous.

862
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,170
They can kill her on sight.

863
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,460
Huh?

864
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,880
Kill her?

865
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,460
Is there going to be a problem
when we try to hide her body?

866
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,090
Who said to really kill her?

867
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,380
Oh?

868
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,590
Get back to work,

869
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:28,750
Alright, sir.

870
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,460
I'm all alone.

871
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,420
Will I make it?

872
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,920
Aueng!

873
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,670
Perfect timing. I'm hungry.

874
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,300
Find your own food.

875
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,500
This is for Artit.

876
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,340
Don't be so stingy.

877
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:12,750
Just one piece.

878
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,300
- Hey!
- Oh?

879
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,670
Are you angry with me?

880
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,670
You don't know?

881
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,000
About Paeng?

882
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,550
You're a fool.

883
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:25,960
Why are you insulting me?

884
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:27,420
Isn't it true?

885
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,000
I can see she's
concocting something evil.

886
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:32,250
But you keep trusting her.

887
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,920
You can't discipline
someone like her.

888
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,550
Watch out.

889
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,630
Your pet snake might bite you.

890
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:44,750
Tubtim, you don't have to
believe it.

891
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,500
But don't forget
that Paeng's an orphan.

892
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:49,630
She has no one else apart from us.

893
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,840
And the reason why
we didn't have to suffer

894
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,250
is because of her dad's help.

895
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,750
Do you want me to die
and be unable to face my friend?

896
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,460
We've helped a lot of orphans.

897
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,380
Can't we help the family
that helped us?

898
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,500
Don't be so heartless.

899
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,420
Don't ever think that your words

900
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,130
will sway me.

901
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,550
- Ugh.
- Alright.

902
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,750
Gosh! Ling,

903
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,590
why is the coffee so bitter?

904
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,500
You still have feelings.

905
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,500
What are you talking about?

906
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,210
She's trying to say

907
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,590
that you have a black heart,
even towards a little girl.

908
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:01,630
Oh!

909
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,840
So you met that brat, didn't you?

910
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,210
What? Did the brat tell you that
I bullied her?

911
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,460
Don't call her rude names!

912
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,460
Just a second.

913
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:15,800
Hello?

914
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,960
The battery's probably dead.

915
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,340
Hello?

916
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,960
What's up, Non?

917
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,500
Right now?

918
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:26,630
I'll be right there.

919
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:30,960
Non wants me to help
carry some stuff. I'll be back.

920
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,300
- Look after my stuff.
- Okay.

921
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,550
And don't fight each other.

922
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:42,050
When I was overseas,

923
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,500
you called to apologize

924
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,460
for being rude to me.

925
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,210
I forgave you and gave you a chance.

926
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,710
- And why...
- It's not the same.

927
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:54,670
I was only being rude to you.

928
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,460
But as for that girl,
you know what she did to me.

929
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,130
If you're still fixated on the past,

930
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,130
how is your life supposed to
move forward?

931
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,420
It can.

932
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,920
It's going well, actually.

933
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,340
Don't you see how happy I am?

934
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,340
You're lying to yourself.

935
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,300
Hey,

936
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,590
what's in these boxes?
They're so heavy.

937
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,300
I took our client on a trip
to a mangosteen farm.

938
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,750
The owner was very kind. They
gave us heaps of mangosteens.

939
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,750
Ling's going to throw
a party if she knows.

940
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,380
She's a mangosteen lover.

941
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,500
Hold on.

942
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,550
Did they give them to you?

943
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,050
Or did you intentionally
bring them for her?

944
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,500
Wait up!

945
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,420
Argh.

946
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,420
Thanks very much.

947
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:01,670
Mmm! Now that's what
I call a coffee.

948
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,090
Non's coming?

949
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,250
Yes.

950
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:12,750
You got it?

951
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,590
Seriously, Ling.

952
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,710
How long do we have to keep
pretending to be a couple?

953
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:23,920
I don't know.

954
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,000
I don't understand
why you have to do this.

955
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:30,340
I have my reasons.

956
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:32,340
Just keep helping me for now.

957
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:38,670
Non,

958
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:41,050
you still can't get over her?

959
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,920
Why should I?

960
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,420
I'm actually happy

961
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,750
to have someone that makes
my world a special place.

962
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,250
Even though she doesn't love me,

963
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,130
seeing her be happy
with the person she loves

964
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:06,460
makes me happy too.

965
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,880
Don't you think, Kot?

966
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,130
Wise

967
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,500
but heartbreaking.

968
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,840
Wow, with this many mangosteens,

969
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,340
I should make
complementary ice-cream and juice.

970
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,420
Complementary?

971
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:42,050
Ling, you can earn a lot from those.

972
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,250
Why do you want to make it free?

973
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,210
To show our gratitude
to the customers.

974
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:49,500
Oh, right!

975
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,210
I agree with you, Ling.

976
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,090
The customers will be impressed.

977
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,880
Right.

978
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:58,000
Both of you are angels.

979
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,590
You two are so suitable,

980
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:00,840
don't you think? Non?

981
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,960
I'll help you carry these
over there.

982
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:07,710
Good.

983
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,550
They're helping each other.

984
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,210
You're overacting. You'd can carry
your own boxes.

985
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,590
Alright.

986
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,500
Okay.

987
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:40,710
Ling,

988
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:42,800
what's wrong?

989
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,380
Should you go and rest?
I'll do it myself.

990
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,090
Thanks.

991
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,000
Paeng!

992
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,550
Non!

993
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:33,710
Here it is.

994
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,050
The research lab is facing west,

995
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,960
you don't mind, don't you?

996
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:42,840
I don't.

997
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,420
But that direction is very hot.

998
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,210
If it's this direction,

999
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,210
it will in the shade and breezy.

1000
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,460
- I have to think of the direction?
- Yes.

1001
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:57,500
But your design is very detailed.

1002
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,800
If it's about construction,
you can consult me.

1003
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,960
That's true. You run a resort

1004
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:06,300
so you must have
some knowledge about it.

1005
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:07,750
Just a tad.

1006
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,960
For this size of a building,

1007
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,050
it should take around
four months to finish.

1008
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:15,750
- Just four months?
- Yes.

1009
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:17,550
How long did you
think it would take?

1010
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,000
Non, please help me

1011
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,750
limit the budget.

1012
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,800
Sure. Easy enough.

1013
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,500
I love you!

1014
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:29,670
Come on. Don't flatter me.

1015
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,920
- Here. Don't forget your pen.
- Thank you.

1016
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,340
You couldn't seduce me
so you're seducing my friend?

1017
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,090
You can't stand not
having a guy in your life?

1018
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:40,960
Artit, that's too harsh

1019
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,130
Non,

1020
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,920
I have something to talk
to you about.

1021
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,630
Follow me.

1022
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:52,710
Where are we going?

1023
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,420
Just under the tamarind tree.

1024
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,460
Non,

1025
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,210
why are you talking to her?

1026
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:05,880
I was only helping Paeng
with her plans.

1027
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,380
Who's your friend? Me or her?

1028
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:11,630
Artit, we're not kids anymore,

1029
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:13,880
fighting each other
and taking sides.

1030
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,090
I mean well, that's why
I'm warning you.

1031
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,670
Paeng is evil.

1032
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,750
If you don't want her to cling
to you, stop fraternizing with her.

1033
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,250
I'm only helping with what I can.

1034
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,460
If I passed by but didn't help her,

1035
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,130
isn't that a little too heartless?

1036
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,920
You were seduced, weren't you?

1037
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:33,960
Do you want to end up like me?

1038
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,590
It might not be my problem.

1039
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,840
What do you mean?

1040
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:44,800
I think Paeng's a lovely person.

1041
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,960
If I don't have anyone

1042
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,590
and I'm interested in her,

1043
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,960
then it shouldn't be a problem.

1044
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,880
Non,

1045
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,590
you're my friend.

1046
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:56,710
And I love you.

1047
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:59,920
If you get together with her,

1048
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,670
you can sever ties with me.

1049
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:05,300
Artit,

1050
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:07,880
what about you getting
together with Ling?

1051
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:10,750
I didn't sever ties with you.

1052
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:27,210
- Non!
- Stop!

1053
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,130
I want peace and quiet.

1054
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,090
I'm also tired.

1055
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,710
Your friend's been acting cheeky
with me too.

1056
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,250
I don't want Kot coming here.

1057
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,630
He likes to eat without paying.

1058
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,090
He's also nosy

1059
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:43,750
and acts like he owns the resort.

1060
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,050
I'm not okay with it.

1061
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:46,960
You have to be.

1062
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,750
Kot's my friend.

1063
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,380
And I don't think he's nosy.

1064
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:54,170
You're the one causing trouble.

1065
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:57,960
Did you forget I'm your sister?

1066
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,460
It's because you're my sister

1067
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:01,960
that I have to scold you.

1068
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,960
And stop being a self-centered
spoiled girl.

1069
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,840
Try to be mature like Paeng.

1070
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,420
Paeng?

1071
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:14,420
You mean rotten Paeng?

1072
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:17,340
Why did you mention her?

1073
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,800
Nothing. I was just saying.

1074
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,800
How was that just a statement

1075
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,800
when she's been gone for years?

1076
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,210
Did she come back here?

1077
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:31,210
Can you get me some water?

1078
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:32,670
I'm thirsty.

1079
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:36,420
Get going. Be a good sister.

1080
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,800
Come on.

1081
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,750
No, Paeng came back, didn't she?

1082
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:45,460
- She came back, didn't she?
- Are you trying to kill me?

1083
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,420
- I've tweaked the plans.
- Can I have a look?

1084
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,710
What do you think?

1085
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,340
Wow!

1086
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,170
This is good. Much better.

1087
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,300
Initially, I was going to say
something as well,

1088
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,000
that it seemed a little off.

1089
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:06,090
But I was too busy
so I didn't look at it in detail.

1090
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,090
You don't have to worry anymore.

1091
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:12,420
I already have a consultant
for the project.

1092
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,090
Who? Can you tell me?

1093
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:19,920
Of course. Non's my consultant.

1094
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,880
Non? Artit's friend?

1095
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:26,800
Yes. Non told me that

1096
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:29,840
the building's facing the wrong way.

1097
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,300
He said it would be too hot.

1098
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,380
So I changed it to be south-facing.

1099
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,460
It's still easy to go in and out of

1100
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:38,460
- and it will have a nice breeze.
- Okay.

1101
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,590
That's true.

1102
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,050
Excellent.

1103
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:46,300
Non is reliable.

1104
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:50,050
If he's got time to look after you,
then I'm happy.

1105
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,840
I was too busy worrying about
this demonstration plot

1106
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,050
so I forgot about the direction
of the wind for the building.

1107
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,880
If I didn't have Non's help,
I'd be stuck in a rut.

1108
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,050
But I'm relieved now.

1109
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,460
Non also promised me

1110
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,340
that he'll help minimize the budget

1111
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,670
and supervise the construction.

1112
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,170
But Uncle,

1113
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:19,170
we have to keep
this a secret from Artit.

1114
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,750
Because if he knows,

1115
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:24,550
he'll accuse me of
stealing his friend.

1116
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,460
It's a secret.

1117
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,130
Where is she?

1118
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,340
I should've dropped by
to ask Auntie first.

1119
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:49,170
Hey, you.

1120
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:51,250
Do you know Paeng?

1121
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,250
I do.

1122
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,880
Have you seen her?

1123
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,380
I haven't.

1124
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:01,130
Where are you going?
I'm not finished.

1125
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,800
- Hey, stop.
- Don't follow me. Go away.

1126
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:07,960
What's this?

1127
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,000
I said don't follow me.

1128
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:11,960
Why does it stink so much?

1129
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,960
It's bio-fermented water.

1130
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:15,920
Did you play a trick on me?

1131
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,670
Paeng!

1132
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:25,340
I was asking for you.
Why did you lie to me?

1133
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:26,800
Are you trying to avoid me?

1134
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,590
When did you ask for me?

1135
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,500
Just now, you said,

1136
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,460
have you seen her?

1137
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,090
I thought you were asking
about someone else.

1138
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:39,800
Paeng, you still have a sharp
tongue after all these years.

1139
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,960
Do you have anything else to say?

1140
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:45,710
If you don't, I'll have
to excuse myself.

1141
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,050
I have something else to attend to.

1142
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,960
You're shameless.

1143
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:52,300
You still dare come back after
causing all that havoc?

1144
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,710
No one here will ever
forget your audaciousness.

1145
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,300
Don't think you'll be
successful in getting Artit.

1146
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,380
Did you rush over just to say this?

1147
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,130
Nang, it's been years.

1148
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:06,300
Elon Musk already sent
SpaceX to Mars.

1149
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,000
You keep mentioning the past.

1150
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,090
But you haven't succeeded
in winning over Arit's heart, right?

1151
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,670
That's why you came after me.

1152
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,050
Are you scared?

1153
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,550
Paeng!

1154
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,210
Artit!

1155
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,670
Where?

1156
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:24,920
Where has she gone to?

1157
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,300
Paeng!

1158
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:34,130
Oh my gosh! I'm telling Auntie!

1159
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,130
The weather's nice today.

1160
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:39,670
I hope things will
be peaceful for a day.

1161
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,170
Auntie!

1162
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,340
Auntie!

1163
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,840
Help me!

1164
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:51,840
What's that smell?

1165
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,130
Oh, Nang!

1166
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,550
Did you fall into a septic pond?

1167
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:09,250
How old are you now?
You even had to tell Auntie?

1168
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:11,800
Paeng,

1169
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,880
apologize to her right now.

1170
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,210
Aren't you going to listen
to my explanation?

1171
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,420
It's not necessary.

1172
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,670
I've told her everything.

1173
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,710
Auntie,

1174
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:26,460
I had intended to come and see you.

1175
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:28,880
But I saw her on the way.

1176
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,750
I just found out that she got back,

1177
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:32,960
so I went over to greet her.

1178
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:36,500
What's wrong with her? She saw me
and she insulted me right away.

1179
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:37,670
She chased me away.

1180
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,340
Look at me.

1181
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,550
She sprinkled
this stinky water at me.

1182
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,800
Aren't you ashamed
of yourself at all?

1183
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,960
Paeng!

1184
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:53,050
Are you saying she's lying
and started it first?

1185
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:54,500
Yes.

1186
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,250
I don't believe you.

1187
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,210
I figured that.

1188
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,960
But it's okay.
I'm already used to it.

1189
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,340
Arrogant!

1190
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,960
Did you summon me just for this?

1191
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:10,340
If you're done, I'm going now.

1192
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,340
Paeng, come back here!
Apologize to her now.

1193
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,130
Brat!

1194
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,340
Calm down.

1195
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,670
She has no respect for you at all.

1196
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,590
She probably thinks that
she has Master's support.

1197
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,880
She's still the same.

1198
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:29,800
She was evil before,

1199
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:31,920
now she's still just as evil.

1200
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,170
Even more evil than before.

1201
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,590
I'm really sorry.

1202
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,420
I'll deal with her later.

1203
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:39,800
It's okay.

1204
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,920
I don't want it to be a burden.

1205
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,250
I'm only concerned about one thing.

1206
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,170
I don't want her

1207
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,670
to cause trouble
for you and Artit again.

1208
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,380
Auntie,

1209
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,380
please be careful.

1210
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,920
It's okay.

1211
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,460
Artit and I already
know her every move.

1212
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:02,460
Artit hates her to the bone.

1213
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:03,960
She can't do anything.

1214
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:07,210
That's right. He detests her.

1215
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:19,170
Okay. All done.

1216
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,340
I'll get it done, Sir.

1217
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,550
I told you

1218
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,880
if we're alone, you don't have
to call me Sir.

1219
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,840
It's a force of habit, buddy.

1220
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:33,130
If you have some time,
take me fishing.

1221
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,750
Can you go?

1222
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,840
Your wife is always on to you.

1223
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,880
She's like a security guard.

1224
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,420
I'm never been scared of my wife.

1225
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,960
- Krongprateep.
- Yes, dear?

1226
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,340
You're not scared of your wife.

1227
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,090
But I'm getting diabetes
from your sweet talk.

1228
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:50,250
I'll excuse myself, Sir.

1229
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:54,840
What's the matter?

1230
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:58,300
Your niece is causing
troubles again.

1231
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,000
What is it now?

1232
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,920
She threw fermented water at Nang.

1233
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,920
Where did this happen?

1234
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:06,000
At her rose garden.

1235
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,500
Really?

1236
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,670
Why did Nang go there?

1237
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:10,840
Well, she...

1238
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,920
She was only there to greet her.

1239
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:18,710
What are you smiling about?

1240
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:22,250
Just let the girls play sometimes.

1241
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,750
You're siding with her again.

1242
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:28,340
I came to see the wrong person.

1243
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:48,460
Artit!

1244
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:54,670
Hey,

1245
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:56,920
did you seduce my friend again?

1246
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:01,170
I'm warning you now.
Don't mess around with him.

1247
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,090
The mom scolds me in the morning.

1248
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,420
The son throws a fit in the evening.
Will I ever get a break?

1249
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,960
What are you muttering about?

1250
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:13,800
Instead of being a watchdog,

1251
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,170
you should spend more time working.

1252
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:16,840
That's more beneficial.

1253
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,460
Hold on.

1254
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,380
It's because you can't be trusted.

1255
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:23,590
You're always seducing guys
whenever you get the chance.

1256
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:27,300
Non was just looking
at the plans for me.

1257
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,500
There's nothing more.

1258
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,050
Non came for that.

1259
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:33,050
But I don't believe you.

1260
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:35,000
You don't have to.

1261
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,800
Snake! Snake!

1262
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,750
- Snake! Snake!
- Paeng!

1263
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,130
Snake! Snake!

1264
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,380
I thought you said
you weren't seducing me.

1265
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:49,090
I really saw a snake!
Just behind there!

1266
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,590
So it's snake now?

1267
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,710
What a cheap trick. Let me go!

1268
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:56,300
Where is it? I don't see any!

1269
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,340
If there was,

1270
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:00,090
it would be on your head.

1271
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,420
There's a snake on my head?

1272
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:04,090
There's a snake on my head!

1273
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,000
Get off! Get off!

1274
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:15,000
I don't have a snake on my head.

1275
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:16,300
What do you mean? I can see them.

1276
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:17,920
Heaps of them.

1277
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:19,170
Medusa.

1278
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,090
Don't look into my eyes then.

1279
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,250
I'm going to turn you into stone
for eons.

1280
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,210
Artit,

1281
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:44,550
why are you following me?

1282
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:47,130
I told you I don't trust you.

1283
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,000
Non might fall for your tricks.

1284
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:52,500
I'm not meeting with him.

1285
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:55,420
But if you afraid of that,

1286
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:57,630
you can just call him.

1287
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,630
We're already living
in the era of 4G.

1288
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:02,300
No need to use telepathy.

1289
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,050
Oh, Paeng.

1290
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:34,050
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1291
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,800
I dropped by to see
if you're done with the plans.

1292
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:40,090
All done.

1293
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:42,090
I already handed it over to Uncle.

1294
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,420
Artit, don't you have
anything to do?

1295
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,460
I can't let you be alone
with this woman.

1296
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:03,800
Was Artit this obsessive
in the past?

1297
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,300
Or has it gotten worse with age?

1298
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,670
I'm not sure about the past.

1299
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,050
But it's probably gotten worse.

1300
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,460
Have it your way.

1301
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,920
If anything happens,
don't say I didn't warn you.

1302
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:33,380
Can you handle him being this angry?

1303
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,750
I think I can.

1304
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,380
I'm getting used to that now.

1305
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,920
Artit, what are you doing?

1306
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:03,170
Uh...

1307
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,340
nothing.

1308
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:08,170
Oh,

1309
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,960
are you spying on Paeng's house?

1310
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:16,250
Your darling niece is trying
to win my friend over,

1311
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,130
so I have to keep a close watch.

1312
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,250
Which friend?

1313
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,380
Is it Non?

1314
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,460
Even you know about it?

1315
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,550
So what I'm thinking

1316
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:28,880
must be correct.

1317
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,250
But if Non gets together with Paeng,

1318
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,090
then you should be happy.

1319
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,590
So you won't have to be worried
that she'll like you again.

1320
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:44,090
She can like anyone,

1321
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,460
just not my friend.

1322
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:01,170
Tharathep,

1323
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,920
I think I have someone
to take care of Paeng now.

1324
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:30,500
Saeb, put them in the car.

1325
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:31,710
Okay, sir.

1326
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,420
Put them in the car now.

1327
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,840
Do you have anything else
that I can help with?

1328
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,420
No.

1329
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:45,710
Saeb.

1330
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,170
Yes, sir?

1331
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:49,550
Have you seen...

1332
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,550
Paeng?

1333
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,500
That's right.

1334
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,750
Oh, why are you asking about her?

1335
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,840
You're not interested
in her anymore.

1336
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,050
Hmm? Hmm?

1337
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:03,800
Huh?

1338
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:05,710
There you go!

1339
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,380
That hurt, sir.

1340
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:10,170
- Just answer my question
- Okay, okay.

1341
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,750
My answer is

1342
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,960
I don't know where she is.

1343
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:15,500
Besides,

1344
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,460
I'm not a gecko in her house

1345
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:19,590
that would know of her movements.

1346
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:22,340
Saeb, you're still being cheeky.

1347
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,590
Feel free to relax.

1348
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:40,420
Ling, come here.

1349
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:49,750
Do you think there's something
more than rose garden plans?

1350
01:21:51,550 --> 01:21:53,210
Non is only helping her.

1351
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,380
Wrong.

1352
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:57,090
I can smell

1353
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,880
love.

1354
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:01,090
The love of red roses.

1355
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,630
It's so obvious.

1356
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:05,300
Don't you have anything else to do?

1357
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:07,050
Don't you have a delivery?

1358
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,210
That's right. I do.

1359
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,710
Because for some things,

1360
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:16,880
if you wait too long,

1361
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:18,920
you might miss it.

1362
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:21,130
It has to be delivered today.

1363
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,960
Right now.

1364
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:24,750
At this moment.

1365
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:27,960
Because if you
don't deliver it today,

1366
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:30,920
you might have to wait
for the rest of your life.

1367
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,090
What about you?

1368
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,000
Do you have anything to deliver?

1369
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,380
Tell me.

1370
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,250
I can help you.

1371
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:47,340
I'll go and do my delivery now

1372
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,920
or I might miss it.

1373
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,800
- Aueng!
- Miss Paeng!

1374
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:27,550
Uh... you don't have
to look at me like that.

1375
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,000
I can survive.

1376
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,880
I've survived many nights already.

1377
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,460
I'm still alive, see?

1378
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,090
If you're okay, then I'm okay too.

1379
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,460
Are you ready, Aueng?

1380
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:45,800
I was ready before I came over.

1381
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,960
I've missed you!

1382
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:51,960
Let's go.

1383
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:55,710
Really?

1384
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,630
We have to plant all of these?

1385
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,880
I can't do it.

1386
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,090
I'm not ready.

1387
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:05,710
No, you have to. You are
the only person who can help.

1388
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,210
But an area this big?

1389
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:10,670
It's only the two of us.

1390
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:14,960
Maybe we should
wait for the contractor?

1391
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,710
When they level out the land,
we can ask them to plant these.

1392
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,300
We can't, Aueng.

1393
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:21,630
I don't know when
the contractor's coming.

1394
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:24,500
Whatever we can do on our own,
we should do now.

1395
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,380
If I don't do anything,

1396
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:29,840
they're going to rip me to pieces.

1397
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,000
Let's go, Aueng. Fight!

1398
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,960
Come on. Fight!

1399
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:36,130
FIght!

1400
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,500
Okay. Fight!

1401
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:42,130
Where did you get all that strength?

1402
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,880
Oh, sorry!

1403
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:10,170
I can't go on!

1404
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,210
I'm exhausted and starving!

1405
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:16,250
Let's take a break.

1406
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,670
Then, should we go to the kitchen?

1407
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:22,420
We can't, Aueng.

1408
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,210
We can't go and mess
around with that house.

1409
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:28,590
Why are they so heartless?

1410
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,880
I don't want to get involved or be
in a fight with them anymore.

1411
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:37,050
Aueng, let's find something
to eat for ourselves.

1412
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,170
What are we going to eat?

1413
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:45,960
I know!

1414
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:48,170
At this farm, there should be...

1415
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,670
And it will have everything.

1416
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:57,710
Two!

1417
01:25:58,750 --> 01:25:59,840
Come on.

1418
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,630
Omelet, boiled vegetables
and chili paste again?

1419
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,300
That's right. My face is starting
to look like an omelet already.

1420
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:10,090
And my face is starting to look like
a rabbit's from all the vegetables.

1421
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,210
True. Your face really does
look like a rabbit.

1422
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:15,500
Don't do that!
You know I'm scared of rabbits!

1423
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:17,550
You don't look like
you're scared of anything.

1424
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,500
Can't you cook anything else?

1425
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,960
I can.

1426
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:22,500
But I'm just lazy to do so.

1427
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:24,590
Just eat it up.

1428
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,420
You'll poop it out anyway.

1429
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,090
I won't.

1430
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:31,250
Have it your way.

1431
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:32,920
What about you two?
Are you going to eat?

1432
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:38,710
Let's go. I'm not eating anymore.

1433
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,340
Come on.

1434
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:42,380
Are you trying to be a ringleader?

1435
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:44,250
- I won't eat it.
- You don't have to.

1436
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,210
What about the rest of you?
Are you eating?

1437
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:49,630
I am.

1438
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,380
Then be quick about it.

1439
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:04,630
Your grilled pork is so soft.

1440
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,840
The marinade is so good!

1441
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,960
We'll run out if you keep
eating while cooking.

1442
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,050
Well, it's nice.

1443
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:16,380
- Oh, Pong? Aod? Kaew?
- Have you eaten anything yet?

1444
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:17,710
We haven't.

1445
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,880
Would you like to join us?

1446
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,380
Yes, please.

1447
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,420
- Just lay out the mat!
- Hurry up.

1448
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,800
- Hurry.
- I'm hungry.

1449
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,300
Why did you bump into me?

1450
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:29,050
Hurry! One for each of us.

1451
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:32,960
Some fermented fish?

1452
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:35,130
- That'd be great.
- Over here.

1453
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,630
Make it heavenly.

1454
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,840
Bring it over here right away.

1455
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,340
I can't pick it up.

1456
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,380
What?

1457
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,050
Why are there so many
leftovers today?

1458
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:46,840
Where is everyone?

1459
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:50,170
How should I know?
I've been sitting here with you.

1460
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:57,210
Ready? If we're ready,
then let's go.

1461
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,170
Come on.

1462
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:06,920
Here it is.

1463
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,460
Everyone will be fed!

1464
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,920
Here you go! Papaya salad coming up.

1465
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,050
Just a second.

1466
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:17,500
Here.

1467
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,130
It's coming!

1468
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:26,050
What are you doing?

1469
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,170
Madam!

1470
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,670
Madam!

1471
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,630
- Madam!
- What's the ruckus, Duang?

1472
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,050
My ears are going to explode.

1473
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:37,420
It's Paeng.

1474
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:38,630
What's she doing now?

1475
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:39,800
She started a mob.

1476
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,500
Huh? A mob?

1477
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,380
Are you sure?

1478
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,170
I am 100 percent sure.

1479
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:46,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

1480
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:49,800
Where's Paeng?

1481
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:51,960
Take me to her right now.

1482
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:01,670
Miss Paeng!

1483
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,050
Watch out!

1484
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:07,750
Go and have a think about
how you’re going to get back to me.

1485
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,920
Sicko!

1486
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:11,960
I’m not paying.

1487
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:14,210
Because these three
aren’t my employees anymore.

1488
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,500
Stay with me. I'll look after you.

1489
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,000
You only have money and no brain.

1490
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:22,300
I'm going to show you that
I can survive without money,

1491
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:24,710
If Paeng works for you,

1492
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,670
then that means she's
my subordinate.

1493
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,880
The recipient has
committed a grave sin,

1494
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,130
these merits can help them, right?

1495
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:37,210
Miss Paeng! Miss Paeng!

1496
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,960
Dad!

1497
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:40,210
A grave sin

1498
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:43,000
is committed by murdering someone

1499
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,630
or killing oneself, I think.
