(Previous Episode)

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,460
You investigated me.

41
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,860
So you shouldn't be surprised when I investigated you.

42
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,220
When you're hugging me,

43
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,220
it has turned me on.

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,700
I really want to throw myself at you.

45
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,740
Haven't you seen each other before?

46
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,060
I have a mining ground here.

47
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,540
It's not far from here.

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,260
Aren't you so capable?

49
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,140
He came out of a sudden to save her.

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,300
We had no other way.

51
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,500
Arthit.

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
You're getting in my way.

53
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,580
Do you want me to leave you here?

54
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,900
No way.

55
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,360
We have to escape together.

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,820
-Hurry up. -Get them!

57
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,600
You have to do what I say

58
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,040
because if we go together,

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,820
both of us may die.

60
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,140
Hey!

61
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,300
He is over there!

62
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,940
He ran so fast.

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,380
Where has he gone?

64
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,700
Look for him there.

65
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,100
Yes.

66
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,660
Brother Arthit!

67
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,020
Mark?

68
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,020
Why are you here?

69
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,020
I followed you from the exhibition.

70
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,580
But I'll explain it later.

71
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,220
Are you okay?

72
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,180
Mark.

73
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,180
I heard a gunshot.

74
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,020
I'm afraid that Brother Arthit was shot.

75
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,540
Is Mr. Arthit here?

76
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,060
We were caught here by some bad guys.

77
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,300
Brother Arthit tricked them into another direction.

78
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,660
Then, I ran out.

79
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,780
I heard a gunshot.

80
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,340
I am worried about Brother Arthit.

81
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,180
Calm down.

82
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,140
I think you should leave here now.

83
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,340
It's not safe here.

84
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,340
No.

85
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,660
I have to meet Brother Arthit first.

86
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,380
Okay.

87
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,900
I promise you.

88
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,260
I will come back for Mr. Arthit.

89
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,300
But now, you have to follow me.

90
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,140
Paeng, wait for me in the car.

91
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,940
Never open the door if you see a stranger.

92
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,380
I'll save Mr. Arthit.

93
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,260
This is my phone.

94
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,500
Call the police.

95
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,060
Mark.

96
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
You must find Brother Arthit.

97
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,940
I absolutely will.

98
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,580
Who are you?

99
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,900
What do you want?

100
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,140
Well, still won't tell?

101
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,300
I will.

102
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,660
Brother Arthit.

103
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,660
Brother Arthit!

104
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,300
Paeng.

105
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,580
You told me

106
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,340
you'd be safe.

107
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,500
I...

108
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,420
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,980
I'll take you to the hospital.

110
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,220
Can you get up?

111
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,140
Brother Arthit.

112
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,060
Brother Arthit!

113
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,780
Stay awake!

114
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,540
Brother Arthit!

115
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,980
Stay awake!

116
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,820
I can't carry you, Brother Arthit!

117
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,820
Paeng.

118
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,900
Don't be afraid.

119
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,140
I'm fine.

120
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,740
I just feel dizzy.

121
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,540
I'll be fine soon.

122
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,660
Let me get some rest.

123
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,180
Really?

124
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,780
Are you really okay, Brother Arthit?

125
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,660
Who is over there?

126
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,700
We are the police!

127
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,060
Help!

128
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,740
Hey, let's go!

129
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,860
Brother Arthit!

130
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,780
The police are here, Brother Arthit!

131
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,060
Are you alright?

132
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,180
Hang in there!

133
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,620
Check the wounded's condition.

134
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,860
Help.

135
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
Calling for help.

136
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,140
Are you alright?

137
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,660
Someone got shot.

138
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,540
We request an ambulance.

139
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,660
Calm down.

140
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,460
(Operating Room)

141
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,780
(Operating Room) Uncle, Thanon.

142
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,060
Brother Arthit was shot.

143
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,980
We knew it.

144
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,860
Doctor.

145
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,900
What is my son's condition?

146
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,540
The bullet missed the vital parts.

147
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,820
It has been taken out.

148
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
The patient is out of danger now.

149
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,900
Can we go in and visit Brother Arthit?

150
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,260
The patient is still asleep.

151
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,220
We will monitor his condition for one night.

152
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,860
(Operating Room) You may visit him tomorrow.

153
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,780
Is my son really okay, doctor?

154
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,260
We need to monitor his condition.

155
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,060
But he's safe for the time being.

156
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,900
Thank you.

157
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,300
Arthit is okay, Paeng.

158
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,900
Uncle.

159
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,820
Has Auntie known it?

160
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,860
I didn't dare to tell her.

161
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,220
But now,

162
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,220
she is probably asleep.

163
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,660
I'll tell her tomorrow.

164
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,140
Uncle.

165
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,940
Can I look after Brother Arthit tonight?

166
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,900
Uncle.

167
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,780
I'll stay together with Paeng.

168
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,380
Okay.

169
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,260
In this case,

170
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,540
I'll leave him to your care.

171
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,540
Please.

172
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,260
Sure.

173
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,300
I'm going to the police.

174
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,140
I'm not afraid of anything that may happen to me.

175
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,140
But I am afraid

176
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,900
that you will be in danger because of me.

177
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,020
If it happens again,

178
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,140
I'll be too  ashamed to face Uncle and Auntie.

179
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,100
Paeng.

180
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,660
Your clothes are dirty.

181
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,180
I'll take you home to change it.

182
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,740
I want to look after Brother Arthit.

183
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,420
Arthit should be glad

184
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,420
that you're worried about him.

185
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,940
Put it on.

186
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,260
Thank you.

187
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,300
Be strong, Paeng.

188
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,820
Paeng, you haven't rested for a bit, have you?

189
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,100
I want to wait until Brother Arthit wakes up.

190
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,300
I'll go home first.

191
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,900
I'll be back later.

192
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,940
Brother Arthit.

193
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,660
Brother Arthit.

194
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,860
Brother Arthit.

195
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,220
You got shot.

196
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,460
But you are safe now.

197
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,460
Do you remember?

198
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,500
Paeng, are you okay?

199
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,980
I'm fine.

200
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,060
That's good.

201
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,460
What's wrong?

202
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,300
Thank you for worrying about me.

203
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,500
You are worried about me, too.

204
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,060
I was afraid

205
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,180
that something would happen to you.

206
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,100
Why are you smiling?

207
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,580
I'm glad

208
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,860
that you're worried about me.

209
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,900
I'm thirsty.

210
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,300
The doctor said you can only take a sip.

211
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,620
Brother Arthit.

212
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,700
Are you hungry?

213
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,380
Is there anything you want to eat?

214
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,500
Brother Arthit, you look a little tired.

215
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,420
Do you want to continue to take a rest?

216
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,260
Hold my hand.

217
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,180
What?

218
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,260
Brother Arthit.

219
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,580
Why do you ask me to do this?

220
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,340
So I can rest assured.

221
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,740
Madam.

222
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,220
Yes?

223
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,500
Boss made a call and said

224
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,060
he'd pick you up later.

225
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,420
Where to?

226
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,700
I have no idea.

227
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,780
Has he left?

228
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,460
Yes.

229
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,300
Uh, what is he up to?

230
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,700
He came home late

231
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,180
and got up early.

232
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,780
What on earth is he busy with?

233
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,620
He didn't tell

234
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,540
where he was going to bring me.

235
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,820
How do I prepare for it?

236
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,740
Hello, Uncle.

237
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,740
How are you, son?

238
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,060
I've talked to the doctor.

239
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,460
Don't worry.

240
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,260
Paeng, you can rest assured, too.

241
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,100
Yes, Uncle.

242
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,220
This is your clothes.

243
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,660
I asked Aueng to get them for you.

244
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,660
But I didn't tell her anything.

245
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,100
I just told her that you were with me.

246
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,820
Okay.

247
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,740
Paeng, go get changed

248
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,460
and go back for a rest.

249
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,740
I'll look after him.

250
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,060
No, Uncle.

251
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,140
I want to stay and look after Brother Arthit.

252
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,700
Paeng.

253
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,580
Can you ask the nurse

254
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,820
when Arthit can start eating?

255
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,820
Okay.

256
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,100
I haven't told your mother yet.

257
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,100
I don't know how to tell her.

258
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,820
But I guess I have to let her know slowly.

259
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,940
I'll bring her here to visit you later.

260
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,620
Be prepared for that.

261
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,380
Can you not tell Mom?

262
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,940
No way.

263
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,020
She's your mother.

264
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,140
If she learns it from others,

265
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,100
you and I both will be in deep trouble.

266
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,500
Well,

267
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,740
let's not tell her

268
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,380
it's related to Paeng, okay?

269
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,740
You want Paeng to look after you, right?

270
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,300
Arthit!

271
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
I'm sorry!

272
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,300
How do you feel?

273
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,620
I thought you were dead!

274
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,140
Who dared to hurt you like this?

275
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,580
Weren't they afraid of going to jail?

276
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,420
Arthit, are you okay?

277
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,820
I'm okay.

278
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,660
That's good.

279
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,780
Hey.

280
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,460
Why are you lying here alone?

281
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,940
Is no one taking care of you?

282
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,260
I'll look after you. What do you think?

283
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,580
No, thank you.

284
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,940
Why?

285
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,900
Someone is taking care of me.

286
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,060
Someone?

287
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Where is that person?

288
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,420
She's gone to the restroom.

289
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,860
I see.

290
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,020
Is it your mother?

291
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,580
Hello, Auntie.

292
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,020
Hello.

293
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,980
Paeng?

294
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,660
Brother Arthit, do you need me to adjust the height?

295
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,780
Is it okay?

296
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,220
Alright.

297
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,660
I'll leave you be.

298
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,500
Paeng.

299
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,700
Help me move the pillow.

300
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,380
Okay.

301
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,620
Are they...

302
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,620
Is it okay?

303
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,340
I'll leave you be.

304
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,180
Paeng.

305
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,340
Uh, please bear with me.

306
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,260
I need to go to the toilet.

307
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,460
I can take you there.

308
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,380
That's okay.

309
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,700
Paeng, take me there.

310
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,020
Okay.

311
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,780
Excuse me.

312
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,380
I'm sorry.

313
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,620
Easy.

314
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,660
What?

315
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,940
What is going on?

316
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,660
No way.

317
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,900
Paeng.

318
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,260
What's wrong with Arthit?

319
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,940
I have no idea either.

320
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,540
Besides being shot,

321
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,140
did he get hit in the head

322
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,460
or hit against the ground?

323
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,780
I think so.

324
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,260
But

325
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,620
I don't know which part of his was hit.

326
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,740
Paeng, do you find it strange?

327
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,780
Of course.

328
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,980
Brother Arthit has changed a lot.

329
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,580
Look, I'm not the only one having such a thought.

330
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,940
Should we get a doctor here?

331
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,100
I agree.

332
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,860
Let the doctor check him carefully

333
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,500
and scan his cranial nerves.

334
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,540
That's not necessary.

335
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,660
Just get used to it.

336
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,860
Get used to it?

337
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,980
I mean we will get used to it.

338
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,300
Give him some time.

339
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,620
What has happened to Arthit actually?

340
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,580
Tubtim.

341
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,420
Okay.

342
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,460
Get right to it.

343
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,020
Where do you want to take me?

344
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,460
You said you would take me out at noon.

345
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,660
It's afternoon now.

346
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
I'm taking you to the hospital.

347
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,940
For what?

348
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,980
Arthit is sick.

349
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,180
He was alright when he was at the exhibition yesterday.

350
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,140
What are you going to tell me?

351
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,860
What happened to Arthit?

352
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,780
Calm down.

353
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,180
Our son is fine.

354
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,900
What happened to my son?

355
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,780
Arthit is safe.

356
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,900
But

357
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,580
an accident happened yesterday.

358
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,300
Say it, what happened?

359
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,460
Was he involved in a car accident?

360
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,740
No.

361
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,940
Are you sure my son is okay?

362
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,980
Of course.

363
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,860
Take me there right away.

364
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,140
-Let's go. -Dear.

365
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,500
Calm down.

366
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,180
Do you have any enemies?

367
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,820
I have no conflict with anyone.

368
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,660
I believe they targeted you.

369
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,780
Is it possible

370
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,580
that it's related to my farm?

371
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
Do you mean you're their target?

372
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,740
It's possible.

373
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,580
Are you in dispute with anyone?

374
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,740
Actually, it's not a big deal.

375
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,700
But this person

376
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,420
is the prime suspect.

377
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,500
Who is it?

378
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,340
I had a dispute with Dandim, the mine owner.

379
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,420
Mr. Dandim?

380
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,140
Yes.

381
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,500
Thank you.

382
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,260
We will continue the investigation.

383
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,740
Yes, please do.

384
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,540
Yes.

385
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,020
Brother Arthit!

386
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,060
Why do you leave the bed?

387
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,220
What do you need?

388
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,900
Nothing.

389
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,020
I didn't see you have any food today.

390
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,700
Have you had anything?

391
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,900
I...

392
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,900
I'm not hungry.

393
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,180
Then...

394
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,580
Did you look after me all night long yesterday?

395
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,660
Yes.

396
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,060
Did you get a rest?

397
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,380
Paeng.

398
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,580
Thank you for worrying about me.

399
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,540
But don't make me worry about you.

400
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,420
It's almost one PM.

401
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,100
Go get some food.

402
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,140
I'll place an order for you.

403
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,580
You can rest better after eating.

404
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,460
I'm not hungry.

405
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,700
Fine.

406
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,420
I won't have dinner then.

407
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,340
I...

408
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,780
I'll have my meal.

409
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,380
I'll go downstairs for food.

410
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,620
Are you going alone?

411
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,300
I'm worried about you.

412
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,980
Brother Arthit, we're in the hospital.

413
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,020
Nothing will happen here.

414
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
Well.

415
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,780
Hurry back.

416
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,340
Okay.

417
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
You'll have ten minutes.

418
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Uncle.

419
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
Arthit.

420
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,660
Are you okay, son?

421
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,740
I'll go to the doctor now.

422
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,780
I want to make sure you are fine.

423
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,780
I'm fine, Mom.

424
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,620
The only thing is that my wound hurts a little.

425
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,140
I don't believe it.

426
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,340
Do you want me to get up and run in front of you?

427
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,660
No.

428
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,660
Don't get up.

429
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,820
Stay in bed until the doctor allows you to go home.

430
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,980
By the way,

431
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,300
where's Dad?

432
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,780
Right.

433
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,500
He said he was going to talk to the doctor.

434
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,900
Have the police arrested the bad guys?

435
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,300
The police have come to take the statement.

436
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,900
Were you in conflict with anyone?

437
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,580
Why would you get shot?

438
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,140
Does it have anything to do with our farm?

439
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,700
I'm not sure, Mom.

440
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,980
But I think the police will catch the culprits soon.

441
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,380
If it is related to the farm,

442
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,660
just sell it.

443
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,020
It's not worth risking my son's life.

444
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,340
Next time, if I'm still the last one

445
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,340
to be informed

446
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,780
when something serious happens,

447
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,140
I will kill both of you.

448
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,020
There won't be another time, Mom.

449
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,500
Fair enough.

450
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,460
Why would such a thing happen to you?

451
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,780
I nearly had a heart attack,

452
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,540
you know, Arthit?

453
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,260
I'm sorry, Mom.

454
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,100
Can I fall asleep tonight?

455
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,980
The culprits haven't been caught yet.

456
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,540
I don't know if they will come back and hurt you.

457
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,020
The police have stepped in.

458
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,140
I think they won't have the guts.

459
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,100
My son.

460
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,020
Let me

461
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,900
look after you tonight.

462
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,780
Don't worry, son.

463
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,580
You can sleep with peace of mind.

464
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,420
Have a rest.

465
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,380
Auntie wants to look after her son.

466
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,660
So I'm taking you home.

467
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,020
I understand.

468
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,300
If Auntie finds out

469
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,860
that Brother Arthit got injured because of me,

470
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,620
she will hate me even more.

471
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,500
But Arthit survived it

472
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,140
because of you.

473
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,180
If you had run away

474
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,060
and left Arthit there,

475
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,340
I might have lost my son now.

476
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,500
How could I leave Brother Arthit behind, Uncle?

477
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,860
Brother Arthit risked his life to save me.

478
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,220
By the way,

479
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,740
Arthit wants you to move back to our house.

480
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,540
What?

481
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,500
I agree with him.

482
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,420
I'm worried about your safety.

483
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,260
We don't know

484
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,940
why and who is

485
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,540
behind this incident yet.

486
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,500
I think I'd better stay here.

487
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,980
I don't want to upset Auntie.

488
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,820
But Arthit is worried about you.

489
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,260
He asked me again and again.

490
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,500
He is worried about your safety.

491
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,060
He told me

492
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,580
not to let strangers into the farm.

493
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,500
I'm also worried about Brother Arthit.

494
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,020
He will be discharged in two or three days.

495
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,060
You can rest assured.

496
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,540
Yes, Uncle.

497
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,900
Oh, Nang is here.

498
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,300
Hello, Auntie.

499
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,260
Yes.

500
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,420
Brother Arthit.

501
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,700
Does it hurt?

502
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,620
When Auntie told me on the phone,

503
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,020
I was so frightened and I couldn't do anything.

504
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,460
Can I take a look at the wound?

505
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,740
No, Nang.

506
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,300
I'm just taking a look.

507
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,100
Brother Arthit, don't worry.

508
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,100
I have taken nursing courses before.

509
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,300
I promise,

510
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,220
I can take good care of you.

511
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,420
I'm almost recovered, Nang.

512
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,540
No way.

513
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,060
You need more private care

514
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,180
when you're getting better.

515
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,460
It's afternoon already.

516
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,460
Let me wipe your body.

517
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,900
Auntie.

518
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,780
I ask for your permission.

519
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,300
Nang!

520
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,100
Mom!

521
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,660
Mom.

522
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,420
Time for cleaning.

523
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,460
Auntie.

524
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,860
I'll

525
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,540
look after Arthit tonight, okay?

526
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,700
Uh, sure.

527
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,420
What's the matter?

528
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,580
Mr. Dandim.

529
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,180
The police asked to see you.

530
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,980
Miss Paeng, you are here!

531
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,780
Miss Paeng!

532
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,780
Everyone is saying

533
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,620
that Mr. Arthit was injured and hospitalized, is it true?

534
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,900
What happened to Mr. Arthit?

535
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
Who was that bald to hurt Mr. Arthit?

536
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,700
Miss Paeng.

537
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,860
How dare they bully us!

538
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,220
Phong!

539
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,780
What are you going to do?

540
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,820
I'll scold them.

541
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,500
Oh, Phong!

542
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,660
Hey, if this is all you can do,

543
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,700
be quiet then!

544
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,340
Let's listen to Miss Paeng.

545
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,580
Or else, I'll beat the snot out of you!

546
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,500
Sape.

547
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,260
Are you looking for a fight? I'll...

548
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,260
Do you want to kiss me?

549
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,540
I'll kick you to death!

550
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,060
I'm sorry!

551
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,500
Listen up!

552
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,540
Uh, Miss Paeng.

553
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,100
Is Mr. Arthit alright?

554
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,940
Brother Arthit

555
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,580
will be discharged in a few days.

556
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,860
Phong, Sape,

557
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,460
you can ask him yourselves.

558
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,860
It must be the people from the mining ground, right?

559
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,380
We don't know who the gangsters are.

560
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
I knew it!

561
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,620
Mr. Arthit must have been attacked by them!

562
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,940
I'm sure of it!

563
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,940
Everyone, listen up!

564
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,580
Everyone, come on!

565
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,580
Listen up!

566
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,820
Everyone, come on!

567
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,900
Arthit.

568
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,740
The doctor said you could leave the hospital tomorrow.

569
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,660
Are you happy?

570
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,620
Thanks to Nang's care

571
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,540
so you've recovered so quickly.

572
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,620
You're exaggerating it, Auntie.

573
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,340
I'm only showing my concern to Brother Arthit.

574
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,900
I've chosen the right person.

575
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,460
I've told you, Nang is lovely.

576
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,660
Auntie!

577
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,300
Thank you, Nang.

578
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,060
I'm almost recovered.

579
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,740
You may go home.

580
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,460
I can't.

581
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,660
Auntie told me

582
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,900
to go home with you and continue to take care of you

583
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,020
until your wound is completely healed.

584
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,780
And I

585
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,780
agreed to it right away.

586
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,420
Don't you need to work?

587
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,660
Work?

588
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,580
I have made time for you.

589
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,580
I've sent a leave note to my father.

590
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,420
It's a long leave, one, two, three months!

591
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,980
Arthit, don't worry.

592
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,460
My father has agreed to it.

593
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,900
Mom.

594
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,060
I can take care of myself.

595
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,860
My decision is unanimous.

596
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,700
From now on, Nang will take care of you at home.

597
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,860
Oh.

598
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,020
I'll go back today.

599
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,260
Let Nang take me back.

600
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,820
Then, she will come back to take care of you.

601
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,580
Mom.

602
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,620
Arthit.

603
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,620
Why are you so scared?

604
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,980
I won't do anything to you.

605
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,900
Nang is right.

606
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,300
Why are you so frightened?

607
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,660
Let's go, Nang.

608
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,700
Hello.

609
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,980
Thanon, it's me.

610
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,700
I was about to visit you.

611
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,740
That's good.

612
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,740
Could you help me buy two mobile phones?

613
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,780
No problem.

614
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,660
Also,

615
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,620
I need your help.

616
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,900
What's the matter?

617
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,900
Is it about my sister again?

618
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,740
Alright, leave it to me.

619
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,300
Thank you.

620
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,700
My sister

621
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,860
always embarrasses me before my friend.

622
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,180
Pam.

623
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,860
Where is my car?

624
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,580
Mr. Thanon asked me to send it for repair just now.

625
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,020
Sent for repair?

626
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,460
My car?

627
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,180
Yes.

628
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,900
I only parked it here just now.

629
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,300
Uh, all the cars have been sent for repair.

630
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,580
All the cars at home?

631
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,940
Mr. Thanon said that you wouldn't go out today.

632
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
Oh!

633
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,700
Why doesn't he get permissions before doing anything?

634
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,900
Where is Brother Thanon?

635
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,020
Mr. Thanon just drove out.

636
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,180
He sent all the cars at home for repair,

637
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,260
except his?

638
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,300
What a crazy brother!

639
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,260
How am I going out?

640
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,740
Miss Paeng!

641
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,620
Miss Paeng!

642
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,980
Miss Paeng!

643
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,580
What's wrong, Sape?

644
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,660
Mr. Arthit gave us a call

645
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,100
and asked you to go to the hospital right away!

646
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,660
What's wrong with Brother Arthit?

647
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,740
I have no idea, Miss Paeng!

648
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,860
Be quick!

649
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,820
Miss Paeng, hurry up!

650
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,660
Hello.

651
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,660
Miss Paeng has left home, Mr. Arthit.

652
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,340
I saw her take a lot of food with her.

653
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,100
Well done, Sape.

654
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,420
Thank you.

655
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,940
Yes.

656
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,820
Hey.

657
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,900
I should go back, right?

658
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,100
Yes.

659
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,940
Why do you get so close to me?

660
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,620
I lost my value

661
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,740
after bringing you the mobile phones, right?

662
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,300
I want you to give me a little attention.

663
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,860
Go back.

664
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,740
Thank you.

665
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,980
Fine.

666
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,380
I'll go back.

667
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,060
I'll go back to Ling.

668
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,580
You may go.

669
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,020
Bye.

670
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,860
Paeng, thank you.

671
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,220
What are you doing here?

672
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,900
(Pregnancy and Birth)

673
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,500
(Pregnancy and Birth) Why can't I be here?

674
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,860
You know what you've done.

675
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,140
How dare you ask me!

676
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,260
What have I done?

677
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,340
Are you here to see how serious Brother Arthit's gunshot wound is?

678
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,580
I can sue you

679
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,340
for falsely accusing me.

680
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,660
What are you doing here then?

681
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,420
For sure, I'm here to visit my friend.

682
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,420
Visiting your friend?

683
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Mark, my friend

684
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,020
was also injured and hospitalized.

685
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,180
Really?

686
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,300
If you don't believe me,

687
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,180
check it out yourself.

688
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,140
He's in Ward 6602.

689
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,140
I have to leave.

690
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,980
(Patient: Mark Tanikeji)

691
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,860
Mark.

692
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,860
Paeng.

693
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,320
Miss Paeng was out long ago.

694
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,000
Why isn't she here yet, Sape?

695
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,640
I don't know.

696
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,400
You have to know, Sape.

697
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,360
How would I know, Mr. Arthit?

698
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,360
I didn't go with her.

699
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,320
Mr. Arthit.

700
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,480
Would Miss Paeng run back to Bangkok?

701
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,040
Enough.

702
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,960
Talking to you is totally unbearable.

703
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,280
I'll hang up now.

704
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,480
Mr. Arthit! What?

705
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,320
Paeng.

706
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,640
Why are you here so late?

707
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,600
I was going to look for you.

708
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,600
Brother Arthit, why do you get out of bed again?

709
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,880
I'm alright now.

710
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,720
Sape said you brought me something.

711
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,880
I've given it to someone else.

712
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,240
Whom did you meet?

713
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,160
I went to see Mark.

714
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,800
What?

715
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,800
Where did you meet him?

716
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,960
How did you meet him?

717
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,960
You don't have his contact number.

718
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,440
I saw him in the hospital.

719
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,280
Did he follow us here?

720
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,600
No, Brother Arthit.

721
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,320
Listen to me.

722
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,640
Mark is hospitalized.

723
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,520
He was shot, too.

724
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,560
Paeng, tell me.

725
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,080
Why is Mark involved?

726
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,440
I saw him in the forest.

727
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,160
He rescued me.

728
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,840
Then, he went in to look for you and save you.

729
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,080
Did he come to save me?

730
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,640
Why would he pop up in the forest?

731
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,040
Don't you think it's more like an arranged encounter?

732
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,880
I had the same thought at the beginning.

733
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,120
But he explained it.

734
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
What did he say?

735
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,240
I saw you being taken into the car.

736
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,160
You looked unconscious.

737
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,280
So I got back to my car

738
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,720
and followed them.

739
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,200
I didn't see where their car was going.

740
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,360
I called you

741
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,760
while looking around.

742
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,040
And then, I found

743
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,680
that the car was parked on the roadside.

744
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,800
I called the police

745
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,040
and got off the car to look for you.

746
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,560
In the end, I found you.

747
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,400
After that, I heard gunshots.

748
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,440
You went to save Brother Arthit after that?

749
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,000
Yes.

750
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,360
But I ran into the gangsters.

751
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,040
So they shot me.

752
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,320
You got shot, too?

753
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,960
Really?

754
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,920
I'm very sorry

755
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,240
for causing you to be shot.

756
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,920
I'm relieved

757
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,720
as long as I know you are safe.

758
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,080
But are you okay?

759
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,800
Yes, I'm safe.

760
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,280
I didn't know you were injured.

761
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,560
How is Mr. Arthit?

762
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,280
Brother Arthit was also shot.

763
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,200
But he's safe now.

764
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,960
By the way,

765
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,560
don't you have anyone to take care of you?

766
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,440
I feel so sorry about it.

767
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,960
If I knew it,

768
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,000
I'd visit you on the first day.

769
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,280
I'm glad that you're worried about me.

770
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,440
In this case,

771
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,440
you can take care of me.

772
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,480
Sure.

773
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,080
Paeng.

774
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,280
Do you know who they are now?

775
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,320
I don't know.

776
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,960
The police have come to me to take a statement.

777
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,480
They looked familiar, as if I have seen them.

778
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,120
But I can't recall.

779
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,000
Do you believe him?

780
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,960
But I indeed saw him

781
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,520
go to save you.

782
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,440
Do you really believe in him?

783
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,120
Will someone like him save me?

784
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,560
Brother Arthit, what do you mean?

785
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,520
I don't think it was a coincidence.

786
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,140
He went there on purpose.

787
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,940
This is all his doing.

788
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,380
Brother Arthit.

789
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,220
I know

790
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,220
you don't like Mark.

791
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,820
He was injured and yet you're suspecting him.

792
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,340
I think you're too much.

793
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,020
Not at all, Paeng.

794
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,620
I don't believe him anyway.

795
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:53,900
Brother Arthit.

796
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,780
Will anyone be that crazy to shoot himself?

797
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,860
How serious is his injury?

798
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,300
It's almost like yours.

799
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,460
The bullet missed the vital parts.

800
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,460
Paeng.

801
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,060
Before the culprit is caught,

802
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,700
I don't want you to see that man again.

803
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,540
I'd be ungrateful

804
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,060
if I don't visit him.

805
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,340
You'll go with me then.

806
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,300
-But... -Paeng.

807
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,540
Enough, I feel dizzy.

808
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,060
Okay.

809
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,540
Don't call him "that man".

810
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,100
You should be polite.

811
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,900
No way!

812
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,100
I don't believe him at all.

813
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,980
What have you done?

814
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,580
Have you ever considered me?

815
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,060
I didn't mean it.

816
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,780
That was an accident.

817
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,220
You shot Arthit.

818
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,700
Was it only an accident?

819
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,300
I just wanted to frighten him.

820
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,540
He moved to the bullet himself.

821
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,860
Yes, it was my fault.

822
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,820
I didn't ask you about your plan earlier.

823
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,900
Actually, Arthit was not in my plan.

824
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,540
But everything is in a mess now.

825
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,500
It's all because he had a finger in the pie.

826
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,060
What should we do now?

827
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,860
This happened in my place.

828
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,380
Everyone knows that I had a conflict with him.

829
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,300
I'm bearing the blame for you.

830
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,220
Why are you so anxious?

831
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,940
They don't know who did it.

832
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,620
You are overly confident.

833
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,420
You may ruin yourself.

834
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,900
You are asking for trouble.

835
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,020
That's why you've paid a huge price.

836
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,460
This the only way to settle this matter.

837
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,260
And you won't be involved too.

838
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,820
I have sent the people who did this for you

839
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,020
somewhere else.

840
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,260
Stop pestering that woman.

841
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,700
No.

842
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,500
Mr. Mark.

843
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,340
She's just a woman. Is she this important?

844
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,660
Yes.

845
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,700
She is important to me.

846
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,740
That's your business.

847
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,620
But I won't help you again.

848
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,820
Mr. Dandim.

849
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:00,900
The police are requesting to search

850
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,980
the old warehouse with a warrant.

851
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,060
They won't let me go, right?

852
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,060
They insist on getting the evidence against me.

853
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,580
Mr. Dandim,

854
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,660
why are you so protective of your friend?

855
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,500
I'm repaying his kindness.

856
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,820
He once saved my life.

857
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,460
Take a bite.

858
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,620
Ling, are you ready?

859
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,980
Yes.

860
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:42,940
Hello, Arthit.

861
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,260
What's up?

862
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,140
Ling and I are going to visit you.

863
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,660
Sorry, we'll be a little late.

864
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,700
Save yourself the trouble.

865
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,940
Why?

866
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,660
I'm sleepy.

867
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,300
Arthit is sleepy.

868
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,660
Okay, then.

869
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,660
Get some rest.

870
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,020
Paeng.

871
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,300
What are you doing?

872
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,860
Oh, you said you were sleepy.

873
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,220
So I'm adjusting the height.

874
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,260
I'm not sleepy yet.

875
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,900
I just

876
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,700
don't want him to be here.

877
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,020
I only want the two of us to be here.

878
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,660
This is my shirt.

879
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,900
Just settle for it.

880
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,860
Should I stay here and look after you, Brother Arthit?

881
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,460
If you don't look after me,

882
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,740
who will?

883
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,820
Brother Arthit.

884
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,860
You have your family

885
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,060
and friends.

886
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,740
But he has no one.

887
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,820
You are thinking about Mark.

888
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,540
You want to take care of him.

889
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,300
Whether I want it or not,

890
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,580
that's my responsibility, isn't it?

891
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:16,220
Then, I'll ask you to take the responsibility

892
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,580
and take care of me.

893
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,340
Are you willing to do that?

894
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,540
Sure.

895
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,300
I will stay here and look after you tonight.

896
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,260
But I request to take care of Mark tomorrow.

897
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,500
I will stay here and look after you tonight.

898
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,060
But I request to take care of Mark tomorrow.

899
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,900
Who are you looking for?

900
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,420
Paeng told me that you were shot.

901
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,180
So I'm here to visit you.

902
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,700
You're here to visit me

903
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,540
or to see Paeng?

904
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,820
Both.

905
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,740
That day,

906
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,060
why were you there?

907
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,940
I think Paeng has told you about it.

908
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,620
Yes, she has.

909
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,620
But I don't believe it.

910
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,860
You don't like me.

911
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,340
That's why you don't believe it.

912
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,900
Do you know

913
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,780
why you got shot?

914
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,540
Did you make enemies?

915
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,100
I've never made enemies.

916
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,300
But it's another story if someone wants

917
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,380
to make enemies with me.

918
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,900
I think you must have gotten in someone's way.

919
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,540
It's good to be careful.

920
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,340
I think

921
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,820
it's just a mad dog's random attack.

922
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,620
I won't be afraid.

923
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,300
Paeng is in the ward, right?

924
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,420
Stop pestering Paeng.

925
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,940
Why should I?

926
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,140
I'm so attracted to her.

927
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,940
And I believe that Paeng wants to come to me

928
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,580
if she isn't stopped by someone.

929
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,380
Then, you should know

930
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,700
I have Paeng's ear.

931
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,500
Well, you have her ear for the moment.

932
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,100
But can you stop her for a lifetime?

933
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,300
I will get the evidence

934
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,820
and find out

935
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,820
who shot me

936
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,020
and took Paeng away.

937
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:20,820
And I believe

938
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,700
I didn't suspect the wrong person.

939
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,220
Remember to share the message with me.

940
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,060
I was shot, too.

941
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,420
Please tell Paeng

942
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,620
that I am lonely.

943
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,460
Brother Arthit.

944
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,220
Will anyone be that crazy and shoot himself?

945
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,660
He is scarier than you can imagine.

946
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,700
He made it clear that we should stay out of his business.

947
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:50,820
Paeng.

948
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,260
We've arrived.

949
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,740
Where are we, Brother Arthit?

950
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,740
Brother Arthit.

951
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,500
Brother Arthit.

952
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,340
Brother Arthit.

953
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,940
Why aren't we going home?

954
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:29,260
Whose house is this?

955
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,220
Wow.

956
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,820
It's so beautiful.

957
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,380
Where is this place?

958
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:53,380
Paeng.

959
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,140
I want to get some rest.

960
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,100
Go home and take a nap if you want to rest.

961
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,460
What are you doing here?

962
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,460
Do you want to go back to your sleep?

963
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,460
No.

964
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,980
Are you hungry?

965
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,060
Not yet.

966
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,780
Okay, I'll get some rest now.

967
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,140
I'm not feeling very well.

968
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,340
Brother Arthit.

969
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,340
Brother Arthit.

970
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,460
Whose home is this?

971
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,380
Let me sleep a little longer.

972
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,940
Let go of my hand.

973
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,980
Brother Arthit!

974
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,540
I'm here.

975
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,900
I'm so sorry that I couldn't come last night.

976
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,140
Thanon fooled me,

977
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,820
so you had to stay in the hospital alone.

978
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:04,860
Did you feel lonely?

979
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,180
Can you leave the hospital today?

980
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,860
Where is Arthit?

981
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,500
Am I in the wrong ward?

982
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,340
I'm so sorry.

983
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,980
It's the right ward.

984
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,260
Is it possible that Arthit has gone home?

985
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:04,660
You're up.

986
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,180
You were asleep, so I didn't wake you up.

987
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,580
I really envy you.

988
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:10,660
You sleep a lot.

989
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,500
Don't accuse me.

990
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,100
I just took a short nap.

991
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,660
I sat beside you for hours.

992
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,060
Do you want to have your meal or take a shower first?

993
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,260
I want to talk to you first.

994
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,940
Brother Arthit, are you ready for a talk?

995
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,900
Have your meal first then.

996
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,940
We'll talk after,

997
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:32,740
alright?

998
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:34,660
Please take a seat.

999
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,340
It looks delicious, doesn't it?

1000
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,180
It looks delicious.

1001
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:47,180
I didn't expect that you could cook.

1002
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,420
There are many things that you've never expected.

1003
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,300
Why are you smiling?

1004
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,180
Because I am happy.

1005
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,420
Brother Arthit!

1006
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,420
Yes?

1007
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,180
Are you happy when you're with me?

1008
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:15,980
Yes.

1009
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,100
You are fooling me!

1010
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:25,860
Brother Arthit.

1011
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,860
Why are you doing this?

1012
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,380
What's your purpose?

1013
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,540
I understand

1014
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,700
if you hate me.

1015
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,820
I can also understand

1016
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,300
if you want to forgive me

1017
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,660
and bury the hatchet with me.

1018
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,540
But

1019
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,420
why are you doing this to me?

1020
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:51,780
What do you want?

1021
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,620
Isn't it good

1022
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,580
that I behave this way?

1023
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,980
I...

1024
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,060
I do feel good

1025
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,260
when you are good to me.

1026
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,780
But I...

1027
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,260
I am frustrated.

1028
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:21,020
What makes you feel frustrated?

1029
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,540
It's...

1030
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,780
In the beginning,

1031
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,940
you hated me

1032
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,780
and looked like you were going to kill me.

1033
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,140
But now,

1034
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,820
you suddenly care about me

1035
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,500
and you even saved me.

1036
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,140
Well,

1037
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,220
which one do you like?

1038
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:51,380
Uh...

1039
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,020
I don't know how to handle it.

1040
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:59,300
Why?

1041
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:04,060
Because I...

1042
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,220
You hate me.

1043
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,740
I've never hated you.

1044
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,260
So, you're fond of me.

1045
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:13,420
I am not!

1046
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,100
You smile again.

1047
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,420
Right.

1048
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:23,420
Take a bath after the meal.

1049
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,100
Your clothes are over there.

1050
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,340
Why are my clothes here?

1051
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,380
I asked Sape to prepare it.

1052
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,020
By the way,

1053
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,300
take this.

1054
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,220
It's your new mobile phone and new number.

1055
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,940
But you are with me. I don't think you need it.

1056
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,620
Just in case

1057
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,700
you get lost somewhere,

1058
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,580

Brother Arthit.

1072
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:28,300
Brother Arthit!

1073
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,180
Brother Arthit, stay here!

1074
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,700
Let's talk.

1075
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,660
Brother Arthit!

1076
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,660
Brother Arthit!

1077
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,580
Brother Arthit!

1078
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:42,740
Brother Arthit!

1079
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,700
Brother Arthit.

1080
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,900
Can you tell me now?

1081
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,300
Why don't you go home?

1082
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:53,860
There are many reasons.

1083
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,780
Tell me all.

1084
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,260
I want to know.

1085
01:12:59,060 --> 01:12:59,860
Okay.

1086
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:01,860
First,

1087
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:04,220
I don't want to go back and let Nang take care of me.

1088
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,100
If I go home,

1089
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,420
she will definitely come and make a mess.

1090
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,620
Isn't it good?

1091
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,300
Paeng.

1092
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,300
What's the second reason?

1093
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,060
The second reason is

1094
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,940
that I'm worried about you.

1095
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,380
I think we are still in danger.

1096
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,780
And the third reason,

1097
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,180
I don't want to be with others.

1098
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,460
I want to be...

1099
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,940
Well, I don't want to hear this.

1100
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,740
This is the most important reason.

1101
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,100
Brother Arthit!

1102
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,740
Why did you shout?

1103
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:48,940
I'm right in front of you.

1104
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:50,980
You are fooling me.

1105
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,060
Am I?

1106
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:54,980
Look at me.

1107
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,060
Then, tell me.

1108
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,100
Am I fooling you?

1109
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,860
I got it.

1110
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,340
You got shot.

1111
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,500
You might also be hit in the head.

1112
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:13,180
You may be schizophrenic now.

1113
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:16,540
You surely have a concussion.

1114
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:20,020
You've changed the way you call yourself.

1115
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,180
You call yourself Brother Arthit in front of me.

1116
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,620
You've been different since you woke up.

1117
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,060
Have you noticed that?

1118
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,300
Of course, I do.

1119
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,060
I'm not as crazy as you.

1120
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,020
Brother Arthit.

1121
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,100
Listen to me.

1122
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:41,060
Okay.

1123
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,060
I'm listening.

1124
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,180
I'll explain it to you.

1125
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,300
Actually,

1126
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,020
you hate me.

1127
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:57,740
I hated you.

1128
01:14:59,020 --> 01:14:59,900
Yes.

1129
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,660
You hate me.

1130
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,380
Yes.

1131
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,380
But I don't hate you anymore.

1132
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,140
If I hate you,

1133
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,020
I won't do this.

1134
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:24,940
Brother Arthit.

1135
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,020
I think you need to see a psychiatrist.

1136
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:28,060
I'm fine.

1137
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,420
You're not.

1138
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,660
Whatever.

1139
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:38,820
Let me go.

1140
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:44,900
Brother Arthit.

1141
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,900
Let me make it clear.

1142
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,340
If you remember everything after you've recovered,

1143
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,220
you can't blame me for these.

1144
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,260
It's you

1145
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,060
who have brought me here.

1146
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:55,620
You're holding me.

1147
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,220
I didn't take the initiative.

1148
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:57,740
Yes.

1149
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,100
If you turn back to who you were,

1150
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,700
you must remember what you have done.

1151
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,020
I will remember that it's me

1152
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:44,260
who kiss you this time.

1153
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:45,900
You didn't take the initiative.

It's me, Dad.

1167
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:32,500
Arthit.

1168
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,740
Tell me now, where are you?

1169
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,860
Your mother is so worried.

1170
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,780
I'm in another province.

1171
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,620
How did you get there?

1172
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,180
You haven't recovered yet.

1173
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:44,500
Who is going to take care of you?

1174
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:46,740
I've brought Paeng with me, Dad.

1175
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,180
You took Paeng with you?

1176
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:51,900
Yes.

1177
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,820
I want to take leave for four or five days.

1178
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,340
Why didn't you give us a call?

1179
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:59,380
Alright.

1180
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,460
I understand it.

1181
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:02,780
What I can't understand

1182
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:04,860
is why you took Paeng with you.

1183
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:08,380
She's going to take care of me.

1184
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,060
Are you worried about Paeng?

1185
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,500
I'm also worried about her, Dad.

1186
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:16,700
That's good.

1187
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:18,380
You admitted it.

1188
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,060
Anyway,

1189
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,460
you have to respect her.

1190
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,500
Oh, Dad.

1191
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,260
You sound like I'm a bad person.

1192
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,380
Since Paeng came back,

1193
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,100
you have always behaved badly in my eyes.

1194
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,220
Please go on.

1195
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,220
Now you know it.

1196
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,220
Paeng has changed.

1197
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,980
She's asking more now.

1198
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,180
Dad.

1199
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,380
Help me explain to Mom.

1200
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,140
Arthit.

1201
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,980
I am worried about you.

1202
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,780
I didn't expect

1203
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,940
you'd fall in love with Paeng.

1204
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,140
I didn't expect it, too, Dad.

1205
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,780
There will be a lot of trouble coming.

1206
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:11,940
I think we need to talk

1207
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,700
after you come back.

1208
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,380
Yes.

1209
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:19,380
That's all for now, Dad.

1210
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,780
You should ask before opening the door.

1211
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:48,460
What if it is someone else?

1212
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:51,260
There are only two of us.

1213
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,140
It'd be a ghost if it weren't you.

1214
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:54,980
I'm telling you

1215
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,420
that you have to be careful.

1216
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,380
Alright.

1217
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:01,380
Hold on.

1218
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,620
Brother Arthit.

1219
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:13,380
What's up?

1220
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,540
I want to take a bath.

1221
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,540
Go ahead, why do you tell me?

1222
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,820
Also, what are you doing in my room?

1223
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:24,540
I...

1224
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,700
I can't take off my shirt.

1225
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,260
My wound hurts.

1226
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:30,620
Oh.

1227
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,300
How did you put on the shirt then?

1228
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:35,180
I don't know. I was too anxious.

1229
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,020
Sit down slowly.

1230
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,940
Raise your arms slowly.

1231
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,060
Raise your arms slowly.

1232
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:44,460
Brother Arthit, hold your arm.

1233
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,220
Ouch.

1234
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:02,660
Done!

1235
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:09,020
Are you happy to manage to take off a man's clothes?

1236
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:10,900
Are you crazy?

1237
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,180
Brother Arthit.

1238
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,340
You can take a bath now.

1239
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:28,860
What's up?

1240
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,100
Are you shy?

1241
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:38,260
Whoever sees a man undressing

1242
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,220
will be shy.

1243
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:44,820
You weren't shy before.

1244
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:53,780
What?

1245
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:57,660
Wear your shirt.

1246
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:01,660
Let me help you.

1247
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:03,460
Don't be shy.

1248
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,460
I'll wear it myself.

1249
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,140
Brother Arthit!

1250
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:17,500
Does fooling me make you happy?

1251
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,900
Hey, hold on, I was wrong!

1252
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:23,620
I won't do this again.

1253
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,100
I'm sorry.

1254
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:37,020
Does your wound hurt?

1255
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:41,340
It doesn't hurt

1256
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:42,660
when you show me your concern.

1257
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:49,860
I'm glad that you're worried about me.

1258
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:52,740
In this case, come and take care of me.

1259
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,020
Sure.

1260
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:03,180
Paeng.

1261
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:05,780
What are you thinking?

1262
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:08,940
Nothing.

1263
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:10,580
Then,

1264
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:12,380
can you take a bath now?

1265
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:18,180
I forgot.

1266
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,500
I can only wipe my body.

1267
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,660
Oh, can you do it yourself?

1268
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:25,100
Why?

1269
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,620
Do you want to help?

1270
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:28,780
I...

1271
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:31,100
If you can't do it yourself,

1272
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,540
I can't only help.

1273
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,220
Uh...

1274
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:45,220
I think

1275
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,220
I'll do it myself.

1276
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:49,460
Why?

1277
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,980
Are you being shy now?

1278
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,260
Brother Arthit.

1279
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,820
Let me help you.

1280
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,500
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

1281
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:00,860
Brother Arthit.

1282
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,620
I said I'd help you.

1283
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,140
Don't be stubborn.

1284
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:08,940
Sit down.

1285
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,380
Hurry up, Paeng.

1286
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:25,700
Are you done yet?

1287
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:27,620
Brother Arthit.

1288
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,020
What's the matter with you?

1289
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:30,220
Why have you been urging me?

1290
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,940
I'm cleaning your body to make you comfortable.

1291
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:33,220
You should thank me.

1292
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:35,220
You won't understand.

1293
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:38,340
I can never understand

1294
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,140
a nitpicker like you.

1295
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,500
You're a nitpicker like me, too.

1296
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:46,380
It's because I've been spending time with you.

1297
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:49,020
I surely have to be a good arguer like you.

1298
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:55,300
Ouch!

1299
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:57,420
I'm sorry.

1300
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,060
I'll be gentle.

1301
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,060
I really want to kiss you again.

1302
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,620
I'm kind enough to take care of you

1303
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,900
but you're fooling me.

1304
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,340
Brother Arthit, your arm

1305
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:42,900
also makes my heart beat faster.

1306
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,580
Do you want to kiss me?

1307
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:12,900
You fooled me and I'm getting back at you.

1308
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,300
I won't play dirty.

1309
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:42,020
Uh...

1310
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,260
You seduced me first.

1311
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,180
If you don't play dirty,

1312
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,380
you can kiss me back.
