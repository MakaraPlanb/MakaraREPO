I dare not belittle you to guess your thoughts.

I'm not sure.

116
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,330
I saved you before,

117
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,210
so I count on you to be grateful and risk your life for me. That is like a joke.

118

The master will always change.

126
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,480
The cave master of Qianyue Cave is passed down through generations.

127
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,400
Someone terrorized others with sheer force and won victoriously without even going to the battle.

128
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,200
Some others killed all the old subordinates and monopolized authority.

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,900
one day when I need you to choose,

131
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,150
you can try your best to preserve the reputation of Qianyue Cave,

132
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,450
instead of guarding your love,

133
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,600

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,610
Bu'er has set up a banquet and sent the invitation to all of us.

138
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,600
I surmise that he wants to ignite the fuse

139
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,000
and let us experience the impact of this ignition together.

140
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,400
Let's not attend this kind of dinner where this treachery is planned.

141
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,480
Can't.

142
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,520
We, the Fengming Mountain Manor, should attend the banquet with dignity.

143
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,020
This way, we can expose the conspiracy of Bu'er to the whole world.

144
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,730
Shangguan Qiu Yue is seriously injured so the Demon Sect is without a leader.

145
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,520
Bu'er has no one to rely on.

146
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,250
It's the best time to attack him.

147
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,460
However, we still haven't found the evidence to prove Bu'er is Master Shi.

148
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,610
That's right! We collaborated with Li Yu and we already searched almost all of Baxian Residence.

149
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,680
Earlier, we were brainwashed that

150
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,800
Master Bu'er is kind and has clean hands.

151
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,410
He is the backbone of Baxian City.

152
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,870
In the big picture, we should adapt ourselves to changing circumstances.

153
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,210
If we first detain Bu'er and then go to find evidence, that would also be another way.

154
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,570
The whole Baxian Residence respects Master Bu'er very much.

155
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,190
I'm afraid if we do this, it's not very convincing and might even cause a riot.

156
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,550
So let's not consider this right now.

157
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,170
We should catch Bu'er and disclose the Demon Sect's conspiracy.

158
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,080
Then we clean up the Qianyue Sect in one sweep.

159
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,990
This way, we can force them to disclose where Shangguan Qiu Yue is.

160
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,390
After then, we will be able to help Miss Chun Hua get rid of her poison.

161
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,220
Shangguan Qiu Yue?

162
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,200
Shangguan Qiu Yue! You're still alive!

163
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,510
You must still be alive, aren't you?

164
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,370
Is it fun to mock me like this?

165
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,860
I am a coward.

166
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,340
If it wasn't for the fact that I'm so scared of death, I wouldn't necessarily want to be with you.

167
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,300
Isn't it just a poison of love?

168
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,860
Just wait for ten days, at most half a month, and I'll forget you.

169
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,960
I will live happily on my own.

170
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,230
Shangguan Qiu Yue,

171
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,030
why don't you just stay in that ice cold place alone?

172
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,740
Miss Chun Hua!

173
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,930
Miss Chun Hua, you are ill.

174
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,090
Why are you still wandering around?

175
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,560
I went out to clear my mind.

176
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,140
You must not know that the roads are not safe these days.

177
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,150
What happened that's so serious?

178
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,220
Baxian Residence wanted to use this messy situation to cause trouble.

179
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,580
I came to discuss a countermeasure with Miss Feng.

180
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,380
Three days later, Master Bu'er will invite you to a banquet.

181
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,670
There will be Soft Muscle Powder poison in all the food.

182
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,020
Xiao Chun Hua, you shouldn't eat.

183
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,940
If you get poisoned additionally,

184
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,580
I can no longer save you.

185
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,470
Oh right! Will Master Bu'er entertain us tomorrow?

186
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,040
Yes, all the invitation already went out.

187
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,350
I am here to discuss this.

188
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,400
He will put Soft Muscle Powder poison in the food.

189
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,840
Miss Chun Hua, how do you know about this?

190
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,530
Yes. How would I know?

191
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,200
It is not convenient for me to tell Xiao Bai this.

192
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,930
You are from Baxian Residence so you should tell him.

193
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,710
Sure, Miss Chun Hua.

194
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,360
If it's true about the poison,

195
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,430
it will be very helpful to Young Chief Master.

196
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,200
With a lady like you by Young Master's side, he must be very lucky.

197
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,050
Anyway, I am about to die.

198
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,620
How can you say such a thing?

199
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,390
Do not worry! I have been studying all the medical texts.

200
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,350
I believe he will find your antidote very soon.

201
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,970
if you have time, why don't you look for the evidence that Bu'er is Master Shi?

202
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,020
How can I do this? Young Chief Master is also urging me to do this.

203
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,620
Oh yes! Miss Chun Hua, I meet a guest at the tea house tomorrow.

204
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,850
If you want some company, you can also join me.

205
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,460
There are so many good people in this world.

206
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,660
Why do I worry about the only demon?

207
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,000
[Baxian Restaurant]

208
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,120
Young Master, I will be back soon.

209
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,710
This Young Master Zhou is very difficult to get along with.

210
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,080
He is normally very lascivious.

211
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,850
When he comes to the restaurant, he even flirts with my mother.

212
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,150
However, it was so different today.

213
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,890
He didn't utter a single word the entire trip, it's like he has changed into a different person.

214
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,180
It's probably...

215
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,980
Perhaps there might be something that triggered the change.

216
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,920
You know! People, they are bound to change.

217
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,700
You are right! Then, I'll take my leave now.

218
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,160
- Miss Chun Hua, just wait for my news here. 
 - Sure.

219
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,080
 It seemed like he has changed into a different person overnight. 

220
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,970
He is not Young Master Zhou.

221
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,350
Is he Shangguan Qiu Yue who altered his appearance and voice? 

222
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,810
He is...

223
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,550
He is...

224
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,710
Shangguan Qiu Yue!

225
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,150
Miss Chun Hua.

226
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,220
Miss Chun Hua, my client has left.

227
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,000
Let's—

228
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,590
Miss Chun Hua?

229
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,010
Shangguan Qiu Yue, you are still alive.

230
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,810
Do you really hate me that much? 

231
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,280
Chun Hua?

232
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,940
You are awake.

233
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,870
Miss Chun Hua, I have prescribed something different for your pain.

234
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,870
How could a trip to the restaurant make your illness worse?

235
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,370
It was my fault.

236
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,550
Chun Hua, if you want to go clear your mind,

237
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:47,440
after this battle is over, I will accompany  you anywhere.

238
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,900
Then I'll decoct Miss Chun Hua's medication.

239
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,440
- Miss Feng, I will go with you. 
 - Okay.

240
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,090
A moment, please!

241
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,350
Young Master Li.

242
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,800
At the restaurant,

243
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,340
who did you meet?

244
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:30,110
How about we'll do this! Why don't you describe your interesting client to entertain Miss Chun Hua?

245
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,530
That man is Young Master Zhou, the most famous wood business family in Baxian City.

246
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,960
These years, the wood Bu'er used for his house renovation are all from him.

247
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,440
Today, he suddenly asked me to meet him, asking

248
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,050
if the wood of Baxian Residence is still fine.

249
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,880
What do you mean he suddenly invited you?

250
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,220
Yes.

251
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,530
However, it wasn't all that strange.

252
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,910
Regarding the pillars Bu'er used in the mansion...

253
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:05,040
That time, I have also kept the best load of lumber from the southwest and already sent them to Bu'er. 

254
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,400
You have very good taste! Master Bu'er really liked that delivery.

255
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,570
He used those for the long corridor specially. 

256
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,060
Even to clean, he also does that by himself.

257
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:26,800
That is Miss Chun Hua, Fengming Mountain Manor's Madam.

258
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,770
Her story is very sad.

259
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,530
Miss Chun Hua was poisoned

260
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,960
I fear her life is rapidly reaching its end.

261
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,230
As a doctor, I couldn't find any cure.

262
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,160
I can only see her deteriorate, day by day.

263
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,230
She has many capable men to help her.

264
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,200
You'd better think about how to help Bu'er.

265
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,630
[Three]

266
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,710
However, why did Master Zhou mention the pillars?

267
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,020
This is so strange.

268
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,810
That's true!

269
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,370
Every single piece of brick, tile, glass, and wood that Master Bu'er put in the mansion,

270
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,940
I checked all according to Miss Feng's instruction.

271
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,940
I didn't see anything different.

272
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,700
Then let's pay special attention to this at the banquet today.

273
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,890
Yes.

274
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,220
Did he disguise himself to show some clues to the Fengming Mountain Manor?

275
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,610
Or was he making even a bigger plan? 

276
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,960
However, in any case, he will never care for me again.

277
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,270
The pain medication must be very bitter.

278
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,470
I am so scared just thinking about it.

279
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,620
Miss Chun Hua, if you fear bitterness,

280
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,260
pain and death,

281
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:35,660
after I investigate and identify Master Shi, I will try my best to save you.

282
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,740
As long as I am alive, I will not let you die.

283
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,280
Miss Feng, don't forget my warning

284
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,530
about the food at the banquet.

285
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,660
I understand.

286
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,850
We shouldn't alienate each other.

287
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,800
Chun Hua,

288
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,270
you've lost so much weight.

289
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,500
In the past, you loved to eat.

290
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,580
So your shoulders used to be rounded and soft.

291
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,270
Is it bad that I've lost weight?

292
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,720
Mis Chun Hua, how you look, is all fine with me.

293
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,390
When all this is done,

294
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,360
and the poison in your body is gone,

295
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,760
you can do whatever you want.

296
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,120
What is wrong? Are you still not feeling well?

297
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,220
I worry about you going to the banquet.

298
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,690
But I'll worry more if you stay in this room alone.

299
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,890
I will go with you.

300
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,380
Chun Hua,

301
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,970
for your own sake,

302
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,980
just forget him and be with me instead.

♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

338
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,310
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

339
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,110
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

340
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:25,220
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

341
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,740
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

342
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,960
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,640
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

344
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,610
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
