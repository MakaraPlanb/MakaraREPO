[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,810
The Chuanqi Sect wants to exchange Miss Chun Hua for the Longevity Fruit. 

32
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,140
Up until yesterday,

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,660
Gorge Master Fu still naively thought Fengming Mountain Manor wouldn't dare to do

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,430
 such a shameless thing.

35
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,800
The Longevity fruit is fake.

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,210
I came here to stop you guys from falling into their trap.

37
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,240
They kidnapped Madam Yousi, you can kidnap me.

38
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,560
If you do not bring out Sisi, I will kill her!

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,860
 The Longevity fruit should be left for those who truly need it. 

40
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,220
We cannot tell everyone it is fake in order to keep it at Fengming Mountain Manor.

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,250
Between you and the martial arts circle, which one will Xiao Bai choose?

42

[Episode 25]

Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

44
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,030
I longingly remember that time in the very beginning, when you would always want to act flirtatiously with me.

45
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,970
 I won't let go. 

46
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,820
Unless... 

47
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,370
you flirt with me, then my illness will be better.

48
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,170
I do not remember such a thing.

49
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,200
It is better to be a sister,

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,450
memories that you do not want to remember or past feelings that you do not want to feel,

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,340
can all be willed away.

52
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,240
You can choose to not remember everything, but I cannot.

53
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,010
I must be responsible for helping you remember.

54
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,170
The Longevity fruit was something we initially concocted.

55
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,230
It's simply because we wanted to destroy it in front of everyone.

56
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,510
Did you already know about this?

57
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,130
If you do not want me to know, then I won't.

58
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,110
If you think I knew, then I must pretend that I knew.

59
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,690
You haven't uttered a single sentence with sincere words.

60
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,390
The Longevity fruit is everywhere.

61
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,400
Everyone is trying to get it.

62
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,130
So, besides the trap for Fengming Mountain Manor,

63
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,990
do you have any other traps?

64
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,410
Are you here to protect me or are you here to see the commotion that the Longevity fruit is creating?

65
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:38,700
Or are you here to see how many people are willing to die or kill for this fruit?

66
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,230
Or to see how many idiots you can fool?

67
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,070
Xiao Chun Hua, you no longer believe me.

68
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,940
So it does not matter if I confirm or deny it, I will always be in the wrong.

69
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,440
Then just tell me the truth.

70
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,990
Xiao Chun Hua is becoming obsessive again.

71
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,870
Actually, the whole world has these thrilling sights

72
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,480
because the greed of man makes it so.

73
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,110
However, my desire to protect you is real.

74
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,340
Well then, is Fu Lou's intent to protect Yousi, greed as well?

75
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,250
Or shall I say,

76
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,440
you have no feelings of greed?

77
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,060
Xiao Chun Hua have changed.

78
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,370
You are no longer like your past self.

79
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,750
The previous Xiao Chun Hua would every day only think about how to act flirtatiously with Xiao Bai and me.

80
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,640
Well, I suppose that you were warm-hearted, good, and kind, like a fool.

81
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,740
How is it that now, you do not believe anything?

82
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,770
In all actuality,

83
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,770
I came to this world as passionate as fire.

84
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,420
I wanted to find true love.

85
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,390
Regardless, in spite of everything, I wildly ran all the way toward my goal.

86
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,700
When I achieved my goal,

87
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,480
my heart,

88
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,360
I don't know how it has become cold.

89
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,950
It seems like you have also discovered that you are not like before.

90
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,040
I guess this is also a good thing.

91
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,670
The simple and pure Xiao Chun Hua is nice.

92
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,130
The deep and thinking Xiao Chun Hua is also nice.

93
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,430
Both are cute! I like them both.

94
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,970
Tomorrow, everything should come to light.

95
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,130
I encourage you to open your eyes wide to watch carefully.

96
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,100
Chun Hua, you...

97
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,310
Are you feeling better?

98
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,330
Let's elope.

99
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,230
In the past,

100
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,700
I was undoubtedly suspected of killing the Healer.

101
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,890
Why did you still take me into the Fengming Mountain Manor?

102
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,970
Since I was young, my father always taught me

103
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,310
that the Fengming Mountain Manor has the responsibility to the whole world's martial arts circle.

104
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,110
We must punish wicked people, get rid of evil, and support those small and weak.

105
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,560
Miss Chun Hua, you do not know martial arts.

106
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,080
Therefore, you would not possess murderous intent.

107
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,740
I even indiscriminately called you, Husband.

108
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,400
I brazenly and without reason returned to Fengming Mountain Manor with you.

109
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,340
You never kicked me out or found me to be a burden.

110
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,720
Miss Chun Hua, you are different from any of the girls I had met.

111
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,000
Although you may not have known any manners,

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,160
your heart was pure.

113
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,990
You were cute and warm-hearted.

114
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,620
I really liked you.

115
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,150
Moreover, you are still Hua Xiao Lei,

116
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,910
my fiancée.

117
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,640
I knew the skill of fake voices.

118
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,770
No one knew where I came from and I loved to make trouble.

119
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,030
You were constantly partial toward me.

120
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,120
You tolerated me.

121
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,170
At that time,

122
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,610
I really thought I obtained true love.

123
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,640
Chun Hua,

124
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,960
I will always accept you and protect you.

125
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,390
I really do not know what is wrong with me.

126
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,330
I didn't get what I wanted.

127
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,400
I got what I didn't want.

128
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,600
Xiao Bai,

129
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,700
Fu Luo trusts you so much.

130
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,000
You must promise to keep them safe tomorrow.

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,530
My father taught me that

132
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,100
it is my mission to maintain peace and justice in the martial arts world.

133
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,520
Father said...

134
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,500
Father taugh...

135
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,150
 Father said, 

136
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:37,340
"Those who think for the greater good will be granted the strength of the four seas;

137
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,390
otherwise, it is just speaking empty words."

138
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,790
Chun Hua says, 

139
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,000
"If you cannot even hold a girl in your heart, how can you take care of the greater good?"

140
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,050
Nothing has changed.

141
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,120
You are still the Chun Hua I love.

142
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,220
This is such an obvious trap.

143
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,420
Only Fu Lou who is desperate for a cure would believe it,

144
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,670
but he still trusts and believes in you.

145
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,220
So Xiao Bai,

146
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,110
you must make sure they are safe tomorrow.

147
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,700
I want to hear you give me your words.

148
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,510
That is ignoring that the two of them are of the demon sects.

149
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,590
If they can be exchanged for peace in the pugilist world,

150
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,590
then their death will be worth it.

151
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,740
But what if...

152
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,470
What if it is not the Longevity fruit or Luosi,

153
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,680
but me whom you must be sacrificed to get the peace you want.

154
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,170
What would you choose?

155
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,570
I will not let that happen.

156
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,940
You always sound so confident about success.

157
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,470
Will he really come?

158
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,630
I am also not sure.

159
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,130
Young Chief Master Xiao.

160
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,540
Gorge Master Fu indeed came as planned.

161
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,560
A man honors his words.

162
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,040
I am the same.

163
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,030
Wait!

164
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,940
Young Chief Master Xiao.

165
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,910
Gorge Master Fu's Book of One's Crimes really is sincere.

166
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,950
According to the rules, the Longevity fruit

167
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,810
should belong to Gorge Master Fu.

168
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,610
Fu Lou! Don't you dare leave like this.

169
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,790
Stop! Fengming Mountain Manor

170
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,070
should honor the deal we have with Fu Lou.

171
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,170
Don't you dare think you will obtain the Longevity Fruit!

172
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,690
Don't you dare leave! Take the Longevity fruit!

173
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,500
Masters, please rest assured!

174
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,880
Fu Lou personally promised,

175
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,620
after this, he will offer his life as penance.

176
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,220
Thank you, Miss Chun Hua, for staying with me while I wait for my husband.

177
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,310
Madam Fu,

178
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,800
You are... Cave Master Shangguan?

179
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,430
This demeanor,

180
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,380
you must be Shangguan Qiu Yue.

181
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,180
Cave Master Shangguan,

182
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,620
why don't you have a nice chat with Miss Chun Hua?

183
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,130
I still need to check for why my husband is not back yet.

184
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,880
Why are you here?

185
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,530
I know that you are nervous, so I rushed here as soon as I could.

186
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,960
You are here only to see the commotion.

187
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,720
Of course, if there is commotion to be seen, that would be better.

188
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,920
But it would still be the best if I can take you back to  Qianyue Cave.

189
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,960
I really hate all of you who are so full of yourselves.

190
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,440
It sounds like Xiao Bai angered you once again.

191
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,490
Xiao Bai is like this because he wants to help the greater good.

192
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,840
Even if I am unhappy,

193
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,940
I must endure it alone.

194
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,110
- What about you? 
 - Me?

195
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,990
I can promise to not let you suffer.

196
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,400
So what are you here for?

197
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,350
Rest assured, Xiao Chun Hua! I will surely not intervene.

198
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,690
In order to ensure that Xiao Bai won't mess up when he sees me,

199
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,900
I will only observe from afar.

200
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,450
However, my Xiao Chun Hua,

201
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,800
just don't forget our bet!

202
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,490
Husband!

203
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,090
Sisi!

204
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,710
Here! Come and sit down.

205
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,550
You are home?

206
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,670
Look what I brought!

207
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,730
The Longevity fruit.

208
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,730
Did you go to the Longevity fruit meeting?

209
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,490
Did they make things hard for you?

210
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,160
They are willing to use the Longevity Fruit to save your life.

211
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,380
I know that Miss Chun Hua and Young Master Xiao

212
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,730
are both good people.

213
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,940
In the past, you always complained about how boring it was to be trapped in the gorge.

214
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,380
Once we cure the poison in your body,

215
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,980
we can go explore all the beautiful sights of the world.

216
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,150
We can also learn about all the food all over the world

217
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,800
and make it for you to eat. How does that sound?

218
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,340
I was just saying that casually.

219
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,950
Do you remember that?

220
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,550
Anything you say,

221
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,070
I remember them all.

222
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,960
Sisi, once I have talked things over with them,

223
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,260
I will come back to see you.

224
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,580
Fu Lou, your promise must be fulfilled.

225
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,710
When the night of the full moon comes,

226
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,510
after Sisi has consumed the Longevity fruit,

227
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,050
I will offer myself.

228
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,100
There is nothing to hide in my Book of One's Crimes.

229
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,810
Good!

230
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,360
All the names on this list

231
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,200
are people you have killed.

232
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,320
[Names of those killed by Fu Lou]

233
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,320
Fu Lou,

234
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,090
you petty man!

235
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,850
Why is my father's name not on this list?

236
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,930
I don't have a heart to repent for crimes,

237
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,830
but I would never lie.

238
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,430
You purposefully left out Feng Qian Wei.

239
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,810
- I did not kill him. 
 - You are lying.

240
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,710
As for you, it seems like you still don't know

241
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,810
that your good father was the one who

242
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,740
killed the Healer.

243
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,120
How can that be?

244
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,050
He slipped into Baxian Residence but failed to locate the Longevity fruit.

245
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,970
He was worried that his motives would be revealed,

246
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,700
so he killed the healer.

247
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,010
Unfortunately, I bore witness to this by chance.

248
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,550
I do not believe you.

249
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,340
Gorge Master, I

250
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,330
don't really care whether you believe it.

251
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,050
As for the person who killed Feng Qian Wei,

252
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,530
I also know his identity.

253
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,390
Fu Lou, do you dare continue to shamefully boast?

254
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,130
Even if you didn't kill Feng Qian Wei, the number of deaths written on paper,

255
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,400
how many can you truly face?

256
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,280
There is someone who can support my claim that I am not lying.

257
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:56,210
This time, I will do what you ask.

258
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:01,020
However, you must promise me that you won't harm any additional person.

259
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,480
I agree.

260
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,210
Don't!

261
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,460
Do not make any sudden movements.

262
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,250
We don't want Miss Chun Hua to get hurt.

263
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,520
Speak!

264
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,340
Feng Chen Wei,

265
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,510
did he once lie to his daughter and kidnapped you only to bring you to me?

266
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,450
Fu Lou has committed innumerable murders all his life,

267
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,470
but since I earnestly obtained the Longevity fruit to protect Sisi,

268
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,660
I will most definitely not lie or miss a single person.

269
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,360
In a few hours, my wife will consume the Longevity fruit.

270
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,590
After Fengming Mountain Manor agrees to her protection,

271
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,520
I will naturally come and face my crimes!

272
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,990
Miss Chun Hua, I have something to ask of you.

273
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,120
As a man, I must take responsibility for my actions.

274
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,520
I beg of you to protect my Sisi.

275
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,590
Take her away!

276
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,800
All right. I promise you.

277
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,010
This is the token of the Chuanqi Sect.

278
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,050
You can pass this on to Shangguan Qiu Yue, or you can give it...

279
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,900
give it to Xiao Bai

280
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,230
as long as it can protect Sisi.

281
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,620
[Order] (Chuanqi Sect's command seal)

282
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,180
But didn't you also promise your wife to protect her?

283
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,220
I am begging you,

284
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,430
please be by my wife's side always.

285
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,330
A major incident like the Book of One's Crimes,

286
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,770
how can you not invite Qianyue Sect to observe?

287
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,130
Shangguan Qiu Yue!

288
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,550
Young Chief Master Xiao, the perpetrator is in front of us.

289
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,910
Be careful of those who secretly try to reap the benefits.

290
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,060
Fu Lou has repented for his sins in exchange for the Longevity fruit.

291
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,000
He is heading toward the path of goodness.

292
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,760
I hope Cave Master Shangguan

293
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,360
will observe without interruption.

294
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:51,470
Young Chief Master Xiao, I was disrespectful.

295
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,750
Fengming Mountain Sect had honorable intentions.

296
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,000
I, Shangguan Qiu Yue, admire that.

297
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,530
Gorge Master Fu is really open and honest about his crimes.

298
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,660
I almost thought you were also a member of Fengming Mountain Manor.

299
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,780
Of course, Gorge Master Fu is also open about killing people,

300
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,380
so there shouldn't be any innocent people who died for nothing.

301
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,180
What do you think Chief Leng?

302
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,850
I am also curious about the names on the Book of One's Crimes.

303
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,320
Then tell me, who killed my father?

304
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,420
Miss Feng is very expressive.

305
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:28,530
The person who killed your father is definitely not me amongst the people here.

306
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,770
You are all too impatient.

307
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,410
This takes place under the full moon, yet the sun is still out.

308
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,680
I will not stay here to play with you guys anymore.

309
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,940
When the full moon is out, I will come to observe.

310
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,750
Gorge Master Fu,

311
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,030
can you tell me

312
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,670
who killed my father?

313
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:07,550
Miss Feng, what more can you discuss with this murderer?

314
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,850
Fu Lou, you committed so many crimes.

315
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,310
I have so many disciples who died at your hands.

316
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,750
Your life is forfeited. Go!

317
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,920
Someone once begged me not to harm any additional person

318
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,410
but if you all want to die,

319
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,720
I won't stop you.

320
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,890
Miss Chun Hua,

321
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,570
I heard my husband's voice.

322
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,940
They are...

323
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,070
They are just negotiating.

324
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,740
When the full moon comes—

325
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,690
I know.

326
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,120
It isn't a negotiation.

327
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,120
They are out to kill.

328
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,840
Miss Chun Hua.

329
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,260
I want to be by his side.

330

♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

348
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:47,850
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

349
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,680
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

350
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,180
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking it's eye  ♫

351
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:00,330
♫  Seeing through the fickleness of love  ♫

352
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,400
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

353
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,650
♫  It's such a pity for not stepping forward  ♫

354
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,770
♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

355
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:18,600
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

356
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:25,140
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

357
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,320
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

358
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,160
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

359
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,620
♫  It's hard to walk on, there's even no one to argue with  ♫

360
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,700
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

361
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,050
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

362
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,970
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

363
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:56,020
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

364
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,810
♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of the spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

365
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,960
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

366
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,780
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

367
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,290
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

368
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,380
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

369
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,770
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

370
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,600
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

371
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:45,950
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
