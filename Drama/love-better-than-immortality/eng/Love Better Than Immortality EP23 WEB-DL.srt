[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,220
However, I was obviously lead through this way previously.

32
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,810
How is it that I cannot find the route now?

33
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,470
You tried to poison my food and arranged someone to come and kill me.

34
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,220
Xiao Bai, do you really want me to die so badly?

35
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,360
I need to return to Fengming Mountain Manor to get to the bottom of this.

36
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,050
As much as I want to give you freedom, I also want to protect you.

37
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,770
By keeping someone locked beside you and only allowing them to do what you want them to do.

38
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,940
is that really still considered as freedom?

39
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,570
Xiao Chun Hua, rest assured! I will never harm you.

40
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,070
Qianyue Cave is constantly going against Fengming Mountain Manor. Why is this so? 

41
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,160
I fear that it could be the difficulty of staying away from feelings.

42
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,420
We need to quickly find Miss Chun Hua.

43
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,270
[Episode 23]

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,550
If others saw the master of Qianyue Cave combing my hair, they will laugh at me.

45
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,160
Whoever dares to joke about this, I will kill him.

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,140
Then why don't you just kill me?

47
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,990
Could it be...

48
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,450
that I still possess something that you can use to your advantage?

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,550
You're not an exceptional martial art master, nor are you in any important position.

50
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,920
What possible use do I have for you?

51
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,400
Previously, I just wanted you to help me steal the Xin Fa.

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,970
I mistook you for Hua Xiaolei.

53
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,320
Later, Xiao Bai mastered the last stage of the Fengming Saber skill.

54
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,330
Then the Xin Fa has long become unimportant to me.

55
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,800
Now, I just want to protect you for life.

56
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,740
I don't want you to protect me for life.

57
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,420
I just wish you would graciously lift your hands and let me go.

58
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,840
Let you go back to Fengming Mountain Manor?

59
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,030
Little Sister, Xiao Bai wants to kill you.

60
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,180
Even in my Qianyue Cave, he dared to have murderous intentions.

61
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,850
If I let you go back,

62
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,230
won't you be heading towards your death?

63
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,350
I believe in Xiao Bai.

64
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,380
What exactly is so good about Xiao Bai

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,870
to allow you to be so loyal to him?

66
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,420
I want true love.

67
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,210
Xiao Bai is the first person I've chosen to love.

68
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,920
Little Sister,

69
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,590
you are too stubborn.

70
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,790
There are so many well-paved paths for you to walk upon in this world.

71
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,600
Why must you go down the wrong path?

Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

73
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,660
Older Brother, you gave this ice silk pearl to me,

74
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,960
using it to tie me up.

75
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,680
Now I will

76
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,130
return it to you.

77
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,100
Please, Older Brother,

78
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,420
give me a path to live.

79
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,160
Look!

80
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,330
How have you been calling me?

81
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,240
In your normal daily life, how often do you rely on me?

82
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,910
This pearl has seen it all.

83
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,750
I thank you for your protection.

84
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,200
It is just that we are no longer children.

85
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,680
It is time

86
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,760
for us to look for our own paths and homes.

87
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,810
My little sister has grown up.

88
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,930
Escort her out!

89
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,860
Miss Chun Hua, since you have already decided,

90
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,420
then please leave.

91
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,570
Master.

92
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,320
Did you send her off?

93
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,270
Yes.

94
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,280
Is Yousi of Chuanqi Gorge not going to make it soon?

95
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,910
Yes.

96
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,050
The matter of Gorge Master Fu loving his wife to death has been hidden well.

97
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,580
Spread the news of You Si's illness to the public.

98
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,730
Young Chief Master!

99
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,250
Miss Chun Hua is back.

100
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,260
Young Chief Master, please enter.

101
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,970
Chun Hua.

102
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,910
Let go!

103
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,350
Are you and Shangguan Qiu Yue...?

104
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,780
The first thing you do when you see me is to doubt me?

105
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,180
You...

106
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,290
Are you okay?

107
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,180
You are right! He asked me to come to steal the Xin Fa.

108
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,070
Shangguan Qiu Yue has seen the birthmark of Hua Xiaolei before.

109
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,100
It was also he who let me go on his own accord.

110
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,700
What is it? You think that I've sullied the name of Fengming Mountain Manor, thus you want to kill me?

111
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,180
Why would I?

112
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,760
I really went to Qianyue Sect to look for you but–

113
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,490
So because you couldn't find me you sent a spy to kill me?

114
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,140
What?

115
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,900
Why would I want to kill you?

116
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,730
I have always believed you and wanted to save you.

117
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,580
You have heard everything Shangguan Qiu Yue had to say.

118
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,640
How can you still believe me?

119
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,800
Do not lie to me!

120
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,610
I am not lying. I do believe you. Honestly!

121
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,250
Maybe Hua Xiaolei showed him the scars,

122
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,280
but it definitely isn't Chun Hua who has amnesia now, is it?

123
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,660
It was  Shangguan Qiu Yue who threatened you.

124
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,360
He made you come and steal the Xin Fa.

125
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,400
He made you believe him, didn't he?

126
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,760
I am willingly to give you the Xin Fa

127
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,160
but Shangguan Qiu Yue did not get the Xin Fa.

128
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,900
Isn't that right?

129
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,900
I gave him a fake one.

130
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,450
So how could I not believe you?

131
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,770
It is I who has wronged you

132
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,720
because earlier I did not know that you were being threatened by him.

133
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,300
I allowed you to bear the burden alone.

134
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,020
Then before this,

135
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,790
did you think that I've sullied the name of the Fengming Mountain Manor.

136
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,760
You sent Ling Yang to kill me.

137
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,600
I most definitely did not send Ling Yang to kill you.

138
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,490
I was waiting all this time for your return. Anxiously awaiting!

139
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,510
I waited for you to come back and tell me the truth

140
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,140
but suddenly, all the communication from there ceased.

141
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,430
Was it really not you?

142
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,130
I never gave such a command.

143
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,270
Caicai, just think,

144
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,520
how do you think Chun Hua came back?

145
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,850
The spy is dead.

146
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,610
If that big demon didn't let her go, how could she come back?

147
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,000
Then the relationship between them can't be so simple.

148
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,100
Maybe, this time she's back with crafty schemes.

149
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,500
In the future, when it comes to Miss Chun Hua,

150
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,420
we should just let the Young Chief Master deal with it.

151
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,520
Then do you believe that they have a secret affair between them?

152
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,500
We are outsiders.

153
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,500
The last time you were poisoned, everyone was at a loss.

154
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,600
Only Miss Chun Hua actually brought the antidote

155
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,200
and the antidote appeared everywhere afterward.

156
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,900
No matter what, she saved me.

157
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,070
In the future, anything that are relating to her,

158
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,530
only the Young Chief Master should deal with them.

159
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,860
How did it go? Did you have a good talk?

160
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,160
Chun Hua was truly used by  Shangguan Qiu Yue.

161
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,400
She did not betray Fengming Mountain Manor.

162
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,750
However, you still cannot be sure if Chun Hua and Shangguan Qiu Yue...

163
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,070
Is there really a secret affair?

164
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,910
I dare not probe into it,

165
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,530
but I do not believe there is.

166
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,500
Speaking of this, the antidote for the Dandelion

167
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,130
suddenly became common everywhere.

168
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,240
The leaf of the Longevity fruit, the antidote for the Dandelion,

169
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,890
if these all came from Qianyue Sect,

170
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,470
then Shangguan Qiu Yue might not be uninterested in the Longevity fruit.

171
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,980
Speaking of this,

172
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,040
Ling Yang wanted to harm her in Qianyue Cave.

173
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,890
Chun Hua would not lie about this.

174
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,260
The complications in between...

175
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,430
I'm not sure about what happened between Ling Yang and Chief Leng.

176
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,470
You had more interactions with Chief Leng before.

177
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,000
Brother Qin, please explain it to me.

178
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,870
Ling Yang only obeys Chief Leng.

179
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,250
Apart from this, if Ling Yang has other thoughts,

180
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,140
that could be a possibility.

181
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,250
No wonder Miss Chun Hua's return this time is much different from before.

182
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,410
Why don't you go and comfort her?

183
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,710
It seems like we still need to discuss this further.

184
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,530
I apologize for the disturbance, I will come back another time.

185
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,200
Chun Hua?

186
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,800
Please come and sit here.

187
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,790
Miss Chun Hua, we are discussing the news relating to the Longevity fruit.

188
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,520
I just wanted to come to see how everyone is.

189
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,740
Now I know.

190
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,650
I will be on my way.

191
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,660
Miss Chun Hua!

192
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,000
Miss Chun Hua, please wait a second.

193
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,230
Do not misunderstand!

194
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,860
I've become an awkward existence now.

195
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,270
Of course not! You are still the Young Chief Master's wife.

196
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,640
Young Master Qin, don't forget!

197
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,900
We have never had a wedding ceremony.

198
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,860
The wedding will happen sooner or later, but

199
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,200
the Young Chief Master's wife is different from other wives.

200
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,300
There are more responsibilities and sacrifices.

201
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,550
[Chuanqi Gorge]

202
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,070
Husband, you needn't worry about me.

203
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,600
It's only because I didn't put on any makeup,

204
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,210
thus my complexion is not so great.

205
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,670
Your complexion is not bad.

206
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,020
Sisi, you are still so pretty.

207
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,200
Longevity fruit!

208
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,370
You have to be real.

209
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,410
You have to let a person long plagued with sickness

210
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,610
become healthy again.

211
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,510
I don't care for longevity,

212
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,490
but the limited interactions,

213
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,400
you should grant this.

214
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,000
Ever since Xiao Chun Hua returned to the Fengming Mountain Manor,

215
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,940
has she been well?

216
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,610
From my investigations,

217
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,000
Miss Chun Hua's return to the Fengming Mountain Manor has not been widely known.

218
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,560
Is she so well protected or have you been manipulated?

219
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,610
I was careless.

220
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,330
Stand up!

221
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,200
I told you to get up!

222
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,200
Yes.

223
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,540
How is Lady Fu's condition?

224
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,290
She does not have long to live.

225
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,480
What should we do about this?

226
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,220
Fu Lou cherishes his wife like one cherishes their eyes.

227
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,900
This news is pretty widespread now, am I right?

228
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,010
It can be seen that there has been chatters in the streets.

229
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,010
Those who chatter about this aren't good people, either.

230
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,630
They're all waiting to compete with Lady Fu for the Longevity fruit.

231
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,060
I will arrange for this immediately.

232
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,800
Wait a minute!

233
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:45,080
It's not fun to simply strike with force.

234
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,860
I am really interested in seeing what these people who want to steal the Longevity fruit are willing to trade for it.

235
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,120
What do you think, Ye Yan?

236
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,330
The honorable sects all care about their reputation.

237
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,210
Those that are in danger are in dire need of power.

238
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,810
That sounds logical,

239
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:05,380
Then let them all speak their mind.

240
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,800
I will arrange for this immediately.

241
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:13,010
How about we call it 'Book of One's Crimes'?

242
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,820
That name sounds good. Go on!

243
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,540
Book of One's Crimes? Longevity fruit? What do you mean?

244
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,450
After the failure of burning the Longevity fruit at the wedding last time,

245
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,430
it was difficult to make everyone believe

246
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,850
that Miss Chun Hua took the Longevity fruit to Qianyue Sect.

247
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,370
We had a few days of peace at Fengming Mountain Manor.

248
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,170
However, from early this morning, many people from the pugilist world have come about this again.

249
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,900
Master Shi started something again?

250
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,990
Yes. He announced that the auction failed last time,

251
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,860
thus allowing Fengming Mountain Manor to freely gain the Longevity fruit.

252
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,830
He doesn't want to be involved in these matters.

253
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,200
He asked for Fengming Mountain Manor to burn the fruit in front of everyone,

254
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,740
to halt the thoughts of greed.

255
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,470
This explanation sounds very glorified but there is more.

256
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,500
He suggested that in order to uphold principles of goodwill,

257
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,580
the people should be open to confessing their crimes.

258
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,940
This Master Shi,

259
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,940
his schemes really are endless.

260
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,040
The promise of the Book of One's Crimes, those who confess

261
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,100
will get the Longevity fruit.

262
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,500
He hopes that someone will repent and absolve their sins in order to set a good example.

263
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,960
Supporting that path will open up to sinners who repent.

264
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,370
Why do I feel that he does not have such good intentions?

265
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,250
Yes, for sure he doesn't have these good intentions.

266
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,860
He mentioned on multiple occasions that the Longevity fruit is in the hands of Miss Chun Hua.

267
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,830
If we don't burn the fruit, then doubt will persist.

268
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,720
Also, he mentions that Fengming Mountain Manor follows through with their promises.

269
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,940
A place of leadership dating back to 100 years.

270
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,180
Fengming Mountain Manor is the best choice for this kind of procedural justice.

271
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,150
Burning the fruit in front of the public.

272
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,080
There was already much bloodshed at the auction.

273
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,910
Now, doubt is spreading to more people.

274
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,400
I don't want to cause more trouble.

275
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,870
How about... I go to clear up this misunderstanding?

276
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,650
No, the idea of the Book of One's Crimes is not bad.

277
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,990
I hope that those big demons do come out

278
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,940
and repent for their sins.

279
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,760
They can get the Longevity fruit and follow the path of goodness once and for all.

280
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,340
But who would be the best person for this role?

281
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,890
Burn the Longevity fruit!

282
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,710
Such a bewitching item should have been burned long ago.

283
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,510
Book of One's Crimes.

284
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,780
In the pugilist world, there are two big demons.

285
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,620
Shangguang Qiu Yue of Qianyue Sect and Fu Lou of Chuanqi Sect.

286
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,270
If Fu Lou can really repent for his crimes,

287
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,510
then it can also settle things regarding my father's death.

288
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,250
But once he admits it,

289
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,450
wouldn't my father have died for nothing?

290
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:20,560
The righteousness of the pugilist world, compared with personal grievances,

291
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,820
I will choose righteousness, of course.

292
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,840
I do not agree to this.

293
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,300
Book of One's Crimes?

294
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,840
The one who wants the Longevity fruit the most is Fu Lou.

295
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,280
He would do this without a second thought even if he thinks it is fake

296
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,170
but this is a trap.

297
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,220
Miss Chun Hua, how can you be so sure that

298
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,520
Fu Lou would fall for this without a second of doubt?

299
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,350
The most precious thing to Fu Lou is his wife.

300
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,810
His wife is currently very ill and needs this Longevity fruit the most,

301
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,870
but this Longevity fruit is fake.

302
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,140
Miss Chun Hua,

303
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,790
I once heard you say this before.

304
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:20,230
That's true! According to the rumors, Fu Lou's wife, You Si, is gravely ill.

305
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,120
Fu Lou has been worried over this.

306
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,960
This rumor coincidently matches with the existence of the Book of One's Crimes.

307
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,440
Could it be too good to be true?

308
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,920
I'm afraid his feelings... can't be compared to the absolute sincerity for Miss Leng.

309
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,090
Were you happy to return to Fengming Mountain Manor?

310
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,180
Is it because of Xiao Bai that you don't act flirtatiously with your brother?

311
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,100
Based on your reaction, does that mean you admit to it?

312
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,830
- Older Brother! 
 - I thought you never wanted to see me again, based on our last encounter.

313
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,230
Today, I passed by coincidently and found out that you were looking for the ice silkworm pearl.

314
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,610
- Older Brother, I was just really desperate! 
 - Look!

315
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,780
The one you think of when you're desperate is also your older brother.

316
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,270
If you return it to me again, you will never see me again.

317
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,500
Older Brother, can you take me to Chuanqi Gorge?

318
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,230
The Cave Master of Qianyue Sect committed so many crimes.

319
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,240
He never does anything out of goodwill.

320
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,810
But since it is your request,

321
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,180
then I must fulfill your request.

322
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,140
Do you really like Lady Fu?

323
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,880
She is a very nice lady.

324
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,710
No wonder you wanted me to ask her for help last time.

325
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,700
What good is it to have a weak heart?

326
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,420
Fu Lou was ultimately brought down by her.

327
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,710
If it was not for her,

328
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,700
Qianyua Sect, Chuanqi Sect, and Fengming Mountain Manor;

329
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,650
the situation of the three pillars wouldn't have persisted until now.

330
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,000
I've met Fu Lou.

331
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,900
Although he acted decisively and cruelly,

332
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,800
he definitely is not a brute nor an unconscionable person.

333
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,950
If he could find a woman to stay by his side at an earlier time,

334
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,690
he wouldn't be in this chaotic martial art world now.

335
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,630
However, he has found Madame You Si

336
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,460
who is soft-hearted and kind.

337
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,410
She is even in such a fragile health.

338
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,180
Fu Lou knows it,

339
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,480
that's why he doesn't let her go out of the valley to be seen easily.

340
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,580
However, Xiao Chun Hua is very special.

341
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,090
You were the first to notice Fu Lou's weakness.

342
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,730
Perhaps...

343
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,090
This is what made me give up immortality

344
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,490
and this is the love that I also want to find.

345
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,610
Don't hurt Fu Lou and Madam You Si.

346
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,580
If I wanted to do that, they wouldn't still be alive now.

347
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,870
You don't want to kill Fu Lou?

348
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,910
I don't want to.

349
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,040
Fu Lou must not die by my hands.

350
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,680
You are so right.

351
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,640
After all, Chuanqi Gorge is not that easy to deal with.

352
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,670
If you kill him, wouldn't you have another group of enemies?

353
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,830
I'm never afraid of too many enemies.

354
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,820
Besides, it is not that difficult to kill Fu Lou.

355
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:30,280
Older Brother, comparing you with Fu Lou, whose martial arts is better?

356
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Xiao Chun Hua, you don't need martial arts to kill Fu Lou.

357
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,940
The key is to know a person's weakness.

358
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,020
If you know his weakness,

359
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,480
he will be much easier to deal with.

360
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,490
Right! You have no weakness.

361
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,340
Older Brother has a weakness.

362
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,710
My weakness is you.

363
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,500
Be careful in the future!

364
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,380
This Yousi is easy to deal with,

365
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,650
but can Xiao Chun Hua deal with Fu Lou?

366
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,220
Master Fu Lou came very quickly.

367
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,230
Shangguan Qiu Yue,

368
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,090
did you spread the news about the Longevity fruit in Fengming Mountain Manor?

369
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,430
Making fun of others must be amusing?

370
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,370
I see Master Fu Lou is concerned about the chaos.

371
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:53,040
So you came to Chuanqi Gorge to make fun of me?

372
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,800
That is where you are wrong.

373
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,040
This time, I came here to help Master Fu Lou.

374
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,090
I've asked you to join forces before.

375
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,570
At that time, you flatly refused.

376
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,290
I don't believe that you can be so kind now.

377
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,200
I indeed don't have much kindness.

378
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,500
However, for my younger sister,

379
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,640
this time, I managed to squeeze out a little (kindness).

380
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,520
Your internal strength.

381
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,460
I already said it, Master Fu Lou.

382
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,490
It's more troublesome to make me to be an opponent than a helper.

383
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,340
The helper you mean... is her right?

384
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,590
It's me!

385
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,650
Since she hasn't the Longevity fruit, she is useless.

386
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,900
My younger sister is quite useful.

387
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:58,270
Gorge Master Fu, Fengming Mountain Manor is about to hold a Longevity fruit conference in these two days.

388
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,850
My younger sister happens to be Xiao's Bai fiancée.

389
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,130
Gorge Master Fu can use my younger sister in exchange for the Longevity fruit.

390
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,730
You are even so supportive.

391
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,480
Older Brother doesn't act for your consideration.

392
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:35,000
