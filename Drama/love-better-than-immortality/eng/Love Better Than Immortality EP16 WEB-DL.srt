Miss Chun Hua, I like you.

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,290
This confession, I'll accept it.

33
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,430
Everyone came for the Longevity fruit.

34
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,650
It's good that when you were in danger, you know to call me.

35
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,340
Having a passionate, unforgettable love is much better than immortality.

36
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,480
What's more important to Xiao Bai, you or the Fengming Saber? He still didn't decide yet.

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,710
Are you really certain of that?

38
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,680

This is my first time in Bishui City.

42
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,060
I have the pleasure of gathering together with all chiefs.

43
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,770
Indeed, I consider myself most fortunate.

44
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,340
Here! Let me take this opportunity to make a toast

45
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,350
and show my respect to you all.

46
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,160
Chief Qin, you are too modest.

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,510
Thank you so much, Chief Qin! I also got a blessing in disguise.

48
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,760
If it's not for my daughter...

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,750
It's best not to mention it. Never mind!

50
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,870
Everyone, here! Let's all have a drink.

51

No need to fear good wine!

55
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,650
- The third cup, I— 
 - Chief Qin.

56
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,610
Is the Young Chief Master still inside?

57
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,660
Did you not invite him to come give a few words?

58
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,160
Fine! Everyone, wait here for a moment.

59
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,340
Young Chief Master, please be calm.

60
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,720
We put missing person posters all over Bishui City.

61
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,310
Perhaps, Miss Chun Hua will return very soon.

62
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,670
I have troubled you, Miss Feng.

63
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,800
Young Chief Master, quickly come.

64

67
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,030
we saw each other at Fengming Mountain Manor just a few days ago.

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,830
Today, we presumably gather here in Bishui City for many different reasons.

69
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,020
We still have two more hours before the great Longevity fruit auction.

70
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,650
Evil and righteous martial arts paths wait for the opportune moment to take action.

71
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,130
As the Righteous Path, we should make law and order our top priority.

72
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,890
- I hope you all can— 
 - Well said.

73
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,630
Young Chief Master, what you said is quite reasonable.

74
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,370
If anyone has an interest in the Longevity fruit, please prepare your money.

75
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,860
- Let's compete fairly by the rules, all right? 
 - All right.

The auction will start soon. Be careful! That wine might be poisoned.

78
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,580
Many chiefs are here.

79
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,610
Did you inquire about Miss Chun Hua's whereabouts?

80
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,610
We won't be able to get anything out of these people.

81
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,730
Besides, I'm the Young Chief Master.

82
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,610
I should give priority to the bigger situation at hand.

83
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,300
How could I ask them to go and look for Miss Chun Hua

84
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,320
because of my personal romantic relationship?

85
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,150
Come, everyone!

86
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,990
We still have some time before the Longevity fruit auction.

87
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,530
Shall we eat and drink first?

88
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,920
- Come, come, come. 
 - Chief Tang, cheers!

89
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,700
- Come, everyone! 
 - Chief Qin.

90
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,530
It seems my father drank a lot. so he might tell me to go and drink with him.

91
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,260
Why don't I accompany you to go out for some fresh air?

92

It's noon now.

93

Chun... Miss Chun Hua.

- Naughty! 
 - Jewelry!

95
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,810
- Miss Chun Hua has good lucks. She will be fine. Don't worry! 
 - Young Master.

96
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,740
I have lots of fashionable jewelry here.

97
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,440
Will you buy one to give to your beloved?

98
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,300
We have many beautiful women.

99
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,210
Choose some nice ones for me.

100
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,590
Young Master, I only sell my jewelry to those who are destined.

101
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,020
You and I do not have a bond of destiny.

102
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,640
However, this Young Master seems very kind.

103
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,570
Your jewelry is truly first class.

104
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,650
You even seek those who are destined.

105
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,320
Here! I have a bracelet passed down through generations.

106
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,170
Young Master, are you interested?

107
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,370

108
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,480
Young Master, this jade bracelet is for a beautiful woman.

109
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,950
Hand over the bracelet!

- Shangguan Qiu Yue. 
 - Shangguan Qiu Yue.

112
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,440
- Why did you tie me up? 
 - I told Xiao Bai that I kidnapped you.

113
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,730
So I have to tie you up, of course.

114
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,320
Now he pays excessive attention to his wording.

115
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,450
Xiao Bai is currently on the road hurrying to the auction.

116
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,510
Xiao Bai and the others are going to prevent the chaos at the auction.

117
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,990
What is it? Did I disappoint you?

118
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,560
Do you think the righteous sects and the Chuanqi Sect will fight?

119
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,330
You are really abnormal.

120
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,750
You mention this conspiracy so casually.

121
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,110
I'm just curious.

122
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,330
Let's make a bet!

123
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,630
I don't want to.

124
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,820
I bet that Xiao Bai won't make it to the auction on time today.

125
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,660
I made him come and rescue you today.

126
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,850
Do you think that I hold such a special place in his heart?

127
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,090
Well, it depends whether or not you're more valuable than the Fengming Saber.

128
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,770
What do you think?

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,100
The auction is from eleven to one o’clock, it's same time as saving Miss Chun Hua.

130
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,510
If the auction is carried out, saving Chun Hua will have to be pushed back.

131
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,600
Why don't we go to save Chun Hua first and return before one o’clock?

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,740
Okay, I will meet up with you soon.

133
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,540
- But what if Shangguan Qiu Yue tries— 
 - Young Chief Master, rest assured.

134
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,450
The three of us will take control of the auction situation,

135
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,900
and wait for you and Miss Chun Hua to return together.

Oh My, I just drank too much wine.

139
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,750

Master Shi has not arrived yet.

143
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,500
It is not appropriate for anyone to leave now.

144
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,870
Chief Suifeng...

145
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,600
What do you say?

146
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,800
Chief Qin,

147
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,400
have a seat!

148
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,500
This group of old men,

149
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,100
why are they not killing each other yet?

150
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,500
Or did they already drink the poisonous wine

151
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,900
and all died?

152
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,600
There is a quarter of an hour left.

153
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,500
Xiao Chun Hua, it seems you aren't worth as much as the Fengming Saber.

154
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,800
Do you really believe that someone

155
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
will give up all for love?

156
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,900
For love, there are people

157
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,100
who will give up everything.

158
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,050
 Later, her wish came true

159
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,100
and she met her Mr. Right.

160
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,580
Then later, she was dumped by Mr. Right.

How could we stir up trouble before the auction even starts?

If word gets out, won’t we be a laughing stock?

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,000
A quarter to noon, it's time for Longevity fruit auction.

172
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,900
A quarter to noon, it's time for Longevity fruit auction.

173
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,600
A quarter to noon, it's time for Longevity fruit auction.

174
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,000
A quarter to noon, it's time for Longevity fruit auction.

175
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,060
Chief Leng, what are you hesitating for?

176
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,780
After you!

177
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,100
- It is now a quarter to noon. The auction will start soon. 
 - Hold on!

178
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,340
- It's already time near eleven. 
 - It's all your fault for dawdling.

179
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,400
I didn't think the righteous sects would secretly station many guards.

180
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,740
If you flirted less, we could have moved faster today.

181
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,600
We are near the auction venue. Be careful!

182
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,290
Feng’er!

183
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,000
Father?

184
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,100
Son, you are impressive! You did not let Xiao Bai have a head start.

185
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,400
Father, Father.

186
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,900
- W-what are you doing? 
 - What are you all doing here?

187
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,000
We are going to the auction. What about you?

188
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,790
Right, right, right! Speaking of the auction, have you ever thought about this?

189
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,140
The Longevity fruit at the auction,

190
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,920
so many sects arrived just to fight for it.

191
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,960
I have always found it strange.

192
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,410
You are always very intelligent so for this, I've decided to stand on the sidelines

193
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,300
and not commit evil deeds with them.

194
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,480
When they have stopped fighting,

195
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
we will then take advantage of the situation, won't we?

196
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,080
I wonder, how is it going at Young Master’s side? Is it going smoothly?

197
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,510
Although Xiao Bai didn't attend the auction but came to save you,

198
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,300
he may not be able to rescue you.

199
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,260
Are you going back on your words?

200
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,000
If he is able to rescue you, I will do anything you want me to do.

201
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,000
Do you want to go and watch the show with me?

202
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,020
I didn't think Xiao Bai

203
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,600
would really put the auction aside to come and save you.

204
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,360
I knew that Xiao Bai would come to save me.

205
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,300
Congratulations, Young Mistress Xiao.

206
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,000
Why is Xiao Bai not using the Fengming Saber?

207
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,070
Fengming Mountain Manor has a rule.

208
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,800
No woman can be killed by the Fengming Saber.

209
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,700
He is indeed a man I admire.

210
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,400
Young Sister, your perception of Xiao Bai is very partial.

211
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,700
If you don't step aside, don't blame me for being merciless.

212
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,200
"Xiao Xiao Fengming Saber!" He did not disappoint me.

213
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,400
Younger Sister, cooperate with me to put on a show later.

214
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,790
- What kind of show? 
 - The hostage cries for help and is strangled to death by me.

215
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,920
My Fengming Saber has said it will not kill women,

216
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,520
but it hasn't said it won't injure them.

217
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,310
- All you hopeless fighters, withdraw! 
 - Yes.

218
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,850
Xiao Bai!

219
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,910
Young Master Xiao. Oh, that's not right.

220
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,010
Young Chief Xiao, I trust you've been well since we last parted?

221
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,590
Your Qianyue Sect has done all kinds of evil and killed people like killing flies.

222
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,450
Today, I will kill you!

223
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,980
Well said!

224
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,060
I'm your enemy. Release Miss Chun Hua!

225
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,270
He really cares about you.

226
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,330
My Husband!

227
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,330
- Husband? 
 - Shangguan Qiu Yue!

228
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,050
You said I could exchange the Fengming Saber for Miss Chun Hua.

229
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,230
I am here as you've wanted.

230
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,910
I really want to choke you to death.

231
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,090
Shangguan Qiu Yue, let go of Miss Chun Hua!

232
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,360
This saber... I can give you!

233
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,670
On second thought, I go back on my word.

234
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,570
Wouldn't it be better if you  just choked me to death?

235
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,160
You can go now.

236
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,320
Miss Chun Hua, are you all right?

237
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,720
Xiao Bai, your Fengming Saber!

238
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,310
Ice silk.

239
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,850
I didn't think that the dignified Young Master of Fengming Mountain Manor,

240
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,990
whom all in the martial arts circle praise as a man of honor,

241
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,510
would rely on the Qianyue Sect's ice silk, in order to save face.

242
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,630
The Longevity fruit will be auctioned at 11:30 a.m.

243
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,440
- Where is the Longevity fruit? 
 - Where is Master Shi?

244
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,110
At 11:30 a.m., Longevity fruit auction. 11:30 a.m., Longevity fruit auction.

245
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,270
- Where is the Longevity fruit? Tell me! 
 - Where is Mr. Shi? Tell me now!

246
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,030
- Where is Mr. Shi? 
 - Where is Mr. Shi?

247
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,460
The Longevity fruit will be auctioned at 11:30 a.m.

248
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,080
The Longevity fruit will be auctioned at 11:30 a.m.

249
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,090
What's the meaning of this? What's going on? Exactly

250
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,240
The Longevity fruit auction has an entrance fee of one million liang.

251
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,420
You all have this.

252
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,220
However, there is only one Longevity fruit.

253
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,290
So among all of you right here,

254
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,570
- only the survivor can obtain the Longevity fruit. 
 - How can you prove the Longevity fruit is real?

255
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,190
I'm already getting close to death!

256
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:17,350
Regardless if it's true or not, I want the Longevity fruit!

257
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,310
The one who can live to tell the tale,

258
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,420
will be able to take the world's treasure, the Longevity fruit.

259
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,010
Gorge Master.

260
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,830
How is it going?

261
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,690
All people from the Righteous Path are swept away in a scene of violence, killing each other.

262
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,990
When I returned, it was already a bloodbath.

263
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,540
- A taste of their own medicine. 
 - They're all fools.

264
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,630
They didn't see the Longevity fruit or Master Shi.

265
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,690
They just fight all those who are close by.

266
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,490
Well, that's because

267
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,110
I still haven't shown up at the homicidal auction.

268
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,570
It's time I should make my appearance.

269
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,940
Wait!

270
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,960
- It's not right. This wasn't here before. Son, my two daughters-in— 
 - Father!

271
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,080
R-Right! Ladies, e better not go inside right now.

272
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,540
This scene is quite bizarre, and we don't know what's inside.

273
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,390
We should be a little cautious.

274
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,320
Chief Qin is right.

275
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,080
Chief Suifeng!

276
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,510
The Longevity fruit is mine!

277
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,970
You, and you all!

278
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,870
Do you want to vie with me for the Longevity fruit?

279
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,610
Son! The way I see it, we must be careful.

280
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,360
We should get out of here.

281
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,580
Oh, no! My father is still in there.

282
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,600
- Take good care of yourself, Old Man. 
 - What are you doing, Son?

283
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,400
Be careful! Take care of yourself! I'll go find Young Chief Xiao to uphold justice!

284
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,170
Uncle Leng!

285
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,000
Xiao Bai,

286
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,960
I have something to ask you.

287
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,830
Miss, please say it.

288
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,240
Did Shangguan Qiu Yue tell you to exchange the Fengming Saber for me?

289
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,370
Well, what if... I'm just saying what if,

290
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,350
what if I had returned,

291
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,250
but not your sword, what would you do?

292
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:57,800
Rest assured! I won't lose you or the sword.

293
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,290
- You are truly so confident. 
 - Yes, truly.

294
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,330
No one knows that there's ice silk on my Fengming Saber.

295
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,880
I also had no idea it was a relic left by my father.

296
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,580
This relationship between ice silk and the Qianyue Sect,

297
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,820
I only discovered this when I learned of Shangguan Hui.

298
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,300
Rest assured,

299
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,390
I will handle these matters as quickly as possible.

300
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,000
Let's go!

301
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,590
Don't worry! Uncle Leng will be all right.

302
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,180
Uncle Leng isn't here!

303
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,660
This...

304
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,230
It's the silver needle the Healer used to control puppets many years ago.

305
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,170
Allegedly, this technique is very evil.

306
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,980
The Healer has stopped using this needle for a long time, not to mention...

307
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,380
the Healer is already dead!

308
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,070
Be it a success or a failure,

309
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,210
let me try it one last time.

310
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,750
Xiao Chun Hua has left.

311
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,550
It suddenly became so boring.

312
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,510
My Lord, please ease your anger.

313
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,390
I just remembered Xiao Chun Hua and you are about the same age.

314
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,350
Come,

315
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,220
say something I would like to hear.

316
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,770
I dare not.

317
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,240
You ate the mooncakes that Xiao Chun Hua made.

318
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,840
We are now a family.

319
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,210
What is there to fear among family members?

320
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,120
I…

321
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,380
only want to serve you my entire life.

322
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,290
I don't dare harbor other thoughts toward you.

323
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,480
You already said “entire life.”

324
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,260
Yet you say you harbor no other thoughts.

325
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,760
If you…

326
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,060
want to kill me now…

327
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,000
I will have served you my entire life.

328
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,250
I like what you said. It’s not bad!

329
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,950
I wonder where Xiao Chun Hua and Young Chief Master are now.

330
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:06,050
Are they able to make it for the grand show?

331
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,880
Miss Chun Hua.

332
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,990
Do not look over there!

333
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,960
Where are Qin Liufeng and the rest?

334
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,160
This is all my fault.

335
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,870
Turn around now.

336
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,830
Miss Chun Hua, don’t be afraid! I'm here.

337
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,160
Qin Liufeng and the rest are not here.

00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,390
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

342
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,780
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking its eye  ♫

343
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,060
♫  Seeing through love's fickleness  ♫

344
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:03,140
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

345
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,340
♫  It's such a pity for not stepping forward  ♫

346
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,450
♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

347
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:17,550
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

348
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,550
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

349
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:28,010
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

350
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:33,760
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

351
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,260
♫  It's hard to walk on. There's even no one to argue with  ♫

352
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,340
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

353
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,780
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

354
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,640
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

355
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,820
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

356
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,720
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

357
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,590
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

358
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:32,070
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking its eye  ♫

359
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,150
♫  Seeing through love's fickleness  ♫

360
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,270
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

361
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,570
♫  It's such a pity for not stepping forward  ♫

362
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:52,090
♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

363
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,640
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

364
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,090
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

365
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:05,210
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

366
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,050
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

367
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:13,380
♫  It's hard to walk on. There's even no one to argue with  ♫

368
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,620
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

369
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,910
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

370
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,800
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

371
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:32,270
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

372
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,680
♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of the spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

373
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,920
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

374
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,710
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

375
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:03,150
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

376
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,300
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

377
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,620
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

378
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,530
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

379
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:21,570
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
