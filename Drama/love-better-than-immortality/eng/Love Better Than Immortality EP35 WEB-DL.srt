Highly toxic without antidote.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,480
Xiao Chun Hua, are you sure you still want to leave me?

35
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,330
 So is it because he does not have the Ice Stone that he has become like this? 

36
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,370
 I would rather never use a sword again than have the Ice Stone from Qianyue Cave. 

37
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,350
 Without the Ice Stone, you will never be able to use a sword again. 

38
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,520
 So we still need to get the Ice Stone back. 

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,620
 You have no use for the Ice Stone, can you give it Xiao Bai? 

40
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,500
 If I were to destroy it, what would happen?

I will make a deal with you.

If you return this Ice Stone to Xiao Bai,

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,590
I will stay here by your side

45
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,610

48
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,750
Then I will just wait for Little Sister

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,720
to come back after giving the Ice Stone to Xiao Bai, to accompany me.

50
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,140
Then you have to pray.

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,320
I pray that after giving him the Ice Stone,

52
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,820
Hundred Flower Tribulation still hasn't activated and I'm still alive.

53
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,240
It doesn't matter! Dead or alive,

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,000
you will be frozen in the ice gorge.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,370
You still can accompany me there.

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,390
Such a pervert!

57
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,960
Cave Master, I have sent Miss Chun Hua back to the Fengming Mountain Manor.

58
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,180
All right! Remember to look after her.

59
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,130
Taking back Xiao Bai's Ice Stone was originally part of our plan,

60
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,600
but now, the Ice Stone has been completely returned.

61
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,040
I do not know if Cave Master have any further plans.

62
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,340
Is there anything that you need me to do?

63
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,630
Martial Arts Leader, miserable chivalrous hero.

64
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,380
He can only rely on the Ice Stone of Qianyue Cave.

65
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,020
This is an interesting dilemma,

66
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,080
and that Master Shi has been a little unruly recently.

67
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,190
What do these clues in our hands mean?

68
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,430
I should also let the chivalrous hero Xiao who wears the Ice Stone, know.

69
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,420
I understand.

70
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
Young Master Qin.

71
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,490
Sorry to trouble you.

72
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,160
What kind of deal did you agree in order to get this?

73
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,620
Nothing is as important as the Fengming sword.

74
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,230
Do not worry! Right now, Xiao Bai will get better

75
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,240
and the Fengming sword will also not disappear from the martial art's world.

76
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,150
It is true that every time you are in harm's way,

77
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,070
Shangguan Qiu Yue is always by your side.

78
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,190
The entrance of the Qianyue Cave is vast and transposed constantly, even insiders can't get in at all.

79
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,720
However, you are different, you seem to be able to come and leave as you like.

80
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,660
It's because he will always be there waiting for me.

81
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,220
What did you say, Miss Chun Hua?

82
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,830
Nothing!

83
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,930
Yesterday, we heard a noise and saw a white shadow taking you away.

84
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,820
We figured it was Shangguan Qiu Yue.

85
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,050
We couldn't catch up with you, so we could only get back into the room.

86
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,800
That was when I found Young Master lying on the floor.

87
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,160
I suspected that Brother Xiao might have offended you.

88
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,400
He has been unable to control himself during the breakout.

89
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,150
Miss Chun Hua, you should forgive him.

90
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,560
No matter what, I believe the Young Chief Master will soon awaken.

91
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,140
Why don't you stay here with him?

92

Miss Chun Hua, just now I acted discourteously.

It is also a celebration of Young Chief Master's recovery.

You are even willing to come to support my small business.

112

I hope you do not push all the burden on me.

How would I dare? Isn't that right?

115
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,020
So this Young Master wasn't a young master after all.

116

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,060
How would one know if helping someone wholeheartedly

171
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,300
will one day not turn into excuses to use one another?

172
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,470
Perhaps, we can never predict the outcome.

173
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,380
However, if the original intention is good, this is also a good thing.

174
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,630
It's just that why are you suddenly asking about this?

175
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,190
In the past, Xiao Bai once told me

176
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,000
he could give up the Fengming Saber.

177
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,780
He doesn't need to worry about the Ice Stone.

178
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,380
I was just thinking

179
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,160
is it also good?

180
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,620
At least, he could give up the obsession with morality and justice,

181
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,540
and he can just be himself.

182
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,020
The Fengming Saber is the arm of the Young Chief Master to carry out his morality and justice.

183
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,360
He will never be able to completely cut it off.

184
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,470
If he gave up on his responsibilities one day,

185
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,210
he would feel guilty for the rest of his life.

186
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,190
So true!

187
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,820
I already gave the Ice Stone to Xiao Bai.

188
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,690
Thus, what I did, should be right.

189
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,800
Young Chief Master already went back.

190
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,390
- What about Miss Chun Hua? 
 - She said she still needs time to be alone.

191
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,950
However, I bought an interesting book.

192
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,460
[The Healer's Secret]

193
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,970
- What's this? 
 - The Healer's Secret book from the Baxian Residence.

194
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,950
The secret book which records the way to use Puppet Silver Needles?

195
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,340
When many Xin Fa's circulated in the market before,

196
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,400
I was thinking whether the Healer's secrets would also appear.

197
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,790
As expected,  I found these stall keepers very quickly.

198
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,690
Caicai,

199
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,710
you are so smart.

200
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,720
This is not right! I learned a couple of things during my time with the Healer,

201
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,920
but this book has many mistakes and omissions.

202
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,560
Look! This is the prescription for Anshen decoction that was precribed yesterday from Master Bu'er.

203
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,780
When you compare such a simple prescription with what is written in this book, it doesn't match.

204
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,840
Moreover, this has nothing about the method or usage of the Puppet Silver Needle.

205
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,020
This Master Bu'er is really suspicious.

206
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,460
For example, moments after you left,

207
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,500
I heard Li Yu discussing with the landlady

208
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,580
about the puppet boy.

209
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,800
I also found this.

210
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,070
The silver needle which can turn a dead body into a puppet?

211
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,160
This Li Yu and also Bu'er,

212
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,930
who is Master Shi?

213
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,520
Xiao Chun Hua, are you waiting for me?

214
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,120
Xiao Chun Hua, don't you like it?

215
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,730
You are too cold.

216
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,360
Yes! I forgot you are afraid of the cold.

217
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,490
I also do not like Qianyue Cave.

218
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,080
I do not like the life there.

219
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,910
After taking the Ice Stone, Xiao Chun Hua wants to go back on her words.

220
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,530
You don't want to leave Xiao Bai, do you?

221
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,000
Regretting is always something done by the Qianyue Cave Master.

222
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,730
I'm not qualified to do this.

223
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,790
Xiao Chun Hua, you definitely won't regret being with me.

224
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,260
How much do you love me?

225
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,630
More than yesterday.

226
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,030
Less than tomorrow.

227
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,800
I will not let you die.

228
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,920
In a few more days, I can develop the antidote of the poison for sure.

229
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,930
When you have discovered the antidote, you can come to find me.

230
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,940
It still won't be too late by then.

231
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,900
You and I have an agreement.

232
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,730
In our agreement, this clause is not in there.

233
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,250
Hundred Flower Tribulation told me that

234
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,930
you care about me,

235
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,320
but Xiao Chun Hua, you are always not honest.

236
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,720
I will take you back to the Qianyue Cave in 5 days.

237
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,870
My life dream is having a sweet family under the moon and flowers.

238
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,060
So I came here from Dongshan Sect.

239
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,860
I didn't expect to work in checking those accounts again!

240
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,230
Not attending to your proper work or duties! Loves fooling around and hates working!

241
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,500
You made your playboy's habits so serious!

242
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,150
Where is the Young Chief Master?

243
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,340
Qianyue Cave's force. We gathered half a month earlier this time.

244
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,390
The Young Chief Master is currently talking with all the chiefs

245
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,480
to discuss countermeasures.

246
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,860
It looks like this battle cannot be avoided.

247
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,920
Master Shi just shows a bit of a clue

248
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,220
and the Qianyue Cave already wants to try it so eagerly.

249
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,740
What relationship do these two things have with each other?

250
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,070
Or do they have a bigger scheme?

251
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,000
It's just that the storm is coming and the wind is blowing. 
 (TN: the worst event is approaching)

252
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,620
Miss Feng, there is a Young Master Li asking to see you.

253
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,160
Me?

254
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,800
Cave Master, Fengming Mountain Manor is deploying and controlling everywhere in Baxian City.

255
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,490
I tried very hard to get rid of the tail, so I came here late.

256
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,560
Please forgive me, Master.

257
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,230
Did Xiao Bai gather all his troops in Baxian City?

258
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,820
One part is in Baxian City and another part is in Fengming Mountain Manor.

259
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,990
This Xiao Bai is not stupid.

260
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,740
However, they will still kill each other eventually.

261
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,970
My Qianyue Cave will be safe and sound.

262
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,180
This still won't do! Xiao Chun Hua does not like death.

263
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,860
Did you spread all the clues?

264
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,030
I have carried out all your orders based on your direction.

265
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,020
Li Yu, the gambler whom you saved last time,

266
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,980
because you've agreed to save his mother,

267
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,330
so he has gone to look for Miss Feng.

268
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,390
Feng Caicai?

269
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,040
She is a good girl.

270
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,620
We cannot let her follow Xiao Bai.

271
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,520
Go on!

272
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,570
What is wrong?

273
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,840
Now, Baxian City is filled with Xiaobai's troops.

274
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,460
I want to remind you to be careful.

275
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,880
Sure! I understand.

276
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,460
I still have something else to say.

277
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,220
Ye Yan, you have also become different recently.

278
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,170
I'm looking for the antidote to the Hundred Flower Tribulation poison.

279
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,110
You are not allowed to mention the Hundred Flower Tribulation in the future.

280
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,380
[Meet in the suburb grove at 15:45]

281
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,700
Li Yu, why would it be you?

282
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,400
Miss Feng, you have a strong sense of justice.

283
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,250
The end of your sword should not be me.

284
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,930
You said you didn't know how to use the Puppet Silver Needle in front of Miss Leng.

285
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,870
Now, the silver needle shows up in the restaurant's kitchen, how do you explain this?

286
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,250
Speak!

287
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,200
Are you Master Shi?

288
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,250
If you lie to me, you won't go back to Baxian Mansion alive!

289
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,580
Hardhearted, that's why he is called Master Shi.

290
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,160
Miss Feng, I wish to ask you a question.

291
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,430
If someone used your family to threaten you,

292
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,590
and forced you to do things you do not agree with,

293
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,570
what would you choose?

294
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,800
You look conflicted.

295
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,140
I do not know if it is because of this case,

296
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,490
but you must make a choice.

297
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,650
Thank you for your teachings, Miss Feng.

298
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,760
Do you remember that Young Master Qin and Fu Lou

299
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,190
both found out there was a man collecting freshly dead bodies.

300
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,530
He introduced himself with the surname, Zhong.

301
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,730
There is no one with the surname Zhong in the martial art's world.

302
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,920
- It's a fake name. 
 - Miss Feng,

303
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,750
people often give themselves fake names but that is just out of a habit.

304
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,760
They like to connect to their real identities.

305
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,900
This way can help hide themselves.

306
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,850
They can also satirize those who don't know the truth.

307
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:03,070
In addition, in terms of the accounts, you can't just check the restaurant.

308
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,660
In the town, how many industries belong to Baxian Mansion?

309
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,390
Miss, you can investigate this clearly.

310
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,140
I was planning to investigate those!

311
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,760
What have you discovered? Please share quickly.

312
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,310
Tell me quickly! Hurry, hurry up!

313
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,120
I recalled the whole matter.

314
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,460
No matter who this Master Shi is,

315
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,030
after experiencing the auction meeting of the longevity fruit,

316
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,320
he will definitely become rich and powerful.

317
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,390
This is what we should consider.

318
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,450
You looked so smug for such a small discovery?

319
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,450
Miss Feng has already suspected as much.

320
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,910
Right now, she is collecting all the account books in town.

321
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,290
It is Miss Feng again.

322
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,690
Other people's rival in love are of the same sex.

323
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:13,030
Mine is the opposite sex!

324
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,150
Come here!

325
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,930
I can accept you both

326
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,850
and let you become my main wife and mistress.

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:54,740
♫  It's hard to walk on, there's even no one to argue with  ♫

341
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,820
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

342
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,330
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

343
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:07,190
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

344
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:14,670
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

345
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,310
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

346
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,200
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

347
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,640
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking it's eye  ♫

348
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,790
♫  Seeing through the fickleness of love  ♫

349
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:58,880
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

350
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,170
♫  It's such a pity for not stepping forward  ♫

351
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:07,300
♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

352
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:14,120
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

353
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,630
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

354
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,740
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

355
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,620
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

356
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:32,090
♫  It's hard to walk on, there's even no one to argue with  ♫

357
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,120
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

358
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,430
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

359
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:44,490
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

360
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:50,920
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

361
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,230
♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of the spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

362
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,540
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

363
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,270
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

364
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:21,590
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

365
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,830
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

366
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,230
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

367
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:34,030
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

368
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:41,690
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
