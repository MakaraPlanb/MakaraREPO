[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,850
Old Brother stayed until you woke up.

32
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,440
With one look, I knew you were a different person.

33
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,170
- The first person whom I saw was you? 
 - Yes, it was me.

34
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,790
The first man whom you see, will be your true love.

35
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,640
Older Brother.

36
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,490
Is Chief Feng the one who killed the healer?

37
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,840
Young Chief Master has been a little off recently.

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,020
Since the source of the silver needles of puppets come from the Healer,

39
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,430
his medical techniques should have been inherited by the Baxian Residence.

40
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,260
We should search Baxian Residence thoroughly.

41
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,260
Since Master Bu'er does not know the technique of the silver needles of puppets well,

42
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,950
there's no need for us to get entangled further in this.

43

[Episode 31]

44
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,180
Okay.

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,330
Xiao Chun Hua indeed has a lot of interesting ideas.

46
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,130
In a bit, I will count to three.

47
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,860
On three, we'll put forth our fists.

48
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,410
One...

49
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,000
Two...

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,620
Three!

51
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,160
You ask.

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,800
It's my turn to ask so soon?

53
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,260
Then... How did Xiao Chun Hua lose her memory?

54
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,410
How could I possibly tell you the truth?

55
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,780
I choose dare.

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,470
Okay.

57
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,500
Then, kiss me here!

Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

59
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,310
Carry on!

60
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,250
One.

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,850
Two.

62
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,510
Three!

63
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,310
Why did I lose again?

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,180
Rumor says that Xiao Chun Hua ate the Longevity fruit.

65
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,760
Then, what does Longevity fruit taste like?

66
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,400
Why do you always ask questions that I cannot answer?

67
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,130
Dare, again!

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,670
Then kiss me again.

69
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,610
Wait a moment!

70
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,450
Kiss here!

71
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,040
Continue, continue!

72
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,710
One.

73
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,780
Two.

74
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,700
Three!

75
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,090
Then the third question!

76
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,140
Where did the name Xiao Chun Hua come from?

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,960
When will Chun Hua (spring flower) and Qiu Yue (autumn moon) end?

78
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,150
Is this really the reason?

79
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,350
I came up with it myself.

80
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,810
There is a poem, too.  Do you want to listen?

81
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,590
Recite it for me!

82
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,560
"When will Chun Hua (spring flower) and Qiu Yue (autumn moon) end?

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,250
How much of my past do I comprehend?

84
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,820
The eastern wind visited my attic again last night.

85
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,060
Under this bright moonlight, I cannot bear to recall my former homeland.

86
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,280
The jade steps and carved railings must still be there,

87
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,160
though changed are the faces fair.

88
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,930
May I ask how much sorrow a man can bear?

89
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,490
It is just like a river of spring water

90
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,580
flowing eastward."

91
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,460
How is it?  Awesome, isn't it?

92
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,790
The poem is good but you did not compose it.

93
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,310
- Did you compose it? 
 - I can't compose poems.

94
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,200
She wrote it.

95
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,690
Every August 15th, she would recite this poem again and again.

96
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,170
After reciting it, she would coerce me into killing Xiao Yuan.

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,190
So does that hit close to home for you?

98
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,090
Do you feel the same?

99
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,290
You and I won't be like that.

100
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,680
I will be good to you for a lifetime.

101
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,520
You and I must do well.

102
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,050
We need to give birth to lots and lots of little Chun Huas.

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,660
If you are good to me,

104
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,480
then let me win once.

105
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,430
Okay.

106
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,220
One.

107
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,800
Two.

108
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,580
Three!

109
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,110
I won.

110
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,440
Good! It's my turn to ask a question.

111
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,290
Then I'll ask.

112
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,730
Big Brother, how many times did you lie to me?

113
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,950
If it's more than three times, I'm leaving right away.

114
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,100
Brother!  Brother Qiu Yue!

115
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,070
Brother Qiu Yue!

116
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,430
Indeed, this color do bring out my scholarly and refined nature the most.

117
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,340
I see that you didn't lock the door.

118
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,010
Are you waiting to welcome anyone at any time?

119
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,930
Am I not awaiting you, Miss Leng?

120
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,000
I do not regret that my wife crossed over my wall.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,530
Qin Liu Feng! You... What are you saying?

122
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,340
You should pay me some respect! Who is your wife?

123
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,160
Not yet... Still not yet.

124
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,440
I can't figure it out.

125
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,180
Young Master Qin, you are dressed so well.

126
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:22,160
Did you come to investigate a case, or to... travel and go for a nice walk in the early spring?

127
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,310
No wonder you always let Cai Cai and the Young Chief Master travel together?

128
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,490
How could I have the nerve to cast aside the feelings of the one whom I travel together with, Miss Leng?

129
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,520
I'm over being with you.

130
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,470
Cai Cai is a person with such clear thinking.

131
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,980
If you always let her go with the Young Chief Master, she'll see his depressed and melancholy state with her own eyes.

132
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,340
Won't that force her to be unhappy?

133
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,560
I especially arranged it in this way because I precisely understood Miss Feng's personality and capability.

134
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,850
Miss Feng is gentle, soft, generous, and good at understanding others.

135
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,590
Furthermore, she has a good opinion about the Young Chief Master.

136
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,300
However, we all know that she is not that type of person.

137
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,280
I know! If it took too much to get them together as a couple,

138
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,790
then she wouldn't be happy.

139
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:09,270
Moreover, with her personality, she can only be the Young Chief Master's close friend.

140
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,860
What about you and I?

141
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,260
I want to be with you in the martial art world.

142
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,720
But...

143
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,530
But what?

144
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,120
But

145
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,520
Li Yu calls us both young masters.

146
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,510
Qin Liu Feng, you b*stard!

147
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,040
Xiao Chun Hua, my wounds hurt so much.

148
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,650
Your wounds hurt?

149
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,490
What do I do?

150
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,920
No! Desperate times call for desperate measures.

151
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,820
I will take you out.

152
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,720
Are you worried about your brother?

153
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,060
Aren't you stupid? Of course, I am worried about you.

154
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,040
Are you telling the truth?

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,030
No! This is a dare.

156
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,570
We couldn't find any clues but we can't mistreat our stomach.

157
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,550
- Boss! 
 - Coming, coming!

158
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,560
Young Master, you've come to my restaurant.

159
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,730
What would you like?

160
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,460
Who would've known that it was a Lady Boss who is beautiful and fairy-like?

161
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,230
I believe you have good taste.

162
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,980
Let's do this! Give me all your good dishes and wine.

163
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,420
No problem!

164
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,340
It will be too much.

165
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,630
This Young Master, our humble restaurant does not have many delicacies,

166
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,250
so we can only greet you with some simple and plain dishes.

167
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,630
I was worried Young Master would dislike it.

168
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,630
Heroine Leng, I'm sorry!

169
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,350
I didn't think about your feelings.

170
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,600
This Young Master, do you want to order something else?

171
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,650
Is this a brothel or a restaurant?

172
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,450
Do you sell dishes or prostitution?

173
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,650
Young Master, you have such good eyesight!

174
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,460
The three of you are as handsome as Pan An (Chinese poet known for his good looks).

175
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,590
I want to change my profession now.

176
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,920
It's a pity that I have to take care of the young masters' dinner first,

177
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,790
then think about other things.

178
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,090
I have no appetite, let's go!

179
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,300
How can that be? You have already ordered your dishes.

180
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,920
My small shop reaps low profits, you cannot toy with me like this.

181
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,500
You...

182
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,600
That's right! We can't leave now.

183
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,760
Heroine Leng, do not get angry over the misgivings of insignificant people.

184
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,670
Blame me after having dinner, okay?

185
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,440
So you two are master and subordinate?

186
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,820
Don't talk nonsense! Mind your own business!

187
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,570
I'm full.

188
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,450
Miss Leng, "sweat droplets water the earth, and each grain of rice is harvested with difficulty."

189
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,330
You remember other people's words so clearly.

190
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,670
That's the way she is.

191
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,480
She can't control herself when she sees Young Master Qin.

192
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,710
Young Master, you haven't paid your bill.

193
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,530
I'll pay.

194
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,620
Young Master, if you give that much, then my restaurant doesn't have a lot of spare change for you.

195
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,570
As the saying goes, keep the rest

196
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,310
as a tip for your beauty.

197
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,540
You're such a good man.

198
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,740
I wonder which important family you are from?

199
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,550
Thank you for your hospitality.

200
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,970
Okay then! I won't disturb you, Young Masters,

201
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,020
but remember to come here often in the future.

202
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,700
Definitely!

203
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,320
There are a lot of things we have to trouble you with in the future.

204
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,570
What is it? You don't recognize me after only a few days?

205
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,690
Greetings, Young Master.

206
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,570
Your clothes are not bad.

207
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,410
You may rise.

208
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,750
Congratulations, Young Master, for regaining your Zhen Qi and returning to Qianyue Cave.

209
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,960
I didn't say that.

210
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,960
- I still need to stay in that Ice Valley for a few more days. 
 - Yes.

211
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,950
I was looking for you this time for a favor.

212
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,590
I heard that Gu Wan died.

213
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,970
He was personally taken care of by me.

214
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,130
Gu Wan was an interesting man.

215
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,200
Others create havoc because of their own ambitions,

216
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,620
he created havoc because of his sincerity to you.

217
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,180
I have no other thoughts about Gu Wan.

218
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,020
Forget it!

219
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,760
Anyway, he's dead already.

220
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,820
Thinking of how he was in such a dilemma because of his feelings,

221
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,540
he's not good material to be a team leader of Qianyue Sect.

222
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,700
During the time that I was gone,

223
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,240
does the outside know about the rebellion at Qianyue Cave?

224
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,840
Since you entered the Ice Valley, I have already ordered all the other subordinates to ensure

225
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,800
no information was leaked,

226
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,710
so during this time, the Fengming Mountain Manor know nothing about this.

227
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,960
Xiao Bai and the rest are heading to Baxian Town

228
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,620
to investigate the healer's death and the truth of the Longevity fruit.

229
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,640
Then, did they find anything yet?

230
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,760
During the Longevity fruit auction,

231
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,380
they found out that Master Shi used silver needles to control the puppets,

232
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,090
but they have no other progress.

233
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,890
However, Master Shi is worried.

234
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,000
Yesterday, he came to Qianyue Cave and wanted the poisonous drugs.

235
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,790
I didn't promise him.

236
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,830
Last time he used Gu Wan

237
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,810
to steal the Dandelion poison to give to Leng Ying to kill Feng Qian Wei.

238
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,710
This time he still wants to repeat this old trick.

239
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,660
Leak the information about the rebellion at the Qianyue Cave

240
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,680
and the fact that Shangguan Qiu Yue is severely injured.

241
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,490
Young Master, you mean...

242
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,630
Let them all be in chaos.

243
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,280
Without Qianyue Cave's protection, Master Shi

244
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,610
wouldn't dare to act on impulse.

245
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,140
As for Xiao Bai,

246
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,240
even though he is extremely laughable,

247
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,620
he is still the leader of the martial arts circle.

248
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,080
I would rather he hear of this news and come rushing to Qianyue Cave,

249
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,670
than watch him die under Master Shi's hands.

250
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,160
Creating chaos all over so that it won't be good for the pugilist world.

251
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,710
Understand! I will do it now.

252
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,430
Beauty, can you pass on a message to your Boss?

253
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,050
I'm the Lady Boss here.

254
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,280
-  Young Master, if you have anything to say, then please be frank. 
 - No.

255
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,670
I'm talking about your Big Boss.

256
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,810
Young Master, what are you talking about? Why don't I understand?

257
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,260
You don't have to understand, you just need to tell them.

258
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,730
Qin Liu Feng of Dongshan School is looking for Master Shi.

259
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,540
Young Master, what a joke!

260
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,760
Master Shi is such a mysterious person.

261
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,470
I'm just a woman, how can I have connections in high places?

262
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,490
Joke?

263
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,410
Then tell this joke to your Boss.

264
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,690
At the Longevity fruit auction,

265
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,610
the beauty of those two young boys may be said to be exceptional among all the people present.

266
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,200
It's just that their parents wouldn't expect

267
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,580
that the two youngsters who were lively

268
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,250
would become two puppets.

269
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,890
I really don't understand.

270
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,460
Young Master, your words are such a fantasy story.

271
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,920
If you want to turn what you have done into nothing,

272
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,910
then you have to destroy all traces.

273
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,850
You must have been very perplexed as to why you could only find and

274
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,910
eliminate one family after turning the entire city over, right?

275
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,780
Apologies! The other family was taken by my loving and helpful father

276
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,540
- to Dongshan Sect. 
 - You...

277
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,300
I...

278
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,450
I'm Qin Liu Feng.

279
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,980
Speaking of it, there are many young and pretty women in town,

280
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,770
but if we search for them just based on their beauty, that's like fishing a needle in the haystack.

281
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,020
I was able to find and track down this pretty lady boss by following some clues.

282
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,750
Those families put up their children for adoption because they was extremely poor.

283
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,760
What do you mean?

284
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,550
They are refugees who fled a famine-stricken area, and they haven't had meat for many months.

285
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,280
They were only able to eat by selling their own children in exchange for a bit of grain.

286
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,910
They'll naturally be overjoyed when they see the young and pretty lady boss.

287
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,610
So, according to what they say,

288
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,720
you should have gone to the neighborhoods of rich and influential families to search for these beauties,

289
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,980
why did you go to a restaurant?

290
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,080
I thought that these circumstances were too general and didn't have enough details.

291
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,350
As a result, I questioned them closely over and over again, and got additional details.

292
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,000
What kind of details?

293
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,690
Those who are extremely hungry have unusually sensitive noses.

294
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,520
According to what they said, the shopkeeper's wife had a peculiar smell on her,

295
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,170
but contrary to expectations, it wasn't the smell of perfume but of food.

296
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,360
After they smelt this flavor, they were unbearably hungry.

297
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,270
As a result, they were unable to hold back from sending their children.

298
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,770
If this shopkeeper's wife was from a rich and influential family,

299
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,800
literally, she should be far away from a kitchen.

300
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,590
So, how did she has the smell of food then?

301
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,240
No wonder you went to the restaurant.

302
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,210
Young Master Qin, you are indeed awesome!

303
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,530
He has so many love affairs.

304
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,520
He is a womanizer so of course, his experience is rich.

305
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,320
With you in front of me, how can I look at others?

306
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,360
But now, you know the reason why I posed as a playboy, don't you?

307
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,710
It's because you think the way she dresses is sexy.

308
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,370
I feel so hurt.

309
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,630
I did so much for this case.

310
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,070
Now, you say such a thing to me.

311
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,190
Young Chief Master, you also didn't say anything on my behalf.

312
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,590
If our Miss Leng were to change and wear women's clothes,

313
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,920
she will look better than that old woman for sure.

314
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,760
Why are you still not getting better?

315
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,650
You've taken care of me

316
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,300
and I've become delicate and fragile.

317
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,860
You cannot be delicate or fragile.

318
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,600
You are a master in the martial arts world.

319
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,900
You still need to protect me in the future.

320
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,650
Then in the future, I will protect you

321
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,110
and you will take care of me, okay?

322
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,010
No one is allowed here.

323
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,950
Only I can take care of you.

324
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,660
Are you not happy?

325
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,020
It's not that. It's just...

326
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,180
I simply want to leave you with a profound memory.

327
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,450
In the future, when we go out, you should make it up to me even more.

328
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,260
Well, then the two of us should make it up to each other for the rest of our lives.

329
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,600
For a lifetime?

330
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,900
Speaking of which,

331
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,110
when you first went to Fengming Mountain Manor after a short while,

332
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,980
what did you promise me?

333
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,280
You pledged to marry me in the future.

334
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,650
Thank you for coming to my rescue, Young Master.

335
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,520
- I don't have anything to repay your kindness. 
 - Will you pledge to marry me?

336
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,840
That is undoubtedly something you said.

337
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,390
Well, it proves that I'm a fortune-teller.

338
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,790
Xiao Chun Hua, you still need to keep your promise.

339
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,540
At that time, Xiao Chun Hua,

340
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,680
you were so silly and adorable.

341
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,630
You're actually going to say that I was silly?

342
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,840
Furthermore, am I not also adorable right now?

343
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,630
The silly Xiao Chun Hua was nice,

344
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,590
the clever Xiao Chun Hua is also nice, I like both.

345
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,960
If that's the case,

346
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,900
did you also place that poisonous snake?

347
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,760
How could you have such a sinister and cunning brother?

348
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,370
That must have been a fake brother.

349
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,550
Do you want me to go punish him for you now?

350
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,730
How would you punish him?

351
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,640
Come!

352
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,240
How would I punish him?

353
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,370
I'll tell you how to punish him.

354
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,130
How is that a punishment?

355
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,250
He was almost suffocated just now.

356
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,520
What? Do you want me to kill him now?

357
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,130
There's no need for that.

358
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,900
However, even if you are a fake brother,

359
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:26,780
for my sake, I need you to take care of yourself and survive.

360
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,610
Silly Little Sister, it'll be for both of our sake.

361
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,650
Master Shi, why are you being overcautious in front of Qianyue Cave today?

362
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,380
You dare not reveal your face?

363
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,100
Since Qianyue Cave has taken advantage of the actions I have taken,

364
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,410
you should not lightly get rid of me

365
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,390
or allow Fengming Mountain Manor to cruelly oppress me.

366
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,690
Did you know that recently,

367
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,830
Xiao Bai has already investigated my closest subordinates?

368
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:18,710
He involved the whole group and they went to threaten them! I...

369
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,540
I am truly in a sorry plight and I am at my wit's end.

370
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,480
If you know when and where to stop,

371
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,990
Qianyue Cave will protect you from start to finish.

372
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,680
Really?

373
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,290
If that's the case, why haven't I seen Cave Master Shangguan lately?

374
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,560
A few days ago, Gu Wan lead the remaining evil supports of Chuanqi Valley

375
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,410
and started a rebellion.

376
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,720
They carried out a sneak attack on the Cave Master.

377
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,690
Master was seriously wounded and fell into the Ice Valley.

378
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,370
What?

379
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,540
This is the reason why I am unable to give you the poison.

380
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,090
This... this...

381
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,330
Well then, what are you talking about when you keep on mentioning protection for me?

382
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,490
Team Leader Ye, has Fengming Mountain Manor received this information?

383
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,220
Although I lack a bit of propriety,

384
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,880
since it's you, I will also speak freely.

385
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,800
If you can lure Xiao Bai out with this information,

386
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,550
I'll be a bit safer in these coming days.

387
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,560
Since you already know, they will know soon enough.

388
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,150
Qianyue Cave has always kept its word.

389
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,930
As long as you don't make any more trouble,

390
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,650
this piece of information will keep you safe for the time being.

391
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,920
T-this... Why is there dead people?

392
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,990
If Xiao Chun Hua is scared,

393
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,340
I will just put it away.

394
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,220
Did you killed this person?

395
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,800
They wanted to kill me in the first place.

396
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,310
Let's go!

397
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,430
How did you come over so fast?

398
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,780
I said that I'll protect you, Xiao Chun Hua,

399
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,700
so I will not break my promise.

400
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,460
So you didn't get hurt at all and kept lying to me.

401
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,220
Not really. The injury just recovered. That's it.

402
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,140
When did it get better?

403
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,600
Three days ago?

404
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,090
You lied to me for three days?

405
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,650
Not at all.

406
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:44,130
I just wanted to spend some time alone with Xiao Chun Hua, that's all.

407
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,740
Why are you always like this?

408
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,890
Sometimes... it's easier to tell the truth than to tell lies.

409
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,140
For the sake of Xiao Chun Hua, I'm racking my brain every day.

410
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,180
Okay then!

411
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,870
Seeing Big Brother is taking a lot of trouble for me,

412
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,140
then I will reluctantly forgive you.

413
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,980
Xiao Chun Hua is really considerate.

414
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,010
What is it?

415
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,090
Big Brother, not everyone can endure the cold like you.

416
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,520
Now, the most important thing is to get out of here quickly.

417
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,180
Okay.

418
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,310
I didn't feel scared before when I walked alone.

419
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:51,220
On the contrary, with you, I'm a little scared now.

420
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,550
The coward Xiao Chun Hua indeed is even more adorable.

421
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,420
Ever since I had a big brother,

422
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,300
I got afraid of many things.

423
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,830
In the future, Brother will help you immediately.

424
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:14,410
With Big Brother's help, I should feel at ease and be happy,

425
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,490
but Big Brother, can you stop killing people in the future?

426
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,240
Actually, it's too dangerous for you to do this.

427
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:40,630
Xiao Chun Hua, suppose Big Brother were injured and trapped again,

428
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,840
what would you do?

429
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,490
I can carefully stay alive.

430
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:01,700
I will carefully stay alive to save Big Brother again.

431
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,290
However, Xiao Chun Hua doesn't have any bit of martial arts at all.

432
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,180
How would you save Big Brother?

433
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,610
However, martial arts is not everything that determines a winner.

434
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:16,140
Big Brother, what's good about being a demon after all?

435
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,330
It's so that we don't have to worry about someone coming to harm me

436
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,920
or my Xiao Chun Hua.

437
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,100
So this is to make them afraid of you?

438
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,800
Yes.

439
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,210
But Big Brother,

440
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,390
what I really want is smoothness and steadiness,

441
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,660
not safety.
