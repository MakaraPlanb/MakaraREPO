[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,320
The Sky Thunder System can satisfy your wish,

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,650
but you must give up immortality.

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,810
The very first man you see is your Mr. Right.

34
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,720
Husband!

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,330
I'm Xiao Bai.

36
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,700
My father is a leader in martial arts circles.

37
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,320
For now, come with me to the Fengming Mountain Manor.

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,340
Take me back? 
 [Fengming Mountain Manor]

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Then there will be many opportunities. Who is Shangguan Qiu Yue?

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,090
- It's Qianyue Sect's Master. 
 - What is Qianyue Sect?

41
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,740
- A Demon Sect. 
 - It's great to have the Demon Sect leader as my relative.

42
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,080
So great!

Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

45
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,150
It seems that he really is Shangguan Qiu Yue but he doesn't resemble whom Lu Xiu described. 

46
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,640
Has no one seen him before?

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,410
Well, we could have just chatted. Why did you bother fussing while someone else is watching?

48
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,200
Who else is watching us?

49
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,110
Well, she won't see us if I gouge her eyes out.

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,680
Wait! Wait...

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,590
Older Brother, you have too much bloodlust.

52
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,750
She just attacked you.

53
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,090
And she even disturbed our family reunion.

54
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,500
Our established rule is don't frighten or let my family's little Chun Hua see blood.

55
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,870
Wait!

56
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,210
We only have one life, don't we?

57
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,990
This, just let her keep both eyes, please.

58
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,070
Just now, were you talking about...

59
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,860
Xin Fa?

60
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,570
I can help you steal it.

61
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,960
You should spare her.

62
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,860
How is that possible? It's obvious you don't know martial arts.

63
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,380
And before, you nearly lost your life.

64
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,830
You had better return to Qianyue Cave with me.

65
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,690
Older Brother!

66
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,150
Might as well! My little Chun Hua is so kindhearted.

67
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,050
This time, I will show mercy and spare her.

68
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,950
You may keep your eyes.

69
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,750
Thank you, Master. Thank you, Miss.

70
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,610
You simply must be very careful.

71
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,630
You must not let Xiao Bai discover your identity.

72
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,600
Otherwise...

73
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,390
What will happen if he finds out?

74
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,240
Then, you cannot blame me for being merciless.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,710
Where did they go?

76
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,600
Hello! How do I find you all?

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,980
What on Earth is the Xin Fa?

78
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,320
Hello?

79
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,430
Miss Chun Hua.

80
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,230
Who were you talking to just now?

81
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,210
I was just training my voice.

82
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,060
It's my daily hobby. Would you like to hear some more?

83
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,250
Do you want to give it a try?

84
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,890
Miss Chun Hua, you should quickly return to the manor with me now.

85
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,390
All right.

86
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,350
At that moment, it seems that you know a bit of martial arts.

87
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,460
Ye Xingzhu, are you satisfied with your new helper?

88
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,060
Congratulations, Master! You can once again rope in Hua Xiaolei.

89
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,030
It's just that... I don't understand.

90
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,970
Why did you pretend to be her older brother?

91
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,560
Since she lost her memory, we can start over.

92
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,540
Now, if you pull Xiao Bai and their relationship into this again... that would be interesting.

93
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,330
Forgive my stupidity.

94
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,290
If she believes and treats me as her brother, then she can help me continue to steal the Xin Fa.

95
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,650
You are wise, Master.

96
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,940
Now, what is Xin Fa? It's the treasure of all sects.

97
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,060
Members of martial arts circles shouldn't be so narrow-minded.

98
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,890
Good things ought to be brought out and shared with everyone,

99
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,770
without hindrance.

100
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,920
I will instruct Gu Xingzhu and He Xingzhu

101
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,370
to hurriedly acquire the other sects' Xin Fa.

102
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,790
What about the Xiao family's Xin Fa?

103
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,570
Just leave that to Hua Xiaolei.

104
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,120
Hua Xiaolei, Xiao Chun Hua.

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,660
Xiao Chun Hua, Hua Xiaolei.

106
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,280
I think I gave her a better name.

107
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,050
The leader has a fierce, cruel temperament, with vicious means, and anyone who has seen...

108
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,770
What will happen if someone finds out?

109
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,500
You cannot distinguish right from wrong.

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,220
It'll mean death, either way.

111
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,320
No, I have to find Xiao Bai and clearly clarify about it.

112
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,520
Miss Chun Hua.

113
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,570
Xiao Bai, I have something I want to ask you.

114
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,000
- Your Xin— 
 - Young Master!

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,280
Young Master, something bad happened. The Hengshan Sect's Xin Fa was stolen by the Qianyue Sect.

116
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,120
Chief Mo is seriously ill from the incident.

117
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,830
The Qianyue Sect again! The Kuishan Sect's and the Mangshan Sect's.

118
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,340
This is the third Xin Fa that has been stolen.

119
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,400
Go back to tell Chief Mo to rest and regain strength.

120
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,680
Fengming Mountain Manor will stop the Qianyue Sect's crimes.

121
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,110
Yes.

122
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,320
Miss, is something the matter?

123
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,190
I just wanted to ask...

124
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,930
does your heart...

125
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,940
- treasure someone? 
 - You...

126
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,840
Me?

127
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,880
You're such a shameless, young woman.

128
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,570
Do you think this is shameless?

129
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,560
What a big blockhead! He's so stubborn.

130
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,900
- Seventh Junior Brother, meanwhile, go to the Hengshan Sect to see Chief Mo. 
 - Yes.

131
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,150
- Eleventh Junior Brother, go to the Kuishan Sect. 
 - Yes.

132
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,380
- Fourth Junior Brother, go to the Mangshan Sect. 
 - Yes.

133
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,900
- Miss, you... 
 - Actually, you don't need to be concerned about me.

134
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,010
After all, I already know that business affairs are important.

135
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,510
People's health and safety are also important.

136
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,360
I'll wait to talk after you care for all these issues.

137
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,020
Miss Chun Hua, wherever is your mind?

138
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,090
Why do you think our young master is very concerned about you?

139
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,290
Anyhow, I'm not preoccupied with anything.

140
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,630
Xiao Bai, do you need a maid?

141
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,000
A personal maid?

142
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,020
Young Master, I think Miss Chun Hua

143
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,550
resembles someone.

144
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,630
Is it Xiao Bai's fiancee?

145
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,220
Or some other beautiful woman?

146
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,190
I think Miss Chun Hua resembles

147
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,310
our kitchen's apprentice, Qishiliu.

148
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,620
Is that so?

149
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,680
Are you serious?

150
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,300
Come here, hurry!

151
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,820
If you have nothing to do, then chop some wood.

152
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,460
What, chop firewood?

153
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,100
Just like this! Pile it up against the entire wall.

154
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,400
They should be evenly cut

155
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,220
and piled up neatly.

156
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,290
Everyone in your Fengming Mountain Manor knows martial arts.

157
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,530
Why ask a weak and feeble girl like me to do such things?

158
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,470
It's dangerous to approach a person when he is practicing martial arts.

159
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,680
Xiao Bai, you should start getting familiar with

160
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,240
the sound of my breathing and footsteps.

161
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,760
This is where I practice martial arts. Outsiders can not come here.

162
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,410
How am I an outsider?

163
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,870
How about I keep you company?

164
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,690
Please keep your distance, Young Miss.

165
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,520
If I go farther, I can't see clearly.

166
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,990
If anything happens, don't say I didn't warn you.

167
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,350
Xiao Bai, your swordsmanship is amazing.

168
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,030
What are you doing?

169
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,330
There are six logs of firewood here.

170
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,020
You should cut them into eight pieces

171
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,990
They should be cut evenly

172
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,420
and piled up neatly.

173
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,280
Also...

174
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
that's all for now.

175
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,900
Can you do that?

176
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,650
I'll try.

177
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,640
Xiao Bai, you're so amazing!

178
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,970
This one is not even.

179
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,980
This one has a different length.

180
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,710
My skills are not good enough.

181
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,160
None so! It's already very good.

182
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,260
What are you doing?

183
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm collecting the firewood.

184
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,090
The environment for practicing martial arts is very important.

185
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,120
It has been hard on you, Miss.

186
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,590
No problem! Look, you even know to reflect on yourself now.

187
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,480
That's very good! You have to keep practicing.

188
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,520
You're right.

189
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,260
Thank you for keeping me company for so long.

190
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,180
No problem! No problem at all.

191
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,640
Xiao Bai's performance was very good.

192
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,240
How about it? Practice like this every day.

193
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,660
You will definitely improve.

194
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,120
- Let me help you. 
 - No, no, no.

195
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,780
I can handle it myself. Don't I also need to practice?

196
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,030
It's getting late. Don't you need to see the master?

197
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,770
Thanks a lot for your understanding. I will get going now.

198
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,300
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

199
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,130
Xiao Bai, you have to come tomorrow. You must come.

200
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,200
I'll keep you company while you chop...

201
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,290
practice martial arts.

202
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,480
 I just have to thaw the ice in warm water to deal with you.

203
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,770
 Take it slow!

204
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,720
[Thousand Moon Cave]

205
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,830
Is this the Qianyue Cave?

206
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,510
Yes.

207
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,020
I didn't expect it to be so warm and elegant.

208
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,150
How has Xiao Chun Hua been after arriving at the Fengming Mountain Manor?

209
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,140
The people at Fengming Mountain Manor make me chop firewood.

210
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,810
I'm exhausted after all that manual labor.

211
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,010
Only Big Brother is good to me.

212
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,240
Big Brother, it's so cold here. Aren't you cold?

213
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,830
Xiao Chun Hua learned how to behave.

214
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,970
You even know to care for me.

215
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,440
 Big Brother knows how to create a romantic atmosphere more than Xiao Bai.

216
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,950
Big Brother, due to a flower petal birthmark on my body

217
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,260
so I'm called Chun Hua; Big Brother is named Qiu Yue...

218
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,420
Does that mean you also have a birthmark?

219
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,360
If Xiao Chun Hua is so curious, why don't you see for yourself?

220
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,220
 Such a calm attitude!

221
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,680
Can I really look for it myself?

222
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,750
Look, then (I'll) look!

223
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,090
It's okay. You can be frivolous.

224
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,270
You are my Big Brother. That wouldn't be right.

225
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,510
It's your own Big Brother. What do you fear?

226
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,860
 I should know the limit since it's my own Big Brother.

227
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,610
Big Brother loves you so much. Shouldn't Xiao Chun Hua help Big Brother?

228
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,730
Xiao Bai is a good person and he's good to me.

229
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,920
After I lost my memory, it's Xiao Bai who took me in.

230
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,870
Isn't stealing Xin Fa quite indecent?

231
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,290
Is he a good person?

232
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,460
If Xiao Bai finds out that Chun Hua is Shangguan Qiu Yue's little sister,

233
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,200
do you think he'll continue to treat you well?

234
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,920
Older Brother, why are you so hostile to them?

235
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,080
Little Sister,

236
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,580
we have never seen eye to eye in every way.

237
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,380
It is dangerous to steal Xin Fa.

238
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,500
If Little Sister doesn't want to do it, that's okay.

239
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,820
Just stay with me at Qianyue Cave.

240
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,350
Xiao Bai is my Mr. Right.

241
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:01,100
If we can't meet, I can't even get him to like me over time.

242
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,370
Since Older Brother needs this Xin Fa so much,

243
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:09,640
I must return to Fengming Mountain Manor to try. But...

244
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,180
I can't guarantee that I'll be able to steal it.

245
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,200
This is my good little sister.

246
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,670
Xiao Chun Hua, rest assured! Older Brother will secretly protect you.

247
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,910
Then I'll return now.

248
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:27,170
Gu Xingzhu, escort Chun Hua back to Fengming Mountain Manor.

249
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,740
Yes.

250
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,600
Put me down! I want to get down.

251
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,400
Let go!

252
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,700
Gu Xingzhu, can we choose a more civilized mode of transportation?

253
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,980
You carry me like a sack. It's not comfortable at all.

254
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,230
Miss Chun Hua, you probably forgot your own identity.

255
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,360
What identity?

256
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,350
I'm your Cave Master Shangguan's little sister!

257
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,730
I am just following the rules.

258
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,840
Then let me ask you.

259
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,210
Did Cave Master Shangguan and I

260
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,300
- really have the same mother and father? 
 - It's getting late.

261
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,010
Find a horse carriage for my little sister.

262
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,950
Yes, Cave Master.

263
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,900
Am I really your biological sister?

264
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,590
My request isn't too much to ask. Is it that hard to fulfill?

265
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,760
Indeed, you are not.

266
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,150
It's possible that Mom and Dad misremembered.

267
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,780
Chun Hua could be Qiu Yue's older sister.

268
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,370
I, Shangguan Chun Hua,

269
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,470
am Shangguan Qiu Yue's older sister!

270
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,860
What are you doing?

271
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,270
Aren't you suspicious?

272
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,290
Then, how about I'll take off my clothes

273
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,070
and show you my birthmark?

274
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,280
I wasn't serious!

275
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,790
I am your older brother.  What are you afraid of?

276
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,860
Xiao Bai!

277
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,650
I didn't think even Older Brother would fall for it.

278
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,480
Older Brother, do you resemble Father or Mother?

279
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,070
- Why? 
 - Although we are siblings,

280
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,570
I can't find any similarities between us.

281
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,840
Did you inherit all of Father and Mother's good traits?

282
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,070
How does Older Brother compare with Xiao Bai?

283
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,860
Compare Brother and Husband? Of course, they're different.

284
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,100
To me, you two are different.

285
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,670
How are we different?

286
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,810
Older Brother Qiu Yue is a close relative.

287
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,440
If I had merely half of Older Brother's good looks,

288
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,610
the Xin Fa would come easily to me.

289
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:31,240
If you say it like that, Xiao Chun Hua wants to use the beauty trap.

290
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,120
He is a gentleman.

291
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,490
I don't know if the beauty trap will work.

292
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,500
It's entirely Older Brother Qiu Yue's fault for stealing all the good looks.

293
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,020
If not, the beauty trap would work, wouldn't it?

294
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,710
Xiao Chun Hua is right so we have to find another way.

295
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,990
Also,

296
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,220
you aren't allowed to use the beauty trap.

297
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,590
You'll make a spectacle of yourself.

298
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,170
I don't need Older Brother's reminder.

299
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,300
[Thousand Moon Cave]

300
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,690
Master, I wonder if Miss Chun Hua is Hua Xiaolei.

301
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,710
Whether she is Hua Xiaolei or not, why are you so nervous?

302
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,810
I have absolutely no intention of prying. It just that...

303
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,590
I'm guessing, letting Miss Chun Hua go and steal the Xin Fa.

304
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:40,740
But it's related to the matter of Xiao Bai not mastering the Fengming Saber.

305
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,000
You're quick to listen and observe.

306
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,620
- For the sake of Cave Master's safety. 
 - Is it for my safety?

307
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,460
People without eyes and ears are the safest.

308
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,500
I am wrong!  Please have mercy, Cave Master!

309
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,890
I told Gu Xingzhu.

310
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,560
Other than him, no one else knows.

311
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,710
I'm willing to guarantee with my life.

312
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,370
- There's one more thing. 
 - Say it!

313
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,630
Qin Liufeng is heading toward Fengming Mountain Village.

314
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,100
However, he has not met Hua Xiaolei.

315
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,270
Go! Watch closely.

316
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,880
Yes.

317
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,080
Miss, what's wrong?

318
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,250
If you encounter someone from the Demon Sect, what will you do?

319
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,190
What do you do?

320
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,840
Good and evil are irreconcilable!

321
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,500
Getting rid of the evil is my family's duty.  Why bother asking?

322
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,780
What if this person is your friend?

323
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,000
Friend?  Who?

324
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,260
Then what if... I'm just saying what if...

325
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,410
Don't speak nonsense! I do not conspire with those who are of different beliefs.

326
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,590
I will not have such a friend.

327
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:43,080
One side is my moody older brother.

328
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,250
The other side is the persistent Xiao Bai.

329
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,580
What should I do?

330
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,880
Forget it, forget it! Stop thinking about it.

331
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,400
What's wrong?

332
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,950
The sunset today is quite beautiful.

333
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,140
It is indeed very beautiful.

334
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,240
I never noticed it before.

335
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,510
Have you never noticed?

336
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,030
All four seasons, rain or shine,

337
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,030
Father always tells me to practice swordsmanship.

338
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,630
Xiao Bai, your life is too boring.

339
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,890
Actually, what I mean is...

340
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,380
do you want to put down the sword in your hand

341
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,640
and watch the sunset glow with me?

342
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,330
If you are bored, then go back now.

343
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,730
Xiao Bai, you are really an unromantic block of wood!

344
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,210
How did that happen?

345
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,840
I changed to a new move. I feel it's not bad.

346
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,840
Why didn't you do it according to the requirements?

347
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,650
If you cut them like this, how can they become firewood?

348
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,300
Firewood?

349
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,180
Anyway, you've done blade work before.

350
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,170
Not burning it, will be a waste, won't it?

351
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,190
Are you asking me to use the Fengming Saber to gather firewood?

352
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,960
I'm not! Isn't this a chance to practice your swordsmanship?

353
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,020
Once you're done practicing,

354
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,270
you can bring the wood to the kitchen to burn.

355
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,970
The Xiao clan's Fengming Saber punishes evil and rewards good.

356
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,620
It has a good reputation everywhere but is tarnished by you.

357
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,820
How can you refer to it like that?

358
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,940
If you don't gather firewood, you must gather bamboo. Isn't that the same?

359
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,100
How is it the same?

360
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,300
Are you scared that the Fengming Saber will become blunt?

361
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,250
- Then I'll just find you a normal blade some other day. 
 - You...

362
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,060
Also, why are you learning martial arts?

363
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,500
- Shouldn't it be practical? 
 - Martial arts isn't used for gathering firewood.

364
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,390
I know!

365
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,750
But... really, don't you think that

366
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,510
using martial arts to cut firewood

367
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,930
can save time while practicing swordsmanship?

368
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,040
Xiao Bai! Xiao Bai!

369
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,160
Your swordsmanship is so good.

370
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,620
Can you teach me a few tricks?

371
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,830
Swordsmanship is a steady skill, and requires strength.

372
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,480
Women are naturally weaker. Using a saber proves to be difficult.

373
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,400
If Miss really wants to learn, I'll teach you the sword.

374
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,870
No need, no need! I don't need to learn much.

375
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,410
- I just want to learn a few tricks. 
 - A few tricks?

376
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,810
Yes, it's just for gathering firewood.

377
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,250
Don't understanding human natures,

378
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,720
and inflexible thinking.

379
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,220
Why is my male lead like this?

380
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Miss Chun Hua.

381
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,240
The kitchen doesn't need any more firewood.

382
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,490
Master Xiao also doesn't need anyone.

383
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,400
You don't have to make the effort next time.

384
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,030
Did Xiao Bai make you say that?

385
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,540
This brainless, wooden man.

386
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,150
Are you also mocking me?

387
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,650
Bow down!

388
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,400
- Bow down. 
 - Is Miss training the flowers?

389
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,400
This way of practicing martial arts is interesting.

390
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,150
May I ask whom Miss learns from?

391
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,970
I...

392
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,440
Why do you care?

393
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,370
If I didn't guess wrong, Miss would be

394
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,140
whom Young Master saved at Yisheng's house...

395
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,050
the weak lady.

396
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,770
Do you know Xiao Bai?

397
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,810
Xiao Bai?

398
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,570
You two are so close.

399
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,880
It seems that your relationship with Young Master is not ordinary.

400
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,830
I was disrespectful. Sorry!

401
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,490
My surname is Qin, called Liufeng.

402
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,680
My father is the Dongshan Sect leader, Qin Daoxian.

403
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,010
- May I ask for your beautiful name? 
 - Chun Hua.

404
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,000
Chun Hua.

405
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,860
The romantic flowers in spring.

406
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,730
It seems that Miss lives up to this name.

407
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,010
You, too.

408
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,090
Young Master Qin also lives up to

409
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,430
your name's meaning of flirtatious.

410
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,190
Junior Brother Qin.

411
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,850
Young Master.

412
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,240
Xiao Bai, you're here!

413
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,780
Young Master.

414
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,870
It's been a while, yet Senior Brother Xiao still looks so grand.

415
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,230
You will be a good leader of the Wulin Sect.

416
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,490
Junior Brother Qin, there are no outsiders in this house.

417
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,000
Say it! Why have you come?
