♫  I've always been simple-minded  ♫

7

♫  I only want my life's one true love  ♫

16

♫  I want a male lead to hold a peerless, treasured sword in his hand  ♫

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,180
♫  The story I want is very sweet, very sweet  ♫

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,670
♫  The storyline I want must be atypical  ♫

[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,030
Actually, this is Miss Leng Ning. This is Miss Feng Caicai.

32
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,510
We didn't meet for a while so this time, I specially prepared a gift.

33
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,080
- Remember you're a demon, not a fairy. Don't use the beauty trap! It's embarrassing.

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,900
You must be here for tomorrow's poem meeting.

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,840
Today's poetry theme will discuss the ways of the right.

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,220
I even thought poem meeting would be so romantic, but it's just this. How boring!

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,530
How did the legendary dignified Gorge Master Fu become as weak-willed as a woman?

38
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,260
Right now, I just want to achieve longevity, then talk about death.

39
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,160
[Episode 6]

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:11,420
Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

41
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,910
Sentiment and righteousness don't get along.

42
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,650
If you must choose only one, you should choose righteousness.

43
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,670
Then is Miss Caicai really saying that

44
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,220
the martial arts world is teaching people to be heartless?

45
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,870
If it's for the people, I'd rather be heartless.

46
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,890
This way, you will be on the right path.

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,070
Great! Then I would also like to recite a poem.

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,430
Please, Miss!

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,700
"They hoe weeds at noon. Their sweat drips on the soil. Who knew each grain of rice is the fruit of hard toil?"

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,250
Good poem! Good poem! Such a very good poem!

51
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,430
Miss Chun Hua, you're indeed so talented.

52
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,890
- Yes. 
 - Good poem!

53
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,570
I still have another one.

54
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,000
"Geese... geese... geese...

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,640
Necks curve as they sing to the sky.

56
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,540
White feathers float on the green water.

57
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,910
Red feet paddle through clear streams."

58
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,950
What's wrong?

59
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,190
This is the poem Brother Qin wrote when he was seven.

60
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,210
- Didn't you know? 
 - Is this Qin Liufeng's original?

61
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,450
- System, are you kidding me? 
 - I wrote it as a joke in childhood.

62
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,970
Miss Chun Hua is so thoughtful.

63
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,070
Who has the time to recite your poem?

64
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,830
It was just on the spur of the moment.

65
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,920
I still have another one.

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,350
Two golden orioles—

67
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,790
No...

68
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,620
A red plum tree—

69
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,130
Too ominous (red plum tree symbolizes a woman's affair).

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,920
When will spring flowers and the autumn moon end?

71
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,660
"When will spring flowers and the autumn moon end?"

72
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,270
How much of the past do you remember?

73
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,290
Someone told me before

74
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,450
this was a sad poem.

75
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,080
She was calm every time she recited it.

76
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,000
Right now, Gorge Master Fu,you are at the exact same time as when she was here.

77
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,360
So even Master Shangguan also has someone you miss.

78
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,690
No,

79
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,820
she died a long time ago.

80
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,030
But it seems the person whom Gorge Master Fu misses, is dying

81
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,340
and needing longevity fruit to stay alive.

82
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,250
Is it the wife of your master whom you stole?

83
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,550
Fu Lou, I didn't know you also seek the longevity fruit.

84
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,490
Are only the Right Path people allowed to know about the longevity fruit?

85
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,140
Have you seen the longevity fruit?

86
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,600
Fool! Do you try to get information out of me?

87
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,080
Chief Feng killed the healer.

88
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,550
That's not a problem but I am not as easy to handle.

89
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,310
Gorge Master Fu, don't falsely accuse me.

90
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,920
The dignified Xisha Sect Master impudently killed the healer for the sake of the longevity fruit.

91
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,640
If your so-called Right Path martial arts friends knew...

92
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,880
Gorge Master, if you have something to say, do so.

93
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,780
Fine! Bring the girl who died and came back to life here.

94
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,160
When will spring flowers and the autumn moon en—

95
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,180
I messed up. I forgot that I can't mention Qiu Yue.

96
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,490
Miss Chun Hua.

97
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,590
Everyone, calm down!

98
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,820
I learned some medical techniques and skills.

99
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,520
We can make a decision after I examine her.

100
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,140
How is it?

101
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,010
It's not urgent.

102
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,920
I learned acupuncture before.

103
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,160
After I give her a few needles, she will wake up.

104
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,770
I never heard that Young Master Qin knows about medicine.

105
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,890
Miss Chun Hua, you're finally awake.

106
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,210
My head hurts.

107
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,870
I want to go back and sleep.

108
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,510
Miss Chun Hua drank some wine just now.

109
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,000
She also caught the cold breeze. I'll ask Miss Feng to take you back to your room.

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,100
No need! I can go on my own.

111
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,540
- She is pretending, right? 
 - I don't know.

112
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,750
Young Warriors, what's the meaning of all this?

113
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,170
Today is the distinguished meeting of our Right Path martial arts circle.

114
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,810
This girl's tongue wagged too freely and willfully said those two words.

115
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,660
Is it possible she's a Demon Sect enchantress?

116
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,250
I was too negligent.

117
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,740
I forgot to tell Miss Chun Hua about this taboo.

118
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,550
However, she really didn't do it on purpose.

119
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,320
Young Master, you are chivalrous.

120
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,590
But what exactly is her identity?

121
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,330
How does Young Master relate to her?

122
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,580
Why have you unexpectedly absolved her this way?

123
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,270
I'm really not absolving Miss Chun Hua.

124
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,830
I simply think that Miss Chun Hua did nothing wrong

125
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,230
but for these two words of Qiu Yue.

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,840
What?

127
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,580
These mere two words put you all into such a panic.

128
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,250
We should all make a concerted effort to eradicate the Demon Sect.

129
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,480
We shouldn't put excessive attention on such words to fear a mere word.

130
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,200
Could it be that

131
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,000
you all truly fear them?

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,400
Naturally, we aren't scared of them.

133
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,740
There's just no need to bring up these topics.

134
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,350
Since you're unafraid, in the future when we eradicate the Demon Sect

135
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,090
and uphold justice, we will need all of your help.

136
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,910
Today is our elegant, illustrious gathering.

137
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,550
Don't let unsheathed weapons

138
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,400
and their frosty, icy glitter ruin the mood.

139
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,630
I especially invited some girls

140
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,660
to play music for your enjoyment.

141
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,370
What do you think?

142
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,490
Two Misses, please!

143
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,150
Thank you, Elder Brother Qin, for your righteousness.

144
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,410
Later, there will be a better opportunity to thank me.

145
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,470
Luckily, I'm clever and quick-witted. Otherwise...

146
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,390
Why is he here again?

147
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,360
You can't hold your liquor,

148
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,020
but you had to show off.

149
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,960
What is Older Brother trying to do?

150
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,640
He wouldn't, would he?

151
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,800
Since little Chun Hua doesn't want to take her medicine,

152
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,260
Older Brother can only use his own methods now.

153
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,250
Older Brother, stop teasing me!

154
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,280
When I was trying to steal the Xin Fa for you, I nearly lost my life.

155
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,690
Big Brother cares for you a lot to even come here to help sober you.

156
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,050
When did I bring up Xin Fa?

157
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,220
Oh right, Older Brother! You should probably go now.

158
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,320
If someone finds out, we'll be done for.

159
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,350
What do you fear? Wouldn't it be fine if we just killed them all?

160
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,180
You're here?

161
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,220
- Take it out! 
 - What?

162
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,580
You know but you still ask.

163
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,700
Hasty men don't get to eat hot tofu.

164
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,740
Stop!

165
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,870
My dad suddenly found in his investigations that Hua Xiaolei of the Hua family died.

166
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,280
Died from what?

167
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,820
The Hua family doesn't reveal much about this matter.

168
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,280
However, once you see a painting of Hua Xiaolei,

169
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,450
you might form your own judgment.

170
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,310
Have you seen this painting before?

171
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,150
How could I have seen it before?

172
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,380
I'm such an amicable person, yet you still don't believe me?

173
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,010
I don't believe you.

174
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,990
Older Brother, I want to ask you about a matter.

175
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,220
What matter?

176
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,700
Did Xiao Bai's fiancée, Hua Xiaolei,

177
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,890
die in a sea of flames?

178
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,720
Indeed!

179
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,530
Did they never find her corpse?

180
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,160
Correct!

181
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,590
Then who started the fire?

182
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,980
The one who set the fire is you.

183
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,430
How is that possible?

184
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,160
Little Chun Hua, don't forget!

185
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,630
When the Xiao family's house burned, you were there, too.

186
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,720
Was I there, too?

187
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,650
You're lying to me. I don't believe you!

188
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,980
LiChun Hua is forgetful as expected.

189
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,740
You had many devilish ideas so you snuck into the Fengming Mountain Manor.

190
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,560
You said you wanted to steal Xin Fa for your Older Brother.

191
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,590
Older Brother, are you really speaking truth?

192
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,640
I... Am I really the one who started the fire?

193
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,900
Absolutely true!

194
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,380
You only started a fire and killed someone.

195
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,170
Why are you nervous?

196
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,170
Brother Xiao, if you keep going like this, how will we ever see Miss Hua's real face?

197
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,680
Are those Lisheng's shoes?

198
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,900
Xingyun's necklace?

199
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,050
Senior Brother, it would still be better if you leave.

200
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,470
Go.

201
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,840
So mysterious! Who cares?

202
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,560
I still don't believe it.

203
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,690
Little Sister doubt Big Brother.

204
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,120
I wouldn't dare.

205
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,670
How do I dare doubt Big Brother?

206
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,290
Is Miss Chun Hua here?

207
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,020
I'm here, Miss Feng. What did you find me for?

208
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,980
For the poem society, I especially brought over new tea.

209
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,980
I wonder, would you want to try it with me?

210
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,000
Sure, I'm coming to open the door. Go then!

211
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,720
Miss Chun Hua?

212
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,280
Miss Feng, I'm still getting over my hangover. It's better not to meet you now.

213
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,170
Well, drinking the new tea with me can help you overcome your hangover.

214
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,250
Miss Feng, I still discuss important matters with Miss Chun Hua.

215
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,720
Can you wait for some other time?

216
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,290
Since Young Master Xiao and Miss Chun Hua are still talking,

217
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,050
I won't bother you anymore.

218
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,760
Young Master Xiao?

219
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,940
How are you...

220
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,620
I'm coming to find Miss Chun Hua to discuss important matters.

221
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,410
But I clearly just heard your voice from inside her room.

222
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,390
I'm afraid Miss Feng heard incorrectly.

223
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,180
I was just in Senior Brother Qin's room.

224
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Then, could it be...

225
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,950
voice imitation?

226
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,440
Miss Chun Hua, are you okay?

227
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,240
We are going to come in.

228
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,640
Miss Feng must be anxious because of the poem society.

229
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,910
But I clearly heard two people.

230
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,470
I suppose Miss is just too tired. Go back and rest early!

231
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,460
Since Young Master Xiao needs to discuss important matters with Miss Chun Hua,

232
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,370
I will not bother you any longer.

233
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,500
Miss, are you better now?

234
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,610
I'm not good, not good at all.

235
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,190
My head feels dizzy, my chest is stuffy, and I want to throw up.

236
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,520
Xiao Bai, can you check if I have a fever?

237
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,360
I'll tell the server to bring you hangover soup.

238
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,930
No need, no need!

239
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,730
Xiao Bai, it's better to just keep me company.

240
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,430
Miss Chun Hua,

241
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,810
I actually have important matters to discuss with you.

242
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,930
As you have not sobered up yet,

243
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,820
I shall talk with you at a later date.

244
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,490
Xiao Bai!

245
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,860
Miss, have you sobered?

246
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,410
Xiao Bai, can you take me outside for some the fresh air?

247
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,620
- Xiao Bai. 
 - Chun Hua.

248
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,670
- Please speak first, Miss.

249
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,330
Tonight, the autumn breeze is blowing gently. The moon...

250
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,800
The moon is bright and the stars are few.

251
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,650
You also think it's not bad, don't you?

252
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,200
Miss, you may speak plainly. Say whatever you want.

253
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,880
Was I not allowed to bring it up? I even pretended to be drunk.

254
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,500
What did you say?

255
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,430
I was saying

256
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,230
going out for fresh air indeed helps sober me.

257
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,350
All is good if Miss feels well.

258
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,550
Xiao Bai, I really didn't mean to do that in the poem society today.

259
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,020
I couldn't think of more poems so I was a little muddleheaded—

260
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,160
Miss is not at fault.

261
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,760
If Demon Sect didn't stir up havoc, how could the martial arts circle be so anxious?

262
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,090
It's just...

263
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,020
Do you really remember nothing from before?

264
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,030
I'm  Shangguan Qiu Yue's younger sister.

265
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,050
I even set afire Fengming Mountain Manor.

266
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,230
I don't remember! However, Xiao Bai, you just ask straightforwardly,

267
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,130
I'll tell you anything I know.

268
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,560
I want to know everything about you, Miss.

269
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,470
Since Young Master Qin is so absent-minded, I won't waste your time anymore.

270
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,220
Miss Leng, please don't go anywhere. I want to make it up to you.

271
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,490
My thoughts really were not wandering.

272
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,240
It's just tha...

273
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,470
There are some matters that are so unimaginable.

274
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:46,350
- Is it related to Miss Chun Hua? 
 - Why do you say that?

275
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,970
At the poem meeting, Miss Chun Hua was amazing.

276
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,690
Her name is now famous in the land.

277
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,660
Miss Chun Hua surely isn't of the martial arts circle.

278
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,720
It's logical she defies trivial conventions.

279
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,040
You take her side as if I was purposely blaming her.

280
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,170
- I didn't mean it that way. 
 - I don't care what you meant.

281
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,390
Young Master Qin keeps mentioning Miss Chun Hua.

282
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:14,410
Why don't you tell Miss Chun Hua the incredible event?

283
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,130
But I don't remember... I only remember what happened after I woke up.

284
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,100
Then what happened before you awoke?

285
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,240
Was Miss hurt by someone? Or—

286
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
I only remember that

287
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,010
the first person I saw after awaking was you.

288
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,080
I only remember that

289
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,220
Young Master, whether practicing martial arts or doing anything else,

290
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,630
you are very focus in all.

291
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,760
I only remember that

292
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,970
whenever I am in danger,

293
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,860
Young Master always rescue me.

294
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,750
I also remember that

295
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,940
I-I dishonored Young Master in his private pool.

296
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,650
Pardon me! I was rash.

297
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,290
Please don't remember such incidents, Miss.

298
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,410
I-I-I forgot already!

299
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,270
Miss, you haven't eaten anything properly all day.

300
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,770
Right now, do you still have an appetite for anything?

301
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,220
Xiao Bai is still the most considerate.

302
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,660
I do!

303
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,000
I have something to say to Young Master Xiao.

304
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,930
Miss Feng, what do you wish to say?

305
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,920
It concerns the martial arts circles.

306
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,250
I'm afraid Miss Chun Hua would be disinterested.

307
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,270
Miss Chun Hua, you've just sobered.

308
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,840
Why don't you go to your room and rest?

309
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,170
All right.

310
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,270
Miss, please speak.

311
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,570
- Today's poem society— 
 - Miss Feng.

312
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,990
Today, Miss Chun Hua didn't do it intentionally.

313
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,340
It's best to forget these matters.

314
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,720
Why does Young Master easily trust Miss Chun Hua?

315
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,570
As a righteous martial arts sect, we must be fair.

316
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,850
We shouldn't suspect anyone without good reason.

317
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,220
Furthermore, Miss Chun Hua is a weak girl without martial arts skill and with no family.

318
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,400
Her heart is innocent but she just approaches some matters recklessly.

319
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,860
She certainly has no ill will.

320
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,040
I clearly heard another voice from inside her room but when we entered, there was only her.

321
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,740
- This kind of explanation... 
 - Miss Feng,

322
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,440
I have my own reasons.

323
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,450
It's simply that now is not a suitable time to tell you.

324
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:27,410
Young Master, you only hear what you want.

325
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,760
Thanks for your reminder.

326
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,850
It's getting late. Miss Feng, please go back and rest.

327
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,710
There is still another matter.

328
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,500
Is the garmentthat I gifted you

329
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,600
suitable for you?

330
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I didn't have enough time to try it on yet.

331
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,800
If the garment is not suitable, please tell me

332
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,060
so I can alter it for you.

333
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,600
I didn't expect Young Master Qin would be such a gifted scholar with practical martial arts skills.

334
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,850
It's "jack of all trades kung fu," nothing compared to Brother Xiao's.

335
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,350
Miss Chun Hua, did you have a nice chat with Brother Xiao last night?

336
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,070
Very good We also had a small midnight snack.

337
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,750
Oh, that's right! Young Master Qin, I recommend a wonton shop that is very good.

338
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,300
- We— 
 - Miss, you are concealing some of your identity.

339
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,410
Do you have any trouble that you're reluctant to discuss?

340
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,850
Concealing?

341
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,750
I have a lying devil brother or I am an arsonist?

342
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,230
If it were me, I wouldn't be so stupid.

343
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,280
If the Young Master knows, it will just...

344
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,400
Young Master Qin, what are you saying? I truly don't understand.

345
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,200
Yesterday at the poem meeting, Brother Xiao didn't blame Miss Chun Hua.

346
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,800
If you intentionally fool him, Brother Xiao will become suspicious.

347
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,600
By then, your Xiao Bai will be quickly stolen by others.

348
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,500
Just don't blame me for not warning you.

349
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,600
Young Master Qin, you're must be kidding.

350
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,700
I'm someone who lost my memory.

351
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,000
How could I conceal something? Right?

352
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,400
Miss Chun Hua, have you packed up everything?

353
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,400
This afternoon we'll prepare to return.

354
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,470
Thanks for your reminder, Miss Leng. I'll go and pack now...

355
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,800
Father, what are you doing here?

356
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,000
I heard something about yesterday's poem meeting.

357
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Sure enough, as you said, this girl cannot be trusted.

358
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,400
Moreover, not only that, but

359
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,900
Miss Chun Hua gave herself away yesterday.

360
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,600
She imitated Young Master Xiao's voice to fool me behind the door.

361
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,340
Just as expected, only the Demon Sect has the skill to imitate voices.

362
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,420
How could an ordinary person easily learn that?

363
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:58,010
But yesterday, I talked to Young Master Xiao about it to no avail.

364
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,360
I was unable to convince him without evidence.

365
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,160
The Chief of the Alliance is seriously ill and powerless.

366
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,780
But we can't just sit by and watch.

367
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,870
Take her to the woods outside town.

368
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,630
I'll also wait there for you.

369
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,750
You and I will interrogate her.

370
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,740
We will surely obtain detailed, accurate evidence.

371
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,070
After I return to Fengming Mountain Manor, I can be alone with Xiao Bai.

372
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,120
Miss Chun Hua, no need for you to return today.

373
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,300
I've told the Young Master that you'll take a stroll with me.

374
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,350
What do you mean?

375

 ''The Unfinished Moment'' by Singer: Li Hongyi 

377
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,530
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

378
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,390
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

379
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,800
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking its eye  ♫

380
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,990
♫  Seeing through love's fickleness  ♫

381
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,100
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

382
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,310
♫  It's such a pity for not stepping forward  ♫

383
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:42,460
♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

384
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:49,100
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

385
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,510
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

386
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,990
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

387
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,870
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

388
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:07,190
♫  It's hard to walk on. There's even no one to argue with  ♫

389
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,430
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

390
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,730
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

391
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,650
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

392
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:26,490
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

393

409
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,770
♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

410
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,930
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

411
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,640
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

412
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,980
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

413
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,320
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

414
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,670
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

415
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,630
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

416
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:53,600
♫  Yet how can you still not see it  ♫
