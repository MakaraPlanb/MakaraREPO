31
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,630
[Episode 1]

32
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,010
 In the year 2169, mankind already achieved immortality. 

33
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,800
 People can undergo the process of physiologically reducing emotional responses and 

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,270
 wearing the helmet of virtual love. 

35
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,590
 By launching the micro-current stimulus program, 

36
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,730
- one can experience the climax of love.  
 - Stop!

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,620
I don't want the physiological stimulation!

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,650
I want to experience an actual love.

39
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,150
 The Sky Thunder System can satisfy your wish 

40
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,400
- but you must give up immortality.  
 - I'm willing! 

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,260
 Without love, what is the point of immortality?

42
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,740
 I'll give up immortality. 

43
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,370
 Do you have any requirements for your love journey? 

44
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,810
I want my Mr. Right to be exceptionally handsome, devoted,

45
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,390
very powerful, and spoils me with a lot and a lot of sweets.

46
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,890
He can handle some bugs. He should be charismatic and decisive.

47
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,570
He can be a Mary Sue, but he should be aloof and not too old fashioned.

48
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,500
Your theme of self-destruction is,

49
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,830
"When will the spring flower and autumn moon end?" 
 ("spring flower' is Chun Hua and "autumn moon" is Qiu Yue in Chinese - this question implies a never-ending relationship)

52
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,000
Bear in mind, the rule of the first one who comes into your sight!

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,990
The first man you shall see is your Mr. Right.

54
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,170
- The count-down is now starting! Three. 
 - What does that mean? 

55
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,330
- If I don't like Mr. Right, 
 - Two.

56
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,330
- can I switch? 
 - One.

59
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,510
Bear in mind the rule of the first one who comes into your sight!

60
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,150
The first man whom you see is your Mr. Right.

61
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,090
Husband!

62
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,240
Where is the agreed-upon Mr. Right?

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,570
He's just the grim reaper!

64
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,250
I didn't expect to encounter such a thrilling beginning.

65
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,890
But I do like it.

66
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,530
We can talk in a civil manner.

67
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,850
- Why pull out the sword? 
 - How dare you!

68
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,350
You dare to disobey our young master?

69
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,750
Young Master?

70
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,560
Does that mean I'm the future young master's wife?

71
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,940
You have eaten the longevity fruit and killed the healer!

72
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,780
Who is the healer?

73
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,270
What's the longevity fruit?

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,710
If you say that I killed someone, then I really killed him?

75
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,310
Then I say that you killed someone and framed me.

76
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,110
Young Master, he is still alive.

77
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,060
- It's indeed her. 
 - It's her.

78
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,160
Just tell them that, "I'm not the killer."

79
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,460
It has nothing to do with me.

80
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,150
- Me? 
 - As the matter stands, I am unable to tolerate your continuous quibbling.

81
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,970
Give me your life!

82
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,590
Fu Lou?

83
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,990
Young Master, I'll go after him!

84
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,390
What is your relationship with Fu Lou?

85
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,490
Fu Lou?

86
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,460
Then, what kind of relationship should I have with him?

87
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,710
You said, "there is none," so why did he rescue you?

88
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,860
He rescued me?

89
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,380
That's not right.

90
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,500
Clearly, Husband saved me.

91
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,990
You're frightening me to death.

92
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,850
Don't kill me!

93
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,570
Miss, what is your name?  Why are you here?

94
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,010
Can you withdraw the sword first? I'm scared.

95
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,920
Miss, there is no need for you to be scared. I'm Xiao Bai. (Xiao means little or young. Bai means white)

96
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,200
My father is a leader in martial arts circles.

97
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,490
The son of a martial arts leader?

98
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,780
They must have vast and fertile lands and countless disciples!

99
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,990
I came to find a cure for my father.

100
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,460
I came to find and beg for the longevity fruit from the healer.

101
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,070
But I unexpectedly came across this crime.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,090
Miss, if you know anything, just tell me.

103
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,360
 What can I know? 

104
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,310
 The system didn't tell me anything. 

105
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,000
Let me tell you

106
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,780

108
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,040
Full of nonsense!  Who exactly are you?

Young Master!

110
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,570
Chief Feng, did you discover any clues at Fu Lou's place?

111
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,490
Fu Luo indeed came for the longevity fruit, but it's just that...

112
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm incapable, thus, I allowed him to escape.

114
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,230

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,290
Are you calling me?

118
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,820
Such an old fashioned name!

119
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,600
She really lost her memory?

120

Lost memory?

121
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,480
This set-up is not bad.

122
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,050
Since all of the disciples from the Baxian Residence identified her,

123
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,300
she certainly must have killed the healer.

124
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,440
I observed her hands, it doesn't look like she practices martial arts.

125

My husband is amazing.

126

For the time being, you should come along with me to the Fengming Mountain Manor.

127

After Hua Xiaolei betrayed you, she died.

132
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,820
I heard, she ate the longevity fruit the day before yesterday and came back to life.

133
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,500
However, she has even lost her memory.

134

Now, she was saved by the Fengming Mountain Manor.

135
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,710
Do you want me to drag her back and question her about the longevity fruit?

136
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,620
Ye Xingzhu, you are too naïve.

137

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,890
I brought back a girl from the healer's residence.

173
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,010
She came back to life after she ate the longevity fruit.

174
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,750
Life and death are dictated by fate.

175
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,320
You should give importance to the martial arts world.

176
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,800
Stick to the right track.

177
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,470
The identity of that miss is unknown.

178
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,170
You should investigate her identity carefully.

179
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,020
I understand.

180
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,360
Xiao Bai? Xiao Bai.

181
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,600
Miss Chun Hua, that is not your seat.

182
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,770
Since the seat across is not mine,

183
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,010
then I can only sit next to Xiao Bai.

184
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,460
How can you be so impolite?

185
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,540
Forget it!  Let her be.

186
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,770
Xiao Bai, I heard that there is something called...

187
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,330
longevity fruit.

188
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,850
Eating it can bring someone back to life.

189
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,850
- True or false? 
 - Young Master, the longevity fruit,

190
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,900
is it just Shangguan Qiu Yue's trick?

191
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,630
The self-destruction theme is when Chun Hua and Qiu Yue will come to an end.

192
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,050
Shangguan Qiu Yue?

193
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,000
Who is Shangguan Qiu Yue?

194
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,480
What do you mean who, it's Qianyue Sect's leader

195
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,630
What is Qianyue Sect?

196
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,600
A Demon Sect.

197
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,740
Since I am Chun Hua, would Qiu Yue be my relative?

198
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,270
Sister?

199
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,400
Chun Hua, Qiu Yue, such vulgar names!

200
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,620
It's great to have the leader of the Demon Sect as my relative.

201
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,500
So great. Really great, so great!

202
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,820
People of Qianyue Sect kill innocent people, such bloodlusts, you dare...

203
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,940
You can't tell right from wrong.

204
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,350
The demon sect is so vicious.

205
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,240
We need to draw a clear distinction with them.

206
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,930
Miss Chun Hua,

207
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,440
medical records say that you rose from the dead.

208
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,900
Do you still remember how you came back to life?

209
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,430
The system planned it.

210
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,570
You mean...

211
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,760
[Spring Welcoming Pavilion]

212
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,710
Come closer!

213
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,850
Come closer and I will tell you.

214
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,760
What do you mean by this?

215
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,370
Miss, just stand right there and tell me.  I can hear you.

216
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,680
Don't want me to come closer?

217
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,660
Then I'll let you come to me.

218
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,700
Just ask whatever you want to ask.

219
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,390
Miss, what is the first thing that you remember?

220
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,450
Miss, louder please.

221
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,300
Come over here!

222
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,880
Say that one more time.

223
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,600
Actually, just now I couldn't hear you clearly. What did you ask?

224
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,350
I just asked, what is the first thing that you remember?

225
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,340
It's you.

226
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,070
Then since you had consumed the longevity fruit,

227
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,830
do you remember how it looks like?

228
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,180
I remember…

229
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,570
how you look like.

230
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,020
I also remember calling you “husband”.

231
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,370
Step aside!

232
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,370
You brought me back, yet you don’t care about me.

233
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,460
Now that we are finally able to see each other, you’re still asking all sorts of questions.

234
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,280
Aren’t you afraid that someone might want to murder me?

235
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,540
Lu Xiu will protect you.

236
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,640
What if that person is so skilled in martial arts that even Lu Xiu can’t win against him?

237
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,380
Personally, I think that you should–

238
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,840
You need not worry. This is Fengming Mountain Manor, after all.

239
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,690
 He does not understand a woman's heart! 

240
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,110
Young Master.

241
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,150
How is it?

242
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,630
Is there anything unusual about Miss Chun Hua?

243
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,950
Other than being ignorant of etiquettes,

244
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,000
there is nothing unusual about her.

245
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
However…

246
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,800
However, what?

247
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,510
She directly addresses you by name.

248
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,580
It seems she believes that both of you have a very close relationship.

249
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,150
This might have been caused by the loss of her memory.

250
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,230
However, it seems that she truly doesn’t know about etiquette.

251
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,280
Don’t listen to her nonsense! Continue observing her secretly.

252
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,910
Yes.

253
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,190
Miss Chun Hua, where are you going?

254
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,190
I want to have a look at what Xiao Bai is currently doing.

255
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,210
Does Miss Chun Hua really not remember anything?

256
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,750
I really do not remember anything.

257
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,710
Fengming Mountain Manor, also known as martial arts of Bei Dou, the leader of of all sects in the martial arts circles.

258
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,260
It’s because of this Xiao Xiao Fengming Saber (the name of a martial art skill)

259
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,370
that the Demon Sect is afraid of committing evil deeds,

260
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,880
allowing peace in our land.

261
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,360
Then…

262
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,960
What’s the story behind the Demon Sect?

263
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,960
One hundred years ago, the head of the demon sect, Nan Xinghe, went on a rampage in the pugilist world.

264
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,660
Later, the Xiao family ancestors joined forces with several huge sects to eliminate him.

265
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,220
After Nan Xinghe’s death, the demon sect suffered a huge blow.

266
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,320
They later split into two different sects: Qianyue Sect and Chuanqi Sect.

267
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,190
The pugilist world now consists of the Wulin sects,

268
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,050
Qianyue Sect and Chuanqi Sect,

269
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,540
forming a tripartite confrontation situation.

270
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,330
Tell me more about Qianyue Sect?

271
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,020
Qianyue Sect is vicious in its ways.

272
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,760
It is rumored that the leader, Shangguan Qiu Yue,

273
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,700
is extremely ugly.

274
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,080
But I heard that anyone who has seen her…

275
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,240
Why are we bringing her up for?

276
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,400
If you put it this way…

277
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,260
Shangguan Qiu Yue and Xiao Bai are unable to coexist with one another.

278
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,690
Miss Chun Hua. Miss Chun Hua!

279
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,390
Miss Chun Hua.

280
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,980
Miss Chun Hua!

281
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,870
Miss Chun Hua, quickly wake up to go up the mountain with me.

282
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,760
Why do I need to go up the mountain? I’m not going.

283
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,200
Just go by yourself!

284
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,990
The weather is fine and the air is fresh.

285
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,060
Miss Lu Xiu, let’s set out now!

286
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,560
I can’t take it anymore! I can’t walk anymore!

287
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,460
Just go by yourself! In any case, I’m not going.

288
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,990
Miss Chun Hua, why do you not use your lightness skill?

289
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,730
Lightness skill?

290
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,420
People in Fengming Mountain Manor all know martial arts?

291
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,580
Of course!  Especially our Xiao family’s Xiao Xiao Fengming Saber.

292
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,570
It is said to no longer be passed down.

293
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,530
Lu Xiu, could it be that you like Xiao Bai?

294
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,550
Young Master already has a marriage engagement since young.

295
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,560
I won’t dare to have such feelings.

296
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,150
Miss Chun Hua must be joking.

297
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,360
What did you say? Marriage engagement? Who does he have a marriage engagement with?

298
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,090
Tell me!

299
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,720
Back then, Leader Xiao and Old Master Hua became relatives by marriage.

300
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,620
However, before they got married, Young Master’s bride, Hua Xiao Lei,

301
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,570
passed away.

302
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,290
The bride died before she could move into the groom’s household?

303
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,950
In that case, Xiao Bai is still single.

304
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,660
I see that it's getting late.

305
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,460
Miss, hurry up and follow after me.

306
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,300
Forget it! Then stay here and wait for me.

307
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,830
Remember, you must not go anywhere.

308
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,900
Don’t go anywhere, okay?

309
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,860
 Xiao Bai, I’m sorry. 

310
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,830
 Allow me to be infatuated for a minute. 

311
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,130
Don’t be afraid! Open your eyes.

312
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,270
Thank you, Young Master, for helping me out. I have nothing to repay you with, except for–

313
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,490
Your body?

314
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,130
 Such a smooth talker! I’m going to be tricked by an expert. 

315
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,030
 Such a pity, my supporting male lead. 

316
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,360
Without a doubt, I only have money to repay you with.

317
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,000
Then how much do you think you’re worth?

318
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,790
Then… how much do you think I am worth?

319
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,490
A thousand gold? Ten thousand gold?

320
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,090
 D*mn! I've met a scammer. 

321
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,060
All of these aren’t enough in exchange for your life.

322
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,530
I think that you are priceless.

323
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,620
Since that’s the case, I’ll take my leave.

324
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,260
In the future, I will definitely repay your great kindness. Bye!

325
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,070
Wait a minute!

326
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,750
Since you are priceless,

327
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,550
I think you can only marry me in return.

328
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:41,180
I am Xiao Bai's young wife of the famous Fengming Mountain Manor.

329
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,560
If you want money, then you can go to the Fengming Mountain Manor. But if you want me,

330
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,940
let me tell you, you must be tired of living.

331
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,810
Really?

332
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,120
Indeed.

333
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,930
Would it be possible for me to ask the young wife of the manor for a favor?

334
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,920
How about solving my tiredness?

335
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,380
You...

336
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,230
It's you? Hua...

337
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,750
Do you know me?

338
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,710
Yes, I'm Chun Hua.

339
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,490
Where are you from?

340
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,390
Qianyue Sect.

341
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,840
Oh, so we're family, aren't we?

342
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,700
Since that's the case, take me to see Shangguan Qiu Yue. Let's go.

343
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,110
That's right.

344
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,710
You guessed correctly.

345
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,720
I am Shangguan Chun Hua.

346
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,950
Shangguan Qiu Yue's older sister. Let's go.

347
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,660
Let's go, quickly take me to see my younger sister. Let's go.

348
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,590
Let's go! Let's go!

349
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,120
Since when does my family's little Chun Hua have a younger sister?

350
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,730
Shangguan Qiu Yue is my younger sister.

351
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,780
If she were here, she would have already recognized me.

352
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,400
At any rate, you all don't need to care about this so much,

353
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,380
just take me to my younger sister, that's fine. Let's go.

354
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,500
You've already seen him.

355
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,920
You?

356
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,880
Shangguan Qiu Yue is...

357
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,720
a man?

358
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,790
Who told you I was a woman?

359
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,410
Is he really Shangguan Qiu Yue?

360
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,470
Didn't Lu Xiu say she was a hideous and evil woman?

361
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,460
How do I know you're not lying to me?

362
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,830
Sure enough, Xiao Chun Hua does not remember,

363
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,030
you are my younger sister.

364
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,070
Since I woke up with the healer, I haven't remembered anything.

365
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,100
Since you've lost your memory, why did you still want to find me?

366
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,540
Because when will Chun Hua and Qiu Yue come to an end?

367
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,590
Interesting!

368
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,790
If I had known, I wouldn't have let you go on this mission.

369
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,520
Now, it turns out to be like this.

370
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,580
What mission?

371
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,260
You rarely went out in the past.

372
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:58,620
This time, you decided to go to Fengming Mountain Manor, saying you will steal the Xin Fa. 
 (Xin Fa = a cultivation method of the heart)

373
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,120
Not only did you fail to steal it,

374
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,710
you also ended up being wounded like this.

375
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,780
You are really my older brother?

376
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,840
What are you doing?

377
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,060
Weren't you suspicious that I am lying to you?

378
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,400
On your body, you have a pink birthmark

379
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,920
that is in the shape of a flower bud. That's why you were named Chun Hua.

380
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,860
It looks like he really is Shangguan Qiu Yue.

381
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,380
But he doesn't fit Lu Xiu's description.

382
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,440
Has no one seen him before?

383
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,720
I can tell you, no need to make a move.

384
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,250
It's not good if someone sees it.

385
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,120
Who can see?

386
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,170
Then I will gouge out her eyes so she can't see.

♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
