Your injury should have already been healed.

- Miss Chun Hua just— 
 - Why did you mention her?

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,490
You should do your best to maintain Qianyue Cave's reputation.

34
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,300
Isn't it just a poison of love? Just wait for ten days, at most half a month,

35
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,860
I'll forget you and live happily on my own.

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,280
Do you really hate me that much?

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,940
Even if it's for your own sake, just forget him.

38
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,860

[Baxian Manor]

43
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,210
Young Chief Master, please come in.

44
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,190
Baxian City is just a small place.

45
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,700
Baxian Resident is also not very roomy.

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,810
I was worried Young Chief Master wasn't willing to attend such a simple and crude occasion.

47
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,310
You are too courteous, Master Bu'er.

48
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,210
Sit, sit, sit! Please have a sit

[Excellent Medical Skills] 
 (TN: lit. "Set out and it becomes spring." An idiom that means to effect a miracle cure)

50
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,950
Everyone travels from afar for my brother's issue.

51
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,540
Today, I've prepared some simple dishes and light wine to show my respect.

52
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,080
It's our job to investigate the death of the Healer.

53
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,250
Be that as it may, everyone has run around.

54
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,050
I am truly feeling guilty about this.

55
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,870
This dish is so vibrant in color.

56
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,520
Unfortunately, my health is weak so I don't have the luck to enjoy it.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,880
I'm afraid I can't digest it.

58
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,340
You are so funny, Young Master Qin.

59
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,560
Baxian Residence is very well prepared with medicine.

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,190
If your stomach really feels unwell,

61
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,670
I will prescribe the whole year's medicine for you.

62
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,560
Thank you for your kindness, Master Bu'er.

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,170
We should treat each other open-heartedly.

64
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,430
Please behave!

65
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,650
This—

66
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,870
Don't be polite! Let's all eat.

67
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,860
Let's eat! Let's eat!

68
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,640
Could it be that these dishes

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,940
are not suitable for everyone's appetite?

70
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,550
Master Bu'er, the Longevity fruit has caused so much trouble to the Martial Arts world.

71
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,620
Even the Healer's death, we haven't found out the truth after 2 years.

72
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,960
I feel very guilty about it.

73
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,940
Things about the Longevity fruit initially, are very unreal.

74
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,750
Young Chief Master, there is no need to be too hard on yourself.

75
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,120
Master Bu'er, you don't need to calculate the gains and losses of this.

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,350
We made this trip to Baxian City,

77
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,970
not only to investigate the Healer's case,

78
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,170
but also to look for the Healer's Longevity fruit.

79
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,990
Now, the Longevity fruit's whereabouts is a mystery.

80
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,960
We are afraid it will fall into the hands of Shangguan Qiu Yue.

81
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,710
Is that so?

82
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,750
Do not worry, Young Chief Master!

83
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,810
The Longevity fruit is this amazing?

84
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,830
Who can really possess it?

85
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,540
- Is that so? 
 - Of course!

86
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,840
That longevity fruit—

87
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,730
Master Bu'er, you may have forgotten! The Longevity fruit has already been destroyed by us.

88
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,690
Hence, the pugilist world remains unusually peaceful these days.

89
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,350
Destroyed already?

90
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,350
Then why have Young Master Qin and Young Chief Master been looking for a destroyed item still?

91
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,410
Then that destroyed Longevity fruit...

92
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,460
That destroyed Longevity fruit is fake.

93
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,000
We both know about this.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's just that I can't figure out how Master Bu'er

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,880
also knew that the Longevity fruit is fake?

96
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,910
I—

97
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,740
The auction of the Longevity fruit ended up with blood flowing like a stream and a field littered with corpses.

98
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,800
The Young Chief Master thinks this thing must be a disaster to stay in the world.

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Coincidently, no one has seen the Longevity fruit before,

100
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,970
so we made a fake one and destroyed it on the spot in public.

101
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,090
No one outside of our circle knew about this.

102
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,810
How did Master Bu'er find out about that?

103
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,160
I've never seen the real Longevity fruit.

104
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,960
I just thought about how there could be such an amazing thing in our world,

105
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,600
so I just assumed it was a fake.

106
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,680
Miss Chun Hua, I heard that

107
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,970
it was you who exposed the secret in front of everyone

108
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,790
that the Longevity fruit was a fake.

109
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,870
But after that, you suddenly were with Shangguan Qiu Yue.

110
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,170
About that...

111
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,320
After thinking about it, I even thought maybe Shangguan Qiu Yue

112
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,060
had your heart, forcing you to lie for him.

113
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,990
But seeing you today, I see that Young Chief Master and Young Madam...

114
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,160
are a couple in love.

115
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,100
So in the end, are you saying the Longevity fruit is fake.

116
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,470
I'm afraid it's indeed a true fact.

117
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,330
Let's just talk about the Longevity fruit at a later time.

118
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,940
Here, here, here! Let's eat.

119
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,590
We shouldn't have this meal, should we?

120
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,530
The Longevity fruit is fake but the Soft Muscle Powder is real.

121
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,270
Master Bu'er's kindness, it seems that we can't afford it.

122
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,960
A mere verbal statement has no guarantee.

123
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,080
What evidence do you have?

124
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,540
A little birdy of mine would never lie.

125
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,940
You poisoned the food to stop us,

126
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,640
so the Demon Sect could catch us all in one fell swoop.

127
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,500
It's such a pity that yesterday, someone told me of this wicked plan.

128
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,530
So today, we came to attend your banquet to see more of your plans.

129
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,480
No. This... How can this be?

130
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,980
These dishes were all prepared by my servant, Li Yu, himself.

131
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,200
How good!

132
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,580
You have the audacity

133
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,830
to poison our food?

134
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,540
You are hypocritical and even slandering your disciple.

135
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,740
Li Yu respects you all the time but you just slander him.

136
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,370
Where would he get the time to prepare these dishes for you?

137
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,420
You said there is poison in this food.

138
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,110
Let me tell you the truth! About this Soft Muscle Powder,

139
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,550
we already knew very early on.

140
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,290
I see!

141
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,810
You are really a good disciple of our clinic.

142
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,910
Miss Feng, I do not know the reason why you are suspecting me.

143
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,890
instead of my unaccomplished disciple.

144
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:50,670
You would trust this gambler, rather than trusting me, a philanthropist of this town?

145
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,450
Philanthropist?

146
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,990
What a ridiculous comparison! You have been wanting us to show you some evidence.

147
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,500
Am I right?

148
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,280
These are all of Baxian Residence's account books.

149
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,330
Back then, your business had been spiraling downhill;

150
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,080
however, later you got a sudden windfall.

151
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,010
Master Bu'er, the origin of this windfall,

152
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,570
you know better than all of us.

153
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,700
You... You guys...

154
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,560
Speaking of these accounting books, I still need to first thank Brother Li.

155
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,900
You were not the one who directly gave it to me, but I did know where to steal it from your place.

156
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,670
Li Yu,

157
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,450
you had the nerve to steal my accounting books?

158
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,900
Bu'er, the Healer treated me like his own son.

159
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,330
He taught me martial arts and medical skills.

160
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,000
However, he died in an unexplained circumstance.

161
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,650
After the Healer died,

162
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,320
my mother and I were under your control,

163
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,500
we can only drag out an ignoble existence.

164
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,300
I have seen what you have done clearly.

165
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,600
Luckily, the Young Chief Master and his fellows came to Baxian City

166
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,370
to investigate the truth of the Healer's death.

167
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,940
Thus, I got the chance to show the silver needle in the restaurant and probed into what happened, step by step.

168
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,500
Finally, I led them to find out about Baxian Residence, a place that shelters evil people and countenances evil practices.

169
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,150
You...

170
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,840
Whatever, I am sure you have already reviewed the accounts.

171
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,030
If I was really Master Shi,

172
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,270
Why would I have so little property?

173
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,680
If you are going to accuse me of being Master Shi based on these two  accounting books,

174
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,870
then I have nothing more to say.

175
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,230
Bu'er has a weird habit.

176
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,770
He likes to sweep this hallway by himself.

177
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,390
At least, 3 times a day.

178
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm not sure if he has obsessive-compulsive disorder or isn't willing to spend money to hire people.

179
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,780
You'd better think about how to share Bu'er's cares and burdens.

180
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,220
[Three]

181
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,490
Young Chief Master,

182
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,260
look at the pillars outside.

183
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,110
- How is it? 
 - Nothing.

184
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,420
Young Chief Master, in this long corridor, just examine the left three pillars and the right three pillars.

185
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,660
This is the evidence!

186
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,650
Master Bu'er surely is smart.

187
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,180
The pillars are made of wood on the outside,

188
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,800
and gold on the inside.

189
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,780
What else do you want to say, Master Bu'er?

190
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,240
Young Chief Master, don't come into the building.

191
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,570
Miss Chun Hua!

192
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,520
Bu'er?

193
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,780
This Team Leader Gu is like a God who can predict with miraculous accuracy.

194
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:05,560
Do you smell a strong aroma of alcohol and vegetables?

195
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,280
I tell you the truth, this is the Snake Saliva Incense.

196
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,490
This is what Team Leader Gu brought from Qianyue Cave.

197
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,010
The effect is very nice.

198
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,430
As for the antidote, I have already taken it.

199
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,980
In regards to these other people,

200
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,270
they will not be so lucky.

201
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,980
You—

202
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,690
I just knew you were not reliable.

203
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,730
Thankfully I still have a helpful hand.

204
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,920
When I am done with them, I will get back to you.

205
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,680
Bu'er, under this current situation, you still do not repent.

206
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,850
Do you know what future ending is awaiting you?

207
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,970
Future? I'm afraid you don't have a future.

208
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,960
Your martial arts skills are strong but don't forget my Snake Saliva Incense is also fierce.

209
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,980
As long as you get closer,

210
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,180
you will just be like them, dropping down onto the floor as well.

211
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,880
They want to get rid of the poison with their internal force now,

212
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,750
it'll take at least two hours.

213
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,070
A lot of things can happen in two hours.

214
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,690
Shangguan Qiu Yue is missing with a serious injury.

215
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,580
Young Chief Master, you cannot save the current situation by yourself.

216
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,980
It seems the banquet today

217
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,920
is a good opportunity for me to take advantage.

218
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,380
Bu'er,  as long as I am alive,

219
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,690
I definitely will not let you win.

220
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,420
I know you all refuse to give in to me

221
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,300
and also look down upon me.

222
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,670
Look! These are this elegant Young Master Qin,

223
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,360
beautiful Miss Feng, and

224
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,570
young and promising Miss Leng.

225
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,250
You are all from noble and wealthy families.

226
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,180
Who could expect that today,

227
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,530
you all could fall for my trap.

228
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,140
Yes, yes, yes, yes! There is still you,

229
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,040
the young lady whom Shangguan Qiu Yue and Xiao Bai both protect.

230
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,600
I want to see how precious you are.

231
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,090
Bu'er, stop it!

232
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,330
Young Chief Master, the censer! The poison is in the censer behind Bu'er.

233
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,190
Shut up!

234
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,340
You live on me while helping others secretly.

235
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,390
Get out the antidote!

236
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,820
The antidote is with Shangguan Qiu Yue.

237
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,440
I do not have any.

238
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,340
Shangguan Qiu Yue never says a word of truth,

239
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,020
I am just a pawn for him.

240
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,600
He has always been using me.

241
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,300
I used up all the antidote that the Team Leader Gu gave me.

242
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,150
Give it here!

243
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,310
Okay.

244
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,650
[A Kind Heart with Kind Skills]

245
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,910
This place is sure lively.

246
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,420
Master Shang... Cave Master Shangguan, it is me!

247
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,900
Cave Master Shangguan! Cave Master Shangguan, save me. Save me, please!

248
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,540
I thought you said that I can't speak a word of truth, and you still want me to save you?

249
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,910
You incited a fight between Fengming Mountain Manor and Qianyue Cave,

250
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,270
and you are still asking me to save you?

251
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,360
Bu'er, your death is not to be regretted.

252
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,350
How many sanguinary slaughters in the Martial Arts world were caused by your greed?

253
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,160
Stupid. Incapable. Greedy. Crazy.

254
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,460
You are even not qualified to get into a Demon Sect.

255
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,500
You are the younger brother of the Healer.

256
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,530
The Healer is very helpful and generous.

257
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,330
He only focuses on healing and rescuing people.

258
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,520
As for you? You covet wealth and properties.

259
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,370
You just want to enrich yourself.

260
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,280
It is such a shame that your medical skill is not adequate,

261
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,370
so you are jealous of your older brother.

262
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,150
You heard that the Healer had found the Longevity fruit,

263
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,660
so you found this way to steal it once for all.

264
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,620
It is you who used me! It is you who used me!

265
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,700
If you don't have any greed, how could I tempt you?

266
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,090
The person who killed the Healer,

267
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,620
is Bu'er?

268
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,250
It's close to the truth now.

269
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,460
Not so fast.

270
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,190
It was the Longevity fruit produced by this Master Shi

271
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,050
that made both of the Righteous Path and the Demon Sects against each other.

272
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,210
You almost perished together.

273
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,540
First is Fu Lou from  Chuanqi Gorge, and then it's Chief Feng Qianwei from Xisha Sect.

274
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,140
However, Fu Lou did this for his beloved one.

275
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,400
As for Feng Qianwei,

276
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,450
is an absolute base person.

277
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,140
He wanted to get his hand on the Longevity fruit for his own.

278
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,300
He couldn't get it by force so he decided to kill the Healer.

279
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,800
I don't believe you.

280
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,520
I don't believe that my father killed the Healer.

281
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,150
Miss Feng,

282
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,820
Brother Qin and I have made the conclusion very early on.

283
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,650
The Healer was probably killed by Chief Feng.

284
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,280
However,

285
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,830
the martial arts skills from Chief Feng and the Healer are about the same.

286
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,260
Chief Feng shouldn't be able to kill the Healer just by one move.

287
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,060
It seems that Young Chief Master has a close relationship with Miss Feng.

288
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,510
A little confusion, even in a certain truth,

289
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,020
can make you to dare not confirm that Chief Feng is indeed the murderer.

290
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,270
Tell them the reasons!

291
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,730
That day, I heard my brother saved a girl

292
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,830
from death using the Longevity fruit.

293
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,280
I thought that there may be some truth in that the Longevity fruit is real.

294
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,450
Hence, I asked for it from him.

295
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,620
I didn't expect to get a lecture from him.

296
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,630
I didn't expect, that person who wants to kill me,

297
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,300
turns out to be Feng Qianwei.

298
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,290
Truth be known, in this world,

299
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,530
how could there be a Longevity fruit?

300
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,930
Older Brother,

301
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,100
you just saved that young Miss.

302
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,430
If she hadn't consumed the Longevity fruit as you claimed,

303
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,030
then what did you use to save her?

304
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:22,090
Older Brother, just give me the Longevity fruit.

305
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,180
Let's make a fortune together!

306
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,730
You should be kind-hearted to be a healer.

307
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,560
A healer should take healing the wounded and saving the dying as his own mission and responsibility.

308
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,590
You shouldn't covet a high position and great wealth.

309
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,180
A lecture again! You have the healer reputation.

310
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,240
As for me! I need to worry about what to eat tomorrow.

311
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,310
Why should I listen to you?

312
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,390
If you aren't filled with such selfish desire,

313
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,490
how can you end up in such a poor situation? 

314
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,320
He told me that there is no shortcut to learning medical skills.

315
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,510
He told me to learn by heart and practice the skills well.

316
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,020
We were brothers of the same mother.

317
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,170
Why was he the Healer while I was just a Bu'er? 
 (TN: "Bu" and "No" are homophones and "er" means second. So his name sounds like next-to-nothing)

318
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,780
You brought this on yourself.

319
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,950
You refused to come to your senses.

320
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,630
Then don't blame me for killing you, Older Brother.

321
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,670
Luckily that day,

322
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,540
I got a little medicine bottle from somewhere else.

323
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,440
Gu Wan gave it to you.

324
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,850
This is the medicine I used for making puppets.

325
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,630
It can temporarily benumb people for a few hours.

326
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,490
It won't leave any trace.

327
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,690
So it was you!

328
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,550
You poisoned the Healer

329
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,870
and asked him the whereabouts of the Longevity fruit.

330
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,620
How could my father understand later on

331
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,730
that the Healer couldn't bear even just one move?

332
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,770
Miss Feng, you are indeed smart.

333
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,510
It was you!

334
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,870
You made my father get on the road of no return.

335
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,070
Chief Feng,

336
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,670
he stroke my brother down with one move.

337
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,550
He was so scared that he jumped out of the window.

338
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,260
Just in case...

339
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,000
By chance he was poisoned first,

340
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,580
then got struck by Chief Feng Qianwei,

341
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,520
and hurt by Bu'er's cleaver eventually.

342
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,230
That's the reason why we couldn't find the murderer.

343
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,600
It turns out the murderer is not just one person.

344
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,370
However, the truth of this matter

345
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,230
was all figured out by Shangguan Qiu Yue.

346
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,860
Since then, I have become his puppet.

347
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,980
He—

348
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,460
I only wanted to know the reason why Hua Xiao Lei came back from the dead.

349
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,110
Thus, I went to see the Healer.

350
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,910
I never expected that I would come face to face with this lunatic.

351
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,710
I just gave him a little tip

352
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,180
but I didn't expect that he would readily be on the road

353
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,470
to auction the nonexistent Longevity fruit.

354
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,310
You killed your own older brother.

355
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,730
Master Bu'er is indeed so cruel as expected.

356
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,890
Why don't I just call you Master Shi in the future? 
 (TN: "Shi" has a meaning of stone or rock, without any feeling.)

357
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,890
Who are you?

358
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,490
Your savior!

359
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,590
Savior?

360
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,200
You killed your own brother just for your own selfish desire.

361
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,500
With such an unscrupulous accusation,

362
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,100
you can't protect Baxian Residence's reputation, can you?

363
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,920
Whatever you want, I can give you all.

364
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,960
I already told you, I'm your savior.

365
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,210
I do not want anything from you.

366
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,840
I can even give you a leeway for you to get out of trouble.

367
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,880
A leeway?

368
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,790
Stretch out your hand!

369
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,130
What is this?

370
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,360
Longevity fruit!

371
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,230
Where is such thing called Longevity fruit?

372
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,620
You obviously are just making fun of me.

373
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,000
Who in this world, has seen the Longevity fruit?

374
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,000
What you mean is...

375
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,680
Master Shi, you now, possess the Longevity fruit.

376
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,470
If you want to rely on it to make money, just tell that to others. 

377
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,870
Isn't it up to you?

378
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,250
However, this Longevity fruit is the panacea bestowed by heaven.

379
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,760
If you are not careful, how can you convince others?

380
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,430
Remember! Take this marvelous medicine only on a full moon day.

381
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,040
It would work the best.

382
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,470
I only gave him some suggestions.

383
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,340
All he did, was also just to spread the news for an auction for the Longevity fruit.

384
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,400
No one knew it would turn out to be like this.

385
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,860
As you can see, people originally are born evil and greedy.

386
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,210
It's not that people are born with evil and greedy intentions.

387
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,470
Being greedy, lazy, and vain

388
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,220
are all people's nature initially.

389
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,270
People use their whole life learning how to resist these desires

390
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,870
and how to get along with the desire.

391
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,310
You just took advantage of the weaknesses of human nature

392
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:26,190
under the guise of the Longevity fruit.

393
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,400
If it were not for you

394
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,900
and your Longevity fruit auction,

395
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,780
how would there be so much bloodshed?

396
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,170
It seems that in Xiao Chun Hua's heart,

397
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,190
I'm also only a heinous evildoer.

398
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,170
At the time like this, you still do not believe me, your brother.

399
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,270
Shangguan Qiu Yue,

400
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,790
what do you want to do?

401
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:16,150
Young Chief Master, whether you believe it or not, with only three moves,

402
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,710
I can take the lives of everyone here.

403
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,190
In terms of the martial arts, you will definitely lose to the Young Chief Master.

404
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,580
But he can't save everyone, all in once.

405
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,620
As long as I am alive,

406
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,950
I will not give you the chance to touch any of them.

407
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,640
Is that so?

408
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,620
Unless I die.

409
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,230
That is fine, too.

410
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,900
Shangguan Qiu Yue.

411
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,810
I am begging you, please leave them be!

412
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,740
Miss Chun Hua!

413
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,750
I thought you had already severed all your ties with me.

414
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,210
Why must I listen to you?

415
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,540
Xiao Bai,

416
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,090
I have always wanted to dignifiedly and visibly battle with you.

417
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,730
Last time, when I was in a fight with others, you took advantage of it

418
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,590
to sneakily attack me.

419
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,730
I was very disappointed.

420
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:31,070
If you think this place is too small, let's step outside.

421
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,750
Young Chief Master!

422
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,920
"Dignifiedly and visibly," when saying by these kind of people,

423
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,430
has such high-sounding but it's completely ridiculous.

424
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,910
Young Master Qin, you really are voicing what others are anxious about.

425
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,130
When all of you have forced out all the poison in your body,

426
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,380
he and I probably would have already finished our battle long before then.

427
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,050
Do you think that using this way,

428
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,620
you could defeat the Young Chief Master?

429
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,250
It doesn't matter if I can kill him.

430
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,530
Anyway, thanks to Master Shi's instigation,

431
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:16,040
there must be a fight between Fengming Mountain Manor and Qianyue Cave.

432
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,290
Now, there are more than ten sects outside the city, approaching here.

433
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,370
Their aims are at you.

434
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,540
It's just because it's Fengming Mountain Manor.

435
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,920
They were all threatened by you.

436
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,110
You tempted Bu'er to spread the news of the Longevity fruit.

437
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,180
You made the fellows of the pugilist world killing each other and shedding blood like water.

438
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:41,770
You took advantage of them and forced them to do something they didn't really want to.

439
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,730
This is where you are wrong.

440
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,610
I didn't force them to do anything.

441
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,160
It's just that they are more willing to believe that I,

442
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,130
in comparison to you,

443
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,960
you,

444
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,340
and all of you,

445
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,080
am more suitable to take over this pugilist world.

446
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,950
Stop killing the innocent,

447
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,910
I've done it.

448
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,980
Distinguish right from wrong,

449
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,040
I also accomplished it.

450
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,210
Unite the martial arts circle and maintain the righteous track.

451
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,850
I'm trying to do it now.

452
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:25,060
Xiao Chun Hua, are you satisfied?

453
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:39,860
I also did not force them but just told them

454
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,420
how to get the thing they want the most.

455
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:51,560
Playing with someone's emotions has always been your specialty.

456
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,720
How many sects have followed you?

457
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,130
From big to small, there are seventeen in total.

458
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:10,530
Young Chief Master, how many sects have followed you?

459
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,240
Shangguan Qiu Yue,

460
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,340
do you really think we don't know how to deal with your scheme?

461
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,350
Our fellows have also gathered near the city.

462
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,940
They are ready for a fight.

463
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,850
It's an internal fight within your Righteous Path.

464
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,010
How is it related to me?

465
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,260
Shangguan Qiu Yue,

466
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,080
you are really so cunning

467
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,830
and extremely vicious.

468
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,890
Why do you praise me for being cunning and vicious?

469
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,930
The internal fight among the sects of the Righteous Path as well as the poison you've gotten,

470
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,390
were all done by Bu'er.

471
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,990
I was just a passerby by chance.

472
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,560
Young Chief Master, what are you going to do?

473
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,770
Without further ado, stop spouting such nonsense!

474
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:24,250
Xiao Bai, Shangguan Qiu Yue really didn't do that!

475
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,940
Xiao Chun Hua actually is willing to believe me. What a surprise!

476
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,430
This is bad!

477
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,270
Young Chief Master, Miss Chun Hua is going to die.

478
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,100
You should return to Fengming Mountain Manor

479
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,100
to lead everyone to join hands and to preserve the strength.

480
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,080
Young Chief Master,

481
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,520
are you going to give up on your wife?

482
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,130
Chun Hua.

♫  It's hard to walk on, there's even no one to argue with  ♫

513
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:32,160
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

514
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,470
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

515
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:40,350
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

516
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:47,290
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

517
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:05,280
♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of the spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

518
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,440
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

519
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,150
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

520
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:17,670
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

521
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,740
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

522
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,100
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

523
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,090
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

524
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:36,940
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
