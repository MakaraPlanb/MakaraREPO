Please, Master, regulate to replenish your Zhen Qi as soon as possible.

Your subordinate is willing to support you.

There is no need.

48
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,650
The Master's inner strength is greatly damaged at this moment;

49
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,370
thus, it's still better to regulate it as soon as possible.

How do you know that your Senior's Zhen Qi (internal force) is damaged?

51

It's just that... when I awoke,

52
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,000
I felt that Master's breathing wasn't as even as before.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,980
Hence, I dared to guess.

54
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,640
You are right.

Greetings, Masters.

62
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,500
Shopkeeper, have you ever seen such a handsome master?

63
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,560
I see what you say!

64
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,940
Oh, My! Two handsome masters like you two young masters,

65
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,560
should need, at least, a pair of custom-made jade pendants to show your extravagance.

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,790
How can you compare us in the same breath?

67
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,900
Also, why should I have a pair of jade pendants with him?

68
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,270
You two are, in a manner of speaking, so intimate that you must be sworn brothers.

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,900
- Certainly, you are a match, aren't you? 
 - You...

Shopkeeper, think again!

72
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,510
- Where is there such a pretty man? 
 - He is in fact,...

73
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,800
So,that's how it is...

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,540
Since you are married, that's another reason to customize a pair.

75
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,510
Shopkeeper!

76
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,850

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,090
What are you afraid of?

86
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,080
No matter how strong Shangguan Qiu Yue is,

87
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,260
right now, his power is only 30-40%.

88
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,310
Besides, the hidden weapon I used just now may have injured him.

89
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,870
We have so many people here, why are you so afraid of him?

90

This is his own fault!

92

But today, I'm lucky that you're here.

93
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,180
Unexpectedly, even wise Shangguan Qiu Yue can have a momentary judgment lapse.

94
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,420
He actually listened to a silly girl like you and took our bait.

I thought he wouldn't take any actions at this time.

Don't be led astray by him and be led to your downfall!

116

Let me tell you all, although Shangguan Qiu Yue suffered a damage to his Zhen Qi,

117

he's still more than capable of dealing with you all.

Should I still keep those who will betray me anytime?

125
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,510
Shangguan Qiu Yue, we, Chuanqi Sect brothers, came to you with a good intention to seek refuge.

126
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,770
However, you put on an appearance and even took away our power.

You detained so many of our brothers and you simply so deceiving.

 - You!

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,730
Earlier, on the back of the puppets' heads,

170
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,560
I discovered two silver needles that could manipulate them.

171
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,960
Is that so?

172
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,270
Those two silver needles were the Healer's special, hidden weapon.

173
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,170
They can manipulate corpses of the recent dead to revive them.

174

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,690

Sir, may I help you?

177
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,000
Add a jug of wine.

178
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,530
Okay.

179
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,390
Young Master Leng, our bill has not been settled.

180
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,340
Why are you in a hurry to leave?

181
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,910
Sit down!

182
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,280
Young Master Qin, you're so rich.

183
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,320
Why can't you afford one meal for me?

184
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,330
Of course, I'm not as money is a worldly possession.

185
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,270
- Now, that is correct. 
 - Money is a worldly possession.

186
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:54,150
Therefore, my pocket is completely empty right now.

187

You—

188
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,270
This is not your style.

189
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,760
I spent all the money I carried buying the jade pendants.

190
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,280
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

191
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,670
If Miss Leng wants to eat in a restaurant, how dare I decline?

192
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,900
I will pay for it.

193
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,430
The total is 37 silver and six copper coins.

194
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,860
Do you have enough?

195
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,690
So much?

196

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,590

198
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,510
Why didn't you tell me then?

199
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,660
You were in such a good mood, I did not want to spoil it.

200
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,620
Hence, what should we do?

201
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,200
- Put it on outstanding credit. 
 - No, I can't.

202

Yes. I regretted not being with you as well.

I still have you.

Miss Leng and I spread the message, but we didn't expect to catch such a big fish.

285
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,780
- What do you mean? 
 - In the restaurant, we mentioned the silver needles publicly.

286
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,940
As a result, before we left the restaurant, there was someone behind who wanted to kill us.

287
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,620
But luckily, we already took necessary precautions.

288
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,530
That person didn't succeed and we could even subdue him.

289
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,740
Then that person hastily used a powder that blinded us.

290
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,520
And there is this...

291
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,110
These are those silver needles again.

292
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,280
Correct! Before he nearly blinded me, I had pulled this out of his cuff.

293
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,290
Afterward, we asked after the man we noticed in the restaurant.

294
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,520
He's called Li Yu, the Healer's disciple, and he lives in Baxian Residence.

295
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,390
I investigated his identity and found out that this Li Yu was originally a gambler.

296
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,210
Debt collectors beat him nearly to death.

297
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,700
People from Baxian Residence saved him.

298
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,210
We still don't know the location of the Longevity fruit and the Healer's case still remains unresolved.

299
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:33,230
Now, this is truly complex and difficult to solve with many moving parts.

300
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,890
It seems that we must make another trip to the scene of the Healer's death.

301
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:01,170
Xiao Chun Hua, we are here!

302
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Be careful!

303
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,070

00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,690

This is an ice cave.

306
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,510
I never like it here.

307
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,550
I was locked in here for decades.

308
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,870
Only Cave Masters ever knew about this such place through inheritance.

309
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,980
Can only Cave Masters come here?

310
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,690
I am not even a member of Qianyue Sect.

Didn't you tell me that you will make my wishes come true?

320

I have decided to grant your wish.

Xiao Chun Hua, your new outfit is very pretty.

329
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,410
Do you think I will die?

330

Can you stop talking?

331
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:56,260
It is only a small injury so I can heal myself.

332
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,760
Then hurry and heal yourself!

333
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,710

I am just afraid of you dying in front of me.

345
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,190
There is nothing here.

346
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,970
Aren't you afraid of starving to death?

347
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,360
However, it is the safest here.

348
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,770
If you

349
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,990
do not want to stay here,

350
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,730
there is a secret passageway to exist.

351
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,960
You can escape through there.

352
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,720
What do you like to eat?

353
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,540
As long as it is prepared by you,

354
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,540
I will eat it.

355
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,440
It sure is peaceful here.

356
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,740
It won't be good is we just barge in there, will it?

357
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,330
What are you afraid of? Fengming Mountain Manor leads the martial arts circle.

358
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,840
Right now, we came to investigate the Healer's death, so it's perfectly justifiable.

359
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,290
Isn't that right, Young Chief Master?

360
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,440
Young Chief Master?

361
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,490
Xiao Bai?

362
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,010
Husband!

363
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,220
Can you take the sword away first? I am scared. 

364
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,270
[Chun Hua: A girl who had died in Sangtian village, was revived but lost her memory]

365
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,650
Chun Hua?

366
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,110
Young Master?

367
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,280
I remember the first time you met Miss Chun Hua,

368
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,990
it was at this place.

369
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,330
So everything that has happened, related to the key link in the death of the Healer,

370
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,660
the Healer, my father, and Miss Chun Hua.

371
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,770
They all have countless ties with the Longevity fruit.

372
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:18,420
If we make use of this opportunity and solve this riddle,

373
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,820
then the misunderstanding between you and Miss Chun Hua

374
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,360
will surely disappear.

375
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,180
Those who abandoned and left me,

376
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,800
I can't keep them anyway.

377
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:54,410
Right now, I would rather much cherish you all,

378
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,340
especially you.
