[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,650
Just now, I didn't completely trust you.

32
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,730
I only know that you wouldn't hurt Miss Feng.

33
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,640
Although the origins are unclear, they say the antidote was made from Longevity leaves.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,260
People will act as if the Devil is in their hearts as long as we cannot find the Longevity fruit.

35
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,920
We'll just find something that no one has ever seen before,

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,710
and fake it as the Longevity fruit.

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,210
We must destroy it in the presence of all, and we still need to find a good excuse

38
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,430
to gather the chiefs of all the sects together.

39
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,860
I thought it over and over again, so I decided to make up for it by giving you a big wedding.

40
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,510
You actually dare to marry him, without my approval!

Sisi,

44
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,550
the ghosts and gods in the afterlife

45
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,900
are not in our control.

46
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,360
The only thing I can do

47
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,660
is to save you.

48
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,050
I must save you.

49
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,770
You must hold on and live well.

 [Full of Noble Daring Aspiration] 

51
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,260
Miss Leng, why does your face have a little bit of blush today?

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,010
It's just the reflection of the "happiness" characters.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,000
If you said these words were prepared for us,

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
that would be much better.

55
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,410
Forget it! I dare accept your words.

56
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,770
The wedding will be soon, and our efforts in the past few days

57
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,820
will eventually pay off.

58
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,320
The closer the wedding, the more we cannot slack off.

59
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,750
Miss Leng, do you think the Longevity fruit that all the world is scrambling for,

60
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,740
is really worth it?

61
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,650
I'm still young so why should I think about that?

62
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,380
Miss Leng, we are like-minded, no doubt.

63
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,250
I also think that living a life with the one you love

64
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,020
is better than immortality without love.

65
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,530
Boring!

66
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,330
Boring?

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,860
Well, then I insist on saying something today.

68
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,720
Miss Leng, I boldly ask, on life's long, winding road,

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,790
are you willing to let my beaming bright self join you?

70
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,510
I think you are just too beaming and bright.

71
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,590
You get in the way and become a hindrance between Caicai and me.

72
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,380
Xiao Bai, what are you doing here?

73
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,770
You can't look!

74
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,260
In the past, you wouldn't even come when I invited you.

75
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,980
And now you just came over without my asking.

76
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,970
Your customs here

77
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,840
for new brides are so difficult.

78
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,360
Originally, I thought I could just wait for my new bridal clothes.

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,980
Who knew that I still need to embroider my own handkerchief?

80
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,560
Oh, right! Look, do you think this pearl resembles the Longevity fruit?

81
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,070
Speaking of that,

82
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,820
we actually became acquainted because of the Longevity fruit.

83
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,760
Chun Hua,

84
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,030
if the Longevity fruit is real,

85
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,370
what would you do with it?

86
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,530
I think...

87
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,650
I would send it to Madam Yousi.

88
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,840
- Madam Yousi? She's Fu Lou's... 
 - So what?

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,740
She's such a nice person.

90
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,250
Madam Yousi is so lovely and pitiful.

91
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,320
I really like her.

92
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,820
If the Longevity fruit was snatched by the Demon Sects,

93
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,730
I don't know what kinds of storm or chaos that would ensue.

94
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,740
However, she's not like that.

95
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,660
Madam Yousi is just like this pearl,

96
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,600
extremely innocent and kind.

97
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,270
Fu Lou is very protective of her, just like a clam with its pearl.

98
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,540
If this pearl were plucked away one day,

99
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,170
then the clam's heart would be empty.

100
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,910
Right now, I don't know whether Fu Lou is evil or not.

101
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,910
I only know that if someone's heart is empty,

102
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,950
then he will truly be afflicted and tormented.

103
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,260
Chun Hua, I...

104
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,730
It's you again!

105
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,430
Why have I always been in awkward, troublesome situations lately?

106
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,230
Brother Qin!

107
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,400
- Brother Qin. 
 - Young Chief Master, why are you so unenthusiastic and half-hearted?

108
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,300
You were just being attentive with Miss Chun Hua, and now you're here to sway me through pillow talk.

109
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,410
Fortunately, I am a man of fervent righteousness.

110
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,090
- I can't stand your fickleness. 
 - Stop making a fuss!

111
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,040
I'm very remorseful and uneasy.

112
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,150
Remorseful?

113
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,810
Toward me?

114
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,760
Do you really think it's okay to hide this from Miss Chun Hua?

115
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,510
Well, then I'll take you to own up to it.

116
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,670
I just tried to admit it to her but I couldn't get it out.

117
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,940
She earnestly wants to marry me but if I confess to her now,

118
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,580
she will surely think I don't sincerely want to marry her.

119
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,970
As long as your conscience is clear, it's all right.

120
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,900
You have never been in love so what do you know?

121
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,840
I...

122
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,470
Why am I always the one who gets hurt?

123
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,810
This is broken ice stone.

124
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,400
It wasn't Qin Liufeng just now but Shangguan Qiu Yue.

125
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,820
Chun Hua, you need to be clear-minded (lit your heart has to be clear).

126
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,970
You're about to marry soon so how can your mind and heart be full of that big devil?

127
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,590
Shangguan Qiu Yue!

128
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,770
Xiao Bai, you were the very first one I saw.

129
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,710
You must be the one for me, aren't you?

130
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,830
The red is so tasteless.

131
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,270
Tell me, when common people get married,

132
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,280
must they decorate with lanterns and be festive?

133
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Red paper and red cloth blots out the sky over the earth.

134
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,670
Yes. Red is the color for joyous events.

135
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,480
If the women in this world were able to marry whom they love,

136
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,940
naturally, that would be joyous.

137
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,720
Well, you've been covered in black all day.

138
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,320
Does that mean you were never happy?

139
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,440
It is my honor to serve you, Master.

140
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,460
As such, I consider to already be very lucky.

141
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,290
I certainly don't need any common or worldly joy.

142
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,890
You're also a woman.

143
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,220
Do you have someone you adore?

144
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,150
I am merely a subordinate.

145
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,990
- I do not think about love. 
 - You're lying!

146
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,170
I have allowed you to serve and support me for your entire life.

147
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,710
So you must bear

148
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,230
this small injury.

149
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes.

150
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,560
In regards to Xiao Chun Hua's wedding,

151
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,970
you must report to me every detail, no matter how big or small.

152
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,570
When you act, you're ruthless, relentless, and merciless.

153
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,970
You are worthy of being Master's most trusted aid.

154
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,640
You didn't manage to dodge my dart! Gu Xingzhu, practice more until you get it right.

155
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,610
What happened with that injury on your face?

156
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,550
I was busy and got injured, all in the line of work.

157
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,850
Xiao Yan, you smell like you've been drinking for three nights.

158
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,550
Has Master been drinking often lately?

159
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,650
If you really want to know, Gu Xingzhu, you should ask him yourself.

160
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,490
Xiao Yan, it's already so late, where are you going?

161
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,490
I can't be daydreaming, can I?

162
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,720
Of course, not.

163
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,110
Miss Caicai, what are you doing here?

164
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,990
Miss Caicai, do you blame me?

165
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,270
Miss Chun Hua, you saved me twice.

166
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,530
You are a nice girl.

167
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,950
You and Young Chief Master are finally able to get married.

168
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,600
I simply wish you the very best.

169
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
That's all!

170
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,980
You will definitely be the prettiest bride in the world.

171
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,300
Thank you.

172
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,130
It's a pity that Young Chief Master can't feast his eyes on you sooner.

173
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,030
Chun Hua.

174
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,420
Xiao Bai?

175
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,320
Miss Feng.

176
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,530
Well then, I won't disturb both of you any longer.

177
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,980
Xiao Bai, come and sit here.

178
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,940
If you don't come over here, I'll be angry.

179
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,730
So great!

180
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,040
Tell me that you like me.

181
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,120
I like Chun Hua.

182
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,710
Why have you changed and become so obedient?

183
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,470
You've never been like this in the past.

184
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,810
When you looked at me before, you would blush.

185
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,720
You even use the Fengming Saber to separate us and to keep me at a distance.

186
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,370
- Chun Hua, I— 
 - I know!

187
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,310
You'll be good to me for my entire life, won't you?

188
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,450
Miss Chun Hua,

189
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,770
I hope you won't be angry at me for keeping the truth from you.

190
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,130
I hope that this grand wedding

191
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,910
can stop all the problems.

192
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,950
I hope that Young Chief Master and you

193
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,430
can be happy forever.

194
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,370
- Congratulations, Young Chief Master! 
 - Congratulations, Young Chief Master!

195
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,650
 Congratulations! Congratulations! 

196
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,970
I am fortunate to have all of the heroes and outstanding people

197
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,150
here to attend my wedding.

198
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,560
This magnificent scene is a rare sight.

199
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,850
- That’s right. 
 - That’s true.

200
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,560
However, the announcement that I will make

201
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,590
has nothing to do with this wedding.

202
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,570
My Lady, what do you think of this flower?

203
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,190
Don’t always cut those flowers in full bloom.

204
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,570
My Lady, you are very strange! Flowers for flower arrangements should be beautiful.

205
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,970
Why do you always pick those that are withering?

206
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,300
Flower arrangement

207
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,800
is for those flowers with a short life span to have a second life.

208
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,250
If we cut a flower that's in bloom

209
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,900
just because of its beauty,

210
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,720
aren’t we placing the importance on the wrong thing?

211
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,940
Now, Miss Chun Hua

212
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,070
and Young Chief Master are having their wedding.

213
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,240
I wonder if they have received my congratulatory gift yet.

214
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,690
My Lady, don't you worry!

215
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,030
The weather does not look good.

216
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,040
My Lady, I will go to fetch an umbrella.

217
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,770
What’s going on?

218
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,780
Because of the Longevity fruit, the pugilist world is in chaos with murders happening everywhere.

219
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,260
As part of the Righteous Wulin Sects, how can Fengming Mountain Manor be indifferent?

220
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,100
Right! This is right.

221
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,660
 It’s truly been too long. 

222
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,370
- Our ways to handle the situation were wrong. 
 - We should have done something. 

223
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,600
However, days ago, I was fortunate enough

224
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,090
to obtain the Longevity fruit.

225
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,980
- What? 
 - Young Chief Master, are you speaking the truth?

226
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,720
- Is the Longevity fruit in your hands? 
 - Really?

227
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,570
- This is a blessing for the righteous sects. 
 - I have never seen it before.

228
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,890
Everyone, be quiet! Let Young Chief Master finish his speech.

229
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,450
I have really never seen it before.

230
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,650
There is no end to troubles if this fruit remains in this world.

231
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,060
Therefore, today, I will destroy the Longevity fruit

232
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,460
in front of everyone.

233
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,820
- You cannot do that! 
 - That’s right. You should not do that.

234
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,710
No way! How can he do that? He shouldn't do that!

235
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,090
Xiao Bai,

236
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,940
the grand wedding you promised me,

237
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,810
is it just a cover for the Longevity fruit?

238
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,370
A wedding was organized with such great pains.

239
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,930
[Double Happiness]

240
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,580
Shangguan Qiu Yue!

241
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,860
Could it be you're also here for the Longevity fruit?

242
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,460
You have such a one-track mind. How laughable!

243
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,940
But seeing you make a fool of yourself, is much more interesting.

244
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,240
Shangguang Qiu Yue, let go of her immediately!

245
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,520
Fengming Saber’s last technique is a crushing blow.

246
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,270
Young Chief Master, I'm unsure of the result if you attack us.

247
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,150
However, your Miss Chun Hua will be mutilated.

248
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,180
Shangguan Qiu Yue, are you insane?

249
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,450
Immediately let go of her!

250
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,990
Let go of her?

251
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,040
I am here today to inform you

252
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,590
that this wedding cannot proceed.

253
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,090
What nonsense are you spouting?

254
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,010
Shangguan Qiu Yue, she is my wife.

255
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,070
What rights do you have?

256
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,200
What rights do I have?

257
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,590
Miss Chun Hua has a birthmark on her collarbone,

258
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,070
a shape of a flower bud.

259
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,510
Young Chief Master, you don't know that, do you?

260
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,690
That scar…

261
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,350
It turns out that you do know.

262
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,190
Then I might as well let you know.

263
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,320
Miss Chun Hua, with her original name of Hua Xiaolei,

264
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,560
had an engagement with you before.

265
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,730
It's just that we have already been husband and wife.

266
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,960
 What? What is going on? 

267
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,910
 What? What is going on? 

268
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,070
He cannot really say so! Right, he can't! Exactly! How can he say that?

269
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,890
 How outrageous! 

270
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,040
 Exactly! 

271
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,730
Xiao Bai, it is not like that.

272
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,610
I am not Hua Xiaolei. Chun Hua is just Chun Hua.

273
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Xiao Chun Hua,

274
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,140
without my permission, you are not allowed to marry others.

275
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,840
But that is all right! I have already decided to take you back to Qianyue Cave.

276
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,330
Xiao Bai wants to take advantage of the wedding to destroy the Longevity fruit

277
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,520
while I just want to be with you.

278
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,920
Xiao Bai!

279
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,620
 You can destroy your Longevity fruit 

280
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,670
 and I will have my Xiao Chun Hua. 

281
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,980
 Young Chief Master, hand over the Longevity fruit! 

282
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,080
 Hand it over! Hand over the Longevity fruit! 

283
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,330
The Longevity fruit will be discussed at a later date.

284
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,540
 No! Hand over the Longevity fruit now! 

285
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,800
 Hand it over now! 

286
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,840
Move aside!

287
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,000
What are you doing? Young Chief Master, what are you doing?

288
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,640
That’s right! We must make him hand it over!

289
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,500
 - You must hand it over! 
 - You must hand it over! 

290
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:47,750
This is not good! I have never seen Young Chief Master so angry.

291
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,000
Who else would like to taste the real whistling wind of the Fengming Saber?

292
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,780
Xiao Bai, you are so vicious. Let's go!

293
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,490
Go, let's go.

294
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,990
A phoenix must

295
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,430
go back to its hometown.

296
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:30,900
Travel the four seas to seek its phoenix.

297
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:41,200
Words are worthy of virtue and go hand in hand with each other.

298
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,170
Not being able to fly

299
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,980
brings me to ruins.

300
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,910
It was such nice weather.

301
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,250
Why does it suddenly rain so heavily?

302
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,910
My  Lady, My Lady.

303
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,090
Welcome home, Xiao Chun Hua!

304
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,260
Qianyue Cave is not my home.

305
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,250
Brother will help you live in the cliff.

306
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,060
You dishonored me

307
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,790
and humiliated Xiao Bai.

308
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:49,290
- You are pushing me down the cliff. 
 - Then that's indeed a good thing.

309
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:54,160
From now on, you have nothing to do with Fengming Mountain Manor.

310
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,820
Why do you have to separate us?

311

♫  It's hard to walk on. There's even no one to argue with  ♫

341
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,910
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place ♫

342
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,240
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

343
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,250
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

344
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:26,280
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

345
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:44,120
♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of the spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

346
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,300
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

347
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,030
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

348
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:56,510
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

349
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,590
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

350
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,930
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

351
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:08,930
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

352
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:15,840
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
