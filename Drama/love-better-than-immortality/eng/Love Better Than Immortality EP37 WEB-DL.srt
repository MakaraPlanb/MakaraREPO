31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,290
After the longevity fruit auction, Master Shi should have earned millions.

32
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,360
Baxian Residence doesn't have so much money.

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,800
Bo, zhong, shu? Bu'er?

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,360
Three days later, Bu'er will invite you to a banquet.

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,870
There will be lots of Soft Muscle Powder in all the dishes.

36
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,300
Xiao Chun Hua, you shouldn't engorge it.

37
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,760
Li Yu isn't Master Shi.

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,380
Now, every piece of evidence all point to Master Bu'er.

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,190
I believe that people like Bu'er

40
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,040
will definitely think the more visible the place is, the safer it is. 

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,720
Find Shangguan Qiuyue and force him to detoxify Chun Hua.

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,010
Are you crazy?

45
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,740
This place is full of people loyal to Fengming Mountain Manor.

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,950
- Don't you want your life anymore? 
 - No problem.

47
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,120
If someone sees me, then I'll just kill him

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,220
and use his clothes to leave.

49
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,970
Is it fun to you?

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,000
I only missed you.

51
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,650
Lady, you finally came!

52
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,080
Please hurry to take this man home.

53
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,770
He is so handsome but is so dumb.

54
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,920
If he continues to wander, he will likely lose all of your family's fortune.

55
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,480
Xiao Chun Hua, you must save me.

56
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,050
What is wrong?

57
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,770
I came here to pick the jade pendant that I ordered for you.

58
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,070
I gave him money but he won't let me leave.

59
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,900
I have an upright business so I don't want to take advantage of you.

60
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,770
- This much money, how am I supposed to give back your change? 
 - I told you to keep the change.

61
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,940
Look! This one is yours.

62
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,590
It is engraved with your name on it.  [Spring Flower (green)] [Autumn Moon (white)]

63
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,880
This one with my name on it is mine.

64
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,200
Is it you who told him to engrave these?

65
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,660
I didn't tell you? Oh right! I think you were mad at me at the time.

66
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,950
I must have forgotten to mention it.

67
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,700
Please talk later! We need to clear this transaction first.

68
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,290
If you insist giving me this,

69
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,280
I will not take it and you will have to leave those jade ornaments here with me.

70
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,380
We don't want them anymore.

71
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,450
You have been wandering around just for this?

72
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,450
Wait a minute! You can't do this because these jade ornaments have your names engraved on them.

73
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,460
- Who would I resell it to? 
 - That's right!

74
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,430
What to do?

75
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,170
I bought it for you so why would you pay for it?

76
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,870
Then your money will be given to me?

77
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,790
This man indeed has a strange mind.

78
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,140
Let me tell you, Miss! You must look after him in the future.

79
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,260
He is an older brother and I'm his younger sister.

80
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,700
How can I look after him?

81
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,240
You can. You can!

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,620
You two really get along very well, fighting in jest for fun.

83
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,240
I really like you both.

84
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,640
This young man should understand the hardship of making money.

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,050
In the future, you won't feel bad after spending it.

86
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,570
You are the younger sister but you are steadier than your older brother.

87
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,100
Please educate him! He will listen to you.

88
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,710
Of course, I will listen to her.

89
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,590
- Thanks. 
 - Okay.

90
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,370
Please. Take care!

91
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,900
Flowers for sale!

92
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,580
Flowers for sale! Miss, come and take a look.

93
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,030
You like it?

94
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,240
-Take one. 
 - Flowers!

95
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Kites!

96
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,850
Can you please not make trouble for me anymore?

97
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,220
The jade pendant Xiao Chun Hua had chosen,

98
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,540
if he sold to others, what would we do?

99
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,740
So you caused him trouble.

100
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,820
It's lucky that I stopped by or else I do not know what will happen.

101
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,090
Even if you had not intervened, I would have only scared him a little.

102
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,340
I doubt it would cause much trouble.

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,870
He doesn't want to take the money.

104
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,020
He is still smarter than you.

105
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,960
He is honest and kind.

106
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,740
I am not like you who has no conscience. Take it!

107
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,020
My money is yours.

108
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,980
Xiao Chun Hua should take it.

109
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:21,190
However, how do you have so much money?

110
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,350
Where did you steal it from?

111
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,940
I have tons of money so there's no need to rob anyone.

112
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,490
I have a friend so I just went to see him to borrow some money.

113
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,240
He just gave me 10,000 Liang casually.

114
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,910
He is really scared and afraid I won't help him.

115
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,580
What friend?

116
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,500
Master Shi?

117
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,830
Might as well! He sold a fake Longevity fruit and did make a lot from it.

118
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,540
Master Shi is indeed Bu'er.

119
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,310
You came to Baxian City this time.

120
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,420
It is not as simple as you just need to borrow some money, am I right?

121
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,590
The fact that you are staying.

122
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,960
Is it really to just wait for me?

123
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,830
Then why must we leave in three days?

124
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,070
Xiao Chun Hua, you sure are silly.

125
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,430
It has already been two days.

126
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,920
When everything finishes,

127
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,130
I will take you back to Qianyue Cave.

128
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,170
Finish? How would you like to finish it?

129
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,820
Killing people?

130
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,320
Get me to go back to Qianyue Cave with my hands stained with blood?

131
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,870
Xiao Chun Hua, if you want to see me, you can go to that meadow to find me.

132
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,260
Remember this! As long as I am alive,

133
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,720
I surely won't let you die.

134
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,760
I want you to take me back now.

135
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,750
Did you go out to relieve boredom?

136
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,370
The poison in your body

137
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,160
was used as a tactic for Shangguan Qiu Yue to force you into something?

138
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,710
If you do not want to tell me, I will not pursue it, either.

139
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,590
However, I will find a solution for you.

140
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,350
The poison in my body is just a small matter.

141
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,320
You are the master of the martial arts circle and the successor of the Fengming Saber.

142
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,780
You should take care of the whole pugilist world,

143
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,930
and not me.

144
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:55,100
You are afraid that I will be busy with the matters of pugilist world and can't take care of you?

145
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,250
The Xiao Family takes care of the pugilist world generation after generation.

146
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,450
It's our responsibility.

147
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,070
However, I will definitely save you.

148
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,600
Shangguan Qiu Yue will not let me go.

149
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,930
Besides, the poison I am inflicted with is connected to him.

150
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,900
So I cannot help you to fight against him.

151
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,810
I just want to live well.

152
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,200
I know that my attitude and standpoint make other people

153
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,990
feel that I bring shame upon the Fengming Mountain Manor.

154
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,360
I do not want to burden you.

155
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,850
You once told me

156
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,640
you liked me.

157
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,880
- In the past, I did and I wasn't lying to you but now— 
 - No need to say anything further.

158
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,470
Chun Hua, I won't let the pugilist world down.

159
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,780
I will not let you down, either.

160
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,140
Xiao Bai,

161
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,760
sometimes, people are forced to choose.

162
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,430
The path that Shangguan Qiu Yue has chosen to take

163
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,270
should not force us to make the same choice.

164
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,670
Chun Hua, don't you worry.

165
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,920
I definitely won't let the poison in your body to spread.

166
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,930
Xiao Bai must really hate Shangguan Qiu Yue right now.

167
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,080
He might just kill him.

168
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,850
 Not good! I can't go out alone right now. 

169
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,300
It will definitely draw their attention.

170
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,140
Miss Chun Hua, do you need something?

171
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,250
Miss Caicai, I have been in conflict recently.

172
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,290
Why don't we go out to get some afternoon tea and chat?

173
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:20,970
- Sure! Let me get Young Chief Master— 
 - No, no, no!

174
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,750
Why are we bringing such a big man like him?

175
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,350
Let's just keep it among us, girls.

176
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,640
Sure!

177
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,510
It is so hard for us to get some time alone together.

178
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,220
Yeah. The three of us can't just follow the men wherever they go.

179
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,300
It's still better if girls are more independent.

180
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,430
That is right. Qin Liufeng is too clingy.

181
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,400
I have been wanting to come out with you girls.

182
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,480
My stomach is bothering me so I need to relieve myself.

183
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,850
- Do you have any food poisoning? Or— 
 - No, no.

184
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,470
I am just feeling unwell.

185
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,640
I just want to go and relieve myself.

186
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,100
I have no money right now so you both should wait for me.

187
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,630
Lady Boss, where is the restroom?

188
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,950
When you go out the door, head North.

189
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,400
How do you get to the restroom?

190
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,610
It is a bit far! Once you exit, you must go North.

191
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,630
Miss, what do you need?

192
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,720
Do you see those two young misses?

193
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,040
They are all my frenemies.

194
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,110
They want to take my man.

195
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,080
I need to meet with him but they are so clingy and I cannot meet him.

196
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,420
I just told them that my stomach hurts and needs to go to the restroom.

197
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,980
However, that won't delay them for long.

198
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,710
I must burden you with the task of delaying them.

199
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,770
Sure! I know those two well.

200
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,800
You know them well?

201
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,940
Then you must be extra careful.

202
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,680
You just go! I can watch them.

203
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,830
Take the back door.

204
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,090
Thanks a lot.

205
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,300
Thanks, Madam.

206
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,920
Have you really been here?

207
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,040
I was worried that you couldn't find me.

208
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,530
Oh right! They are all trying to look for you; you should leave quickly.

209
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,300
Shangguan Qiu Yue, I've looked for you for long time.

210
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,510
Xiao Chun Hua, you brought people here.

211
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,490
Do you want to kill me?

212
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,820
In you mind, everyone wants to kill you.

213
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,460
Since you don't trust me, you shouldn't have told me your hiding place.

214
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,300
It is not that I do not trust you.

215
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,060
However, because you are too stupid, I am disappointed in you.

216
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,900
Did Miss Chun Hua really go to see Shangguan Qiu Yue?

217
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,480
Yes. This morning, Lady Chun Hua went to invite the two girls out.

218
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,300
They thought it was weird so they told me about it.

219
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,130
So I followed the girls to the restaurant and stayed nearby.

220
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,260
Then I saw Miss Chun Hua sneaked into the meadows alone.

221
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,990
Shangguan Qiu Yue!

222
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,130
I have been working day and night to find you.

223
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,450
God helps those who help themselves.

224
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,160
Tell me where the real Longevity Fruit is.

225
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,970
Your first words to me is the Longevity Fruit.

226
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,960
You sure are blunt.

227
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,080
The Longevity Fruit must belong to the legit circle of the martial arts circle.

228
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,840
I naturally must know where is it for sure.

229
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,590
Chief Leng, you are full of flaws when you are anxious.

230
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,510
When you fought with Feng Qianwei for the Longevity Fruit back then,

231
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,700
was it with this same attitude?

232
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,870
You... What are you talking about?

233
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,140
You and Fengqian Wei both want this longevity fruit,

234
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,850
it's a fair competition.

235
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,950
However, you only want to take a shortcut.

236
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,000
You promised Master Shi to help him in the auction.

237
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,520
You had gotten the Poison of  Dandelion from him.

238
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,560
Then you killed your biggest competitor, Feng Qianwei.

239
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,440
Nonsense!

240
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,230
All the people who claimed that I talked nonsense were all attested to the truth in the end.

241
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,660
Everything I've said is the truth.

242
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,900
Leng Ying, when you discard Feng Qianwei's body in the wilds at the time,

243
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,480
did you really not know how potent the Poison of Dandelion is？

244
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,020
Shangguan Qiu Yue,

245
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,750
Feng Qianwei's body was obviously in the coffin,

246
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,920
but you slander me that I discarded it.

247
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,210
Your lie is so untenable.

248
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,710
It seems that Chief Leng still doesn't know that it's I who sent in the coffin.

249
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,300
You!

250
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,880
Master Shi originally wanted to use that coffin to punish you

251
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,600
but he didn't expect that you were wicked and merciless.

252
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,070
You led Qin Liufeng and his companion to a secret room.

253
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,280
You had wanted to get rid of them

254
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,340
but your biological daughter was also there.

255
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,060
Leng Ying, you were in such a hurry to kill Fu Lou,

256
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,760
wasn't it because he also had discovered everything?

257
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,030
Do you think that since Fu Lou spared you, you can do whatever you wanted?

258
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,510
Leng Ying,

259
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,860
the people who you killed, Fu Lou, You Si and Feng Qianwei are all watching you now.

260
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,630
Accidentally, Xiao Bai opened the secret room and you didn't get punished.

261
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:42,010
On the contrary, you made Feng Caicai get the Poison of Dandelion.

262
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,400
It was not me. It wasn't me...

263
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,440
It was not me!

264
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,260
What a pity!

265
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,910
Leng Ying,

266
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,620
go and explain to those you have killed.

267
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,340
Let go  of Chief Leng!

268
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,800
Be careful!

269
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,600
Chief Leng?

270
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,640
Miss Chun Hua, did he hurt you?

271
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,070
How many people did you bring?

272
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,620
It wasn't me.

273
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,890
It was not me. I didn't do anything.

274
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,910
Miss Chun Hua, don't be afraid!

275
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,680
I am here.

276
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
Fengming Mountain Manor

277
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,570
are full of people who concentrate on making profits.

278
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,700
You also associate with them?

279
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,250
Shangguan Qiu Yue, if you allow yourself to be seized without putting up a fight,

280
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,470
I will give you a chance to live on for the moment as the master of martial arts circle.

281
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,820
Live on?

282
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm not sure if the Sect Chief Nan Xinghe

283
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,170
will laugh if he heard this in Heaven.

284
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,730
Chief Leng.

285
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,640
Chief Leng is going to die.

286
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,460
Shangguan Qiu Yue,

287
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,880
you have committed another major crime.

288
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,740
Chief Leng,

289
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,510
how about you ask Chun Hua, who is next to you,

290
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,040
if he deserved to die.

291
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,670
You have the nerve to mention Chun Hua?

292
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,390
Cave Master.

293
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,740
Ye Yan?

294
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,900
- Oh no! It's not good. 
 - What is the matter?

295
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,510
Miss Chun Hua's poison flower has bloomed.

296
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,340
This is love poison.

297
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,510
When the inflicted is enamored, it will become fatal.

298
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,070
What?

299
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,990
Oh right! Let's not telling Miss Feng and Miss Leng about Chief Leng.

300
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,860
Miss Chun Hua, Miss Feng and Miss Leng are both waiting for you.

301
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,030
Do you want to explain to them?

302
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,490
Should it be time for me to explain anything right now?

303
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,460
For your Fengming Mountain Manor's responsibility,

304
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,510
can you just treat others' trust as rubbish?

305
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,680
Don't be mad!

306
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,050
I told him to say it.

307
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,650
Do you think I still don't know what kind of person you are?

308
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,290
You came here to confess that this was all done under your command.

309
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,360
What would that solve?

310
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,190
Of course, I know this was done under your command.

311
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,780
The fact is

312
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,820
in order to eliminate Demon Sect,

313
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,210
you can do anything.

314
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,130
I want to kill Shangguan Qiu Yue.

315
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,700
However, if I have to be in a battle to the death with him,

316
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,740
I certainly will do it above board.

317
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,130
Really?

318
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,230
Has your father ever told you

319
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:33,240
Where is the spirit tablet without any characters in the study from?

320
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,960
Do you want me to tell you a name?

321
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,810
Nan Singhe.

322
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,480
I heard about it before.

323
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,910
My ancestors and Nan Xinghe are sworn brothers indeed.

324
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,270
But later my father didn't bring this up.

325
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,980
So I didn't question closely as well.

326
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,400
Xiao Min feels guilty for Nan Xinghe.

327
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,250
Xiao Yuan feels guilty for Shangguan Hui.

328
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,810
The spirit tablet without characters

329
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:08,010
shows the self-accusation of Fengming Mountain Manor which can't be told to anyone.

330
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:11,250
It's also Fengming Mountain Manor's ridiculous pride.

331
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,520
Last time,

332
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,720
you made use of "acknowledging one's sin" to scheme against Fu Lou.

333
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:25,160
This time, you used me to find Shangguan Qiu Yue.

334
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,980
Sometimes, I was thinking if there is one day I was also among the spirit tablets without characters.

335
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,100
To become one of your underserved victims

336
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,260
who bear your secret self-accusation.

337
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,140
My ancestor was also helpless.

338
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,980
However, Nan Xinghe originally killed countless people.

339
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,620
How can you compare yourself with them?

340
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,870
If Nan Xinghe gives up evil and return to the righteous path, then we won't have Qianyue Cave today.

341
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,610
I didn't expect anything new under the sun.

342
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,110
In the end,

343
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,820
I will become a pawn for you to manipulate Shangguan Qiu Yue.

344
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,300
Miss Chun Hua,

345
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,300
not anyone can give up evil and return to good.

346
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,540
There can only be one person walking in front of you.

347
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,730
Otherwise, there will be cause of a disaster for sure.

348
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,670
Sometimes for the sake of pugilist world,

349
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,260
you must choose one.

350
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,840
So in reality, you are very clear about your grudge.

351
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,610
It's nothing to do with good or evil.

352
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,300
No matter it's Shangguan Qiu Yue or Nan Xinghe,

353
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,050
They must both die.

354
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,470
No.

355
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,210
I have no intention to kill Shangguan Qiu Yue.

356
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,910
You have injured him to that point and you still say...

357
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,420
Chief Leng arrived before us.

358
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,920
I didn't expect that.

359
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,670
I was forced to injure Shangguan Qiu Yue.

360
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:27,310
Unfortunately, Chief Leng still died.

361
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,230
I cannot kill Shangguan Qiu Yue.

362
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:46,280
It's because the antidote for your poison is with him.

363
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,370
Are you really doing this only to get the antidote?

364
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,170
Miss Chun Hua, I like you.

365
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,120
I just want you to live well.

366
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,470
Xiao Bai,

367
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,740
thank you.

368
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,500
- But— 
 - There is no buts.

369
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,850
I will promise you that I will use any method

370
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,780
to help you get rid of your poison.

371
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:54,620

 ''The Unfinished Moment'' - Singer: Li Hongyi 

373
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,650
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

374
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,500
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

375
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,950
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking it's eye  ♫

376
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:33,210
♫  Seeing through the fickleness of love  ♫

377
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,260
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

378
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,460
♫  It's such a pity for not stepping forward  ♫

379
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,610
♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

380
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:52,540
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

381
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,030
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

382
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:02,240
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

383
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,050
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

384
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:10,370
♫  It's hard to walk on, there's even no one to argue with  ♫

385
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:14,580
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

386
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,930
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

387
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:22,870
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

388
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:30,130
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

406
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,080
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

407
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,810
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

408
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:37,350
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

409
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,510
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

410
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,840
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

411
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,780
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

412
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:56,480
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
