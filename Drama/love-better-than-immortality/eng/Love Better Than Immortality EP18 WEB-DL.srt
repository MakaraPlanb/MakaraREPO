[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,230
My father was poisoned and it's contagious.

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,970
Did someone else poison him?

33
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,350
As expected! Master, they have already fallen into a trap.

34
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,600
You cannot lose hope.

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,330
 You must believe that your protection is worth something.

36
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,060
However, at the moment, we must think of a way to treat and cure Miss Feng.

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,190
 I cannot be concerned only about being in love.

38
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,120
I must go and find Shangguan Qiu Yue to get the antidote.

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,150
Brother Qiu Yue, I wholeheartedly want to return to Qianyue Cave with you.

40
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,780
Since you truly want to return to Qianyue Cave, then you cannot have regrets.

[Episode 18]

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:12,020
Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,020
Thank you so much, Brother Xiao.

44
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,260
Oh right! How is Miss Feng doing now?

45
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,840
Brother Qin, you have gone to great trouble these past few days.

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,730
I really don't know who on earth this Master Shi is.

47
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,220
He was actually able to draw out more than half of those in the Righteous Path sects.

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,590
They were all lost at the auction.

49
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,550
So what do you think of the auction?

50
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,720
Speaking of auction, now I have to say that

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,160
this Master Shi knows people's hearts very well.

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,090
He merely sent out some information,

53
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,890
and set up the entire situation, while guiding it along its natural course.

54
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,130
He just let nature take its course.

55
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,340
Guiding it along its natural course?

56
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,280
On a surface level, the Righteous Path looks like a force

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,020
that can sufficiently contend with the Demon Sect.

58
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,420
However, in the end, this force couldn't defeat snobbery.

59
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,190
If they could be enticed by means of their own interests, but repeatedly say that they work together with one heart,

60
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,650
then they will fall to pieces.

61
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,780
Interests can be checked and balanced in many ways.

62
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,870
Power is in the feelings of the people.

63
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,660
There are three evils in the heart of man: greed, anger, and idiocy. Three means!

64
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,650
The intensity of a fire is generated and risen by the wind.

65
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,800
The Longevity Fruit is a good thing.

66
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,870
But oftentimes, the better something is, the more it will lead to dire consequences.

67
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,700
However,

68
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,620
is the Longevity Fruit truly in Master Shi's hands?

69
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,020
If he doesn't have it, then he is just making use of the attitudes and thoughts concerning the Longevity Fruit,

70
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,950
to throw the world into disorder.

71
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,830
Then, whether the Longevity Fruit exists or doesn't exist,

72
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,070
we still need other opinions.

73
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,290
If he doesn't have it...

74
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,280
By the way, Brother Xiao! I have something I forgot to tell you.

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,260
This is what I found on Master Shi's puppet servant that day.

76
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,340
This needle is very similar to the one

77
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,510
that the Healer used in the past.

78
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,130
So it's to say,

79
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,150
he had something to do with the Healer's death.

80
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,740
The Longevity Fruit, the Healer, and Xin Fa.

81
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,760
All these indicate and make it clear that Master Shi is still the key.

82
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,920
These people...

83
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,590
How can they see grabbing the trivial Longevity Fruit as an antidote?

84
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,480
Was the auction from a few days ago very fun?

85
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,450
You already know it.

86
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,930
I don't want to talk about it.

87
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,220
If you get it out, Xiao Chun Hua, you'll feel much better.

88
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,460
Those old chiefs,

89
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,690
in normal times, each and every one of them poses as a person of high morals.

90
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,750
Once they heard about the Longevity Fruit auction,

91
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,070
all of them were uglier than the others.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,740
Do you want me to go and teach them a lesson?

93
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,810
You won't have a chance anymore.

94
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,450
They're all dead.

95
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,260
I'm here.

96
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,360
Just forget about this affair.

97
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,230
Xiao Chun Hua, you don't know that

98
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,310
the more someone likes to distinguish between right and wrong,

99
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,960
the more wrong they are.

100
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,820
They have a layer of ash on their hearts.

101
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,960
However, you can continue being innocent,

102
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,090
you can just leave the rest to me.

103
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,810
Your way of toying with others is so sophisticated.

104
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,960
Is that so? After being frivolous with me, you won't admit it.

105
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,620
I saw it coming.

106
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,500
You're right.

107
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,610
However, speaking of frivolity,

108
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,490
today it's me, will it be Xiao Bai tomorrow?

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,660
Why are you mentioning him?

110
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,150
Because you haven't said a single sincere word to me.

111
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,680
What are you talking about? I've been open and forthright with you.

112
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,770
This time, the one instigating behind the curtain of the Longevity Fruit auction,

113
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,770
it seems like he hasn't said a single sincere word.

114
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,190
Perhaps, you've been lied to as well.

115
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,530
Xiao Chun Hua, if they wanted to lie to me,

116
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,650
they're all incredibly inadequate.

117
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,730
It's easy to decipher people's hearts.

118
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,480
I'm able to figure out whatever they are capable of thinking.

119
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,460
Then Older Brother, you are quite amazing.

120
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,900
I might as well listen to you.

121
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,430
People's weaknesses

122
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,480
are plastered and written all over their faces and their bodies.

123
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,060
For example, with the way that you're gazing at me right now,

124
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,820
you are most likely having lustful thoughts again.

125
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,900
That's untrue!

126
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,030
And as for others, no matter how well they conceal it,

127
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,950
you can discern from their tone

128
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,910
whether they are greedy, or infatuated, or not.

129
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,510
You can see these things so clearly.

130
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,470
Presumably, you enjoy toying with others from time to time.

131
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,750
For example, would you ever hold an auction for fun?

132
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,170
It's a beautiful day outside.

133
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,610
Weren't you complaining that Qianyue Cave is cold?

134
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,420
 [Spring Flowers House] 

135
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,910
Miss Chun Hua.

136
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,920
Miss Chun Hua, during this time, you've been busy and running around with me.

137
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,020
You must be exhausted.

138
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,620
The inside of Qianyue Cave is ice-cold

139
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,680
so I didn't know that there are places with lotuses, grass,

140
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,830
and even dandelions.

141
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,150
However, which flowers do you like?

142
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,500
I like "little spring flower." (Xiao Chun Hua = little spring flower)

143
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,160
And you?

144
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,860
Me?

145
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,510
I only like

146
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,160
wild dandelions like this.

147
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,500
Why?

148
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,080
It's because dandelions are resilient.

149
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,220
Xiao Chun Hua, you really have some misconceptions and fallacies with your reasoning.

150
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,610
However, I've also heard

151
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,180
there is a poison in the world called, 'Dandelion.'

152
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,140
Do you have the antidote?

153
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,960
The only one who has the antidote is the poisoner.

154
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,820
Do you suspect me?

155
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,720
How could I dare suspect you?

156
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,260
It's just that, this small poison

157
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,140
must be a piece of cake for you.

158
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,050
Well, of course! Even poisons that haven't been heard of before,

159
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,030
I can make antidotes for them, all the same.

160
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,520
So where is the antidote?

161
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,780
As for the antidote, the hidden chamber has everything one could wish for.

162
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,200
So when are you going to take me to see the hidden chamber?

163
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,420
It depends on my mood.

164
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,920
Well, how are you feeling today?

165
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,900
So-so.

166
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,530
I think you're in such a good mood.

167
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,840
If there's no calendar in the mountain,

168
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,660
people won't know when the winter ends or what year it is.

169
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,200
You have ice here that you can look at,

170
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,970

One can really feel a glow of happiness.

172

Even more, you can beckon and simply have whatever you want.

173
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,820
However, it's just a pity...

174
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,630
What's a pity for?

175
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,040
It's a pity you haven't met a girl that you love.

176
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,820
Isn't it enough for me to have you?

177
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,430
That is because you haven't known what true love is. That's all!

178
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,900
As I see it,

179
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,960
it would be better for you not to concern yourself with all these numerous chaotic affairs outside of Qianyue Cave.

180
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,190
You can save the time you spend engaging in evil and mischief deeds,

181
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,570
and find a beautiful fairy-like lady—

182
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,290
Not only have you brought up the poison subject, but also the topic of evil behaviors.

If you suspect that I planned the auction,

184
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,160
you might as well tell me directly.

185
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,310
I did indeed suspect you

186
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,870
but you said,

187
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,580
one's experiences and behaviors can be reflected by their actions.

188
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,170
Ever since I lost my memory, although you're always teasing me,

189
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,480
you've never hurt me.

190
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,170
On the contrary, you've gone and come to my rescue, time and time again.

191
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,230
Therefore, I believe that you're not one who wantonly slaughters innocent people.

192
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,690
Well, what if I really did do something?

193
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,230
I simply think that if you change your way of life,

194
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,010
- you'll be much happier. 
 - Is that so?

195
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,770

Has the situation already become so serious?

198
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,060
Therefore, I came here as quickly as I could from my home,

199
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,960
to see if I could be a helping hand to the Young Chief.

200

If Fu Lou wasn't the poisoner.

Chief Leng, with Miss Feng's situation at the moment,

203
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,010
it would still be better to not go in and disturb her.

207
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,670
It's poison.

208

You mustn't follow me.

209
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,800
Why would I follow you?

It would be better for me to use this drug, I can get Shangguan Qiu Yue drunk with it.

225
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,730

Xiao Chun Hua, what are you doing?

232
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,690
It seems like you're in a great mood, so I prepared some wine.

233

However, that bottle didn't have 'Three Day Drunk' in it.

00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,890
Yes. Well, I've never used that drug before,

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,110

 - It's an aphrodisiac.

What's that?

It's just something that arouses you.

287
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,390
Is it a drug that will make you like me more?

288
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,440
Xiao Chun Hua, you are tender-hearted.

289
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,330
You only grabbed the 'Three-Day Drunk.'

290
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,860
You hit the mark by a fluke. 
 (similar to seemingly missing the target but in the end, still hit the target)

291
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,120
You've caused our feelings to become deeper.

292
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,280
I initially meant to grab the arsenic.

293

You wouldn't!

294
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,900
But as far as your thoughts,

295
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,190
that's as far as I can guess.

296
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,760
As for how you would treat me,

297
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,480
I don't know.

298
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,200
As for whether your words are true or not,

299
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,690
I also don't know.

300
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,730
Maybe I should dig out your heart,

301
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,600
and see what on earth is written on it.

302
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,990
Excuse me, Miss! Is there an Uncle Yang who lives here?

303
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,860
He's my husband.

304
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,380
A few days after our recent wedding, he became severely ill.

305
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,930
He went to see doctors all over the city but it was no use.

306
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,520
The deceased's family lives in Bishui City, the person is Uncle Yang.

307
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,770
I found out that the deceased had a silver needle on the top of his head.

308
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,090
The Healer used this to manipulate and control corpses as puppets.

309
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,120
However, the Healer is dead.

310
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,180
Well, have you heard of the Healer before?

311
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,680
The Healer? No.

312
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,630
When Yang passed away, I couldn't afford his burial or coffin.

313
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,420
An unfamiliar but extremely charitable person,

314
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,930
said that he wanted to help me give Yang a decent burial.

315
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:16,050
- If that's the case, did you see Uncle Yang being buried for yourself? 
 - Yes.

316
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,590
So as for this extremely charitable person, did you ask for his name?

317
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,980
He said his surname was Zhong.

318
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,470
Do you really hate me that much?

319
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,520
No.

320
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,970
It's because I must get the antidote for the dandelion poison.

321
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,110
For Xiao Bai?

322
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,910
For myself.

323
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,430
The people at Fengming Mountain Manor poisoned me.

324
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,950
- I have to— 
 - It's no problem.

00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:19,630
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

344
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:48,020
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

345
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,910
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

346
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:56,430
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking it's eye  ♫

347
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,540
♫  Seeing through the fickleness of love  ♫

348
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,610
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

349
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:08,880
♫  It's such a pity for not stepping forward  ♫

350
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,960
♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

351
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,700
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

352
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,400
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

353
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,480
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

354
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,400
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

355
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,710
♫  It's hard to walk on, there's even no one to argue with  ♫

356
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,850
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

357
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,300
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

358
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,230
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

359
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:57,120
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

360
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,990
♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of the spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

361
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,140
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

362
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,060
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

363
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,510
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

364
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,560
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

365
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,000
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

366
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,750
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

367
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:48,160
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
