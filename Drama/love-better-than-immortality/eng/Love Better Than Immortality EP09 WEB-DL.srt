[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,310
I have recently heard a lot of rumors about Miss Chun Hua.

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,600
Brother Xiao is going to go to the Hua family to find out the truth.

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,970
Xiaolei did not die and I already found her.

34
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,600
I know I shouldn't have guessed around but I'm worried that the Demon Sect will take advantage of her.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,670
This Yetan City is filled with both good and bad people. I still think I should go and find her. 

36
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,040
In my heart, Little Chun Hua is the best.

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,940
Right now, I really must go back.

38
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,930
Mid-Autumn Festival should be spent with family.

39
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,750
Could Xiao Bai be more important than me?

40
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,650
[Episode 9]

Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,440
Little Chun Hua.

43
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,080
What are these?

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,380
Ice silk pearls! I'll give you one.

45
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,070
It feels alive.

46
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,390
These two ice silk pearls can call to each other.

47
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,550
But if one of them dies,

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,200
it will be difficult for the other to survive.

49
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,880
Come! I will help you put it on.

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,480
Next time, when you need me while stealing the Xin Fa or you want to see me,

51
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,310
say an incantation to the ice silk pearl.

52
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,260
What incantation?

53
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,310
When will Chun Hua (spring flower) and Qiu Yue (autumn moon) come to an end?

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,480
Is this something that I can say when I want to?

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,420
Are you trying to make things difficult for me?

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,850
Can we change the incantation?

57
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,220
Absolutely not! Ice silk babies already heard it.

58
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,820
Little Chun Hua, remember!  Take the ice silk pearl out to be under the moonlight every night.

59
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,330
I've heard of sunbathing

60
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,330
but I've never heard of moonbathing.

61
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,950
Breathe in the spiritual power of Heaven and Earth,

62
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,080
gather the essence of the sun and the moon.

63
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,370
If Xiao Bai sunbathes, then I will moonbathe.

64
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,660
Brother, what time is it now?

65
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,750
- It must be 11:00pm. 
 - 11:00pm?

66
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,590
No way! I have to go now.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,230
Little Chun Hua needs to obey my words.

68
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,860
The ice silk baby is watching you.

69
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,410
Sir, it's getting late.

70
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,450
We need to close up.  Can you...

71
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,270
Please let me wait a little longer.

72
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,870
Okay.

73
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Miss Chun Hua.

74
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,090
Xiao Bai, why are you not sleeping yet?

75
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,070
Miss Chun Hua, where did you go?

76
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,980
I went to buy mooncakes and watch the lanterns and then...

77
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,940
I... walked around and around, and then I got lost.

78
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,560
After getting lost and walking around and around, I got hungry.

79
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,950
After getting hungry, I ate all of the mooncakes.

80
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,920
After eating all of the mooncakes, I thought 'These mooncakes are for Xiao Bai.  How can I eat them all myself?'

81
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,690
So I made fresh mooncakes for Xiao Bai. Do you want to try them?

82
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,880
This world is dangerous out there and you don't know martial arts.

83
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,370
Next time, you shouldn't go outside alone.

84
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,420
Okay.

85
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,400
Come with me!  I have something important to tell you.

86
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,800
I have something important.  Please take a look.

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,630
Could he be giving me a present?

88
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,910
Xiao Bai has finally started to understand things properly.

89
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,990
I'm telling you, I accept your sincerity.

90
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,550
Don't spend so much money in the future.

91
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,470
This is too beautiful.

92
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,260
Xiao Bai, when have you painted this?

93
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,730
It's so similar!

94
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,840
Xiao Bai, you're so good to me.

95
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,040
Xiao Chun Hua needs to obey my words!

96
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,700
I can see everything that you do.

97
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,590
Tonight, I went to Hua Residence.

98
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,330
Uncle Hua himself admitted that the person in this painting

99
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,590
is indeed his daughter, Hua Xiaolei.

100
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,340
This isn't me?

101
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,880
But it's clearly me.  It's even exactly the same!

102
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,730
Could it be...

103
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,050
I am really Hua Xiaolei?

104
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,670
Am I not Shangguan Qiu Yue's younger sister?

105
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,030
How did I become Xiao Bai's fiance?

106
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,140
However, didn't Hua XiaoLei already...

107
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,760
We still need to investigate the truth of this matter.

108
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,320
Tomorrow, go with me to visit your father.

109
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Uncle Hua has been depressed for so long.

110
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,260
If he sees you, he should be much relieved.

111
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,620
Father, are you looking for me?

112
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,430
Que'er!

113
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,820
Xiaolei is still alive.

114
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,500
- Xiao Bai found her. 
 - She even dares to come back?

115
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,790
She is better staying dead than implicating our Hua Family.

116
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,080
Go immediately to the inn and find your younger sister.

117
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,560
Tell her absolutely not to come back to our family.

118
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,540
Yes, Father.

119
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,230
Hua Family already knows that Hua Xiaolei is still alive, don't they?

120
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,920
Yes, Hua Family has no other way out.

121
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,040
Hua Que is probably looking for Hua Xiaolei now.

122
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,980
What Hua Xiaolei?

123
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,780
She is now Little Chun Hua.

124
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,060
Since she has lost her memory, I will not treat her the same way that I treated Hua Xiaolei.

125
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,610
Miss Chun Hua and Hua Xiaolei are indeed like two different people.

126
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,110
- But now, Master, are you now... 
 - What is it?

127
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,010
Are you afraid that I will get sucked into this brother-sister game?

128
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,400
It's a good thing if it's interesting.

129
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,950
Fu Lou recent sent more men around Thousand Moon Cave.

130
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,020
Yousi is Fulou's biggest weak point.

131
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,260
Fulou initially thought he could keep the secret from the world.

132
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,250
But I didn't expected that my younger sister could pry it out so easily.

133
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,440
Of course, he's anxious.

134
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,050
The Chuanqi Sect must completely protect Yousi, still need to find the Longevity Fruit,

135
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,280
and must constantly guard against the Qianyue Sect.

136
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,350
- Their ability has already fallen short of their wishes. 
 - It couldn't be better.

137
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,550
Eating mooncakes and acting as her family are merely an adjustment.

138
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,590
It's so relaxed and cheerful, it's not a burden,

139
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,520
and there are many additional benefits.

140
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,540
So, Ye Xingzhu, what are you worried about?

141
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,190
You even intentionally mentioned Fulou.

142
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,120
Everything is under your control.

143
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,600
- I shouldn't have doubted it. 
 - I don't blame you.

144
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,740
Go and see how Hua Que is doing.

145
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,450
Yes.

146
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,790
So according to what you're saying,

147
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,630
you have long been suspecting that I was Xiaolei, haven't you?

148
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,880
Otherwise, you wouldn't have taken me back to the Hua family to be investigated.

149
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,760
Miss, you don't need to ask so many questions; in short,

150
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,200
I have 100 percent assurance.

151
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,820
What assurance?

152
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,840
The scar!

153
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,320
What scar?

154
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,210
I have to go back now. You should go to bed early.

155
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,570
See you tomorrow!

156
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,650
Scar? Even Xiao Bai knows about my scar?

157
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,100
- Miss Chun Hua. 
 - Xiao Bai?

158
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,680
That to say, I'm Xiao Bai's destiny!

159
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,800
Not right!

160
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,460
- What are you doing? 
 - Weren't you suspicious that I am lying to you?

161
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,760
On your body, you have a pink birthmark.

162
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,100
It's in the shape of a flower bud. That's the reason why you were named Chun Hua.

163
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,180
My brother said it was a birthmark.

164
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,620
Xiao Bai said it was a scar.

165
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,340
Did he lie to me?

166
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,990
- Who is it? 
 - Open the door. It's older brother.

167
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,770
You shouldn't imitate other people's voices, I simply don't know if it's you.

168
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:08,590
Besides, isn't it easy for you to enter wherever you want? Do you still need me to open the door for you?

169
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,950
Xiaolei, quickly open the door!

170
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,970
Xiaolei? How can older brother know I'm called Xiaolei.

171
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,980
You are really belong to Hua family!

172
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,440
I'm your older brother!

173
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,700
Have you lost your memory? Can't you remember me?

174
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,350
Let's talk inside!

175
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,720
What are you talking about?

176
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,840
Right now, we only have one option, leave as far away as you can from the Hua family.

177
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,090
The further, the better! Never come back again.

178
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,410
From now on, you are not Hua Xiaolei.

179
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,940
I'm also not your older brother; even more so, you aren't their daughter.

180
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,230
The matter between you and Shangguan Qiu Yue has brought shame upon the entire Hua family.

181
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,320
Wait...

182
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,700
What happened between Shangguan Qiu Yue and I?

183
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,880
You don't remember?

184
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,940
You mean I even...

185
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,570
I... Shangguan Qiu Yue and I...

186
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,830
had a love affair?

187
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,660
- This is impossible. 
 - If it weren't for this matter, why would I come to see you now?

188
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,820
In Shangguan Qiu Yue's eyes, I'm just a joke.

189
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,490
He called me 'little sister' so many times, but it has actually all been a lie.

190
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,900
This matter, you promised not to judge.

191
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,100
Does Xiao Bai know?

192
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,950
If he knows, it won't be just you,

193
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,570
but the entire Hua family will suffer.

194
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,570
Take advantage of the fact that Xiao Bai still hasn't discovered this yet, it would be best if you never returned again.

195
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,650
Xiao Bai said he would take me to Hua's family tomorrow.

196
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,080
I don't care about all that, figure it out yourself!

197
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,700
- But... 
 - No but.

198
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,470
But what does this have to do with me?

199
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,480
I mean to say.

200
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,840
That was the past.

201
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,760
I'm not Hua Xiaolei. I'm Chun Hua.

202
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,640
If that's the case, don't blame me if I don't think of the love between a brother and a sister.

203
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,570
Tomorrow, when we see each other, father and I absolutely will not acknowledge you.

204
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,130
Sister, haven't you died once?

205
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,340
Now, if you can just disappear completely,

206
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,890
only then, can I protect the Hua family.

207
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,170
You killed him?

208
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,880
- He wanted to set a fire and kill Hua— 
 - I'm not asking about him, I'm asking you.

209
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,460
Who told you to kill Hua Que?

210
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,680
It's all my fault.

211
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,310
Little Chun Hua has no brother now, can you compensate her for her loss?

212
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,870
I...

213
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,300
Have no brother...

214
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,890
Then I'm the only one who can compensate her with a brother, for you.

215
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,540
- Master. 
 - Stand up.

216
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,130
Little Chun Hua doesn't want to be my sister

217
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,060
but I still partially want to be her brother.

218
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,850
Master.

219
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,150
I've disrupted every corner of the world and now, I've gotten the opportunity to have a sister.

220
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,440
It's truly killing two birds with one stone, I'm pleased.

221
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,080
Furthermore, in the future, do not mention Fulou.

222
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,170
I am not Fulou.

223
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,140
I won't indulge myself in a love affair.

224
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,850
Yes.

225
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,980
I received an order from your son to come and support the Hua family in resolving this little annoyance of Xiao Bai.

226
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,840
So then, where is my son?

227
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,150
Why didn't he return first and discuss this over with me?

228
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,200
Master Hua, please don't worry. We've agreed to act together.

229
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,250
This time, your son is unable to be present for this occasion.

230
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,350
What do you mean?

231
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,280
I still know some martial arts.

232
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,330
From now on, I am Hua Que.

233
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,830
This... it's all right.

234
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,420
But... I must be cautious.

235
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,370
Just now, your son left in such a hurry that I forgot to ask,

236
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,460
Have he and Xiao Bai met?

237
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,320
Yes... they have seen each other before.

238
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,180
But it was already 15 years ago.

239
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,200
Right now, I'm afraid they won't recognize each other.

240
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,420
If it's so, that's good also!

241
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,600
 [Yingzhen Inn] 

242
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,450
Miss Chun Hua, it's time to go.

243
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,810
Wait a moment!

244
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,180
Miss Chun Hua.

245
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,960
Miss Chun Hua.

246
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,180
I'm going in, okay?

247
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,980
Miss Chun Hua.

248
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,800
Chun Hua.

249
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,890
Xiao Bai?

250
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,400
- Miss Chun Hua? 
 - I don't know.

251
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,670
I clearly just heard her when knocking.

252
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,580
Today, clearly she doesn't know how to face it.

253
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,880
So she hides alone.

254
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,290
Heaven protects me through this.

255
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,880
In that case, let's wait for Miss Chun Hua to figure it out.

256
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,920
Until that moment comes, just give her time to make a decision.

257
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,860
No, absolutely not! This matter cannot be delayed.

258
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,820
Brother Xiao, no way!

259
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,290
- Go, go, go on! 
 - This...

260
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,830
Finally gone!

261
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,780
Miss Chun Hua.

262
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,430
 [Hua Residence] 

263
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,670
If it comes to it, I'll just keep pretending that I lost my memory.

264
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,840
This won't hinder me.

265
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,200
I'm done for! They're fighting again.

266
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,970
Younger Sister, where were you?

267
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,990
You...

268
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,060
Did you freeze or starve?

269
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,010
That can't be! Even Xiao Bai has never seen Shangguan Qiu Yue?

270
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,210
Did someone bully you?

271
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,460
Could it be that you lost your memory?

272
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,550
What made my Little Sister to become so injured like this?

273
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,100
So it's Brother Hua. Excuse me! I beg you pardon.

274
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,910
 Xiao Bai hasn't seen Hua Que before, either, has he?

275
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,730
Yesterday, my father offended you.

276
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,990
I hope Hero Xiao will understand.

277
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,960
Not at all! I was too impulsive and, thus, have offended Old Master Hua.

278
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,390
Older Brother Hua, please don't take it to heart.

279
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,930
We're one family. Let's not talk like strangers.

280
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,760
Please enter!

281
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,490
Pardon me.

282
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,300
Hero Xiao, my father is holding this feast as an apology.

283
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,650
I hope Hero Xiao will appreciate it.

284
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,450
- Many thanks to Master Hua. 
 - Please!

285
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,770
What happened yesterday is so offensive.

286
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,400
I hope that Nephew (endearing term to call a son of a friend) will be generous to overlook it.

287
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,680
Little girl has returned safely now.

288
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,630
It is all thanks to you.

289
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,580
This old man will toast you once.

290
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,860
It was my negligence. I should have investigated clearly before coming.

291
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,960
Little Sister.

292
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,180
Brother Hua, why did you sigh?

293
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,500
Hero Xiao, you might not know,

294
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,280
My little sister and I have been inseparable since childhood while growing up.

295
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,390
Whatever it is, as long as she likes it,

296
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,560
even if it was the moon in the sky,

297
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,100
I wouldn't hesitate any bit to take it off and give it to her.

298
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,260
What a pity!

299
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:26,350
When I found out my little sister had died in the fire,

300
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:31,230
I couldn't stop my tears from streaming down my face, nor could I eat or drink.

301
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,570
Now,

302
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:41,320
it's even so hard for Little Sister to call me Older Brother.

303
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,460
Forget it!

304
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,420
It's all because Older Brother is not good

305
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,950
to let you suffer through so much.

306
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,330
When will you stop acting this scene?

307
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,180
Xiaolei,

308
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,000
you shouldn't be so rude to Brother Hua.

309
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,330
Older Brother.

310
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:27,930
Since you already called me "Older Brother," then it means you've already forgiven older brother.

311
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,700
Come! Sit here and let this older brother take a good look at you.

312
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,780
To be honest, it is really thoughtless of me.

313
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,480
Xiaolei isn't married yet, she should sit next to her brother.

314
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,110
Xiao Bai, aren't you a fool?

315
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,680
Why are you looking at me?

316
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,380
We all are a family so it doesn't matter where we sit, does it?

317
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,120
Since Xiaolei doesn't want to move,

318
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,100
then I can switch seats with you, Big Brother Hua.

319
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,870
Hero Xiao, please hurry to sit back down.

320
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,460
My little sister has been spoiled too much.

321
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,100
How can you be so impolite in front of our guest?

322
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,030
Do it quickly!

323
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,940
Come and sit over here!

324
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,290
Hero Xiao, please take your seat.

325
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,320
Come, Little Sister.

326
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,650
Eat more!

327
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,600
Just like this!

328
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,680
Have them all!

329
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,500
No problem! Hero Xiao, you should have some, too.

330
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,930
Come on, eat a little.

331
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
Have some more.

332
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,370
Brother Hua, please don't bother to see me out. I'll take my leave here.

333
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,590
Little Sister, where are you going?

334
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,400
- Of course, I want to go. 
 - Naturally, she's staying

335
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,490
to reminisce with Brother Hua and Uncle Hua.

336
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,730
It's a relief solution to the pain of the heart.

337
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,500
Hero Xiao, you are still the one who is very considerate.

338
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,160
It's hard to keep a grown-up girl home.

339
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm afraid my little sister hasn't totally given in to staying at home yet (lit. not in the heart nor the mind).

340
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,750
Xiaolei and I stayed at the inn because we had no option.

341
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,000
Now that you've reunited,

342
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,420
naturally, it would be more appropriate for you to stay at your home.

343
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,810
- No, it's not appropriate.  
 - I shall take my leave.

344
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,600
Goodbye.

345
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,450
No... no... Xiao Bai.

346
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,630
Xiao Bai!

347
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,490
- Stop calling! He's already gone. 
 - Xiao Bai.

348
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,220
It's better to play with me.

349
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,280
Xiao Bai!

350
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,080
Xiao Bai.

351
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,680
[(Left)The flowers bring about the clear morning sun of the sunny Spring day.] - [(Top and Center) The Spring is exuberant] - [(Right) The chirp of the warbler and the hundreds of flowers bring about the sunny Spring day]  

352
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,340
What on earth do you want to do?

353
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,400
I just want to play with you.

354
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,390
You're still acting?

355
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,050
Let me ask you! Where is Hua Que? Where did you hide him?

356
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,120
Why does Master Hua keep saying you're my brother?

357
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,220
It's the truth. I am your brother.

358
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,890
Please! Can you stop lying to me?

359
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,350
- When have I lied to you? 
 - You...

360
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,280
Hua Que came to find me yesterday.

361
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,650
He said that he's my real brother.

362
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,930
Xiao Chun Hua believes the words from a stranger.

363
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:18,130
Then how do you know that he didn't lie to you?

364
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,110
Fine! Even if he is a liar,

365
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,800
then you aren't a good person, either.

366
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,370
What's the point of being a good person?

367
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,160
- It's better to be Xiao Chun Hua's brother. 
 - You see?

368
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,060
Didn't you just admit it?

369
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,110
After I obtain the Xin Fa, you can I can be together forever.

370
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,490
You promised me!

371
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,230
Is this how you lied to Hua Xiaolei?

372
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,150
Let me tell you! I don't remember anything of my past.

373
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,810
I just need to know who I am right now and that's enough.

374
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,980
What Shangguan Chun Hua?

375
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,380
You made all of it up.

376
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,870
I see Shangguan Qiu Yue as my family, but all you want is just to use me.

377
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,020
- I just want to try it and see what the feeling of having a family is. 
 - What feeling?

378
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,850
Happy?

379
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,810
When will Chun Hua and Qin Yue come to an end?

380
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,770
- The feeling is quite good. 
 - Good like a f*rt! (a bad swear term)

381
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,760
Then let me ask you! How do you know about my birthmark?

382
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,780
Of course, I know.

383
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,000
You already forgot everything about us.

384
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,410
Let alone the birthmark,

385
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,380
every part of your body,

386
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,450
I know it all.

387
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,390
You... you mean...

388
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,750
- You.... 
 - You don't want to marry Xiao Bai. 
 - We...

389
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,990
You said you want to elope with me.

390
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,340
Enough, enough. Stop talking!

391
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,940
Do you recall it now?

392
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,250
I don't remember anything. I won't remember it for the rest of my life.

393
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,180
Actually... actually...

394
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,770
If someone loses their memory, they will change to be someone different.

395
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,420
We can expunge everything that's happened in the past.

396
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,890
Just pretend that it never happened.

397
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,650
I don't care if you believe me or not, but I am not Hua Xiaolei.

398
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,280
I do know.

399
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,050
Hua Xiaolei likes me

400
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,080
but you don't.

401
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,990
That's the general idea.

402
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,760
It's the same as saying Chun Hua has no relationship with Qiu Yue any longer.

403
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,890
How can you say it like that?

404
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,140
Xiao Chun Hua is still my younger sister.

405
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,240
Isn't that something you lied?

406
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,290
Xiao Chun Hua want to be with Xiao Bai?

407
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,950
I am originally his fiancée.

408
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,450
The Young Master's fiancée has a close relationship with me.

409
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,900
- The birthmark... 
 - Wait... no...

410
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,920
Not right! Not right! Not right!

411
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,420
Chun Hua is not Hua Xiaolei.

412
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,980
- Because Hua Xiaolei is already dead. 
 - But the birthmark is still there.

413
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,840
Then what do you want to do?

414
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:44,080
I want to try and see what the feeling of having a family is.

415
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,620
Okay.

416
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,990
Older Brother.

417
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,860
Brother Qiu Yue.

418
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,750
You can still continue to be my Qiu Yue brother.

419
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,150
- Is that okay? 
 - Okay.

420
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,710
Then.. can you...

421
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,360
- forget about that matter? 
 - What matter?

422
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,530
- It's... 
 - That matter!

423
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:22,450
Then it'll depend on how Xiao Chun Hua is doing as my younger sister.
