Miss, you can clearly investigate that.

More than that, it even includes medicine shops, rice shops,

how could you do this?

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,550
I've used many tricks to collect these.

58
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,870
Please show us, Miss Feng.

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,920
People in the restaurants and tea houses are sophisticated.

60
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,660
They can't deal with the silly, reckless guys.

61
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,610
They cherish their harmony and reputation,

62
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,420
or they won't have customers in the future.

63
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,360
But people from the escorts are totally different.

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,270
They can be persuaded by reason but don't bow to force.

65
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,180
Normally, they are tough guys in the martial arts world.

66
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,850
So they can't resist a heartwarming request.

67
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,140
Cosmetic shops are all small business.

As long as you are generous, you can get the account books quite easily.

69

As for the bank,

70

it's protected by both the government and local bully.

71
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,520
It's not a place to trifle with.

72
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,710
However if one is just and generous to talk to them about vital interests,

73
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,730
then they willingly cooperate.

74
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,430

I feel guilty for my brother's reputation of Healer.

113
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,370
How about this? Let me get Li Yu to make some medicine.

- Li Yu— 
 - Hold on.

115
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,940
With such a strong poison, I don't trust Li Yu's experience.

116
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,950
I would like to humbly ask you to do it personally.

117
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,310
Young Chef Master, you are right.

118
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,170
Li Yu is just a naughty child, playing around everyday.

119
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,060
In medicine skills, he really doesn't make any progress.

120
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,130
Then I'll go personally. I'll go personally.

121
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,320
Young Chief Master, I have something to tell you.

122
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,240
I met Li Yu today.

123
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,760
He also told me that the person who makes use of a dead body has the surname Zhong.

124
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,440
Zhong?

125
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,360
Baxian Residence doesn't have any person with the surname Zhong.

126
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,160
However, among the people we suspect, there is one related to Zhong.

127
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,600
Zhong?

128
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,240
Bo Zhong Shu? (One, two, three in Chinese.) Bu'er?

129
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,130
I just came to the same conclusion.

130
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,000
So if he makes Miss Chun Hua's medicine, it may work.

131
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,110
Miss Chun Hua could get back the Stone Lotus.

132
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,150
It means Shangguan Qiu Yue regarded her with special respect.

133
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,310
If Shangguan Qiu Yue really poisoned her,

134
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,940
then he just wanted to control Chun Hua.

135
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,640
He won't kill her.

136
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,650
As for Bu'er,

137
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,080
if he poisoned the medicine,

138
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,650
after we find out the truth, then we can know who Master Shi is!

139
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,460
Young Chief Master,

140
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,660
it's inappropriate to do this, isn't it?

141
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,040
Do not worry! I will definitely save Miss Chun Hua.

142
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,200
I will not let this matter degrade further.

143
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,920
I got it.

144
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,640
Miss Feng and the Young Chief Master really have lots of difficulties to go through.

145
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,270
Qin Liufeng, may we speak?

146
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,080

147
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,900
I will be back soon.

00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,800
How long since we last met?

149
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,320
I had almost forgotten you were my cousin.

150
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,330
It's normal to forget.

151
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,310
I'm at Qianyue Cave so naturally, I can't contact you.

152
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,860
It was my father's doing.

153
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,060
Every time you were mentioned, he would sigh.

154
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,720
Also, places like Qianyue Cave...

155
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,060
If I died along with my parents, then you could gain a reputation of being a hero.

156
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,170
Unfortunately, I let everyone down.

157
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,990
I was saved by Shangguan Qiu Yue.

158
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,520
In the whole of martial arts circle, no one believes Shangguan Qiu Yue would save other people.

159
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,100
There is a rumor that you went and sought refuge with him.

160
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,870
That's the reason why you caused a disaster for the entire family to be exterminated.

161
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:44,100
Although my dad knows the truth, the old chief came to talk to him again and again.

162
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,720
He did not allow him to speak the truth.

163
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,700
It has all passed.

164
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,290
Why did you come?

165
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,440
Has Miss Chun Hua been poisoned?

166
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,760
Miss Chun Hua's poison is called Hundred Flower Tribulation.

167
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,020
If she doesn't become emotional, then it won't be activated.

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,010
I do not believe you.

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,560
Miss Leng, she really is my cousin.

172
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,200
I think you just want to be doubly related!

173
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,680
She is Shangguan Qiu Yue's subordinate.

174
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,450
How can we get together?

175
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,420
So if she wasn't Shangguan Qiu Yue's subordinate, would there be a possibility?

176
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,590
We grew up together, what are you saying—

177
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,750
I think I overheard you speak of Shangguan Qiu Yue.

178
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,970
I was planning to tell you this, Leader Ye of Qianyue Sect is my cousin.

179
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,660
So Shangguan Qiu Yue indeed is near.

180
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,650
Miss Chun Hua, it's time to take your medication.

181
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,190
Please take this, Miss Chun Hua.

182
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,810
Hurry!

183
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,820
What is this?

184
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,690
Snow Lotus Seed!

185
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,490
Miss Feng, you are so generous!

186
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,540
This is Snow Lotus Seed.

187
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,840
It can detoxify the normal poison.

188
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,500
My illness is not worth using such a precious ingredient.

189
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,950
Miss Chun Hua, do not speak such nonsense.

190
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,590
If...

191
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,490
If I thought it over at that time,

192
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,080
Miss Caicai, you are a good person.

193
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,280
You fit well with Xiao Bai.

194
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,310
There is no "if" in this world.

People decide their own path.

196
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,250
Right now, you should concentrate in healing your body.

197
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,270
Then you can continue with Young Chief Master.

198
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,440
I genuinely wish you both well.

I've never heard of such a thing.

203
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:57,170
Currently, the problem is that Miss Chun Hua's poison has no cure.

204
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,220
It's okay normally, but it will attack if its person becomes enamored.

205
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,650
He said that Miss Chun Hua should have a flower in her palm.

206
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,260
Once it turns black, the poison will turn deadly

207
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,890
and the results will be fatal.

208
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,590
Is there actually such a poison?

209
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,110
Regarding this poison in Miss Chun Hua,

210
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,030
don't let Xiao Bai know about it, okay?

211
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,430
Qin Liufeng?

212
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,480
Shangguan Qiu Yue is the one who most likely poisoned Miss Chun Hua.

Shangguan Qiu Yue comes and goes as he pleases.

Where do you think we can find him?

216
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,980
The way to find Shangguan Qiu Yue is through Miss Chun Hua.

217
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,520
How so?

218
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,930
In terms of everything else, you know a lot more than me.

219
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,230
But regarding Miss Chun Hua, I'm definitely more knowledgeable than you.

220
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,430
You are right! Every time Miss Chun Hua is in danger,

221
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,230
Shangguan Qiu Yue appears.

222
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,960
Now that Miss Chun Hua won't see Shangguan Qiu Yue, this might turn into a good thing.

223
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,170
I do not want Miss Chun Hua to be in between our feud anymore.

224
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,470
I just want her to be safe.

225

Find Shangguan Qiu Yue and force him to cure Chun Hua.

This poison has no cure.

But in my mind,

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,910
the safest place is wherever Xiao Chun Hua is.

The toxicity of Hundred Flower Tribulation is reducing now.

239
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,620
Is it because you don't miss me recently?

00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,200
that I was trying to harm anyone.

Master, everyone from Qianyue Cave has gathered outside Baxian Town.

However, the martial arts circle show a huge power strength.

What we had done, has caught their attention.

293
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,190
It doesn't matter.

294
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,210
Qianyue Cave will want to be in the clear this time around.

295
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,560
We need to let the martial arts circle know

296

who controls the situation in the pugilist world

297
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,340
and who has let them act freely without hindrance.

What news is there from Fengming Mountain Manor?

299
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,660
They are troubled by clues to Master Shi's identity.

300
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,830
So annoying!

301
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,850
Should I personally help them if they are this weak?

302
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,170
The day after tomorrow, Bu'er will raise a big uproar to entertain the martial arts circle.

By then, if Xiao Bai still hasn't noticed that something is wrong,

304
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,510
I fear that it will affect Miss Chun Hua negatively.

305
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:36,550
It doesn't have a lot of time but many sects still harbor evil intent.

306

If all goes smoothly that day,

309
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,760
I will be able to take Xiao Chun Hua back to Qianyue Cave.

310
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,410
Yes.

311
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,220
I just want to beg you, Master,

312
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,880
you should better go to a safer place for the time being.

313
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,290
Safer place?

314
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,200
Xiao Chun Hua is nervous about her poison everyday.

315
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,980
It doesn't matter.

316
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,210
Miss Chun Hua,

317
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,920
I'm checking Baxian Residence accounts.

318
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,120
Miss Caicai, how is your investigation?

319
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,170
Now, we have two suspects. One is the disciple of Baxian Residence, Li Yu.

320
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,130
The other one is his master, Bu'er.

321
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,450
Li Yu is not Master Shi.

322
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,950
Miss Chun Hua, how are you so sure?

323
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,250
However, what you said is logical.

324
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,690
Young Master Qin found out that the landlady of the restaurant is the mother of Li Yu.

325
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,910
She was pregnant in the brothel before so she got kicked out.

326
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,020
The Healer took her in.

327
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,110
Li Yu was naughty when he was young. Others deluded him so he became a gambler.

328
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,430
It's also the Healer who corrected and got him out from gambling; thus, he became his disciple.

329
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,670
I never imagined they have such a sad past.

330
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:40,150
Since it was like this, those two would appreciate the Healer.

331
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,440
If they weren't threatened by others,

332
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,210
they wouldn't do evil with the Healer's skills.

333
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,490
You are right.

334
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,360
Moreover, Li Yu's life currently is also pitiful.

335
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,840
He doesn't show any sign of wanting to get rich.

336
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,460
As for this Bu'er, two years after the Healer died,

337
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,660
his business has spread all over Baxian City.

338
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,050
So are you saying that every piece of evidence

339
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,060
all points to Master Bu'er?

340
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,710
The most interesting thing is Li Yu surrendered to me yesterday.

341
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,840
Bu'er, Bu'er.

342
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:27,010
We probably need to seriously consider if he is Master Shi.

343
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,170
This deduction is very convincing indeed.

344
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,340
However...

345
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,730
Bu'er seems to be very nice.

346
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,510
I really can't believe it.

347
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:42,920
We didn't expect human's greed and darkness would pan out to be like this.

348
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,210
It's just that by selling the Longevity fruit, he should have become rich already.

349
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,480
However, after checking the accounts for a long time,

350
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,890
I didn't find any abruptly change.

351
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,490
Hence, these can't become evidence.

352
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,760
Greed and stinginess are two sides of one thing.

353
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,690
Bu'er accumulated wealth through unfair means

354
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,510
but that still does not mean he plans to spend all that money.

355
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:15,430
I suspect he might have hidden his wealth somewhere.

356
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,790
This is his seized fortune after all. Yes!

357
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,750
Furthermore, the place he hid it

358
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,840
must be somewhere that he can reach easily and get to quickly,

359
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,810
then he could feel at ease.

360
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:33,810
Miss Chun Hua, do you mean that his precious fortune

361
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,130
is hidden in the Baxian Residence?

362
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,530
I think a person like Bu'er would definitely believe

363
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:46,190
that the more public a place is, indeed the safer it is.

364
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,130
What you said makes sense.

365
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,750
Then, Miss Chun Hua, why don't you stay and rest here?

366
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,070
[Baxian Residence]

367
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,360
Baxian Residence is not big.

368
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,510
It should be easy to find these stolen treasures.

369
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,100
I even searched the aisles.

370
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,980
The inside is empty and there is no space to store things.

371
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,440
This is where the problem lies.

372
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,930
We spent so many hours but there is no clue at all.

373
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,000
That's right, Miss Feng! Why didn't Young Chief Master come with you?

374
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,880
He is still troubled by Miss Chun Hua's poison.

375
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,750
All day, he is racking his brain for answers.

376
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,970
However, Miss Chun Hua and Shangguan Qiu Yue clearly have—

377
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,220
Young Chief Master likes Miss Chun Hua.

378
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,060
Miss Chun Hua is coincidentally here.

379
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,570
We shouldn't rain on his parade (spoil his joy).

380
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,140
Besides, I predict that

381
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,980
the bird I saw yesterday was indeed Shangguan Qiu Yue's.

382
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,630
How do you know?

383
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,660
The mark I saw on Miss Chun Hua's palm today

384
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,200
is deeper in color now.

385
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,220
We cannot continue like this anymore.

386
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,860
Shangguan Qiu Yue cannot be by Miss Chun Hua's side for much longer.

387
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:38,190
No good will come from this for Chun Hua or the Young Chief Master.

388
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,300
Maybe it will even cause more trouble.

389
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,060
Miss Feng, we meet again!

390
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,150
This Li Yu seems to have fallen for our Caicai.

391
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,350
This brat really has some guts.

392
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,280
However...

393
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,160
You still have me and I have you.

394
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,560
Did you look for me for something earlier?

395
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,140
You came at the right time as I have some questions for you.

396
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,670
I will answer without reserve.

397
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,460
You has come to Baxian Residence for over a year.

398
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,100
Do you know where to store goods here?

399
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,130
Although I was manipulated and instructed by Master Bu'er,

400
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,490
he has always been cautious.

401
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,970
He just forced me to do some menial, dirty work.

402
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,460
He keeps everything else private.

403
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,700
This kind of person worships money like his life.

404
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,370
There's no way he'd willingly give away his precious things to another person.

405
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,940
It might also be true! If he told you, it's likely you'd have run away with the money.

406
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,920
If that is the case,

407
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,260
then would I lose the chance to get to know Miss Feng?

408
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,950
Do you know what quirks Master Bu'er has?

409
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,640
He doesn't like the company of women.

410
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,530
He does not like alcohol.

411
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,150
He wakes up earlier than anyone but goes to sleep later than most.

412
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,590
To an outsider, compared to those respectable lords,

413
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,840
he is even more self-disciplined.

414
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,000
However, if you ask me about his specific quirks,

415
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,610
there still is something.

416
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,770
Tell me quickly!

417
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,990
Bu'er has a very interesting habit.

418
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,260
He likes to sweep this hallway himself.

419
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,090
He does it three times a day at least.

420
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,230
I do not know if it is just a habit,

421
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,370
or he is unwilling to spend money to hire people.

422
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,580
- Sweep the common hallway? 
 - Yes.

423
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,750
This has nothing to do with his money nor treasure.

424
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,510
Are you looking for me?

425
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,900
A brother who wears white,

426
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,060
told me to find the laziest young miss in this village.

427
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,660
All the female villagers told me that it's you.

428
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,680
- What did you need me for? 
 - Give me my money!

429
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,650
He drew me this flower

430
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,110
and said you would give me money if you saw this flower.

431
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,040
What else did this uncle say?

432
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,720
That brother is still very young, how can you call him uncle?

433
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,400
He only said two words, "Chun Hua."

434
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,600
Go back and tell him that Chun Hua is not coming today.

435
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,890
I will give you twice as much money.

436
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:39,080
Brother told me not to be greedy.

437
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,310
Shangguan Qiu Yue,

438
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,630
don't you know that the situation is very dangerous right now?
