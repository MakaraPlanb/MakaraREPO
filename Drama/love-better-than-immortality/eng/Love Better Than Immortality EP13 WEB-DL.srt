 If I can’t memorize the Xin Fa, then forget it.

 Won't this benefit Shangguan Qiu Yue, a freeloader? 

33
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,710
 In the past, when my mother married into this household, 

34
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,460
 my father made it their love token that my mother loved so much. 

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,970
 They didn't exchange rings in the past. 

36
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,770
 This counts as a marriage proposal, doesn't it? 

37
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,340
 As soon as you got engaged, you wanted to get rid of me. 

38
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,500
 What do you have to discuss conditions with me? 

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,120
 I didn't disappoint your wishes.

 I finally mastered Xiao Xiao Fengming Saber's last technique. 

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,780
 You used a fake Xin Fa to trick me which made me very sad. 

42
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,740
 I knew that you would regret it. 

43

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,310
You have been traveling a lot recently so, perhaps, you’re tired.

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,030
That's not necessarily true.

52

It’s such a pity that there are no gains.

Xiao Bai has already mastered the Fengming Saber’s last technique.

54

The Xiao family's Xin Fa is of no use now.

55
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,650
Tell me,

56
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,300
is Xiao Chun Hua, who is responsible for stealing the Xin Fa, still useful?

57
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,840
She knows too much.

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,170
According to past conventions, when there’s no need for someone, kill him.

59
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,210
Xiao Chun Hua is too interesting so it would be a pity to kill her.

60
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,610
I’ll find a way to make her useful.

Everyone, Old Master Xiao

65
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,500
was honest, righteous, and principled, and didn't show favoritism.

66

He did his duty to assist the righteous sects and strengthen Wulin Sects.

67
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,650
With his martial arts skills and intelligence,

68
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,370
he was, without exception, a hero who ensured peace and prosperity.

69
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,700
- Today– 
 - “Honest and righteousness?"

70
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,240
“A hero who ensured peace and prosperity?" What a joke!

71
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,610
Who dares act rashly here? You aren't allowed to slander the Master’s reputation!

72
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,340
 A group of extremely hypocritical evildoers. 

73
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,800
Since you’re here to pay your condolences,

74
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,610

Young Master, have you already mastered the Fengming Saber’s last technique?

96
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,140
Then, before Xiao Yuan died, did he pass you the Xuanbing Stone?

They all say that you murdered Chief Xiao.

I know that it’s not true.

So what exactly is your relationship with Chief Xiao?

108
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,810
He poured away the medicine?

That’s interesting!

00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,730
I have no relationship with Master Xiao.

00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,590
When have I lied to you?

112
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,500
 I have been deceived by you, time and again.

Since you’re so curious, why don't you personally go and listen?

Listen carefully!

117
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,160
 Indeed, my father has given me a crystal. 

118
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,000
However, it isn't a Xuanbing Stone.

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,180
Chief Li, how can you say such lies?

120
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,220
Is that crystal in the shape of a white lotus flower?

121
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,830
With blood stains on the petal?

122
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,970
How did you know that?

123
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,400
That was a gift from my father’s friend.

124
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,000
Friend?

125
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,730
Hui'er gave the Xuanbing Stone to Xiao Yuan to master the Fengming Saber

126
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,160
to become the leader of Wulin sects in order to protect her son.

127
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,830
But now, she ended up with only the title of someone's friend.

128
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,800
The friend who gave the Xuanbing Stone to my father,

129
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,410
who was it?

130
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,840
Didn't Xiao Yuan dare mention her name?

131
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,600
He even doesn't deserve to mention her name.

132
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,710
Hui'er, Hui'er...

133
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,970
Even if you are the Devil's own sister, so what?

134
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,050
- You are still my beloved Hui'er. 
 - What? Chief Xiao?

135
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,410
- How could he be involved with a Qianyue Sect enchantress? 
 - Yes... yes...

136
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,590
Qianyue Sect?

137
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,110
Do you still say you have no relationship with Chief Xiao?

138
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,120
There are many people in Qianyue Cave.

139
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,150
How could I be involved with every mishap that occurs?

140
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,960
However, this is still so wonderful.

141
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,180
This Xiao Bai, in order to cultivate the Fengming Saber techniques,

142
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,060
he still needs to rely on the "Enchantress of Qianyue Cave."

143
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,660
Xiao Bai doesn't need the Xuanbing Stone.

144
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,270
He still can master the Fengming Saber without it.

145
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,770
Stop this nonsense! My father was open and honest his entire life.

146
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,890
How could he have a love affair with a Demon Sect temptress?

147
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,480
Xiao Yuan's biggest life achievement was leading his men to attack Qianyue Cave,

148
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,310
to become the leader of the martial arts circle, a hero revered by all in his generation.

149
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,340
So naturally, the deeper he buried this sordid past affair, the better.

150
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,120
I merely ask you this.

151
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,370
Each year, on the eighth month and 15th day

152
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,440
is the day of family reunions.

153
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,100
Have you ever spent even one Mid-Autumn Festival with your father?

154
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,190
Did Xiao Bai never celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival?

155
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,000
But my father acted in the interest of justice his whole life.

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,180
Thus, he had little time to spend with his family.

157
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,080
How could you slander my father so?

158
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,620
Do you know that every year, on the 15th day of the eighth month,

159
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,520
your father, who so deeply cared about the martial arts circle, hurried far away

160
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,220
to the lotus pond of Sangtian village to stay there all night.

161
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,900
You don't believe me, do you?

162
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,330
Fine!

163
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,100
I'll ask you again.

164
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,260
You were with your father everywhere for twenty years.

165
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,480
Near his heart, didn't you see

166
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,470
the carved ice lotus flower?

167
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,800
Regarding events of those years, no need to evade, Chief Li.

168
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,660
You might as well tell everyone.

169
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,240
I believe my father can withstand any test regarding his post.

170
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,800
Twenty-four years ago, Xiao Yuan and I

171
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,650
were hunted and poisoned by Xing servants.

172
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,610
We accidentally entered the ice gorge of the nearby Qianyue Cave.

173
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,880
Hui'er saved us.

174
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,080
The ice silk likes him!

175
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,380
Miss, the one on the left was poisoned so it does not bode well for him.

176
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,820
He is so handsome but cannot be saved.

177
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,390
Indeed, beautiful things cannot survive in the ice gorge.

178
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,080
The lotus flower cannot survive, either.

179
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,170
You're awake!

180
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,870
Thank you so much for saving my life, Miss.

181
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,440
His life cannot be saved.

182
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,030
He was poisoned so he won't be able to survive.

183
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,760
That moment was both beautiful and strange.

184
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,750
In my whole life, I will never forget.

185
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,940
Afterwards, I learned Hui'er was born with a fear of heat.

186
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,640
Therefore, she had to live in the ice gorge her whole life.

187
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,200
These eyelashes are very long.

188
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,740
My ice silk pearl!

189
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,990
I never once expected that

190
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,610
her lotus flower

191
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,820
could actually neutralize the poison in Xiao Yuan's body.

192
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,870
Hui'er took care of him non-stop for three days and three nights.

193
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,100
From that moment on,

194
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,160
she fell deeply in love with him.

195
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,370
Now, you also have a lotus flower.

196
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,610
Xiao Yuan is finally awake.

197
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,520
Brother Li, we've been in this ice gorge for almost three months.

198
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,200
At the moment, our decisive battle with the Qianyue Sect draws near.

199
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,460
I think it would be best if we establish contact with the Chief.

200
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,410
But I think there's no harm in waiting for your full recovery before leaving.

201
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,790
I apologize for the trouble, Brother Li.

202
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,100
Who dares to leave?

203
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,000
Miss Hui'er.

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,420
Either you stay here and be with me, or I'll kill you both.

205
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,930
Dare you go? Impossible.

206
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,280
Don't you think that Shangguan Hui and you are very similar?

207
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,980
How are we similar?

208
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,510
Both of them are self-centered.

209
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,420
Do you think that I'm as stupid as her?

210
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,690
Shangguan Hui.

211
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,770
Shangguan Qiu Yue?

212
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,220
You two must be related in some way.

213
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,450
Yes.

214
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,580
Shangguan Chun Hua and Shangguan Qiu Yue are also related in some way.

215
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,450
Keep on listening!

216
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,570
Shangguan Hui is indeed the enchantress of Qianyue Cave.

217
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,020
Even if she paid no attention to the world, she was still fierce and cruel.

218
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,660
Speaking of being fierce and cruel,

219
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,490
Hui'er never harmed anyone.

220
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,200
She even saved me and Xiao Yuan.

221
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,960
I should like to ask Chief Feng,

222
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,300
can you remember the number of men who died under your sword?

223
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,740
Chief Li, it's different from what you say.

224
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,000
A human's good and evil are absolutely not determined by nature.

225
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,050
One's nature must be cultivated, enlightened, and educated.

226
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,830
Chief Xiao, at that time and under those circumstances,

227
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,230
encountered his savior but still chose the Righteous Path.

228
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,270
This is virtuous, righteous behavior.

229
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,630
Miss Feng, you are exactly right.

230
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,760
You two are indeed a perfect pair,

231
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,980
a pair of hypocrites!

232
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,390
Did you hear that? A perfect pair!

233
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,240
Do you think that as well?

234
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,930
I can understand what Shangguan Hui wanted to do.

235
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,130
However, I agree with her.

236
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,650
Life is precious and it needs to be cultivated.

237
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,290
So Shangguan Hui just wanted to keep Chief Xiao with her,

238
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,770
but her method was extremely ruthless and too vicious.

239
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,640
In this whole world, no one has the qualifications to judge Hui'er.

240
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,450
Do you know that the Xuanbing Stone was carved into the stone lotus

241
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,830
and Hui'er just gave it to Xiao Yuan?

242
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,580
- If I had known... 
 - If? This is all garbage!

243
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,960
Since you all want to be gentlemen,

244
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,290
then why don't you be a gentlemen to the very end?

245
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,580
Hui'er was deceived by all of your hypocritical exteriors

246
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,130
and fell in love with the wrong man.

247
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,240
Have you seen a real lotus flower before?

248
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,870
Of course!

249
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,400
But I have never.

250
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,110
Due to my fears and health, I have to live in this extremely cold ice gorge.

251
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,340
Once, I ventured out,

252
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:04,230
but from afar, I was only able to see the bright blue rolling waves.

253
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,510
Afterwards, my brother

254
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,960
took the ice silk pendant and carved a lotus flower shape.

255
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,800
Now, my chest has the lotus flower that you gave me.

256
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,970
In my hometown,

257
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,140
the Mid-Autumn Festival is a time for family reunion.

258
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,800
On this day, the women in the family will release lotus flower lanterns,

259
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,770
and make a wish under the moon hoping for

260
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,800
a full family reunion.

261
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,950
Then I want to spend my Mid-Autumn Festival together with Brother Xiao.

262
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,120
Brother Xiao,

263
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,560
your heart is beating really fast.

264
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,410
This is my lotus flower lantern.

265
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,810
My wish is

266
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,020
to be with you forever, and never will we part.

267
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,200
I did not expect that

268
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,590
the Xuanbing Stone and the Xiao family's Xin Fa would become one.

269
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,230
It helped Xiao Yuan master the long-lost martial arts skill.

270
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,950
Hui'er!

271
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,470
Hui'er,

272
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,240
I mastered the last move of the Fengming Saber.

273
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,920
Xiao Yuan carried great burdens and responsibilities.

274
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,430
He accepted his relationship with the world's people as unavoidable.

275
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,560
Knowing the importance of martial arts, he decided to leave.

276
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,260
Hui'er,

277
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,040
I must leave the gorge.

278
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,420
But you promised, on the 15th day of the eighth month, you'll light lanterns to make a wish with me.

279
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,370
I promise, whether matters are handled or not, on the 15th day of the eighth month,

280
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,520
I will definitely light the lanterns and make a wish with you, no matter what.

281
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,890
Brother Xiao,

282
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,090
your heart beats really fast.

283
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,690
The Fengming Saber is indeed the most valuable treasure in the world.

284
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,420
It is able to intertwine people with itself.

285
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,020
I think you may not know about that

286
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,760
in addition, after succeeding the last move, the Fengming Saber

287
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,460
can sound out "Xiao Xiao Fengming Wai"

288
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,300
when its master comes across the one whom he loves.

289
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,520
The uttered sound is the same as that of a heartbeat.

290
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,890
Has Mistress Xiao

291
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,030
heard this type of sound before?

292
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,560
Little Chun Hua, has Xiao Bai's Fengming Saber made a sound for you?

293
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,060
Xiao Bai has only just mastered the Fengming Saber.

294
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,960
Now, are you looking forward to it sounding out to you?

295
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,270
Don't you want to listen anymore?

296
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,950
Don't you want to know how Shangguan Hui died?

297
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,190
She died from her own stupidity.

298
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,920
So boring!

299
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,860
Regardless of the Xuanbing Stone's use or Shangguan Hui's real identity,

300
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,640
my father didn't know any of this beforehand.

301
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:55,120
No wonder, the Chief's skills suddenly improved dramatically.

302
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,360
It was because he had mastered the long-lost Fengming Saber's last move.

303
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,010
I remember that back then, his skills unexpectedly improved a lot but he was depressed.

304
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,290
Now, it was presumably due to this ill-fated relationship.

305
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,600
Of course, he couldn't be happy.

306
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,490
It was because he soon figured out Shangguan Hui's true identity.

307
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,530
Hui'er is Qianyue Cave Master's younger sister.

308
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,750
If you truly love Hui'er, then stay here.

309
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,660
Don't bother with the grievance between the Righteous Path and Qianyue Sect anymore.

310
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,790
I knew that Xiao Bai would not return on the 15th day of the eighth month.

311
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,910
That was the exact day of our last-ditch fight with the Qianyue Sect.

312
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,460
Only in that way,

313
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,090
could Xiao Yuan become the next chief of the martial arts circle.

314
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,860
Miss, you must leave!

315
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,590
Miss, you must leave! The Righteous Path is attacking.

316
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,540
Some Xingzhu must have betrayed us, and the Cave Master died right then and there.

317
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,360
Let's go, Hui'er!

318
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,920
Hui'er.

319
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,920
Where is the Xuanbing Stone?

320
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,700
Hui'er had given the Xuanbing Stone to Xiao Yuan,

321
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,890
and thus, caused the death of her own brother.

322
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,200
The great hero in your eyes, the leader of the martial arts circle,

323
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,800
whose greatest achievement was to wipe out the Demon Path,

324
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,400
- solely relied on a young girl for it all! 
 - How can this be?

325
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,370
- Don't you think it's laughable and ridiculous? 
 - Impossible!

326
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,660
Brother Li, we also went out to find you

327
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,080
but it was already too late.

328
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,700
I was pushed off a cliff, fell to the bottom, and was disfigured.

329
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,900
So now, I have become like this.

330
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,130
I initially thought that all troubles would end when the main issue ended.

331
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,820
I was sustained by my two reasons to continue living.

332
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,280
The first, it's to rescue the fully insulted, disgraced Hui'er.

333
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,460
And the second is to make Xiao Yuan

334
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,790
lose all the outstanding reputation.

335
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,900
I see! You are the one who killed the Chief.

336
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,500
He died because he cut his own veins.

337
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,160
I originally gave him the Xuanbing Poison,

338
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,780
to make him experience a fraction of the pain Hui'er suffered all those years.

339
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,240
I had no idea this coward would take the easy way out.

340
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,850
He really was let off too lightly.

341
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,750
I finally know

342
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,860
what my father always did during Mid-Autumn Festivals.

343
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,820
Now Xiao Yuan has died.

344
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,440
Hui'er,

345
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,280
I will be with you today.

346
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,700
We will truly never be apart.

347
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,170
Wait for me!

348
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,400
Wait for me!

349
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,830
Brother Li!

 [Wind Listening Pavilion] 

351
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,980
 [Wind Listening Pavilion] 

352
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,470
Let him have a moment of solitude.

353
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,900
I didn't expect the previous Chief would have that kind of a past.

354
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,790
A single general achieves fame on the rotting bones of tens of thousands.

355
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,300
Who set a game here?

356
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,020
This is so confusing.

357
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,960
I also don't know if this is just the beginning

358
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,750
or the end of the game that was formed by disrupting the chess pieces in a puzzling way.

359
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,640
Discard this chessboard and go.

360
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,970
- This chess game looks like today's situation. 
 - Why do you say so?

361
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,990
These two white and black chess pieces can be compared to Shangguan Hui and Chief Xiao.

362
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,310
Only these two pieces are dependent and related,

363
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,780
as if they are in a love situation.

364
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,050
So right!

365
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:07,120
If there is no interference from others, where is black and white, good and evil?

366
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,130
These two chess pieces can stay together for a long time.

367
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,250
However, even in a game, there is no such good thing.

368
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,480
If a great wave of white pieces enter,

369
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,090
one day, how can this sole white piece

370
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,460
lose its identity

371
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,450
to live peacefully with the black chess piece?

372
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,800
Of course, it can!

373
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,050
If I were to be in these circumstances,

374
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,450
we have to depend on each other, surviving and dying together.

375
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,040
Even if I have to betray my original sect, I still wouldn't hesitate.

376
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,070
But if this white piece is the right way,

377
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,880
this black piece is the same way as evil.

378
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,940
What an insignificant situation!

379
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,060
The white piece should stick to the right way.

380
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,810
The white piece should uphold the Righteous Path.

381
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,130
What about the black piece then?

382
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,770
Cut the mess quickly with a sharp knife!

383
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,370
Miss Feng, if it's as straightforward as you said,

384
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,370
how could there be a situation like Shangguan Hui's?

385
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,950
Rules of the world, rules of love,

386
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,890
in the end, it's all but just a puzzle.

387
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:31,920
I also don't know which choice the Young Master will take.

388
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,640
Young Master?

389
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,770
Xiao Bai?
