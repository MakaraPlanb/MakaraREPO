00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,250
♫  The story I want is very sweet, very sweet  ♫

[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,420
This girl does not know any martial arts.

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,030
Her background and origin are all suspicious.

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,390
What does Xiao Bai actually like?

34
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,650
I would assume you're not interested in what he likes but whom he likes. 

35
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,600
Miss Chun Hua revived because she ate the longevity fruit but she completely lost her memory.

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,400
Based on my observation, she isn't someone tactful.

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,130
Miss is our Fengming Mountain Manor's precious guest. I strive to protect you.

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,620
As long as you are here with me, Chun Hua won't be afraid.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,560

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,410
 [The white, delicate skin has a spot of red.] 

42
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,020
"The white, delicate skin has a spot of red." Such a good poem! Good poem!

43
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,590
I should not have told you about the private bath situation.

44
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,840
You tested her for so long. Did Miss Chun Hua have no reaction to the kite?

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,000
Is that why you let her stay in Miss Hua's room?

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,930
It's such a pity that it was renovated after the big fire.

47
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,620
I don't know if she can remember it.

48
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,380
You really put a lot of thought into this. However...

49
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,050
Does Brother Qin have a good idea?

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,490
Tell me how you will thank me first.

51
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,060
I'll repay your great kindness with heartfelt thanks.

52
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,940
I just want a few jars of aged wine. Don’t be so stingy!

53
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,940
Hurry up and tell me.

54
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,760
First, you think Miss Chun Hua is Miss Hua.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,890
Second, Miss Hua never left her room. No one ever saw her.

56
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,230
You two only met once in childhood.

57
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:15,040
Third, Miss Chun Hua already lost her memory and your research had no result.

58
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,480
So...

59
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,400
I can't help you.

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,730
Calm down! What I mean is...

61
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,840
the Hua  Family can help you, not me.

62
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,790
Why the Hua Family?

63
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,540
We can go ask the Hua Family for her portrait.

64
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,130
Wouldn't it be all clear then?

65
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,280
You can still fly the kite.

66
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,410
Miss Chun Hua.

67
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,980
Are you satisfied with your new place?

68
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,310
I am satisfied, very satisfied.

69
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,100
Older Brother, quickly leave! If he enters—

70
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,820
Don't worry!

71
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,860
He won't break into a girl's room.

72
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,670
What if there's an exception?

73
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,070
Xiao Bai, what are you here for?

74
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,080
Why don't you come in to talk?

75
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
I don't need to enter your room.

76
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,760
We should just talk from the outside.

77
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:22,000
Xiao Bai, do you have something important to say?

78
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,030
I forgot to tell you just then that

79
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,990
the annual poem meeting will be in half a month.

80
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,650
Are you interested in attending?

81
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,360
Then I—

82
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,490
Will you also go?

83
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,650
This year, I host this meeting so I will be there.

84
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,710
Then you should take me there.

85
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,860
My pleasure, I will. Get some rest. I'll leave now.

86
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,350
Xiao Bai, there's something I don't know if I should ask.

87
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,570
Please do.

88
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,750
Why are you so good to me?

89
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,690
You changed my room and even want to take me to the poetry meeting.

90
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,400
You don't need to worry.

91
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,120
You just need to remember that I mean no harm.

92
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,740
Older Brother, do you try to scare me to death?

93
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,590
What's there to fear? I think it's quite fun.

94
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,550
You just have to believe that I mean no harm.

95
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,790
How did you make Xiao Bai trust you so much?

96
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,920
Aren't they just some little tricks?

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,970
I did all this to help Older Brother get the Xin Fa.

98
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,430
Oh, right! Older Brother,

99
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,260
how do you imitate others' voices?

100
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,350
You can, too.

101
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,030
Me?

102
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,100
Older Brother, I can't.

103
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,840
You used to know how before.

104
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,800
Unfortunately, I already lost my memory.

105
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,320
Why don't you teach me again?

106
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,760
Come here!

107
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,170
Turn around!

108
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,220
Now, try again.

109
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,870
Just like this...

110
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,860
Miss Chun Hua.

111
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,800
Why are you laughing? Is it funny?

112
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,480
It's fun. Of course, what Older Brother taught is fun.

113
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,040
Are you done playing?

114
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,060
If I don't get the Xin Fa in three days,

115
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,970
I will kill you.

116
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,130
Older Brother wouldn't dare kill me.

117
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,550
I remember now.

118
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,440
Three days later, get the Xin Fa.

119
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,340
I guarantee it.

120
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,230
 This Older Brother with sudden mood changes from joy to anger is too dangerous. 

121
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,380
Gu Xingzhu, why are you back?

122
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,710
Where's Master? He's not in Thousand Moon Cave.

123
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,180
Master went to look for his little sister.

124
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,450
Little sister?

125
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,520
It’s Hua... his younger sister.

126
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,330
Things underwent huge changes in this world.

127
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,480
Yet he still insists that one person steal the Xin Fa.

128
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,810
I advise you to mind your words.

129
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,030
Xiao Yan, you still draw such a clear line between your personal and work affairs.

130
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,910
We are all Master’s subordinates.

131
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,930
It is much more convenient this way.

132
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,490
This surely is funny.

133
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,540
I previously heard an old rumor.

134
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,160
Master wants Xiao Yan to be as good as dead

135
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,550
because it’s his mother’s dying wish.

136
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,300
It's no wonder he is especially interested

137
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,830
in the Xiao family’s Xin Fa.

138
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,180
It’s time to make the medicine.

139
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,420
 [Chuanqi Sect] 

140
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,030
My Dear, when I left the gorge yesterday,

141
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,430
I got information of a rare medicine.

142
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,640
Your illness finally has a cure.

143
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,360
There was a rather long holdup that caused you worry.

144
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,940
I will be worried…

145
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,360
Gorge Master, someone from Qianyue Sect is here.

146
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,680
My Dear, wait for my return.

147
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,110
Gorge Master, do you want me to act now?

148
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,630
Why are you suddenly so anxious?

149
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,630
You already attained a leader rank for three years.

150
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,830
After this, you’ll either be murdered by a disciple,

151
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,060
or you must murder Shangguan Qiu Yue to become the Cave Master.

152
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,050
It seems that you only have these two choices.

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,230
The Cave Master of Qianyue Sect is the most respected.

154
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,520
Among his nine leaders,

155
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,270
the strongest will emerge victorious.

156
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,420
Plotting a rebellion is not a serious offence.

157
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,040
Losing (a serious "crime") leads to a death penalty.

158
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,950
Back then, you also had murdered your leader.

159
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,630
Being a leader is much more comfortable

160
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,290
than being a disciple, isn’t it?

161
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,590
Shangguan Qiu Yue’s capabilities are fathomless.

162
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,310
Are you worried about this?

163
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,270
I have a plan to help you…

164
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,470
take over Qianyue Sect.

165
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,300
Take action as soon as possible.

166
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,790
Gorge Master Fu, do not look down on me.

167
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,750
Cave Master, I earnestly request a personal meeting.

168
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,710
Come in!

169
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,600
 Qianyue Sect has countless Xin Fa in martial arts 

170
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,500
 but is still unable to perfect the only Su family’s swordsmanship. 

171
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,790
 Do you know why? 

172
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,150
The last move of the Su family’s swordsmanship wasn't passed down.

173
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,670
Recently, I learned this last move was drawn into a painting.

174
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,030
I fortunately obtained this painting so I respectfully offer it to you.

175
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,910
Bring it here for me to see.

176
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,840
You held Qianyue Cave Master position far too long now, didn't you?

177
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,070
It’s time for a new master.

178
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,610
You were intelligent all your life.

179
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,320
In the end, you still fell for my trick.

180
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,370
Men!

181
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,590
Kill him!

182
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,760
Master.

183
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm willing to deal with these traitors on your behalf.

184
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,060
Ye Yan, you can’t betray me.

185
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,480
We agreed that whoever kills him will become the next master.

186
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,960
It seems that you aren't injured, but just want to draw the snake out of its hole.

187
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,440
If you had the ability to kill me,

188
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,090
cultivating you would not be in vain.

189
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,890
It’s a pity you only depended on Fu Lou

190
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,010
to boost your own courage.

191
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,690
If you aren’t serving Qianyue Sect,

192
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,890
then you serve Chuanqi Sect.

193
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,420
What’s the point of you living then?

194
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,730
I was momentarily deluded, irrational, and my sin is inexcusable.

195
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,090
Please kill me.

196
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,050
You always mention “dying.”

197
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,690
Am I that scary?

198
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,840
 We only have one life, don't we? 

199
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,870
This, just let her keep both eyes, please. 

200
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
Master.

201
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,950
He Xingzhu overestimated himself and attempted to plot against Master.

202
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,910
Have you all seen their fates?

203
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,040
 We will always be loyal to Master. 

204
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,060
It looks like I’ll have to treat him more kindly in the future.

205
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,010
I’ll act according to your wishes.

206
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,770
Master.

207
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,470
Ye Xingzhu,

208
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,540
tell me, should I or shouldn't I take this?

209
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,840
Presently, you are the best poison master in this world.

210
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,130
If I had wanted to play any tricks, I would have died just now.

211
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,030
That’s a good reply. Where is Leader He?

212
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,270
He lost all his martial arts skill, and seeks death.

213
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,370
We must persuade him otherwise.

214
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,530
We must not let him die.

215
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,090
Yes.

216
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Master, this painting…

217
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,450
A low quality item is unsuitable for me.

218
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,530
As usual, send it over to Mister Shi.

219
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,520
Master, if you only want Fengming Saber Xin Fa,

220
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,510
shall I send a few more people there?

221
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,300
Just from hearing it, one can see that Xiao Yan is already beyond cure.

222
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,870
One foolish girl at Fengming Mountain Manor is enough.

223
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,830
When the time comes, just do as I say.

224
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,460
 Stealing the Xin Fa while flying the kite. 

225
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,340
 Will Xiao Bai be carrying the Xin Fa? 

226
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,990
 But how do I steal the Xin Fa? 

227
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,830
 Let me first try it on Qin Liufeng. 

228
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,380
So clumsy! Next time be faster and

229
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,210
don't have shaky hands.

230
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,030
I failed again!

231
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,490
I don't know martial arts. Of course, I'm clumsy.

232
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,610
What happened?

233
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,630
Miss Chun Hua seems especially interested in my silver.

234
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,880
Miss Chun Hua, what did you steal Qin Liufeng's money for?

235
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,940
I need to have some money to walk around with.

236
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,150
Also, Qin Liufeng is a playboy.

237
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,560
He's full of tricks. If I don't steal his,

238
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,690
should I steal yours, instead?

239
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,530
This is my first time hearing about stealing in such a dignified manner.

240
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,170
Yes!

241
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,760
Xiao Bai?

242
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,140
Please be forgiving, Brother Qin.

243
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,540
Okay.

244
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,270
Miss Chun Hua steals my things and Xiao Bai apologizes to me.

245
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,590
How interesting!

246
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,030
How is it interesting?

247
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,830
 Only this place in Fengming Mountain Manor is sealed tightly. 
 [Bright Moon and Bright Heart]

248
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,230
 The Xin Fa must be there.

249
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,700
Miss Chun Hua.

250
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,180
What's wrong?

251
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,460
I was just taking a walk but twisted my ankle.

252
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,100
[Bright Moon and Bright Heart]

253
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,830
Let's go.

254
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,470
There is nothing here.

255
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,040
Xiao Bai, what is this?

256
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,350
This is set up by my ancestor, Xiao Min.

257
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,810
It’s a long story.

258
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,130
Back then, he wiped out Xingyue Sect.

259
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,280
Countless deaths and injuries made him feel he sinned greatly.

260
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,620
Thus, he set up this memorial tablet

261
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,140
for descendants to make offerings.

262
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,320
Later, my father changed this into a study room.

263
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,920
Here incense is continuously burned.

264
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,590
Actually, upholding justice is a given.

265
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:53,220
Sacrifice is also unavoidable.

266
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,910
Yes, you're right.

267
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,010
[How can this be endured? Down in Nine Springs (after death) waking in pain.]

268
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,140
This isn't Xin—

269
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,580
Does the writer seem to be in a bad mood?

270
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,710
What is this?

271
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,190
Nothing, it's only my ancestor’s past.

272
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,140
Chun Hua.

273
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,190
What are you looking for?

274
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,860
It's a study room. I was just...

275
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,800
looking for a brush to practice.

276
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,060
What should I write?

277
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,720
You should write what you are good at writing.

278
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,030
What am I good at? Good at everything.

279
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,650
 [World] 

280
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,590
[The most beautiful man in the world.]

281
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,970
Excellent! How could I be so excellent?

282
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,440
As excellent as my husband.

283
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,540
So compatible!

284
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,890
Fine! I'll change it for you.

285
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,700
[Second]

286
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,000
Xiao Bai.

287
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,360
Will you write a word to describe me?

288
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,100
Xiao Bai, don't leave.

289
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,740
Are you unwilling?

290
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,660
He probably saw how excellent my calligraphy is,

291
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,080
and fears he can't surpass me.

292
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:02,490
Excellent! It's so excellent, Chun Hua.

293
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,700
Gosh, you wrote so wonderfully.

294
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,360
 [Written by Xiao Bai] 

295
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,890
Such a nicely put-together phrase,

296
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,250
with such a great artistic conception.

297
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,190
It’s boastful but not lacking in modesty.

298
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,480
But Xiao Bai didn't want it.

299
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,370
Older Brother, why are you here again?

300
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,860
It's a surprise here every day with Xiao Chun Hua.

301
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,990
Brother didn't want to miss it.

302
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,950
I suppose... Older Brother thinks I live among the enemy,

303
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,290
being scared and on edge daily, so you came to see me.

304
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,420
Yes, I'm worried about you.

305
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,690
Did you write this for Xiao Bai?

306
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,870
Why is it the second in the world?

307
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,840
it's because you're the first.

308
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,370
Liar!

309
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,080
I guess Xiao Bai didn't accept it so you took it back, didn't you?

310
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,720
Older Brother knows even this.

311
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,420
Don't waste time saying sweet things.

312
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,040
Be serious in your mission.

313
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,800
I didn't forget. I even looked in the study room today.

314
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,240
But there was nothing in there except for books

315
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,160
and a memorial tablet with no words.

316
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,050
Ancestral hall?

317
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,780
It looks like Xiao Bai treats you rather well.

318
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,650
What does that mean?

319
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,530
Did he tell you the story of the memorial tablet?

320
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,910
He did.

321
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,090
He said it was set up after his ancestor had eliminated the Xingyue Sect,

322
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,410
and felt he committed great sin.

323
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,330
Is Xingyue the Qianyue Sect’s predecessor?

324
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,150
That’s right.

325
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,520
Our blood feud with Fengming Mountain Manor formed hundreds of years ago.

326
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,150
Do you mean blood feud?

327
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,380
Didn't Older Brother say

328
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,430
you just wanted to learn Xin Fa so you wanted me to steal it?

329
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,970
Doesn’t Xiao Chun Hua also want to learn the Fengming Saber Technique?

330
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,080
How do you know that, too?

331
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,590
But I just want to learn it to chop firewood.

332
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:58,000
My little sister is so smart and learns how to imitate voices very quickly.

333
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,920
Fengming Saber Technique is nothing.

334
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,680
When you get the Xin Fa, Older Brother will teach you personally.

335
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,900
Hand-in-hand?

336
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,590
At that time, whatever way you want me to teach you,

337
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,500
I'll be willingly to teach you.

338
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,160
This... is not good?

339
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,700
Hand-in-hand is too intimate. After all, we are siblings.

340
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,400
It's your brother. What is there to fear?

341
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,930
Not good! This brother has an unhealthy tendency.

342
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,720
I need to stay away from him.

343
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,580
The poem meeting is just a few days away.

344
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,960
Xiao Chun Hua must obtain Xin Fa quickly.

345
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,500
I promise, I will have Xin Fa and Xiao Bai

346
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,280
all settled in one go.

347
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,480
You just need to get the Xin Fa.

348
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,930
No need to worry about Xiao Bai.

349
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,800
[Qian Hua Xuan]

350
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,450
Xiao Bai!

351
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,120
Xiao Bai, don't wear that. Wear this!

352
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,830
Get out!

353
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,870
I found someone to make this especially for you.

354
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,400
If you wear this to the poetry meeting, you'll really look good.

355
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,520
Hurry and leave!

356
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,860
 I searched everywhere in Fengming Mountain Manor. 

357
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,930
 It looks like the Xin Fa has to be on Xiao Bai's body.

358
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,830
Miss Chun Hua, what are you doing?

359
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,230
Either you don't wear anything or you wear what I got you.

360
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,040
Stop!

361
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,250
Put it down!

362
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,900
I said so!

363
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,460
What are you standing there for?

364
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,660
I wait for you to come out to try on the clothes. Hurry!

365
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,970
Miss Chun Hua, come here.

366
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,400
What are you doing?

367
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,830
No, Xiao Bai.

368
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,930
Okay, Xiao Bai. Just wear it once, Xiao Bai.

369
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,930
Xiao Bai.

370
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,270
 [Plum and Willow Inn] 

371
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,880
Ye Xingzhu, how could you be this careless handling matters?

372
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,200
I didn't do my duties well to make proper arrangements for the inn.

373
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,760
It's the first time my younger sister leaves Fengming Mountain Manor.

374
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,560
You must be cautious and ensure her safety.

375
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,630
Even the waiters and staff must be extremely obedient.

376
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,100
I have already changed all the inn staff,

377
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,500
and I left a rather smart underling to be on staff.

378
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,460
The extra people were already brought back.

379
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,160
I chose a few underlings who know no martial arts as waiters,

380
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,010
- lest our plan be found out. 
 - What about the innkeeper?

381
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,530
I'm still waiting for your instructions.

382
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,510
Keep him! It would attract too much attention if we suddenly change the innkeeper.

383
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,000
- Get up. 
 - Yes.

384
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,670
You actually didn't have to come.

385
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,480
This plan to make a person suffer from his own scheme can be left to me.

386
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,900
What?

387
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,690
Can’t I even join in the fun?

388
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,360
Do you worry about me?

389
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,750
You are extremely skilled in martial arts. Mine is far beneath yours.

390
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,320
Staying in Thousand Moon Cave every day,

391
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,620
how would one knows the developments or disputes in the pugilist world?

392
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,930
Anyway, if I only knew earlier.

393
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,590
Ye Yan,

394
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,850
you should also go out more and see the world.

395
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,240
People say that a group of horrible-looking people control Qianyue Sect.

396
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,230
We should find an opportunity to clear this stigma.

397
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,970
All right.

 ''The Unfinished Moment'' by Singer: Li Hongyi 

400
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,860
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

401
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,740
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

402
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,110
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking its eye  ♫

403
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:48,320
♫  Seeing through love's fickleness  ♫

404
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,500
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

405
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,640
♫  It's such a pity for not stepping forward  ♫

406
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,830
♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

407
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:07,430
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

408
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,850
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

409
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:17,370
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

410
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:20,240
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

411
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,570
♫  It's hard to walk on. There's even no one to argue with  ♫

412

♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

413

♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

414
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:38,040
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

415
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:45,030
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
