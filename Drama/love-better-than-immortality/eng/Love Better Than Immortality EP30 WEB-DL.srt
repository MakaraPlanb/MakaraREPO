Are you saying that Chief Feng

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,870
is the one who killed the healer?

At the time, I was even thinking

171
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,320
how she could escape death.

172
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,620
I never thought that when she awoke, she became Xiao Chun Hua.

173
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,870
Were you there that day?

174
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,400
I watched over you until you finally came about.

175
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,450
One look at you and I instantly knew you were a different person.

176
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,260
Your expression at that time was extremely innocent.

177
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,140
We're only reminiscing about our chance encounter, what are you thinking about?

178
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,550
Were you wearing this hairpin that day?

179
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,980
That is correct!

180
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,480
I can see that this hairpin seems to have fate with Xiao Chun Hua.

181
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,500
So...

182
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,180
it was you.

183
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,040
It was me.

184
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,420
What is wrong with Little Sister?

185
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,660
The very first person I saw...

186
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,090
was you?

187
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,470

188

Yes.

Did you know?

236
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,750
When I was at Baxian Residence, I had a dream.

237
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,090
In the dream, the person said

238
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,590
that the first person I saw when I opened my eyes

239
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,360
is my one true love.

240
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,350
I always thought, that person was Xiao Bai.

241
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,170
He was not wrong.

242
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,100
It's just that Xiao Chun Hua mistook me for someone else.

243
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,780
Thank goodness all is not lost.

244
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,410
Will you really treat me well?

245
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,270
Of course!

246
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,940
I will be good to you forever.

Countless deaths and injuries,

and Li Yu is only a normal disciple from Baxian Residence.

250
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,140
If he was allowed to participate earlier in the planning of the conspiracy,

251
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,310
he would be lured out by others or perhaps be killed quickly in order to prevent secrets from being disclosed.

252
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,070
However, Li Yu is still living well.

253
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,550
There is nothing suspicious.

254
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,420
So I believe his words.

255
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,410
When I think about it, the assassin that night

256
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,200
is not like Li Yu.

257
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,550
Speaking of that, after Miss Feng and you were at Baxian Residence,

258
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,790
were you also attacked?

259
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,450
Yes.

260
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,830
Yesterday, we went to Baxian Residence.

261
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,990
At that time, my thoughts were numerous and confused.

262
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,210
Upon return, I actually forgot about this incident.

263
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,680
No problem! Young Chief Master, I think you have been too tired these days.

264
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,630
But even until now,

265
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,080
someone still hinders our investigation of the Healer's death.

266
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,070
This means that the possibility of Chief Feng being the killer

267
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,130
is not high.

268
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,230
After all, Chief Feng is already...

269
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,830
If we can really find the mastermind behind these assassins,

270
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,110
that would count as a way to prove my father's innocence.

271
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,470
Since the owner of the silver needles on the puppets is the Healer,

272
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,550
after his death his medical skills were inherited by the Baxians.

273
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,440
We shouldn't just focus on the Healer's disciple, Li Yu.

274
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,860
We should thoroughly search the Baxian Residence.

275
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,520
That's right! Why didn't I think of that?

276
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,240

 - Exactly!

Is that the end of it then?

342
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,590
Isn't that Baxian Residence's...

343
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,590

[Baxian Residence]

345
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,980
Everyone, let me introduce someone.

346
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,500
Baxian Residence's disciple, Li Yu.

347
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,780
Are you the Healer's disciple?

348
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,790
Why are you at Baxian Residence to serve us tea?

349
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,930
You do not know.

350
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,100
Although Master Bo'er and old Master Bu'er were biological brothers,

351
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,110
their personalities were as different as sky and earth.

352
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,950
Healer was benevolent and magnanimous.

353
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,320
But, in fact, Master Bu'er is a complete penny-pincher.

354
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,280
It's nothing! I was just carelessly venting.

355
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,430
Everyone, I should go back; otherwise, Master Bu'er will probably censure me.

356
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,420
- Take care. 
 - Take care.

357
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,650
Let's just go with the original plan.

358
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,260
Miss Leng and I will continue to search for clues of the puppets.

359
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,690
Young Chief Master and Miss Feng, you should stay around Baxian Residence,

360
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,040
to observe Master Bu'er some more.

[Loyal Heart on Medical Skills]

362
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,980
Why has the ice silk pearl's glow become weaker?

363
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,580
I have not taken it under the moonlight for a long time.

364
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,480
That's also good.

365
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,320
Good?

366
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,560
If Xiao Chun Hua is too good to the ice silk pearl,

367
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,950
I will be jealous.

368
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,480
How can you be jealous of a pearl?

369
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,330
Xiao Chun Hua, open your hand.

370
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,450
No matter what you say or do,

371
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,260
I will treat you well forever.

372
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,380
How will you prove that to me?

373
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,310
Look me in the eyes!

374
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,250
 This is the man I 

375
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,890
 first laid eyes on ever. 

376
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,170
My true love!

377
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,790
However, the system never said

378
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,260
 that my true love and I 

379
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,860
 would have a happy ending. 

380
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,010
What's wrong?

381
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,630
I am a little worried.

382
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,490
Worried about what?

383
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,770
Nothing much!

384
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,050
Let's play a game called Truth or Dare.

385
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,530
Truth or dare?
