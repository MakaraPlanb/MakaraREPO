[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,980
Could it be that I am really Hua Xiaolei?

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,760
Tomorrow, go with me to visit your father.

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,850
From now on, I'm Hua Que.

34
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,970
When will you stop acting this scene?

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,470
Now that you've reunited, naturally it would be more appropriate for you to stay at your home.

36
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,300
 Not to mention the birthmark but every part of your body, I know it all.

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,400
I don't care if you believe me or not, but I'm not Hua Xiaolei.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,080
When will Chun Hua and Qiu Yue come to an end? The feeling is quite good.

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,960
You can still continue to be my brother, Qiu Yue.

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,400
The one who had a love affair with Shangguan Qiu Yue is Hua Xiaolei.

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
It's really not me.

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,510
Little Chun Hua.

45
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,330
Are you sleeping?

46
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,750
I'm sleeping. I'm already sleeping. You can't come in.

47
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,540
It's not good for us to stay in the same room.

48
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,250
I urge you! You should give up on this idea. All right?

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,700
Did you hear me?

Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

51
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,580
I know! I know you definitely came in.

52
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,520
Don't scare me all the time like this!

53
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,960
I'm telling you, I'm so good at kicking people's butts.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,270
So good! See! Don't come over here.

55
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,470
I still remember what you promised me today.

56
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,090
What on earth do you want?

57
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,140
"As long as you don't tell Xiao Bai,"

58
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,660
"I can do whatever you want."

59
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,650
Young Master.

60
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,040
I just passed by a small stall on the road,

61
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,670
and I learned some tricks and methods to read someone's fortune from their face.

62
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,090
Watch closely!

63
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,690
I see this Young Master's space

64
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,860
between your eyebrows with happy eyes is glossy and smooth.

65
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,000
Today's matters must be good.

66
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,520
The Hua family has finally reunited.

67
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,450
I also have a clear conscience about my father's last words.

68
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,290
In addition, I've sorted things with Uncle Hua.

69
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,600
After Uncle Hua saw Miss Xiaolei, what reaction did he have?

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,000
He was happy, of course! Brother Hua even rushed a special trip to return.

71
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,460
As long as you don't tell Xiao Bai,

72
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,460
I can do whatever you want.

73
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,190
So, is this what you want me to do?

74
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,980
The one whose ice silk pearl stops glowing first,

75
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,130
has to agree to a condition of the other person.

76
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,480
You're so childish.

77
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,550
Ice silk, Baby, fighting!

78
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,670
Little Chun Hua, wait for your punishment.

79
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,560
Idiot!

80
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,360
You cheated.

81
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,100
You didn't say I couldn't cheat.

82
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,000
In this game, you weren't supposed to lose.

83
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,570
- Why not? 
 - Have you forgotten what I told you?

84
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,430
These two pearls interact with and care for each other.

85
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,530
If one of them dies, it will be difficult for the other to survive.

86
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,190
- So? 
 - As long as mine still glows,

87
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,920
yours won't stop.

88
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,590
However, after hearing what you said, I think

89
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,520
this Brother Hua is a bit suspicious.

90
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,910
- What do you mean? 
 - It's normal to express family affection after a long separation.

91
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,440
But at least, they should have some scruples about etiquette.

92
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,980
Brother Hua can't make Miss Hua Xiaolei lose face in front of guests.

93
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,800
Maybe Uncle Hua was a little too excited, so Brother Hua just spoke up for him.

94
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,760
You think too much.

95
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,370
Why were you making that sound?

96
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,920
Can't I say it? I can't express any opinion about Miss Xiaolei.

97
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,910
Anyway, how is Miss Xiaolei's memory loss?

98
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,090
Is there any progress?

99
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,660
There was nothing strange about the reunion of Uncle Hua and Xiaolei.

100
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,810
I think... we must think of another way.

101
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,860
Miss Chun Hua.

102
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,430
Xiao Bai.

103
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,460
Why don't you return to Fengming Mountain Manor with me?

104
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,060
Not good!

105
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,810
Why not good?

106
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,360
Unless...

107
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,990
Unless you marry me.

108
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,620
Doesn't Little Chun Hua need your brother?

109
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,490
Oh! Brother!

110
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,070
What's wrong?

111
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,560
Everything I said just now was

112
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,890
only talking in my sleep.

113
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,500
So in Little Chun Hua's heart, I'm such a mean person then?

114
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,770
How could that be? Of course, not!

115
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,680
How could that be possible? That's impossible.

116
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,870
If you're mean or not, in your heart, don't you know the answer?

117
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,410
Good to know! Then quickly change your clothes and go with me to see father.

118
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,340
Come with me to pay our respects to father.

119
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,460
You are still so immersed in your act, aren't you?

120
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,030
I need to change my clothes so do you think you should...

121
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,550
Go ahead and change! I'm your brother so what are you afraid of?

122
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,720
My own brother also can't...

123
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,820
Why don't... you turn around?

124
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,430
All right.

125
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,700
If you don't hurry more, Xiao Bai will leave soon.

126
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,050
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

127
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,490
What did you say? Is Xiao Bai here?

128
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,690
Really? Where is he?

129
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,590
Xiao Bai! Xiao Bai, you've come.

130
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,470
Father, I'd like to pay my respects to you.

131
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,800
Greetings, Hero Xiao.

132
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,300
Brother Hua, thanks for your hospitality to allow my early morning visit.

133
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,260
Please forgive me.

134
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,250
Hero Xiao, there's no need for formalities.

135
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,740
Hero Xiao, if you have something to say, please don't hesitate.

136
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,500
Please sit!

137
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,890
My father is ill so I can't stay for too long.

138
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,100
Since the matter regarding Xiaolei has been resolved,

139
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,790
I plan to set out and return home immediately.

140
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,400
Such being the case, I also won't demand that you stay longer.

141
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,820
Remember to go back and greet your dad on our behalf.

142
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,220
Finally, I can get rid of this ill-fated relationship and return to the main story.

143
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,350
Goodbye, Shangguan Qiu Yue!

144
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,050
Wait!

145
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,540
About the marriage contract...

146
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,160
I was just about to mention the marriage contract.

147
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,290
Our Xiao family will keep our words.

148
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,960
We've found Xiaolei so we can fulfill the marriage contract.

149
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,550
I will once more select an auspicious day for Xiaolei and I to get married.

150
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,810
Yes! Yes! That's how it should proceed.

151
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,460
Hero Xiao, you truly don't bear in mind the Hua family.

152
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,280
Brother Hua, why would you say such a thing?

153
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,450
Though the Hua family can't equal the Fengming Mountain Manor,

154
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,710
our family is still considered one of the very best influential families.

155
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,110
How can you casually remark and muddle through our previous agreement?

156
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,150
I was being thoughtless.

157
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,940
Brother Hua, if you worry the Xiao family will treat Xiaolei unfairly,

158
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,190
I will dispatch someone first to bring betrothal gifts.

159
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,780
There will be many more gifts than before.

160
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,260
Master Hua, what do you think?

161
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,520
Regardless how many betrothal gifts you send, I have only one little sister.

162
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,210
Then, Brother Hua, what do you mean exactly?

163
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,450
Call off the marriage.

164
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,630
-  What? 
 - What!

165
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,410
Xiaolei, don't get agitated.

166
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,120
I also agree with this statement.

167
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,970
If I was careless in any point, please instruct and tell me my mistakes.

168
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,910
It's only that, if you want to suddenly cancel

169
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,610
without reason, it cannot be justified.

170
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,310
All right! Since Hero Xiao has mentioned the reason,

171
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,770
then I'll take the time and explain to you.

172
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,490
Regarding reason,

173
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,630
the Hua family sent our most treasured jewel to the Fengming Mountain Manor,

174
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,280
but she fled for her life almost dying in a large fire.

175
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,120
Although she returned with her life and survived,

176
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,180
she has changed, been in a daze, and been acting foolish.

177
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,000
She can't remember even the slightest bit of the past.

178
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,160
There is no shirking this responsibility.

179
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,140
I truly apologize to Xiaolei.

180
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,480
Don't apologize so quickly.

181
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,260
Let me ask you! Fengming Mountain Manor is known as martial arts of Bei Dou,

182
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,730
but you cannot protect even a young girl.

183
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,130
If she was your younger sister,

184
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,580
would you entrust her to someone like you?

185
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,290
This... this...

186
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,560
We still don't clearly know about this matter but you simply place all the responsibilities on Xiao Bai's shoulders.

187
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,540
Regarding affection,

188
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,660
Sister is still young.

189
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,770
I would hate to see her married off having a rough time.

190
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,600
She should wait a few more years to keep me company at home.

191
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,970
Father! Father, please reconsider.

192
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:34,050
Then I'll hand responsibility for this matter over to father and brother.

193
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,330
This is a matter of great importance.

194
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,910
Since Uncle Hua and Brother Hua already have other plans,

195
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,490
I need to report to my father, then I will give you an answer.

196
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,080
I'll take my leave.

197
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,780
No, Xiao Bai! Xiao Bai!

198
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,660
Xiao Bai...

199
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,800
I give this back to you!

200
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,100
Sister, why are you so angry?

201
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,420
You still have the nerve to ask me that?

202
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,540
There are so many people in this world.

203
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,980
Why do you insist on making things difficult for me alone?

204
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,250
It was you, Little Chun Hua, who personally told me

205
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,080
I can do whatever I want.

206
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,980
Yes.

207
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,840
But I already played with these ice silk pearls with you.

208
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,250
Little Chun Hua acted shamelessly and cheated, so that doesn't count.

209
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,860
Then tell me, what on earth do you want to get me out of this?

210
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,250
Sister, you are very silly.

211
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,720
I think Xiao Bai doesn't have sincere feelings for you.

212
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,210
Xiao Bai already said he wants to marry me.

213
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:54,360
- If you didn't put obstacles in his way, I could already be... 
 - Mistress Xiao, right?

214
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,700
Xiao Bai and I,

215
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,990
we originally had an engagement agreement, hadn't we?

216
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,710
We have an affinity for each other.

217
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,120
We were innocent playmates and childhood sweethearts.

218
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,980
If it weren't for you causing every kind of trouble,

219
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,210
how else could I be subject to so much suffering?

220
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,330
But now, as luck would have it,

221
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,680
Xiao Bai has left.

222
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,060
My engagement is gone.

223
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,330
You should compensate me!

224
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,800
You are still terrible to me.

225
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,450
You say that you're my brother,

226
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,760
then you should act like a brother.

227
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,710
- Why do you... 
 - Sister, enough!

228
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,410
Don't cry!

229
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,320
You are so ugly when you cry.

230
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,580
Even more so, you are saying I'm ugly!

231
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,280
You said I'm ugly!

232
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,740
Forget it! You can leave.

233
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,300
You're lying to me again.

234
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,980
You're keeping an eye on me here so how can I leave?

235
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,220
You have your own legs.

236
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,930
You are free to go anywhere.

237
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,860
I know! If I leave,

238
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,430
- then you'll just... 
 - Where's the fun in killing you?

239
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,510
Then you...

240
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,250
won't tell Xiao Bai

241
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,450
about that matter, right?

242
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,700
That is exactly to say,

243
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,960
this matter is something that only Hua Xiaolei did.

244
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,520
I don't have anything to do with that so why should I clean up her awful mess?

245
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,460
Has it nothing to do with you?

246
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,940
At any rate, I have lost my memory, haven't I?

247
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,760
This argument is so peculiar.

248
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,900
I don't know whether Xiao Bai will think the same way or not.

249
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,190
Then... I am really going.

250
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,850
You will be back.

251
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,270
You big obstacle, where does your confidence come from?

252
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,140
Brother are right! Everything Brother says is right.

253
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,240
This is my home, isn't it?

254
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,710
You should wait for me here. I'll certainly come back to see Older Brother.

255
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,650
[Hua Residence]

256
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,900
Little Chun Hua already left.

257
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,930
What method should I use to make her come back obediently of her own accord?

258
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,350
I have an idea you can try.

259
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,630
Say it.

260
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:21,570
If Xiao Bai comes back, then so will Miss Chun Hua.

261
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,190
Interesting, keep talking!

262
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,060
Everyone knows the thing Young Master Xiao cares about the most

263
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,130
is the longevity fruit.

264
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,500
Now that you mention it, I didn't hear any news of the longevity fruit in a while.

265
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,400
I understand. I will get to work.

266
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,590
Longevity fruit?

267
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,410
Sisi, recently, it's rumored that

268
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,480
the longevity fruit flows out of the healer's hands,

269
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,710
and it can bring the dead back to life.

270
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,690
Where on earth could there be such a wonderful thing?

271
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:09,160
Husband, I don't believe in it.

272
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,420
As long as I'm able to cure your illness,

273
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,630
even if there's just a sliver of hope,

274
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,560
I still believe in it.

275
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,410
What is this?

276
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,680
Take a look, Wife.

277
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,180
[A prize for guessing correctly]

278
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,610
It's a lantern riddle.

279
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,180
The red string is a lantern riddle. The string!

280
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,610
It is related to me.

281
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,010
Let me think about it.

282
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,020
A colored string...

283
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,760
means the character for "cut off."

284
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,780
Cut...

285
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,500
A dead end?

286
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,240
A hopeless situation?

287
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,520
My husband,

288
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,960
why does it sound a bit unlucky?

289
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,200
Sisi, you always love to think too much.

290
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,130
It's actually a compliment.

291
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,090
It means "a remarkably beautiful woman."

292
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,440
Master, I have news about Mr. Shi.

293
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,110
Brother Xiao, have you really decided to return like this?

294
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,540
The Hua family unexpectedly called off the engagement.

295
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,100
I did not foresee this.

296
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,350
I plan to make a decision after discussing it with my father.

297
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,220
- Too bad! Marriage arrangement has separated so many lovers. 
 - I heard the longevity fruit surfaced again.

298
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,710
Quick, go and take a look.

299
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,740
The longevity fruit?

300
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,530
Chief.

301
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,040
Chief Leng.

302
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,290
Chief Leng is on our side, so there's no need to be secretive.

303
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,800
According to my scouts, clues to the longevity fruit have resurfaced.

304
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,890
Where is it?

305
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,060
Yetan City, with the Hua family.

306
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,140
[Official Notice: Longevity fruit calmly waits for the man who is destined. If interested, see the Hua family.]

307
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,630
- The Hua family? 
 - Who is the destined man?

308
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,610
Yes! "The destined man..." What's going on?

309
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,420
To the Hua! Excuse me.

310
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,790
I wondered why Xiao Bai suddenly planned to go to Yetan City to see the festival lanterns.

311
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,970
Now I see that he made these plans ahead of time.

312
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,130
He wants to grab the longevity fruit first before others.

313
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,120
Since you trust me,

314
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,370
then I will act according to your plan.

315
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,480
The guest you're talking about has already left.

316
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,590
Left? When did he leave?

317
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,990
He's been gone for a while now.

318
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,430
I don't know any martial arts.

319
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,980
If I want to chase after Xiao Bai,

320
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,970
I'll never catch up with him.

321
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,850
Don't worry! It'll be done soon.

322
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,440
Now, be careful!

323
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,810
- Eat while it's hot. 
 - Buns! Hot steamed buns!

324
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,310
Sir, I'll have two orders of steamed buns.

325
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,370
Miss Caicai?

326
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,210
Miss Chun Hua?

327
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,360
Miss Chun Hua, what are you doing here?

328
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,660
I still want to elope with you.

329
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,400
Steamed meat buns!

330
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,040
Why did you all leave so quickly?

331
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,930
Just now when I returned to the inn, the young innkeeper said you all left.

332
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,970
But why have you returned?

333
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,120
There's an important matter so I must return to the Hua family.

334
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,220
I... I finally got away from the Hua family after so much trouble. What?

335
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,220
And now are you saying you want to return?

336
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,110
Xiao Bai, let me tell you this,

337
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,510
our marriage doesn't need my brother's and father's approvals. Truly!

338
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,260
- If we return to Fengming Mountain Manor, we can... 
 - It's not about that.

339
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,370
Listen! You truly don't need to be afraid of my brother or father.

340
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,040
- I'm being serious. You just need to... 
 - Miss Chun Hua.

341
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,210
Right now, the longevity fruit appeared at the Hua residence.

342
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,670
The chief of the martial arts circles has been waiting for it to save his life.

343
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,130
Therefore, this matter is of the greatest urgency.

344
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,960
So he's not returning for my sake.

345
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,370
This time, I think only we three should go.

346
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,060
Miss Feng and Miss Leng, just return to the inn and wait for my news.

347
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,460
[Hua Residence]

348
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,790
My Sister! My Sweet Sister, where have you been?

349
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,070
Father and I were so worried about you.

350
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,740
It's fine! What matters is you've returned home. Let's go!

351
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,640
Brother Hua.

352
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,850
When did you two get here?

353
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,640
Thank you, Hero Xiao, for personally escorting Xiaolei home.

354
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,240
But there's nothing for you here, you should leave now.

355
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,400
Wait a moment, Brother Hua!

356
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,280
Haven't we said that Xiaolei is not marrying you?

357
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,410
Hero Xiao, how can you have no sense of shame?

358
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,900
Brother Hua, you're crossing the line.

359
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,810
Regardless if Xiaolei marries him or not, the Xiao and Hua families all are old friends.

360
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,000
- Brother Hua, you should not lose your sense of propriety. 
 - And who might you be?

361
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,900
So what if I lost my sense of propriety?

362
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,290
Brother Hua, please listen to my brief remarks.

363
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,390
The reason I'm here is absolutely not due to the engagement matter, but for a much more critical issue.

364
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,410
May I have a word with you in private?

365
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,840
Why can't you say it here?

366
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,860
I'm afraid that this place is not quite suitable.

367
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,340
Hero Xiao, if you're unable to speak clearly,

368
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,180
then forgive me for being unable to accompany you.

369
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,380
- Butler! Send them away. 
 - Brother Hua, to be honest,

370
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,840
I want to ask you about the matter of the longevity fruit.

371
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,120
Well, regarding that, it's really not appropriate to speak here.

372
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,120
Please come in!

373
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,850
Thank you.

374
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,220
I said you will hate to part with me but I didn't expect you to return so quickly.

375
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,720
When Xiao Bai finishes tending to his affairs, he'll take me away with him. You'll see!

376
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,160
I hope so.

377
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,620
You all may take your time but I'm taking my leave now.

378
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,810
Hero Xiao, could it be that you'd like to question us separately?

379
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,330
Brother Hua, why would you say such a thing?

380
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,000
The one whom my sister fell in love with is indeed smart.

381
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,130
If I'm guessing correctly, just now, that young master

382
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,280
is going to looking for my father.

383
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,440
Am I right?

384
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,430
Xiao Bai is definitely not the complicated man that you say he is.

385
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,040
Brother Hua, since you get straight to the point,

386
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,190
there's no need for me to hold back.

387
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,890
Brother Hua, I hope you can understand how I need the longevity fruit to save my father.

388
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,220
Of course, I understand your difficulties, Hero Xiao.

389
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,900
Otherwise, I wouldn't have let you all in.

390
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,780
Come to speak of it,

391
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,180
does Brother Hua know the location of the longevity fruit?

392
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,270
This...

393
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,910
Sister,

394
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,690
do you think we should tell Hero Xiao

395
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,930
our Hua family secret?

396
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,680
Does our family have a secret?

397
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,970
You're joking around again! Have you forgotten what happened yesterday?

398
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:51,440
Y-Yesterday?

399
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,280
Yesterday... y-yesterday?

400
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,260
Xiao Bai, what is he talking about? I truly have no idea.

401
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,240
Since you don't want to talk about it,

402
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,840
then I must become an unfilial son.

403
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,910
To tell you the truth, the longevity fruit is at our manor,

404
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,840
but as to where it is exactly, I'm also not sure.

405
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,830
I only remember very late last night,

406
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,160
my father told me to prepare paper and ink.

407
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,250
He said he wanted to write an official notice.

408
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,320
So Master Hua wrote the notice?

409
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,360
I never wrote any kind of notice.

410
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,800
Moreover, I don't even know what the longevity fruit is.

411
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,520
Someone must be purposely framing me.

412
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,860
Uncle Hua, if you don't feel at ease,

413
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,830
I can give you my guarantee.

414
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,060
If you have any terms or conditions, please do not hesitate to tell me.

415
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,330
This is truly preposterous!

416
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,130
I have urged my father before,

417
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,570
since the longevity fruit is in our hands,

418
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,610
why don't we just give it to Sect Master Xiao?

419
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,400
It would be a great contribution to the martial arts circles.

420
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,520
Moreover, our families are longtime friends.

421
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,230
However, he didn't think so.

422
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,120
Contrary to expectations, Father simply did not understand this logic.

423
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,840
He still insisted on announcing this to the whole world.

424
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,300
He said he wants to sell it for a good price.

425
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,470
Oh, that's right! Hero Xiao, speaking of my sister's wedding,

426
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,550
Actually, I've been in awe and admiring you this entire time.

427
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,490
It's just that my father fears affection will grow in Sister's heart,

428
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,720
and she will steal the fruit for the Xiao family in partiality.

429
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,440
Therefore, we decided to break off the engagement.

430
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,030
No, no, no! Not that.

431
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,460
I truly did not know anything about this matter. Truly!

432
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,200
Brother Hua, you must tell me all you know for me to come to my own conclusion.
