Go to the flower field to look for Fu Lou’s wife and she will save you.

It seems that the identity of Miss Chun Hua is really bothering you.

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,720
However, what bothers you most is the truth about Miss Chun Hua's identity

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,610
or the marriage contract with the Hua family?

46
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,540
Brother Qin, I racked my brain but I still can't figure it out clearly.

47
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,240
Are you even making fun of me?

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,680
I, exactly, am your brain.

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,130
And the brain knows how it works.

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,410
Why are you unhappy?

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,120
I recently heard many rumors about Miss Chun Hua.

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,320
I still can't know what is true and what is false.

53
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,870
But right now, I have an idea.

54
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,050
Brother Xiao will go to the Hua family to find out the truth.

55
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,440
You're insightful!

56
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,970
However, I fear beating the grass will startle the snake (act rashly and alert the enemy).

57
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,810
This is simple.

58
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,270
What day is it half a month later?

59
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,120
August 15th.

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,920
The lantern festival of Yetan City is so well known.

61
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,220
At Mid-Autumn Festival, people enjoy the moon with beautiful women. Wouldn't it be lovely?

62
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,670
If you have time, I will accompany you

63
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,190
to check out the Hua family near Yetan City.

64
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,540
Miss Chun Hua must go with us.

65
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,840
What do you think about the others?

66
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,680
Miss Feng will go, too.

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,450
After all, she is the one who points out Miss Chun Hua.

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,340
Is that so?

69
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Too many people behave badly.

70
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,880
Although it's just putting on a show, we should still do a good job.

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,090
I'm the dignified young master of Dongshan Sect.

72

[Yingzhen Inn]

74
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,290
I'll be objective. I am really sorry.

75
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,670
During Mid-Autumn Festival, many people come to enjoy the flowers and lanterns in Yetan City.

76
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,640
Currently, there are only two rooms left.

77
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,150
Please take it...

78
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,160
So... This is too unfortunate.

79
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,030
How do you think we should divide the two rooms?

80
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,950
How can this be divided? Of course, you men share a room and we girls share the other.

81
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,730
- No! 
 - No!

82
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,360
Really, no more rooms? I can give you...

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,800
No, I can't. He can pay double the price.

84
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,700
I'm so sorry. I'm afraid you have to bear with it.

85
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,810
In fact, some people will leave later.

86
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,940
Until then, I will save it for you.

87
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,380
Since that is the case, then let's arrange it like this.

88
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,400
During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the moon will be beautiful before the flowers.

89
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,790
But right now, we have things to do.

90
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,450
Thank you, Brother Qin, for your care.

91
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,920
After the truth emerges, you'll find your fiancée.

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,680
Then you will live a happy life.

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,050
I will be suffering as my lonely self.

94
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,830
Brotherhood is for life.

95
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,090
With your words, I think you deserve my help.

96
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,680
However, I still don't understand one thing.

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,300
Since you are so impatient to know the truth,

98
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,770
why don't you go with Miss Chun Hua?

99
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,540
Before, Hua family's attitude was strange, and Miss Chun Hua is so suspicious.

100
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,980
I want to find more clues before they meet each other.

101
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,090
Then... when will you stop keeping the secret from them?

102
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,770
After I'm sure Chun Hua will be safe

103
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,300
when I announce her identity.

104
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,030
You are so thoughtful.

105
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,460
When Miss Chun Hua knows your good intentions for her,

106
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,910
she will surely feel so grateful.

107
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,960
I really envy them for being lighthearted.

108
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,760
Now, they must have been enjoying the flowers together.

[The Flower in the Mirror, the Moon on the Water] 

110
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,620
Why does Miss Leng look at me like this?

111
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,760
Could it be that she also suspects my identity?

112
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,920
Darn my older brother! That's how Feng Caicai heard the imitation voice.

113
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,230
That is... You must be hungry, right? I’ll go to buy some mooncakes.

114
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,310
Great! I'll go to see if there's a room available.

115
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,550
Big Sister, I can't find my older brother. Can you help me find him?

116
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,420
Where did you and your brother go?

117
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,980
And what color clothes is he wearing?

118
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,110
Older Brother is wearing white clothes.

119
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,810
He took my bamboo dragonfly (pinwheel) and ran.

120
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,910
Why is your brother doing this?

121
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,600
Never mind! Big Sister will help you get back the bamboo dragonfly, okay?

122
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,930
- Yes. 
 - Let's go!

123
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,260
Big Sister, that is my older brother,

124
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,630
and my dragonfly. It's indeed him!

125

You—

126
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,350
Give it back! It's my bamboo dragonfly.

127
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,760
It's yours if you can get it.

128
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,290
I heard someone was looking for her older brother.

129
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,210
Even a little girl would believe you.

130
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,710
I even thought you had me as your only younger sister.

131
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,270
Little Chun Hua, are you jealous?

132
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,230
Of course, I have only you as my younger sister.

133
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,270
Just that... do you know who's that girl from before?

134
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,820
Back then, you killed her parents.

135
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,790
I saw that she was pitiful so I took her in.

136
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,450
As an older brother, I did so much for my younger sister, but you don't remember anything.

137
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,260
I've actually done such a heartless thing before?

138
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,160
Father, Mother, that’s the weird older brother who stole my bamboo dragonfly.

139
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,810
All right, all right.

140
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,030
Your father will get you another one. Let's go!

141
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,830
Shangguan Qiu Yue, can you stop playing jokes on me?

142
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,240
Are they Kongming lanterns?

143
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,790
I gave up immortality to find my love!

144
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,160
I hope I can have a good ending with my Mr. Right.

145
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,610
Also, I hope that all this trouble can disappear soon.

146
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,770
Younger Sister, what are you doing?

147
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,590
Making a wish!

148
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,470
What's "making a wish?"

149
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,760
Making a wish is like... asking for your family to have good health,

150
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,690
and the world to be at peace.

151
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,860
Then as your wish flies to the sky with the Kongming lantern, it will be fulfilled.

152
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,350
These people actually look for their happiness through these rotten lanterns.

153
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,650
And they even hope it will come true. How absurd!

154
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,630
Little Chun Hua, why do you also perform these foolish things?

155
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,850
Just tell me what wishes you have, I will surely make them come true for you.

156
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,200
If I tell you, am I just courting my own death?

157
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,730
A wish can't be said aloud. Once I tell, it won't come true.

158
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,480
Boring!

159

Oh, mooncakes?

00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,650
- Mooncakes. 
 - Each year at Mid-Autumn, families share mooncakes together.

161
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,510
They admire the moon together. It means the family will remain together in harmony.

162
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,350
Older Brother, did you ever have mooncakes before?

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,880
Of course, I've eaten it before.

164
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,480
Then what flavor do you like?

165
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,950
Brother must not have eaten flower-flavored mooncakes.

This really is an influential family, living here so isolated. 
 [Hua Residence]

169
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,270
Xiao'er, you must remember that without Uncle Hua,

170
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,420
there wouldn't be a Fengming Mountain Manor today.< 
 [Wind Listening Pavilion] 

171
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,350
Now, Uncle Hua’s family moved to Yetan City. 
 [Wind Listening Pavilion] 

172
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,380
Hence, your Uncle Hua and I

173
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,940
decided on a marriage between you and Hua Xiaolei.

174
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,740
Brother Xiao!

175
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,820
Brother Xiao.

176
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,090
Xiao Bai.

177
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,010
Are you recalling the old times, aren't you?

178
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,890
Now, we have only one wall separating us from the truth.

179
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,360
I suddenly feel so confused now.

180
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,360
Don't worry! You're such an affectionate, loyal person,

181
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,750
the heavens will certainly send help to you.

182
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,300
Don't be nervous! Let's go.

183
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:43,260
 [Hua Residence] 

184
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,090
- Greetings, Young Lords. 
 - Visiting in the middle of the night is disrespectful on our part.

185
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,970
Please tell your master that Fengming Mountain Manor's young master, Xiao Bai,

186
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,090
has an important matter to discuss.

187
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,140
Little Chun Hua, you're so clumsy.

188
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,550
Can you make mooncakes properly?

189
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,870
Older Brother, if you don't want to help then forget it, but stop saying nonsense here.

190
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,150
Then you tell me, how should I help you?

191
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,840
I want to make this flour into dough.

192
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,940
That's amazing!

193
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,740
I'm doomed. I'm doomed!

194
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,040
Master...

195
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,630
- Look! 
 - Look at what?

196
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,940
There's something moving inside.

197
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,320
- Look carefully! 
 - Where is it?

198
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,830
- Lower! 
 - I don't see anything!

Fengming Mountain Manor, Xiao Bai.

Dongshan Sect, Qin Liufeng.

- Greetings, Master Hua. 
 -  Greetings, Master Hua.

218
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,110
Your junior has not visited you in a long time.

219
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,600
May I ask if everything is fine with you?

220
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,720
Just a few months ago,

221
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,520
I could have called you “Son-in-law.”

222
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,510
But now, you've become my nephew.

223
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,310
How is Xiao Mengzhu's health?

224
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,850
Thanks to Uncle, he is so-so.

225
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,460
After he was poisoned by the Demon Sect many years ago,

226
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,910
we still couldn't find the antidote for him.

227
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,000
Demon Sect again!

228
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,990
They are really powerful.

229
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,750
I'm here unexpected,

230
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,810
because I have something urgent to report to you.

231
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,810
What is it?

232
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,710
Older Brother, didn't I already tell you?

233
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,600
Mooncakes must be shared with family.

234
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,240
It only tastes good when you share it.

235
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,390
Ye Yan, come here!

236
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,330
Master.

237
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,140
- Try it. 
 - I dare not.

238
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,470
If I want you to try it, then try it.

239
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,630
Does it taste good?

240
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,760
Since it tastes good,

241
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,900
why have I never eaten it before?

242
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,830
I made a mistake.

243
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,780
I thought you dislike the festival atmosphere.

244
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,570
- so... I didn't— 
 - Then that means

245
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,040
you did it on purpose.

246
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,720
I know it's my fault.

247
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,500
Older Brother.

248
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,770
Little Chun Hua, tell me!

249
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,690
Should I gouge her eyes out

250
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,930
or kill her?

251
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,890
Older Brother, while eating mooncakes, we should enjoy the moon.

252
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,490
Besides, during the Mid-Autumn Festival,

253
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,270
why do something so bloody? Right?

254
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,380
Instead, why don't we go for a walk?

255
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,930
Do you remember the taste?

256
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,700
I remember it.

257
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,870
Prepare more next time.

258
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,230
Little Chun Hua likes to eat it.

259
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,190
Then let's go.

260
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,480
The lantern show is already over.

261
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,310
Why do they still not return?

262
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,030
Really strange!

263
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,520
Young Master Qin loves to play.

264
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,960
He likely went to watch the lanterns.

265
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,270
Who cares how Master Qin plays around?

266
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,610
I'm worried about Young Master Xiao.

267
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,610
After he entered Yetan City,

268
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,820
his behavior is so suspicious.

269
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,840
What makes you say this?

270
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,410
According to Young Master Xiao's personality,

271
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,310
he wouldn't come here just to enjoy the lantern show.

272
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,670
Young Master Xiao must have another purpose for coming here.

273
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,240
I think you know this better than me.

274
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,940
This place is near the Hua family’s home.

275
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,370
Compared to watching the lantern show,  based on Young Master Xiao's personality,

276
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,030
visiting Old Master Hua is the most important matter.

277
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:41,130
It's Mid-Autumn Festival so it's normal to drop by and visit an elder.

278
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,060
It's just that... How can he visit

279
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,770
the elder late at night?

280
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,440
Even more odd is Miss Chun Hua.

281
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,530
She said she was going to buy mooncakes.

282
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,630
I think at this time,

283
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,890
all of the shops are likely closed.

284
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,840
My young daughter died recently.

285
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,520
Why do you bring her painting here

286
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,610
to cause pain to a grey-haired person? (Idiom: an elder's pain when a younger loved one dies.)

287
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,570
Uncle (term of respect),

288
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,110
Xiaolei is still alive.

289
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,640
Xiaolei did not die.

290
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,260
I already found her.  It's just that... she has lost her memory.

291
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,840
Where is she now?

292
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,510
She came with me to Yetan City but it's just inconvenient for you to meet her right now.

293
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,200
What do you mean?

294
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,240
Forgive me for speaking bluntly.

295
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,760
After finding Xiaolei,

296
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,200
her suspicious aspects have been increasing.

297
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,780
I know I shouldn't speculate, but I worry the Demon Sect will take advantage of her.

298
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,000
Thus, I came to confirm with Uncle Hua.

299
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,230
Before Xiaolei's marriage, did she...

300
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,630
Utter nonsense!

301
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,500
Not only did you cause my daughter's death,

302
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,730
right now you even want to destroy her innocent reputation.

303
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,330
Xiao Bai,

304
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,530
my Hua family and your Fengming Mountain Manor have had a relationship for generations.

305
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,580
What kind of person I am, your father clearly knows the best.

306
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,610
The daughter that I taught and raised, even after becoming ashes,

307
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,130
I will not allow you to insult or slander her.

308
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,770
- Uncle Hua, please don't get agitated! Brother Xiao didn't mean that— 
 - Shut up!

309
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,260
You should tell me.

310
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,700
Where is the arsonist who set fire to Fengming Mountain Manor that day?

311
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,430
These matters... We have yet to ascertain what happened.

312
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,230
I see that you came to Hua family to convict.

313
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,450
That my Hua family colluded with the Demon Sect.

314
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,010
We are too shameful and inferior to associate with Fengming Mountain Manor!

315
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,580
Butler, escort the guests out!

316
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,280
Uncle Hua.

317
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:08,290
Uncle, please be understanding of today's situation.

318
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,370
After we figure out the truth, we will definitely visit again to apologize.

319
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,630
The Old Master is interesting. He was so enraged.

320
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,330
To know his biological daughter is still alive...

321
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,860
Is his reputation more important?

322
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,400
You can't blame Old Master Hua.

323
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,360
Involvement with the Demon Sect has always been an unforgivable crime.

324
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,230
I acted too impulsively.

325
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,270
What plans do you have?

326
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,310
No matter what, Xiaolei has the right to know the truth.

327
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,620
Let's go!

328
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,590
You, young masters, watched the lanterns until late at night.

329
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,690
How wonderful!

330
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,840
Why isn't Miss Chun Hua here?

331
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:40,210
Miss Feng didn't get to see the lanterns and eat mooncakes, just waiting for you.

332
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,860
But now, you only ask where Miss Chun Hua is.

333
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,320
I am very sorry for making Miss Leng wait for this long.

334
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,510
Who is waiting for you? Fancy yourself!

335
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,800
I just knew that Miss Leng would be angry so I brought you a small gift.

336
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,020
I hope you will like it.

337
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,820
Casually picking wild flowers

338
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,690
is Master Qin's style of doing things.

339
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,750
Yetan City is full of good and bad people.

340
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,120
Miss Chun Hua also doesn't know martial arts.

341
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,580
I think I should go and find her.

342
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,760
Did Miss Chun Hua say where she went?

343
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,730
She went to buy mooncakes so she should be back soon.

344
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,230
- How long has she gone? 
 - It's been three hours.

345
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,560
Young Master Xiao, I'll go with you.

346
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,940
Hold on! I'll go as well.

347
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,760
Count me in!

348
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,810
During the Mid-Autumn Festival,

349
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,470
family should eat mooncakes together.

350
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,500
Together and complete!

351
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,110
Our parents are all dead.

352
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,440
It has been so long.

353
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,910
I don't even remember what they look like.

354
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,770
Brother is so pitiable.

355
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,040
However, I'm destined to be with Xiao Bai.

356
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,290
Then Big Brother will be lonely in the future.

357
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,110
From now on, I'm your only family.

358
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,920
I will find more time to keep you company.

359
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,710
What you said...

360
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,570
do you mean it?

361
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,380
Of course!

362
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,170
Brother believes you.

363
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,140
Excuse me! Have you seen this girl?

364
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,880
- Excuse me! Have you seen this girl? 
 - She's this tall. Have you seen her?

365
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,700
You really haven't?

366
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,320
No.

367
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,180
Brother Qin, how's it going?

368
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,470
Let's continue looking.

369
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,320
How beautiful!

370
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,550
How can this place exist in Qianyue Cave?

371
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,240
How can there be so many lotuses here?

372
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,390
Big Brother, were you born during Mid-Autumn festival? You must be!

373
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,640
Otherwise, how would you be as beautiful as the moon in the sky?

374
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,170
Why don't you beg me? I'll pick it for you.

375
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:02,100
Then I'm begging you to help me pick one.

376
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,010
Thank you, Big Brother.

377
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,040
What's wrong?

378
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,730
The curtains are not good. I don't like them.

379
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,610
In your heart, everything's not that good.

380
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,700
In my heart, Little Chun Hua is the best.

381
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,170
Big Brother, I really have to go back now.

382
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,220
Didn't Chun Hua say you have to be with family during Mid-Autumn Festival?

383
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,930
Is Xiao Bai more important than me?

384
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,370
That's surely not what I meant.

385
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,770
If I don't go back, Xiao Bai will be worried.

386
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,170
Are you sure that he would be worried?

387
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,930
You know Xiao Bai considers himself a hero.

388
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,440
I'm just a weak woman in his eyes.

389
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,110
Of course, he will be worried.

390
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,110
Might as well! Since you're so worried,

391
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,030
get the Xin Fa within ten days.

392
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,840
So be it! I'll worry about that later.

393
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,690
Then...

394
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,730
wait until after I get the Xin Fa, I'll come back to play with you.

395
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,590
- You can play however you want to. 
 - Okay.

396
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,460
Then I'll give you something precious.

 ''The Unfinished Moment'' by Singer: Li Hongyi 

399
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,410
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

400
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:53,340
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

401
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,750
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking its eye  ♫

402
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,060
♫  Seeing through love's fickleness  ♫

403
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,120
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

404

♫  It's such a pity for not stepping forward  ♫

405

♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

406
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:21,530
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

407
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,910
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

408
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:31,000
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

409
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,820
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

410
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:39,270
♫  It's hard to walk on. There's even no one to argue with  ♫

♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

412

♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

413
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,660
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

414
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:58,700

432
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,920
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

433

♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

434
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,070
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

435
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,350
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

436

♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

437
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:18,610
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

438
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:25,360
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
