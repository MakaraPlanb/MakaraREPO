There's a poison called 'Dandelion'.

Do you have the antidote? It would be better for me to use this drug to

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,500
get Shangguan Qiu Yue drunk, and take advantage of the opportunity to coax it out of him.

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,360
However, there wasn't any 'Three Day Drunk' in that vial.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,290
I exchanged it with an aphrodisiac.

You trust Miss Chun Hua because she's your fiancée.

However, no one knows where this antidote came from so how can you ask me to trust

the person who is giving the antidote, sincerely wants to save her?

95
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,780
It's not that I don't trust you, it's just that you are so confident about where this medicine came from.

96
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,090
True! Why did I trust that Devil so much?

Actually...

112
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,360
Just now, I did not entirely trust you.

113
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,540
I just trust that you would not harm Miss Feng.

114
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,810
As for the medicine, Miss Chun Hua, where did this medicine come from?

115
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,470
If I say that I bought it from outside, would you believe me?

116
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,770
I found the antidote!

117
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,960
I found the antidote. Quickly look at it and see if there are any problems.

118
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,910
Where did you get this medicine from?

119
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,030
I bought it at the pharmacy.

120
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,600
Why are the two of you still standing here?

121
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,010
Hurry and give it to Physician Bu.

122
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,530

123
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,540
Is it hot?

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,720
Young Master.

125
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,430
It is good that this medicine is effective.

126
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,770
Miss Feng, you have suffered.

127
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,380
Regarding Leader Feng's death and your poisoning,

128
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,870
these two situations,

129
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,800
I will surely investigate the truth for you.

130
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,140
So for now you should stay in Fengming Mountain Manor to recover.

131
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,740
This time, we must really thank Miss Chun Hua.

132
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,280
Yes.

133
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,910
For this situation,

134
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,090
I am truly grateful to everyone, especially Miss Chun Hua.

135
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,960
She is just a weak girl with no knowledge of martial arts,

136
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,470
yet she ran around outside to help me find the antidote.

137
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,470
Actually,

138
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,170
this antidote was bought on the streets by Miss Chun Hua.

139
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,610
Bought?

140
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,850
Are you saying that all the pharmacies

141
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,210
are currently selling the antidote for 'Dandelion' poison?

142
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,990
I interrogated the pharmacy owner.

143
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,080
He said that the origin of this antidote is unclear. Just that...

144
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,780
Just that what?

145
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,000
The owner said that although its origins are unclear,

146
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,820
it is rumored that the antidote is made using the leaves of the Longevity fruit.

147
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,570
It seems that it must also be related to Master Shi.

148
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,100
Even the leaves are so miraculous.

149
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,230
Could this Longevity fruit really grant immortality?

150
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,650
Miss Chun Hua.

151
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,550
Miss Chun Hua?

152
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,310
I never thought that all the alleys and streets of this city would be selling the antidote.

153
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,740
Using the leaves to make the antidote...

154
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,810
Being sold in all the streets and alleys?

155
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,530
Yet there is no news of the fruit itself?

156
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,570
How can this be?

157
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,390
Master, please forgive me. I have already done my best to search for it.

158
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,530
It is truly...

159
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,710
Useless!

160
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,040

161
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,690
How could I dream about marrying Shangguan Qiu Yue?

162
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,430
The one I love is Xiao Bai.

163
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,380
Right!

164
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,590
The first person I saw is Xiao Bai.

165
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,060
So the one I love is him.

166
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,510
Maybe there has just been too much happening recently.

167
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,620
There's also the matter of me being muddled when stealing the medicine from Shangguan Qiu Yue.

168
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,090
Maybe once I marry Xiao Bai, everything will be all right.

169
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,100
Right!

170
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,450
Miss Feng has been getting better day by day.

171
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,780
Once she is fully recovered, why don't we all head to Mount Ling to play?

172
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,240
Play what?

173
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,070
Right now Xiao Bai has important things to settle, how can he have the time to play?

174
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,400
Then why don't you say,

175
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,320
what is the situation that is making our adorable Xiao Bai the most frustrated?

176
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,220
Wait!

177
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:14,330
Looking at the chemistry of the two of you, you should say it together.

178
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,630
Then so be it!

179
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,690
- The marriage process. 
 - Longevity fruit.

180
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,300
My meaning is...

181
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,730
carrying out the wedding is not as important as looking for the Longevity fruit.

182
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,640
Right?

183
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,340
However, as of now, the Longevity fruit's location is unknown.

184
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,180
At this moment, we still don't know how to investigate it.

185
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,380
For every day we cannot find the Longevity fruit,

186
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,630
the martial arts world will continue to have this demon in their hearts.

187
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,860
Miss Chun Hua, what do you think?

188
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,660
Whether it is a heart demon, I do not know.

189
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,620
However, I know that everyone is interested in this Longevity fruit.

190
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,670
Everyone is being led by the nose.

191
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,680
Yet everyone wants it but cannot get it.

192
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,880
Every time news about the Longevity fruit is leaked, there will always be someone who dies.

193
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,920
For such a thing to continue existing in the world,

194
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,850
there will definitely be even bigger repercussions.

195
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,980
Once we get rid of the Longevity fruit,

196
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,300
then there will no longer be any trouble in the future.

197
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,700
Wait! We don't even know what the Longevity fruit looks like.

198
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,830
How can we even talk about eliminating it?

199
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,850
Are you a fool?

200
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,620
To look for something that no one has seen before,

201
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,890
just display a fake Longevity fruit, then wouldn't it all be over?

202

Miss Chun Hua,

203
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,230
it is easy to draw a dragon while looking at a cat, but difficult to draw a dragon based on nothing.

204
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,890
Where did you get the confidence

205
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,090
to look for something we have never seen before?

206
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,220
Young Master Qin,

207
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,660

217
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,810
Miss Chun Hua, as a matter of fact, you are quite amazing.

218
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,040
After all, we've only seen this on the maps and records of the coastal country.

219
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,410
We have never seen it in person.

220
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,680
You even read that book?

221
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,960
What are you all doing?

222
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,710
Miss Feng, Miss Leng, you are here. Please sit!

223
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,900
- What are you all doing? 
 - Miss Leng, this is the new fried chicken that Miss Chun Hua has come up with.

224
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,130
It's delicious! You should give it a try.

225
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,340
You're quite the expert at eating, drinking and idling away your time.

226
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,830
I think the Longevity fruit is a harmful object to others, so we must destroy it.

227
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:42,170
Moreover, we all haven't seen the Longevity fruit, and we still have no idea what on earth it looks like.

228
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,820
So that's why Miss Chun Hua made this.

229
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,690
Miss Chun Hua is very thoughtful.

230
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,560
Miss Chun Hua is indeed learned and versatile.

231
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,200
However, you must also consider the reality.

232
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,400
The Longevity fruit has wandered around the world for many years.

233
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,860
This is something that should be easily preserved.

234

That's it!

Is this the Longevity fruit?

240
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,000
The walnut does indeed nourish the mind and is beneficial to one's intellectual power.

241

It's just that this Longevity fruit...

243
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,530
It looks like it!

it's simple and nice that they could end up liking me this way.

- I am sorry! 
 - Chun Hua, are you okay?

251
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,660
That was my fault.

Fortunately Xiao Bai is so naive. Otherwise, he wouldn't have fallen into my hands.

264
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,190
The last time you mentioned the matter of marriage, I was indeed slow-witted.

I didn't promptly give you an answer.

I've thought it over and over again.
