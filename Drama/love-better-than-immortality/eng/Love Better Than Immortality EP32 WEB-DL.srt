Although we are both loach spirits,

I need to attract people's attention a bit more.

This way, the flirty loaches will take the initiative and flirt with me.

 - Let's wait and observe a bit more.

170
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,400
Everyone, be careful!

171
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,460
Watch out!

172
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,160
Li Yu?

173
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,330
[Baxian Residence]

174
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,610
Could I have a word with you in private?

175
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,740
You all can go first.

176
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,600
Li Yu, Baxian Residence already has so much medicine.

177
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,830
- Why are you still carrying in these? 
 - The Longevity fruit isn't inside these trunks.

178
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,760
I was just casually asking but if you don't want to tell me, then forget it.

179
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,540
Miss, it isn't that I don't want to tell you.

180
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,190
I just feel angry when it's brought up.

181
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,800
We were relayed some news today, a major issue occurred in Qianyue Cave.

182
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,870
The cave leaders caused an armed rebellion

183
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,280
along with Fu Lou's Chuanqi Gorge disciples.

184
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,080
They severely wounded Shangguan Qiu Yue.

185
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,760
What?

186
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,110
Can you explain more about what you just said?

187
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,800
I heard that Shangguan Qiu Yue has disappeared now.

188
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,410
For the remnants of the troops, both sides suffered heavy casualties.

189
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,190
However, after Master Bu'er heard this, he was extremely happy.

190
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,150
He even said, this would be a good business opportunity.

191
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,900
He instructed me to purchase all medicinal materials in the entire city.

192
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,070
He said when it's time, he can sell them at a higher price.

193
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,420
He'll even rip off the Devil himself.

194
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,260
Really!

195
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,830
Is this news conclusive?

196
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,610
If Master Bu'er said it from his own mouth, then it is certainly beyond doubt.

197
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,380
After this news, the one by Shangguan Qiu Yue's side,

198
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,650
how was Miss Chun Hua doing then?

199
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,760
I heard no news of her; however, I think if Shangguan Qiu Yue is missing,

200
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,390
then the others are not that much better off.

201
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,440
Young Chief Master.

202
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,280
I must go inside now.

203
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,510
I will wrap it for you.

204
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,670
Surely it's safer being in the store than on the street. 

205
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,450
I shouldn't run into Xiao Bai here.

206
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,140
What are the two of you looking for?

207
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,240
Shopkeeper, do you have any jade pendants?

208
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,280
Have you any pendants for lovers?

209
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,410
A pair!

210
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,000
I have some that come in pairs. Follow me!

211
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,240
Please take a look.

212
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,530
Brother, look! This one has your name engraved on the front.

213
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,040
Xiao Chun Hua has great eyesight.

214
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,120
All right, I'll take this one.

215
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,610
Let's go!

216
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,700
Wait, wait!

217
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,630
You haven't paid me yet.

218
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,310
Pay him!

219
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,840
I... didn't bring any money.

220
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,030
Why don't you sell it to me now, and I'll send you money later?

221
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,100
Small shops cannot sell on credit, you should just come back later.

222
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,140
I just want this one.

223
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,390
Young Master, if you really want this one, then I can save it for you half a day.

224
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,420
I want it now.

225
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,910
You have no money. Do you want just to rob it?

226
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,680
- That works, too. 
 - Would you really dare steal in broad daylight?

227
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,020
Do you want to kill me and steal my money?

228
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,360
Shopkeeper, calm down!

229
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,420
I won't sell it anymore!

230
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,500
Shopkeeper, my brother's head is not quite right.

231
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,970
Don't argue with him. I'll pay, I'll pay!

232
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,690
Oh, no! Oh no! 

233
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,530
I...

234
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,590
- I also don't have any money. 
 - You just said my head is not quite right.

235
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,970
Your ears are even better than a rabbit's.

236
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,290
Well, your head isn't quite right, either.

237
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,060
Otherwise, why would you be with me?

238
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,040
Fine, fine! You're always right.

239
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,370
- Let's go! 
 - No way.

240
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,290
I must buy the jade pendant that you picked out for me today.

241
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,690
Well, all right! I'll go back to grab some money.

242
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,140
You must be a good boy.

243
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,620
I'll go now.

244
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,660
[Baxian Residence]

245
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,060
If even Shangguan Qiu Yue has disappeared without a trace,

246
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,190
then others won't be that much better off.

247
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,150
Do you see? This is your sorry fate for leaving me!

248
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,960
Young Chief Master!

249
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,900
Might as well!

250
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,090
Since you chose to follow and be with the Devil,

251
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,920
this serves you right!

252
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,860
Seeing willows by the river and spring flowers deepen my sadness.

253
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,510
Even as our hair turns grey, will we ever meet again?

254
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,180
Chun Hua, if you're lucky enough to survive,

255
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,740
after I kill Shangguan Qiu Yue with my own hands,

256
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,440
I will get even with you.

257
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,250
[Seeing willows by the river and spring flowers deepen my sadness. Even as our hair turns grey, will we ever meet again?]

258
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,930
Is everything you said really all true?

259
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,920
Although I was lucky enough to escape death, I've lost all martial arts skill.

260
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,460
Now, I'm just a good-for-nothing.

261
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,420
If you don't believe me, you can call Shangguan Qiu Yue

262
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,740
here to kill me.

263
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,560
I also have no way to fight back.

264
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,470
Miss Chun Hua, we are cut from the same cloth.

265
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,980
So the last time you fled from Qianyue Cave, I purposely let you go.

266
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,980
Presumably, you know about this.

267
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,200
That was because you had other reasons.

268
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,440
I'm absolutely not some type of daredevil

269
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,470
but I fought desperately in Qianyue Cave just because I wanted Ye Yan to understand my feelings for her.

270
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,770
If you're suspicious of my behavior, then you can go now.

271
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,410
I believe what you've said.

272
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,460
Yes, I hate Shangguan Qiu Yue; however, no matter how much I hate him,

273
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,020
there's nothing I can do to him.

274
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,010
There's no way I can take advantage of him as you can,

275
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,410
because he'll achieve his goal of uniting the martial arts world very soon.

276
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,260
If he leaves you, he will not suffer any loss.

277
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,660
Miss Chun Hua,

278
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:50,030
actually, you are very similar to me.

279
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,580
Your love for Shangguan Qiu Yue is just like mine for Ye Yan.

280
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,910
So I really don't want you to become like me

281
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,840
to trust the wrong person

282
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,720
to finally end up with a tragic of sorry fate.

283
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,590
Then is Master Bu'er diagnosing and treating him now?

284
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,150
Today, Li Yu called for Master Bu'er to come and I wasn't able to decline.

285
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,600
However, the clues we found before all point to Baxian Residence.

286
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,530
If Master Shi is truly a member of Baxian Residence,

287
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,860
then he might want to further hurt the Young Chief Master.

288
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,180
We should go there right now then.

289
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,910
Wait!

290
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,140
Isn't that Miss Chun Hua?

291
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,040
It's her!

292
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,730
Hold on! How about this?

293
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,870
You two go to Baxian Residence and I'll go to find out how she feels now.

294
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,410
That also works!

295
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,840
Miss Chun Hua!

296
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,620
Qin Liufeng?

297
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,880
What are you doing here?

298
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,080
We've been investigating the case of the Healer and Longevity fruit in Baxian City.

299
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,230
However, our results fell short of our expectations.

300
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,120
Miss Chun Hua,

301
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,120
how have you been lately? I heard that Shangguan Qiu Yue—

302
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,010
Don't bring him up!

303
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,750
With the rebellion in Qianyue Cave, you must be homeless, don't you?

304
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,300
Indeed, I don't know where I should go.

305
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,480
The Young Chief Master, he...

306
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,000
misses you all the time.

307
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,810
I already broke up with Xiao Bai.

308
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,360
If I return and see everyone, it'll be so embarrassing.

309
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,540
Miss Chun Hua, what if I told you

310
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,710
that the Young Chief Master has fallen sick and bedridden from missing you so much?

311
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,060
He's such a calm, cool-headed person.

312
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,030
I don't believe you!

313
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,290
Miss Chun Hua, it's absolutely true.

314
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,370
After the Young Chief Master heard of the Qianyue Cave rebellion,

315
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,180
he was so worried about you that he threw up blood and fainted.

316
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,800
He's in a coma now.

317
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,510
How could that happen?

318
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:42,240
He misses you day and night, and longs for your return.

319
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,280
Miss Chun Hua, you are the only one

320
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,370
who can save the Young Chief Master from his extreme misery now.

321
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,530
Please do me a favor! Return and take a quick look at him.

322
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,560
Please trust me!

323
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,490
What are you two doing?

324
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,650
Shangguan Qiu Yue!

325
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,440
He was plotting something horrible for you just now.

326
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,800
That's none of your business.

327
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,020
Xiao Chun Hua, it seems that you're suddenly in an awful mood.

328
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,010
Still all thanks to you.

329
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,660
It seems that he wasn't plotting something horrible for you.

330
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,720
It's that you two fall in love with each other.

331
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,190
It seems I ruined a good thing for you.

332
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,060
Yes, you have. So what?

333
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,650
Return with me!

334
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,630
Shangguan Qiu Yue!

335
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,950
[Baxian Residence]

336
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,340
There's no need for you two to panic.

337
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,850
The Young Chief Master's pulse is stable now.

338
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,310
Master Bu'er, did you discover why the Young Chief Master threw up blood and fainted?

339
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,370
He has no injuries to his internal organs.

340
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,280
Presumably, he's simply anxious about his wife.

341
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,830
For a while, he was in an alarmed, bewildered state of mind because his internal energy was diverted.

342
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,650
Consequently, his energy is upsurging.

343
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,980
He just needs to rest more.

344
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,100
After his internal energy returns to normal, then he'll wake up.

345
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,950
That's good. Thank you.

346
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,070
I asked Li Yu to make this calming soup just now.

347
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,090
- I'll feed it to him. 
 - No need, Master Bu'er.

348
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,910
What do you mean by this, Miss Feng?

349
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,410
This calming soup is a medication that makes people calm, foolish, and ignorant.

350
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,800
However, Young Chief Master only needs rest right now.

351
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,650
No one neglected him.

352
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,210
- I'll give him some now. 
 - Young Chief Master is a martial arts person.

353
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,710
I think he will wake soon on his own.

354
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,230
We won't inconvenience you any longer.

355
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,590
Miss, although it's just a love-sickness,

356
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:26,100
yet if anything else happens,

357
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,300
he will suffer real harm and fall seriously ill.

358
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,120
I cannot afford to bear this burden.

359
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,820
Wouldn't you agree, Miss Feng?

360
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,840
The Young Chief Master is awaken.

361
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,910
I am sorry. I did not mean to.

362
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,290
Are you feeling okay, Young Chief Master?

363
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,600
I am fine.

364
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,550
This is Baxian Residence.

365
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,070
Thank you for your care of my health but I still have important things to do.

366
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,110
I need to talk to you guys about something.

367
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,330
Are you awake?

368
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,850
- Why are you here? Where is Miss Chun Hua? 
 - Leng Ning!

369
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,610
What is going on with Miss Chun Hua?

370
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,630
I...

371
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,000
I indeed saw her.

372
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,780
She is safe.

373
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,620
Do not worry!

374
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,490
That's good.

375
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,780
Li Yu, that boy, definitely cooked and burnt the medicine again.

376
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,720
I will check on it. I'll go and check.

377
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,380
Since you're awake, let's return to  Fengming Mountain Manor first.

378
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,730
Sure!

379
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,680
[Qianyue Cave]

380
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,380
Shangguan Qiu Yue, let me go!

381
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,710
What do you want?

382
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,700
I should be asking you, shouldn't I?

383
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,310
Xiao Chun Hua made her big brother wait at the jewelry shop.

384
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,620
I told the manager to engrave your name on the jade pendant.

385
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,890
I just wanted to make you happy.

386
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,740
However, after coming out,

387
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,580
I saw you fooling around with the  people from Fengming Mountain.

388
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,360
Then I truly disappointed my brother.

389
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,350
Xiao Bai has gone,

390
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,070
and Qin Liufeng came.

391
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,980
What medication did he give you that you'd treat me this way?

392
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,870
Treat you this way?

393
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,790
Every day I smile and look only at you.

394
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,940
But you just play around with my mind every day, is this what you wanted?

395
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:33,510
Shangguan Qiu Yue, what you want is someone you can control

396
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,140
- but I am a living being! 
 - What did he say to you?

397
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,240
He just told me everything you have done,

398
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,630
from start to finish.

399
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,510
Silly Sister, you have been manipulated by him.

400
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,020
Qin Liufeng is from Fengming Mountain.

401
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,940
He certainly has a lot of resentment toward me.

402
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,280
Big Brother, you sure are confident.

403
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,770
It's Xiao Bai.

404
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,170
Xiao Bai still misses you.

405
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:15,310
So he used such a low tactic to come between us.

406
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,970
He doesn't have any tolerance,

407
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:23,280
unlike a martial arts leader, let alone deserving you.

408
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,220
So are the tactics you used any better?

409
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,850
I am not like him.

410
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:37,730
I just want to be good to you and Xiao Bai will only hurt you.

411
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,380
Brother, even at a time like this,

412
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,810
you still worry about my relationship with the people of Fengming Mountain Manor.

413
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,540
It is such a shame!

414
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,320
I wasn't told these things by Xiao Bai or Qin Liufeng.

415
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,620
It was Gu Wan.
