31
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,540
As for this meal, we shouldn't eat this meal.

32
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,220
The Longevity fruit is fake but this Soft Muscle Powder is real.

33
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,670
I tell you the truth, this is the Snake Saliva Incense.

34
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,410
It was indeed the Longevity fruit produced by this Master Shi,

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,150
that set the sects of the Righteous Path and the Demon Sects against each other.

36
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,790
If it weren't for you

37
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,300
and the Longevity fruit auction,

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,040
how would there be so much bloodshed?

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,710
It seems that in Xiao Chun Hua's heart,

40
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,980
I'm also only a heinous evildoer.

[Episode 40]

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,830
What did you all make her eat?

43
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,700
Why does the Hundred Flower Tribulation turn out to be like this?

44
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,960
I only fed her the Snow Lotus Seed.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,290
You guys gave her the Snow Lotus Seed.

46
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,590
I only know that Team Leader Gu has won this game.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,390
No matter whether it's the Soft Muscle Powder or the Snake Saliva Incense,

48
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,890
as long as it got mixed with the Snow Lotus Seed,

49
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,970
then it will trigger

50
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,770
the attack of the Hundred Flower Tribulation poison.

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,450
Bu'er, where is the antidote?

52
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,280
I am most familiar with the Hundred Flower Tribulation poison.

53
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,850
There is no antidote.

54
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,090
I was planning to cure you after the great fight.

55
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,380
I never imagined—

56
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,840
We'll just have to see, between the Young Chief Master and the Cave Master Shangguan,

57
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,610
who is going to save her?

58
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:30,070
I really don't know which figurehead of the Righteous Path or the Demon Sect

59
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,620
will sacrifice himself to save a mere girl.

Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,620
If we do not get rid of the poison,

62
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,190
Xiao Chun Hua will die after half of an hour.

63
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,960
Older Brother Qiu Yue, don't kill the innocent anymore.

64
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,460
The Qianyue Sect is skilled at manufacturing poison.

65
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,870
Since this poison originated from Qianyue Sect, there must be an antidote.

66
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,790
There's no antidote for the Hundred Flower Tribulation poison.

67
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,510
There is still one more method to save her.

68
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,590
It's by using only the Zhen Qi (internal force).

69
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,850
The average normal Qi won't do.

70
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,630
It has to be the purest Qi from Yang, 
 (TN: In Chinese philosophy, Yang is characterized as male associating with heaven, light, and heat in oppose to Yin which is characterized as female associating with earth, dark, and cold.)

71
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,190
or the purest Qi of the three Yin. 
 (TN: Xiao Bai has the purest Yang Zhen Qi; whereas, Qiu Yue has the three times the Yin Zhen Qi of any other.)

72
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,190
Young Chief Master seems to have been practicing the purest Yang Zhen Qi .

73
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,870
Could it be that...

74
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,300
Shangguan Qiu Yue has been practicing the purest Zhen Qi of three Yin?

75
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,390
About the Hundred Flower Tribulation poison, even with the strongest martial arts masters,

76
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,570
it still takes three days to detoxify and cure her.

77
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,690
Team Leader Gu and I were originally planning

78
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,070
to poison the girl during the great fight between Qianyue Sect and the Fengming Mountain Manor.

79
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,210
Then it doesn't matter whoever doesn't sacrifice himself,

80
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,900
I can still gain power and elevate my status.

81
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,560
Such an important thing, Team Leader Gu and I

82
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,580
have planned a long time for this.

83
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,780
But who knew you'd feed her the Snow Lotus Seed

84
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,650
and quicken the attack of the poison?

85
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,120
No matter who decides to cure her,

86
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,500
that person has to use up all his purest Zhen Qi.

87
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,950
The pugilist world will lose yet another top level martial arts master.

88
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,000
However, who would be so foolish

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,680
to become so vulnerable in front of the other?

Chun Hua?

119
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,560
I already told you...

120
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,770
I will treat you well.

121
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,770
Shangguan Qiu Yue had used the fake Longevity fruit

122
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,760
that led to so many deaths.

123
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,050
He has to be punished.

Young Chief Master,

125
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,580
why don't... we kill him now?

126
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,140
Then use your Zhen Qi to cure Miss Chun Hua's poison.

127
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,780
Young Chief Master cannot kill him.

128
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,020
He is saving someone.

129
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,100
Wouldn't that be taking advantage of the situation?

130
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,100
Husband!

131
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,300
 I clearly remember... 

132
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,700
 your face.

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,500
 In your heart, 

134
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,290
 is there anyone you like? 

135
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,000
 There's no right or wrong for love. 

136
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,900
 Although Elder Master Xiao failed Shuangguan Hui, 

137
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,900
 he didn't stain his name as a martial arts master. 

138
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,580
 Chun Hua said, 

139
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,290
 use kindheartedness to heal the world, 

140
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,700
 then you won't fail to love others or get to know others. 

141
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
 I like you. 

142
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,500
 I have never loved anyone other than you. 

143
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,000
 You said that you like me. 

144
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,800
 Xiao Bai likes Chun Hua. 

145
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,000
 You'll be good to me my whole life, won't you? 

146
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,200
 I was wrong to be with the great villain of the Qianyue Sect. 

147
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,000
 I... 

148
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,100
 am, therefore, also a demoness. 

149
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,900
 You should kill me for the greater good. 

150
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,100
 wouldn't that be even better? 

151
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,690
Miss Chun Hua.

152
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,300
Young Master Qin.

153
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,400
I was thinking about when I first met you until now.

154
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,790
Did you sense the change with time?

155
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,100
I'm no longer a cockroach that never dies.

156
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,350
The truth of the Longevity fruit is now known to the world.

157
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,400
Bu'er has also been executed.

158
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,950
Yes.

159
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,080
I still have to congratulate you, Young Master Qin.

160
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,300
You achieved what you wanted, having an engagement to Miss Leng.

161
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,240
In the final fight, the Qianyue Sect had everything within their grasp.

162
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,000
They could have benefited from it.

163
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,400
However, I never thought that suddenly

164
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,580
Shangguan Qiu Yue was taken by Ye Yan.

165
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,260
The martial arts world has also calmed down.

166
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,400
It ended without even a fight.

167
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,000
Your poison from the Hundred Flower Tribulation has also been cured.

168
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,300
You were unconscious for two days.

169
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,600
We moved you from Baxian Residence back to the Fengming Mountain Manor.

170
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,800
Yes.

171
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,400
You... Are you still blaming the Young Chief Master for not making a decision?

172
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,230
Not at all.

173
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,310
He should have done it that way.

174
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,200
If he saved me and sacrificed all of you,

175
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,500
I would feel guilty forever.

176
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,130
Shangguan Qiu Yue

177
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,330
used up his purest Zhen Qi.

178
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,230
This news has spread all over.

179
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,700
Originally the Righteous Path and the Demon Sect would spare no effort to win,

180
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,290
but due to his illness, everyone dispersed in no time.

181
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,590
After that, there was some inner turmoil within the Qianyue Sect.

182
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,910
People from all over the pugilist were against Qianyue Sect.

183
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,800
He had started the issue of the Longevity fruit

184
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,300
so all the sects deeply resented him.

185
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,700
But don't you worry!

186
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,390
The Young Chief Master has ordered that no one can harm him.

187
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,400
Three days ago, Ye Yan settled the rebellion

188
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,800
and had Qianyyue Sect under control.

189
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,450
Then what about Shangguan Qiu Yue?

190
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,000
He... stayed out of the conflict.

191
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,730
Actually, this incident would be to his ultimate benefit.

192
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,330
To think about it again, he was a very calculating person.

193
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,190
He caused us to fight each other from within.

194
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,790
However, before the great fight, he had already used up all of his purest Zhen Qi;

195
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,100
and thus, ultimately prevented this fight.

196
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,220
It is also better this way.

197
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,500
The pugilist world can be peaceful for a while yet.

198
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,410
If his will to protect himself were a bit stronger,

199
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,300
that would have been great.

200
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,700
You... must really love him.

201
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,770
Shangguan Qiu Yue likes to play with people's emotions.

202
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,530
He treated you just like a pawn but he always protected you.

203
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,880
Who would expect that right before the great fight,

204
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,200
he could give up his prospects to choose you?

205
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,900
He, actually,

206
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,700
is too naïve.

207
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,840
Who would dare to disagree?

208
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,420
However, no one can firmly say that he is naive.

209
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,800
I have always wondered what he really wants.

210
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,770
It's as if all he ever wanted is you.

211
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,210
When facing Bu'er's final plot,

212
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,700
he and the Young Chief Master had the same decision to make.

213
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,700
The Young Chief Master chose the greater good, as for him...

214
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,200
he chose you as his final move on the chessboard.

215
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,330
No matter what,

216
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,600
he has won.

217
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,140
With a girl like you by his side,

218
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,480
our worry against him will also lessen

219
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,380
and the peace in the pugilist world

220
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,900
will be maintained a little longer.

221
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,100
Miss Chun Hua,

222
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,920
I now, bid you

223
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,500
a "Goodbye."

224
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,800
The days are getting colder.

225
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,200
Please remember to close the doors and windows.

226
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,500
I am well and strong right now.

227
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,600
You have lost a lot of weight after dealing with this illness.

228
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,790
Xiao Bai, I really do not blame you.

229
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,900
Is that so? I would prefer that you blame me.

230
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,200
I also want to go and see him.

231
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,800
When will it be?

232
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,600
Just right now.

233
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,500
I will tell someone to take you.

234
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,800
Are you still angry at me?

235
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,780
If you stay with me, there will come a day when I will sacrifice you.

236
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,390
Only being with him,

237
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,700
you will be cared for under all circumstances.

238
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,600
Xiao Bai,

239
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,300
you must live on well.

240
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,700
Don't worry! There will be a lot of girls who will fall in love you in the future.

241
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,650
I will get someone to take you.

242
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,010
Thank you.

243
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,320
♫  In a trance, seeing you for the first time  ♫

244
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,070
♫  Tugging on my heartstrings  ♫

245
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,840
♫  Just one glance  ♫

246
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,830
♫  That I will cherish for all of my life  ♫

247
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,480
♫  In love and inseparable, year after year  ♫

248
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,510
♫  There are many volumes of the book of gratitude and grudges  ♫

249
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:24,150
♫  Looking out into the distance, I long for nowhere and nothing  ♫

250
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,990
♫  One's path in life is boundless and goes as far as one can see  ♫

251
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,870
♫  The wind carries and sends promises  ♫

252
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:38,370
♫  People coming together and separating squander this life's destiny  ♫

253
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:43,060
♫  Dreams are numerous and disorderly like thousands of fallen petals  ♫

254
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,180
♫  Looking after each other yet having nothing to say  ♫

255
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:53,730
♫  Spirits of my dreams lead me along, telling me to carry out my ideas  ♫

256
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,180
 Xiao Bai, 

257
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,810
 thank you for all the care you have given me. 

258
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,840
 In the past, I believed in love at first sight. 

259
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,220
 Love means fated to be together. 

260
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,050
 To love someone is to become like the person of your dreams. 

261
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,980
 But now, I realize 

262
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,050
 love is unconditional, 

263
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:46,190
 requires no effort, and cannot be resisted. 

264
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,690
Xiao Bai. 

265
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,250
 A person will die. 

266
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,030
 A love-filled life will always be too short 

267
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,340
 and destined to taste of joys and sorrows. 

268
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,120
 It's unavoidable that you must make choices and sacrifices. 

269
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,450
 You are a hero. 

270
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,630
 One day, you will meet someone 

271
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,050
 whom you will be unable to resist. 

272
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,520
 Chun Hua. 

273
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:27,460
♫  Do you wish to spend forever with me?  ♫

274
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:34,410
♫  Who will you tell? Who will you cry with?  ♫

275
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,900
♫  A song filled with parting sorrow is difficult to score  ♫

276
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:45,470
♫  I'll accompany you on this road of hardship and strife  ♫

277
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,870
♫  Who will you look after? Who will you miss?  ♫

278
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:56,950
♫  For the rest of our lives, we will commit to each other for good times and bad  ♫

279
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,020
♫  Do you wish to  ♫

280
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,860
I came!

281
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,490
♫  Spend forever with me?  ♫

282
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,940
Xiao Chun Hua, are you here to see me?

283
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,460
Yes.

284
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,870
Are you waiting for me?

285
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,590
Xiao Chun Hua, please go back.

286
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,930
I no longer need you.

287
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,060
I don't agree with your previous tactics.

288
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,620
I know!

289
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,350
Can't you control yourself a bit?

290
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,930
Sure!

291
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,190
Then why are you still not coming to me?

292
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,880
I never saw you dress yourself like this.

293
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,600
It is too ugly.

294
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,310
Don't touch! Just ignore it.

295
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,650
You are still so cold.

296
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,280
I do not like people who are cold.

297
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,720
You have to wear more clothes in the future.

298
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,630
Okay.

299
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,720
A while ago, they pursued to kill you.

300
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,570
Are you hurt?

301
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,310
It is all in the past.

302
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,780
Might as well! I know you can't die easily.

303
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,070
Did you also hope I wouldn't die?

304
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,770
Of course!

305
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,220
I only want you to live on well

306
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,430
just like now.

307
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,130
You fool, Older Brother!

308
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,070
I am also leaving.

309
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,730
Will you hug me?

310
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,870
Two people embracing each other,

311
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,030
isn't this warmer?

312
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,850
Yes.

313
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,200
Then I'm going to be flirtatious with you.

314
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,690
I'll do as you please and let you flirt.

315
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,630
Didn't your Purest Zhen Qi return?

316
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,930
Not really.

317
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,610
Will your hair ever turn back?

318
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,130
It is very ugly, isn't it?

319
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,140
A little bit.

320
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,950
But it's not a problem.

321
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,340
I will get used to it after a while.

322
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,610
Let's go!

323
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,270
Let's go home.

324
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,770
This is not pitying.

325
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,700
It's also not gratitude.

326
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,040
It is because Xiao Chun Hua

327
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,140
want to be with you.

328
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,630
Chun Hua is always supposed to be with Qiu Yue originally.

329
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,650
However, I am

330
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,960
unable to take Xiao Chun Hua flying anymore.

331
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,530
How can that be matter, anyway?

332
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,920
We can start a new life.

333
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,300
Then, you have to live well

334
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,930
and love me well.

335
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,850
The past cannot be erased.

336
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,670
Xiao Chun Hua, you also have seen Fu Lou's demise.

337
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,880
Are you scared?

338
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,620
I'm not.

339
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,180
However, you will be.

340
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,680
I have a lot more courage now.

341
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,010
In addition,

342
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,440
you are not Fu Lou and I'm also not Yousi.

343
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,690
I will not let us meet the same ending.

344
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,650
Xiao Chun Hua,

345
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,620
I will ask you seriously one more time.

346
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,570
Do you really have no regrets?

347
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,420
I really don't have any regrets.

348
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,160
However...

349
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,720
in the future, when we fight, I might say some things.

350
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,050
Do not take it to heart!

351
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,520
Sure!

352
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,830
Then...

353
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,710
Older Brother, you once said

354
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,020
you will always treat me well.

355
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,360
Is that still true?

356
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,700
Of course, it's true.

357
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,720
Every word I have said to you is true.

358
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,770
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

359
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,260
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

360
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,680
Fu Lou died 
 ♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking it's eye  ♫

361
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:04,340
so Yousi was unable to live on; hence, you must promise me

362
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,080
that you must die after me. 
 ♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

363
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,230
- I will try. 
 - Moreover,

364
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:19,920
I won't allow you to love someone else, or tell me you hate me

365
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,550
and be in a cold war with me.

366
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,890
- Also, you can't— 
 - I will not permit Xiao Chun Hua to leave me.

367
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,770
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

368
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:33,260
Okay? 
 ♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

369
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,130
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

370
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:41,370
Yes. 
 ♫  It's hard to walk on, there's even no one to argue with  ♫

371
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:45,670
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

372
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,010
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

373
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:53,780
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

374
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:58,280
Xiao Chun Hua, let's go.

375

♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

376
