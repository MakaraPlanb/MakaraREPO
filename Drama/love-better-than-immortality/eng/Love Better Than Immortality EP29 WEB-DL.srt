[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,320
 All of you should die. 

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,550
Although Shangguan Qiu Yue's vital qi has been damaged,

33
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,350
he's still more than capable of dealing with all of you.

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,420
Shangguan Qiu Yue! Shangguan Qiu Yue, what is wrong with you? 

35
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,050
He is injured! Shangguan Qiu Yue. 

36
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,440
It seems that we need to return to the scene of the Healer's death.

37
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,180
Everything has come back to this critical link of the Healer's death.

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,940
Why is it so cold here? 
 - This is an ice cave. 

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,740
I was locked in here for many years 

40
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,070
I am begging you, please wake up!

Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,190
It's lucky that Ye Yan is guarding the front.

44
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,490
Otherwise we wouldn't have been able to get these things.

45
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,140
Her actions have been unbelievable.

46
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,150
What do you mean?

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,910
I originally thought that she would flee to somewhere far away with Gu Wan.

48
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,770
Ye Yan treats you so well.

49
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,450
Why do you always think the worst of her?

50
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,440
Xiao Chun Hua, I am cold.

51
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,420
You are still cold?

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,220
Eat some stuff and warm yourself up.

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,940
Open your mouth.

54
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,480
You really do eat mooncakes daily.

55
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,040
When I am eating mooncakes with Xiao Chun Hua,

56
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,970
I enjoy it.

57
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,730
I want to drink water.

58
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,960
Xiao Chun Hua,

59
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,320
you should not feed me this way.

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,290
Shangguan Qiu Yue, you are messing with me again.

61
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,680
I am so cold!

62
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,980
You are still pretending?

63
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,410
Aren't you not scared of the cold?

64
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,290
When I see you, I'm suddenly afraid of it.

65
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,310
It is not as if it is my fault.

66
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,700
I am severely injured so I cannot move.

67
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,560
Xiao Chun Hua, you must take care of all the work.

68
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,460
Come and hug me!

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,750
You sure are nice.

70
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,370
When you are healed, go and find someone else to hug.

71
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,880
I will only let you hug me.

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,070
Today, don't toss and turn!

73
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,800
Sleep.

74
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,440
I never realized that when one has someone hugging,

75
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,450
it would be so warm.

76
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,570
You are truly a little devil.

77
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,250
Keep in mind the law of 'first sight'.

78
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,840
The very first man you see will be your true love. 

79
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,900
Forget it! Don't forget the rule of 'first sight'.

80
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,970
Defying the natural order of things and changing destiny will not bring about a good result.

81
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,460
Older Brother, it is me.

82
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,480
Xiao Chun Hua,

83
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,370
so it is you.

84
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,510
I didn't scare you, did I?

85
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,320
Clearly identify Miss Feng.

86
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,920
Take care of her, quietly!

87
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,800
Yes.

88
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,810
Feng Caicai, since you want to get to the heart of this matter,

89
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,140
you cannot blame me for being heartless.

90
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,010
I escaped from here when I was 15.

91
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,090
Before that,

92
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,780
that woman would force me to train martial arts.

93
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,570
You told me that before

94
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,810
but I didn't think it was in such a horrible place.

95
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,640
It was hard during training.

96
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,780
I could only sleep for 2-3 hours each day.

97
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,010
I had no one to complain to.

98
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,140
I slept for one whole night,

99
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,110
Then I escaped.

100
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,950
It's because I wasn't familiar with the mechanisms and traps,

101
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,480
I fell into an ice ravine.

102
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,840
I was so severely injured at that time.

103
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,000
The blood and ice on my clothes froze over and became ice.

104
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,400
So when I was discovered that night,

105
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,630
she punished me severely.

106
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,460
She starved me for 3 days.

107
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,540
Then how did you survive?

108
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,500
The ice cave had a lot of ice.

109
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,630
I was hungry but couldn't die.

110
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,720
From when I was six,

111
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,580
she would carry out sneak attacks, day and night.

112
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,250
She did it to test my martial arts and reaction time.

113
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,280
If I was struck by her once,

114
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,980
I would not eat for a day.

115
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,820
Everyone has a desire to survive.

116
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,810
When deciding between sleeping and living,

117
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,300
I could only choose to hold on.

118
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,260
Did she ever take pity on you?

119
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,010
She would only be tender-hearted towards the ice silk that depended on each other for survival.

120
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,410
Afterwards, her responsibility in the ice gorge was to grow the ice silk.

121
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,370
When I was 12,

122
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,410
I set her ice silk on fire.

123
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,370
She almost killed me.

124
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,540
For five days,

125
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,140
she punished me by not letting me eat or drink anything.

126
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,180
Why would she do such a thing?

127
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,020
Why?

128
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,280
She wanted me to take revenge for her.

129
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,550
Revenge?

130
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,210
The person you mean is...

131
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,720
Shangguan Hui?

132
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,610
The one whom Xiao Bai's father, Xiao Yuan, fell in love with?  That Shangguan Hui?

133
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,970
Yes. That is indeed whom I am talking about.

134
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,920
But the stories I have heard about her do not match the person you are describing.

135
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,060
Back then, that person was naive

136
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,170
and generous.

137
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,990
Xiao Chun Hua,

138
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,310
people will change from their experiences.

139
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,650
I will not let you turn into her.

140
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,260
Well, what happened to Shangguan Hui afterwards?

141
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,590
After she was abandoned by Xiao Yuan,

142
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,850
she was imprisoned in the ice gorge for the latter half of her life.

143
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,950
In order to live,

144
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,910
she was with many men.

145
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,300
Some were killed by her.

146
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,180
Some were manipulated by her to do sinful deeds.

147
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,110
Some were killed by others.

148
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,720
That's so heartbreaking!

149
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,820
You don't hate her?

150
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,530
In her unfavorable situation,

151
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,980
She must have been at the end of her rope.

152
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,910
Xiao Chun Hua, you are truly so good at understanding others.

153
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,450
Because she is after all your...

154
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,620
Then did she ever tell you she was your mother?

155
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I found out when she died.

156
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,140
Every Mid-Autumn Festival, she would force me to make a vow to

157
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,350
kill Xiao Yuan.

158
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,090
But in the end,

159
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,640
she died before Xiao Yuan,

160
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,200
and Xiao Yuan

161
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,550
died at the hands of her old friend.

162
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,420
How regretable!

[Ba Xian House]

164
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,690
The Healer saved countless people during his life.

165
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,530
I didn't expect that in the end, he would actually die by another's hand.

166
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,390
The Healer was kindhearted

167
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,750
but he couldn't treat others' hearts.

168
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
Young Chief Master.

169
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,430
Were you all sent by Master Shi?

170
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,780
You dare to run rampant like this in broad daylight?

171
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,300
Young Chief Master.

172
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,740
Young Chief Master!

173
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,110
Young Chief Chief, could this be a clue?

174
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,890
They were all practicing the most common martial arts moves, I couldn't tell which sect they were from.

175
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,320
The person who trained them hid his identity well.

176
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,610
It must be something that we're familiar with.

177
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,790
They all came after me.

178
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,910
I fear that it is because they do not want us to uncover the truth.

179
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,890
These people must all be related to the Healer's death.

180
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,160
You... What were you doing?

181
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,290
I... just wanted to wake you up.

182
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,820
Let me tell you! If you do this again, I will leave you.

183
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,630
Xiao Chun Hua, please do not leave.

184
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,670
Your goal right now is to heal your wounds.

185
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,190
Do not worry about anything else.

186
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,180
I will listen to you.

[Ba Xian Residence]

188
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,730
If we just strut in like this,

189
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,190
will we be acting rashly and alerting the enemy?

190
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,240
Let do it this way! Let's pretend to be sick and get brought in.

191
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,760
Moreover, that way, we can cover up our heads and faces, so as not to attract anyone's attention.

192
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,700
That sounds like a good plan.

193
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,150
In that case, you pretend to be the patient and I will pretend to be your family member.

194
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,070
You can lean your head against my shoulder.

195
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:24,120
It would be best if you used both your arms to wrap yourself around my neck.

196

Qin Liufeng, stop your outrageous daydreaming!

197
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,150
Miss Leng, if I were the patient

198
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,320
can you carry me?

199
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,890
Let's just use our status to openly walk in.

200
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,640
We just need to get in.

201
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,750
Miss Leng, you mean we should go straight in to report our urgent news.

204
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,040
Little Yan, are you still stubbornly sticking to the wrong course?

205
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,620
Ever since I've been at Qianyue Cave,

206
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,620
you know very well how I've felt about you.

207
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,700
My love for you

208
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,420
is also not something you do not know about.

209
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,470
What is so good about Shangguan Qiu Yue that makes you so devoted to him?

210
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,660
Xiao Yan,

211
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,940
Shangguan Qiu Yue is already on the road to destitution.

212
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,330
His life is in my hands now.

213
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,830
I promise that you will be the master of Qianyue Cave.

214
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,840
We will take his blood and use it as a sacrifice to your honorable throne, is that bad?

215
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,050
What are you doing?

216
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,570
In a place like Qianyue Cave,

217
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,110
people's intentions are cunning and grand.

218
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,660
I dare not accept your kindness.

219
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,800
What do you plan to do?

220
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,760
If you just say it, I am willing to do it.

221
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,120
Xiao Yan,

222
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,440
in this lifetime, I vow to never harm you.

223
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,020
I will never reject you.

224
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,050
I'm allowing you this one-time kindness;

225
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,310
thus, this is Hua Gong powder, not arsenic.

226
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,060
Xiao Yan,

227
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,140
thank you.

228
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,830
Today, I am already fulfilled.

229
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,460
I will never regret.

230
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,180
Your martial arts has been disabled and neutralized.

231
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,160
You will never be a danger to the Master.

232

Do not let me see you anymore in the future.

233
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,720

234
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,080
We will definitely still meet in the future.

 - What will we do?

238
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,450
Do not be scared!

239
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,460
This isn't the silver needle for the puppets but the Healer's acupuncture needle.

240
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,130
This Li Yu has proven himself to be a disciple of the Healer.

241
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,030
We cannot take care of this ingenious needle issue by ordinary means.

242
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,890
What should we do? Don't tell me we have to go and beg?

243
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,010
Come to speak of it, I used to also be one of the Healer's disciples.

244
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,780
- Seriously? 
 - I swear!

245
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,520
I once learned the 'Crossing the Cave' acupuncture method from Master Bu.

246
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,130
Perhaps, I can use this 'Crossing the Cave' acupuncture method

247
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,410
to counter Li Yu's method of touching vital points.

248
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:46,610
When the moment comes, maybe I can even take care of your acupressure.

249
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,910
How certain are you?

250
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,670
About 30-40%, for sure.

251
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,700
But at that time, after I showed Master Bu my 'Crossing the Cave' acupuncture method,

252
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,420
- He told me to no longer call him Master. 
 - What?

253
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,870
Qin Liufeng, don't mess with me!

254
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,530
Miss Leng, this situation is critical.

255
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,690
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,050
How dare you? I...

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,700
I can move!

258
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,320
Although I was only 30-40% certain,

259
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,400
on your body, it was executed 100% well.

260
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,460
This was just a coincidence.

261
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,680
Well perhaps, you were too scared,

262
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,020
so your vital qi is surging and it caused your acupressure to open up.

263
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,770
Who said I am scared. Say it again—

264
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,300

00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,520
He is dead?

271
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,090
Then can we come out now?

272
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,900
Although the rebellion has been quelled at this moment,

273
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,690
the former subordinates of Chuanqi Valley have not been fully investigated yet.

274
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,280
I don't know if there are still disciples harboring traitorous intentions.

275
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,960
So I must ask you to continue to stay at the ice cave to take care of the Young Lord

276
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,390
until he completely recovers.

277
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,070
It must be so nice to have a meal with soup.

Come and have some.

00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,030
I will treat you better as payment.

281
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:18,140
I didn't expect that you would ever be so cute and lovely.

282
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,820
Oh, that's right! Older Sister Ye Yan said she has basically taken care of the rebellion outside.

283
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,910
When your wound is better, you can leave.

284
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:31,480
However, my wound is not better.

- I've been waiting here for you. 
 - Speak!

289
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,240
Who instructed you to come here? Was it Master Shi?

290
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,940
- Young Master, I think there's been a misunderstanding between us. 
 - A misunderstanding?

291
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,050
In that case, why did your run when you saw us?

292
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,080
I was spotted yesterday by you two, and then we ran into each other again today.

293
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,130
I was nervous that I was getting into some trouble, so I ran.

294
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,310
But after reconsidering, I thought I should explain myself clearly.

Can you believe his words?

296
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,470
Of course!

297

I am speaking the truth.

298
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,590
That's the reason why I stopped here to meet with you guys to talk out any misunderstandings.

299
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,580
The Young Chief Master has already issued his order to thoroughly investigate the matter of the Longevity Fruit.

300
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,600
I am a disciple of the Healer.

301
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,690
If I know that the Longevity Fruit is related to the silver needles for the puppets,

302
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,300
I must certainly obey his orders.

303
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,260
The trail has gone cold again.

00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,670
I am cold.

307
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,640
There is a fire pit over there. Go and use it.

308
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,490
That's the right way.

309
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,960
You! What are you doing?

310
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,350
What do you do? Are you crazy?

311
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,690
Xiao Chun Hua, my hand is burnt.

312
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,860
What do you want?

313
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,060
I'm cold.

314
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:31,850
You're cold? You're cold, so you roasted your hand on the fire pan?

315
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,760
Xiao Chun Hua, you're much warmer than the fire pan.

316
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,260
Are you able to be a bit more serious?

317
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,550
However, in the beginning, you liked me first.

318
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:14,440
- I'm not Hua Xiaolei! Don't take me for her. 
 - Yes.

319
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,770
You're not Hua Xiaolei.

320
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,050
Hua Xiaolei knew me from the very beginning.

321
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,080
She even wanted to run away with me.

322
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,930
However, once she saw me kill someone,

323
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,700
she insisted on announcing my crime to the world.

324
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,840
But there was nothing wrong with what she did.

325
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,690
You aren't like that.

326
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,290
You simply see me as your older brother, just like a little fool.

327
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,460
The first time you saw me,

328
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,150
you were at a loss and confused.

329
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,760
You are a little fool.

330
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,040
You're not her.

331
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,180
I'll be good to you.

332
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,810
These feathers are...

333
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,800
They have nothing to do with the Healer's death.

334
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
There's no need to be concerned about it.

335
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,540
From this scene,

336
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,870
it seems that the offender could quite possibly be an acquaintance.

337
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,330
There's practically no trace left of the fight.

338
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,220
Precisely! After the Healer died,

339
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,380
Brother Qin and I thought the same.

340
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,140
The Healer's death was not caused by one single knife wound.

341
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,490
A palm caused the arteries and veins in his heart to burst.

342
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,670
I still don't know who in the world would be able to

343
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,150
kill him so easily this way.

344
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:21,180
However, we couldn't find the murderer, so the matter was left unsettled.

345
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,320
That day, Miss Chun Hua had fallen into a coma.

346
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,940
Were there simply no eyewitnesses?

347
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,310
He identified Miss Chun Hua before he died.

348
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,680
It certainly wasn't Miss Chun Hua.

349
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,000
Correct!

350
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,650
Miss Chun Hua doesn't know the slightest bit of martial arts.

351
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,420
Hold on!

352
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,420
Let me think!

353
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,650
He snuck into the Ba Xian Residence to search for the Longevity Fruit but was unsuccessful.

354
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,860
He was nervous the situation would be revealed so he use his ruthless palm on the Healer.

355
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,420
Miss Feng,

356
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,640
from here on out, perhaps this case will simply be an unsolved mystery.

 ''The Unfinished Moment'' - Singer: Li Hongyi 

359
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:57,790
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

360
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,660
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

361
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,000
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking it's eye  ♫

362
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,340
♫  Seeing through the fickleness of love  ♫

363
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,550
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast-beating heart  ♫

364
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:18,490
♫  It's such a pity for not stepping forward  ♫

365
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,840
♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

366
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:29,910
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

367
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,200
♫  Even admiring the freshness and beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

368
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,440
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

369
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,250
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

370
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,660
♫  It's hard to walk on, there's even no one to argue with  ♫

371
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,800
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

372
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,180
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

373
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:00,120
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

374
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:07,670
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

375
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,140
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

390
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:44,560
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

391
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:02,160
♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of the spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

392
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,290
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

393
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,120
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

394
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:14,330
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

395
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:18,740
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

396
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,010
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

397
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:26,920
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

398
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:34,180
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
