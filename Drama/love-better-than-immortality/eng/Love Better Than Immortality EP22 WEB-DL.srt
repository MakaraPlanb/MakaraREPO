31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,690
But the more you're impatient, the more mistakes you'll make. 

32
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,650
As long as you stay in Qianyue Cave, I'll do everything you want. 

33
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,630
Then I want you to die. Can you?

34
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,180
Otherwise, if you let me go back to see Xiao Bai, I will give you the Longevity fruit.

35
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,190
This fake Longevity fruit was used to coax those old men. Will you still lie to me?

36
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,230
I don't remember what happened to you before, so don't sow discord.

37
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,710
The secret letter and token have been delivered. When the time is right, I'll rescue Chun Hua.

38
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,350
Xiao Bai, you said you would come save me. Don't lie to me.

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,030
Your mind is full of worries, you won't achieve victory.

42
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,620
It has been so many days.

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,280
Have you any news from Antelope?

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,390
It's really strange.

45
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,360
I haven't any news.

46
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,390
Young Master,

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,400
Antelope sent message that Shangguan Qiu Yue has noticed so he aborted the mission.

48
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,910
She can't get out.

49
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,600
This won't do! I'm going to save her.

50
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,700
A treasure hunt during the meal.

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,830
Xiao Chun Hua had fun.

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,060
Yes.

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,450
Master.

54
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,800
The numerous sects that came to Qianyue Cave have been defeated.

55
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,310
They returned without success but

56
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,090
many people are still squatting around Qianyue Cave day and night.

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,170
Qianyue Cave hasn't been so bustling for a long time.

58
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,540
What can make all factions glare like a tiger eyeing its prey?

59
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,260
I'm sure it's not for Xiao Chun Hua.

60
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,490
Master, Miss Chun Hua is hiding in Qianyue Cave,

61
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,870
triggering a direct conflict between Fengming Manor and Qianyue Cave.

62
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,130
- This seems to be bad for Qianyue Cave. 
 - Talkative!

63
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,840
The Master will have plans for it. Leave!

64
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,360
What plans do I have? Tell me!

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,080
- I don't dare speculate about Master's will. 
 - Say it!

66
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,030
Chuanqi Gorge, Fengming Manor, and Qianyue Cave

67
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,920
are a triad standing in conflict for so long.

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,260
At the Longevity fruit auction, the righteous path suffered a lot.

69
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,320
Fengming Manor and Chuanqi Gorge were unscathed.

70
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,080
Miss Chun Hua is a good chess piece that can trigger a change.

71
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,240
I don't dare speculate about Master's arrangements.

72
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,260
You can understand this much.

73
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,480
It might not be a bad thing.

74
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,270
But Xiao Chun Hua is not a chess piece.

75
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,240
She is my little sister.

76
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,890
In talking about this...

77
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,540
The young chief's wife hasn't heard from him for so long.

78
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,330
Won't Fengming Manor make their move anymore?

79
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,880
Let's search separately.

80
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,400
Why are we here again?

81
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,040
I don't know.

82
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,380
This place seems to be very evil.

83
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,050
Let's search again!

84
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,290
Xiao Bai, Qianyue Cave is complex.

85
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,920
We cannot enter without any guidance.

86
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,710
I know you are upset right now, but this time

87
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,000
you must be calm (lit. stabilize your heart).

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,090
Don't get confused!

89
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,590
Last time, I was obviously brought in here but this time, I can't find the entrance at all!

90
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,500
Why don't we go back to Fengming Manor to wait for some more news?

91
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,450
Let's go!

92
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,450
Xiao Chun Hua.

93
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,870
Xiao Chun Hua gets nervous when she sees me. Why is that?

94
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,320
Isn't it because you are bored,

95
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,890
that's why you think of me?

96
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,040
I can say the same.

97
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,770
Xiao Chun Hua is my antidote.

98
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,820
As long as I see you

99
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,190
and don't worry that you'll feel bored, I won't be bored.

100
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,760
Come! Accompany me to  play chess.

101
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,210
I can't play chess.

102
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,010
Go is only black and white (Go: A strategic game like chess).

103
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,020
There are clear rules so why can't you play?

104
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,380
Xiao Chun Hua, watch carefully!

105
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,380
This black chess piece is Big Brother.

106
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,120
And this white chess piece

107
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,970
is Xiao Chun Hua.

108
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,920
 This black and white chess piece is like Shangguan Yue and Xiaolei.

109
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,250
 Only these two are living together as if they are in a love relationship. 

110
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,120
The black chess piece

111
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,760
racks his brains in order to be with the white piece.

112
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:16,400
I thought everything would be foolproof if I caught the white piece.

113
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,150
However, the black piece finally realized

114
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,320
that it and the white piece were not the same kind of people.

115
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,210
The harder the black piece tried,

116
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,260
the more the white piece suffered.

117
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,520
Then...

118
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,870
has the black piece figured out what it should do?

119
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,500
Big Brother don't know, either.

120
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,670
[Meet in front of the lotus pond 5-7 a.m. and approach from the rear.]

121
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,970
Have you investigated?

122
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,450
Yes. This morning, Miss Chun Hua's food was poisoned.

123
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,890
I have brought the servant who served the food.

124
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,160
How would you like to handle her, Master?

125
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,640
What happened?

126
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,640
I-I-I only took the food from the kitchen and brought it to Miss Chun Hua.

127
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,220
I really didn't know!

128
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,960
I'm afraid it wasn't her.

129
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,320
Then does the problem lie with the kitchen?

130
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,390
They're fully aware you would speak to them about this matter during the investigate.

131
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,040
They shouldn't be very daringly courageous.

132
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,360
Normally, very few people go in and out of the kitchen but it still happens.

133
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,740
- Therefore— 
 - Look!

134
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,190
Anyone can enter our kitchen so why should we keep her alive?

135
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,890
- Kill her! 
 - I understand.

136
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,290
 [Qianyue Cave] 

137
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,330
- Xiao Bai! 
 - Miss Chun Hua, are you hurt?

138
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,120
I'm fine.

139
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,700
Xiao Chun Hua.

140
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,970
Once you have your husband, you forget about me. You are really heartless!

141
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,390
I don't want to be with you.

142
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,160
Wait!

143
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,620
The Devil died.

144
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,660
Shouldn't I be happy?

145
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,560
Why do I feel so sad?

146
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,130
Chun Hua, your husband is Xiao Bai.

147
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,320
Miss Chun Hua,

148
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,350
where are you going?

149
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,850
Y-You mind your own business!

150
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,010
Then why don't I take you to see the Master?

151
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,930
No need! Moreover, he's very busy anyway.

152
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,630
Well then, please go ahead!

153
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,770
Thanks a lot!

154
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,890
Run! The farther you run,

155
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,560
the more chaotic Shangguan Qiu Yue's heart will be.

156
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,570
Miss Chun Hua.

157
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,350
You are...

158
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,080
Antelope.

159
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,580
Did Xiao Bai tell you to come?

160
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,560
But Xiao Bai said the secret signal would be a white chess piece.

161
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,860
Why is it a black chess piece?

162
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,780
Miss Chun Hua,

163
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,300
I'm sorry!

164
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,960
Using a flute to deliver information, that's so brilliant!

165
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,820
Now, if I were to ask you where your accomplices are,

166
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,420
I know you certainly will not tell me.

167
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,690
Xiao Chun Hua, how should I deal with him?

168
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,370
My sister is a good person so she doesn't kill others.

169
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,390
The Antelope's horns are hung so no trace is left for them to find.

170
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,980
They must have deployed spies to Qianyue Cave.

171
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,140
I looked for so long and wasn't able to find them.

172
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,450
They hid extremely well.

173
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,650
You should thank me, shouldn't you?

174
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,600
Xiao Chun Hua, Xiao Bai wants to kill you.

175
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,490
And I saved you.

176
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,230
- So you intentionally switched out my food. 
 - Or you'd be poisoned to death.

177
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,740
So he either poisoned my food

178
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,200
or sent someone to kill me.

179
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,660
Xiao Bai, do you really want to kill me that much?

180
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,000
Hence,

181
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,320
Xiao Chun Hua, you should stay in Qianyue Cave with me.

182
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,300
You're no better than him, either.

183
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,960
No way! I must return to Fengming Mountain Manor to ask for a clear answer.

184
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,530
Slow down!

185
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,930
Look!

186
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,340
Many honored guests have been attracted to Qianyue Cave all because of you. 
 [Take Chun Hua and the Longivity fruit from the Qianyue Cave.]

187
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,960
Do they care about the Longevity fruit that much?

188
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,750
I want to clear things up with him!

189
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,420
Xiao Chun Hua can surely look death in the face,

190
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,170
but I can't sit idly by and watch.

191
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,910
Cave Master.

192
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,750
Is Xiao Chun Hua all settled in?

193
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,700
She's already sleeping.

194
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,200
Bring me a piece of ice silk.

195
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,800
Yes.

196
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,150
Little Sister,

197
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,010
now I'll give you your freedom,

198
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,390
also protect you, and make sure you're cared for.

199
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,060
Young Chief, are you looking for me?

200
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,600
- Father. 
 - Ning'er.

201
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,480
This jade pendant, have you ever seen it before?

202
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,620
Young Chief, how did you get your hands on this jade pendant?

203
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,270
Then did

204
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,400
the Antelope come to Fengming Mountain Manor?

205
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,540
Sure enough!

206
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,470
Antelope indeed came to Fengming Mountain Manor,

207
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,290
but he was already dead.

208
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,290
No wonder the last sound of the flute was so strange.

209
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,630
It seems Qianyue Cave discovered the Antelope's identity,

210
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,260
and used this same method to humiliate Fengming Mountain Manor.

211
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,200
Since Antelope's identity was already discovered,

212
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,840
Shangguan Qiu Yue certainly won't let Miss Chun Hua go.

213
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,520
Hold on! Don't you all think this situation is strange?

214
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,800
In my opinion, if Shangguan Qiu Yue really wanted to kill Miss Chun Hua,

215
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,210
then Antelope wouldn't be the only corpse found last night.

216
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,890
I'm afraid Shangguan Qiu Yue will

217
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,600
torture and humiliate Chun Hua first.

218
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,990
Miss Chun Hua was kidnapped by Shangguan Qiu Yue from the Young Chief's wedding.

219
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,150
Perhaps, those two...

220
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,770
Or maybe he alternates between intimidation and bribery.

221
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,360
Antelope was well-trained.

222
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,220
He lay low in Qianyue Cave for many years.

223
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,460
Even if this rescue plan wasn't completely safe,

224
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,850
Antelope surely wouldn't dare reveal himself before rescuing Miss Chun Hua.

225
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:31,690
Unless... Miss Chun Hua intentionally exposed him.

226
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,610
Find her first!

227
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,620
I want to hear her tell me herself,

228
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,440
then I'll believe it's true.

229
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,380
It seems I spoke out of turn.

230
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,500
I simply hope that Young Chief is able to see the greater picture

231
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,760
and not playing into Shangguan's hands.

232
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,130
Xiao Bai!

233
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,520
Miss Chun Hua, you're awake.

234
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,300
Eat something.

235
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,500
Where is Shangguan Qiu Yue?

236
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,890
What does he want?

237
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,950
Master granted you freedom to roam within secure limits.

238
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,070
Freedom?

239
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,770
The ice silk will ensure that you're safe and secure in Qianyue Cave.

240
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,210
You won't be kidnapped by outsiders.

241
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,470
Miss Chun Hua, be careful!

242
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,050
Freedom?

243
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,760
Shangguan Qiu Yue, you are really out of your mind!

244
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,930
You have people all around me and they can only do as you say.

245
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,170
Do you call this "freedom?"

246
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,920
A powerful and unconstrained style.

247
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:14,170
You're stupid, just taking something that no one saw before

248
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,000
and passing it off as the Longevity fruit.

249
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,300
Daring to love and hate.

250
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Husband!

251
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,720
Even daring to give up.

252
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,980
 I'm willing to give up my immortality!

253
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,210
What on earth have you experienced?

254
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,790
Do you dare treat me like a bird in a cage and call it freedom?

255
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,540
Do you really think I can't run away?

256
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,810
Be a good girl, Xiao Chun Hua!

257
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,110
Be good?

258
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,830
Do you want to make everyone obey just like your puppets?

259
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,380
Don't be angry! Treating the wound is critical.

260
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,390
You can go anywhere in Qianyue Cave.

261
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,520
That's much better than my childhood.

262
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,030
Do you want to tell me a story again?

263
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:34,060
When I was a child, I was confined to an ice-cold place.

264
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,530
It was only me in there.

265
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:41,780
Fortunately, before that person left, she left me a collection of Xin Fa rhymes.

266
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,550
I read it to myself every day.

267
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,540
Otherwise, I wouldn't even know how to talk.

268
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,210
You also had such a pitiful time in your life?

269
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,100
When I grew up and left, I found that this world is quite large.

270
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,450
There are so many people.

271
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,790
But what's the point of having so many people?

272
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,210
Everyone is still afraid of you.

273
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:16,300
If I was a good person like you, they would all kill me.

274
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,260
Well, isn't that because all you know is killing?

275
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,630
I understand danger and safety better than you do.

276
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,260
Xiao Chun Hua, don't worry!

277
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,700
I won't hurt you.

278
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,510
However, I'm not Hua Xiaolei.

279
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,930
I'm also not a member of the Qianyue Sect.

280
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,990
You repeatedly take advantage of me and now you imprison me.

281
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,100
To keep me safe?

282
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,410
Tell me!

283
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,730
How can I trust you?

284
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,040
Then what do you want?

285
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,200
I want to go and see Xiao Bai.

286
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,040
Do you really think that staying with Xiao Bai is safer than with me?

287
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,270
Shangguan Qiu Yue also sent this.

288
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,730
The fake Longevity fruit? Has he no interest in it?

289
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,840
Then did Miss Chun Hua tell him

290
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,610
about the fake Longevity fruit?

291
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,700
Miss Chun Hua is in a dangerous situation.

292
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,590
It's understandable to make this kind of choice.

293
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,050
Something is not right! Regarding the matter of the Longevity fruit,

294
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,180
I think perhaps the Qianyue Sect understands much more than us.

295
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,220
News of the Longevity fruit was spread after the Healer's death.

296
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,240
Extreme casualties were suffered at the auction by several martial arts sects.

297
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,380
Even the Chuanqi Sect was able to escape only by sheer luck.

298
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,040
We wanted to destroy the Longevity fruit at the wedding ceremony.

299
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,020
But contrary to the expectation, Shangguan Qiu Yue kidnapped only Miss Chun Hua.

300
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:19,030
In all these incidents, only Qianyue Sect remained unscathed, playing it safe as an outsider.

301
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,100
Shangguan Qiu Yue is so cunning.

302
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,470
So why did the Qianyue Sect oppose Fengming Mountain Manor

303
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,520
this time?

304
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,260
Well, I fear it's a matter of inability to control one's emotions.

305
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,150
We must find Miss Chun Hua as soon as possible to fully investigate

306
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,470
to see what on earth is going on.

307
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,360
I'll comb your hair.

308
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,770
If others see the Master of Qianyue Cave combing my hair for me, they'll laugh at me.

309
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,520
I'll kill anyone who dares laugh at you.

310
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,330
Then why don't you just kill me?

311
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,630
Is there still something for you to take advantage of me?

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:32,660
♫  It's hard to walk on. There's even no one to argue with  ♫

342
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,840
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

343
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,080
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

344
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,070
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

345
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:52,370
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

346
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:09,890
♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

347
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,150
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

348
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,850
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

349
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:21,970
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

350
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:26,480
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

351
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,890
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

352
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,630
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

353
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:42,140
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
