[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,650
 Xiao Chun Hua, it seems you aren't as valuable as the Fengming Saber. 

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,350
 Do you really believe there's someone who will give up everything for love? 

33
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,680
 I didn't think Xiao Bai would actually put the auction aside 

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,840
to come save you. 

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,510
Shangguan Qiu Yue, release Miss Chun Hua. The saber… 

36
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,730
I'll give it to you... Rest assured. I won't lose you or the saber. 

37
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,040
 The person who can get out of this darkness alive 

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,230
will attain this human treasure, 

39
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,020
the Longevity fruit. 

40
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,400

This is the secret signal that Qin Liufeng usually uses.

44
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,350
Indeed, they have gone in.

45
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,800
Master Shi, I am here with a sincere heart,

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,330
but why didn't you abide by your promise?

47
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,440
I have even offered my own daughter.

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,990
Is that still not enough to earn your trust?

49
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,270
You were the one who first contacted me in the beginning.

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,170
You earnestly promised to definitely reward me handsomely.

51
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,530
Currently, I have nothing at all.

52
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,380
I will always inform the righteous sects of all you have done.

53
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,750
We can perish together.

54
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,970
I will make you, Master Shi,

55
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,550
lose your reputation.

56
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,930
Chun Hua, are you sure this can work?

57
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,540
There is no building that can stand against a strong assault.

58
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,380
All right then! The Xiao Xiao Fengming Saber’s last move is extremely dangerous.

59
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,160
Wait outside for me!

60
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,850
All right.

61
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,740
The sound of the Fengming Saber’s last technique

62
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,630
is more touching than the sound of heartbeats it emits.

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,100
Let's go in quickly.

64
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,050
Chief Leng, you are too impatient.

65
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,110
Here is five million silver.

66
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,350
It is your reward.

67
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,800
Master Shi, am I that greedy for money?

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,420
I want only one reward.

69
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,510
Longevity fruit?

70
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,780
It will depend whether you have the fortune to get it.

71
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,450
Forget it! I'd rather get it myself than beg others.

72
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,350
It turns out that it's not a real body.

73
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,370
Longevity, Longevity! You drive a person desperately to succeed.

74
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,870
Father!

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,450
Ning’er.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,310
I feared I would never see you again.

77
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,860
It is not what I am looking for.

78
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,950
Perhaps, it's something you all might like.

79
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,390
- What’s wrong? 
 - Miss Feng.

80
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,790
Father.

81
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,970
How did this happen?

82
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,550
Who killed my father?

83
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,640
Father!

84
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,860
It is he.

85
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,770
Just as you expected,

86
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,390
those people all fell for the trap.

87
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,920
Good!

88
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,810
My Lord, aren't you worried for Miss Chun Hua’s safety?

89
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,020
Why should I worry about her?

90
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,650
There is the reputable Hero Xiao by her side.

91
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,210
Qianyue Cave always had its own home-brewed ice wine.

92
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,390
Why did you suddenly ask me

93
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,440
to buy this yellow wine from Bishui City?

94
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,920
You are a little talkative today.

95
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,820
I spoke out of turn.

96
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,810
I was tired of the taste of ice wine,

97
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,460
and wanted a taste of one from the human world.

98
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,680
Can't I do that?

99
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,230
It is a such pity though.

100
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,490
This yellow wine mixed taste is so confusing.

101
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,190
It is very different

102
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,100
from what I had expected.

103
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,540
Do you all seriously believe that old man?

104
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,090
Then should we believe a devil like you, instead?

105
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,720
I, Fu Lou, have a clear conscience.

106
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,910
I don't need to justify myself to you worthless people.

107
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,690
Wait! Let us examine Chief Feng first.

108
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,960
Don't come over!

109
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,080
My father is poisoned and this poison can spread.

110
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,700
- Miss Caicai. 
 - Wait!

111
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,470
Everyone, hurry to seal your acupuncture points, lest the poison enter your bodies and spread.

Let's all eat something to stay healthy.

114
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,920
Miss Feng still needs us to take care of her.

115
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,470
Yes.

116
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,180
At this point, we have no choice but to find some other way.

117
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,600
Here, have some! Quickly.

118
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,540
What are you doing here?

119
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,430
The same as you, I can't sleep.

120
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,930
Even now, I can still vaguely remember

121
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,680
Chief Suifeng's entire body covered in blood,

122
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,810
and his appearance when he walked out from that curtain.

123
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,030
He was so close to my father.

124
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,090
I still remember when I was young,

125
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,390
he would often carry me on his shoulders.

126
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,420
But at that time,

127
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,890
why didn't he recognize me?

128
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,720
Maybe,

129
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,330
he was overtaken by the demons in his heart.

130
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,050
The sky is pitch black,

131
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,920
like the curtain we saw that day.

132
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,050
It pinned down everyone there,

133
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,700
and made them kill each other.

134
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,250
That being said,

135
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,920
the sun will eventually rise again.

136
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,250
It's because after all, the night will end.

137
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,350
Those chiefs had noble character and high prestige.

138
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,890
I didn't expect they could be so greedy.

139
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,790
This night will pass,

140
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,990
and the sun will still rise.

141
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,670
But no one will forget

142
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,460
this covetous slaughter.

143
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,970
I apologize if you were frightened today.

144
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,670
I initially thought the Xiao Xiao Fengming Saber was meant to protect

145
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,510
the people and those of the pugilist world.

146
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,760
However, if greed is able to control everything,

147
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,940
then what is my protection worth?

148
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,260
Xiao Bai,

149
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,440
do you still remember old Chief Xiao's guidance for you before he died?

150
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,810
Father?

151
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:47,610
His whole life, in order to keep the martial arts circle stable,

152
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,940
despite suffering from a strange poison, old Chief Xiao didn't forget his original goal.

153
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,110
He knew it was no use, but kept doing it.

154
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,270
That is a hero.

155
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,380
Is that right?

156
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,290
Therefore, Xiao Bai,

157
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,700
you cannot give up hope.

158
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,770
You must trust that your protection is worth something.

159
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,310
Chun Hua,

160
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,970
thank you.

161
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,740
Were you terrified?

162
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,680
Xiao Chun Hua, don't be afraid!

163
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,490
Older Brother is here.

164
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,840
I'll write a letter to Physician Bu at the Baxian Manor right now.

165
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,540
We must ask him to help with Miss Feng's poison now.

166
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,800
- Are you talking about the Healer's younger brother? 
 - Precisely.

167
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,620
Did the Healer even have a younger brother?

168
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,630
All right! Everyone, pack your things and prepare to leave.

169
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,620
- Physician Bu, what do you think? 
 - What kind is Miss Feng's poison?

170
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,240
I heard somewhat about this poison.

171
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,830
It's called "Dandelion."

172
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,970
Dandelion?

173
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,940
When the dandelion blooms, it gets loose and is dispersed by the wind to spread everywhere.

174
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,980
It's extremely contagious so it's called "Dandelion."

175
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,300
Well, since you know the name, it won't be difficult to cure her, will it?

176
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,730
"Dandelion" was lost for many generations.

177
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,550
I only found out today that this poison still exists.

178
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,040
You are the Healer's younger brother.

179
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,000
You must surely know a way an ordinary person wouldn't.

180
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,590
I fear I'm unable to treat this poison.

181
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,820
You must find the one who poisoned her.

182
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,470
Fu Lou?

183
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,120
Who?

184
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,820
Chief of the Chuanqi Sect, Fu Lou?

185
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,640
He was never adept at making poisons.

186
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,460
My father said that it's Fu Lou who killed Uncle Feng.

187
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,440
Is the poisoner someone else?

188
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,310
Could it be him?

189
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,280
My medicine can only ensure that Miss Feng will survive a week.

190
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,380
If we can't find the cure within seven days,

191
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,470
I'm afraid she will be in grave danger.

192
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,900
Healer, is there really no other option?

193
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,780
I am powerless so I'll take my leave now.

194
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,270
He's truly a mediocre, lazy person.

195
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:48,780
It's better if I find Fu Lou myself to demand justice from him.

196
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,710
If only I had come back earlier,

197
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,470
this wouldn't have happened.

198
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,380
- Miss Leng, calm down first— 
 - Don't come over here!

199
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,580
If you take one step forward, I will end myself right here.

200
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,650
Fine, fine! I won't go over there. Put down the flute first!

201
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,890
I won't go over there. Don't be impulsive!

202
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,960
Fu Lou, you're a shameless coward.

203
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,200
You killed Uncle Feng and even poisoned Miss Feng.

204
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,530
If I knew this, then we should have joined hands to kill you in that hidden chamber.

205
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,670
Fu Lou, don't you really care about

206
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,260
your master's wife whom you stole?

207
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,170
Wait! I'll find a chance to kill her.

208
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,850
So you'll also know the deep pain of losing a loved one.

209
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,520
- Are you all right? 
 - Fu Lou!

210
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,570
You can curse me all you want but not Sisi.

211
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,080
I tell you, it's life or medicine.

212
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,280
You must give up one today.

213
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,610
Are you okay?

214
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,740
I won't kill you guys.

215
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,250
You little b*stards

216
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,620
don't know a thing about treacherous people.

217
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,220
Get some good experience.

218
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,200
Get a taste for it,

219
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,800
then you will know

220
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,590
what real torture is.

221
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,260
Chief Feng's remains were already returned to his hometown,

222
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,290
awaiting burial.

223
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,440
Chief Leng can't bear this type of blow,

224
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,750
so he has also gone home to recuperate.

225
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,540
But at the moment,

226
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,820
we must think of a way to treat and cure Miss Feng.

227
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,640
Bishui City

228
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,690
was a nightmare.

229
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,440
Xiao Bai,

230
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,520
you're a hero shouldering burdens of morality and justice.

231
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,550
Your heart cares for people and the martial arts circle.

232
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,450
Even if you make a few mistakes sometimes,

233
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,890
you must not blame yourself.

234
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,890
No one can predict a calamity.

235
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,990
It's raining really hard.

236
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,560
I don't know if Brother Qin

237
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,070
was able to stop Miss Leng or not.

238
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,490
How Young Master Qin's heart is towards Miss Leng,

239
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,670
even high-grade steel would be melted.

240
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,730
You just have to trust him.

241
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,840
Fortunately, it's just a cold.

242
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,250
How is Miss Feng?

243
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,520
I gave up immortality to find true love.

244
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,930
At first, it was such a dreamy thing.

245
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,060
Love is real.

246
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,110
However, anxiety and fear are also real.

247
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,760
Every person is vivid and lifelike.

248
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,380
They're all real.

249
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,390
No, I can't be concerned with only being in love.

250
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,420
I must find Shangguan Qiu Yue to get the antidote.

251
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:12,380
However, how can I find Shangguan Qiu Yue?

252
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,970
When will the Chun Hua and Qiu Yue end?

253
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,750
I can't untie it!

254
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,500
When will the Chun Hua and Qiu Yue end?

255
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,530
Why didn't he come yet?

256
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,180
Older Brother Qian Yue!

257
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,480
You're here.

258
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,660
Xiao Chun Hua, this gesture is quite unique.

259
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,450
Quickly untie me!

260
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,210
My hands are going to break off soon.

261
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,660
So doesn't Xiao Bai care about you?

262
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,220
Xiao...

263
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,490
Xiao Bai is just a fool.

264
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,670
Because he was late to the auction, after our return, he keeps blaming himself.

265
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,690
I truly think he cannot protect me.

266
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,530
At any rate, I don't want to speak to him again.

267
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,260
Fine! Brother will untie you now.

268
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,120
Wait!

269
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,270
Xiao Bai, forgive me!

270
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,320
This time, I really had no alternative.

271
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,810
This rope actually seems like it's alive.

272
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,640
It's stronger than my Affectionate White Silk.

273
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,790
Who is so cruel?

274
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,990
Even I cannot untie it.

275
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,680
Older Brother, this... behind.

276
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,050
Behind, there's a bow knot that with one pull, you'll untie it. Very simple!

277
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,280
Xiao Chun Hua, you can't see anything.

278
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,830
How do you know it's so simple?

279
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,970
Older Brother Qiu Yue,

280
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,910
I wholeheartedly want to return to Qianyue Cave with you.

281
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,390
Since you really want to return to Qianyue Cave,

282
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,750
you must not regret it.

283
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,170
All right.

284
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,140
[Thousand Moon Pavilion]

285
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,780
Qianyue Cave is indeed very cold.

286
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,760
Are you awake?

287
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,800
It seems Little Sister slept well last night.

288
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,350
I woke up because I'm freezing.

289
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,120
If there's a hot spring with bubbles, I'll be fine.

290
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,530
Well, Fengming Mountain Manor has a hot spring so why are you here?

291
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,200
I'd better send you back to Xiao Bai.

292
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,070
No, no, no. I won't go!

293
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,090
I'm... happiest when I'm with you.

294
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,730
And also...

295
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,430
Also?

296
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:05,470
Also, do you know that Feng Caicai is poisoned?

297
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,430
I heard that the poison is contagious.

298
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,170
Well, then you should quickly go to save her.

299
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,960
If I get infected, then what do I do?

300
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,520
Qianyue Cave also has countless poisons.

301
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,450
Are you not afraid of getting poisoned?

302
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,140
Older Brother won't let me be poisoned, will you?

303
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,620
- You really won't leave? 
 - No, I won't leave.

304
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,530
Didn't I already tell you? I'm the happiest when I'm with you.

305
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,790
And I'm not cold in the slightest.

306
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,740
You're lying!

307
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,930
You're still lying that you're not cold.

308
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,620
Is this a little better?

309
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,350
Leaning on you feels even colder.

310
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,670
Are you still cold?

311
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,140
Since you can use your martial arts to warm yourself,

312
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,680
why are you still so cold?

313
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,380
It's because I'm only like this with you, Xiao Chun Hua.

00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,810
♫  The loneliness I’m fated to have is difficult to put into words  ♫

347
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:38,880
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

348
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,740
♫  Trying my best to pick up all the shattered fragments of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

349
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,860
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

350
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,610
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

351
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:09,130
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

352
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,380
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

353
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,640
♫  I left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

354
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,470
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

355
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:28,510
♫  Yet how can you still not see it?  ♫
