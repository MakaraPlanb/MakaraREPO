[Love Better Than Immortality]

31
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,690
 Qianyue Sect kills the innocent and endangers the pugilist world. 

32
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,870
 This demon sect is so vicious. 

33
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,790
I need to draw a clear distinction with them.

34
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,470
Xiao Chun Hua doesn't remember that she is my sister.

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,480
Cave Master, why did you pretend to be her older brother?

36
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,020
Since you have lost your memories, then let us start over again.

37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,540
I dote on you so much, shouldn't you help me?

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,300
Brother, why do you always make it difficult for them?

39
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,630
We are the opponents with the upright track.

40
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,960
Since Older Brother really needs the Xin Fa,

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,020
I will go back to the Fengming Manor to get it.

42
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,720
We, Fengming Mountain Manor, will definitely stop Qianyue Sect's crime.

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,660
[Episode 3]

44
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,120
Senior, you know me too well.

45
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,300
This time, I need you to do me a favor.

46
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,680
This time, is it the filial debt?

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,970
Or is it the affair debt?

48
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,020
Both kinds of debt.

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,140
My dad believes that family comes first and career comes the second.

50
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,070
So he is pushing me to get married.

51
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,720
You also know that I don't have a place for anyone in my heart.

52
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,340
Avoidance is just a temporary measure.

53
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,900
Spring flowers bloom in Fengming Manor.

54
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,560
Beautiful scenery is pleasant to the eyes.

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,790
Xiao family is the heavenly place to be free from sorrows.

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,970
Brother Qin, you can directly say it if you have anything.

57
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,060
Senior Xiao, when there is a beautiful girl around you,

58
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,710
why do you have such a long face?

59
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,450
The girl you saw just now,

60
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,190
is indeed the one I brought back from Baxian residence.

61
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,610
She doesn't know kungfu at all,

62
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,770
but she was there when the healer was killed and

63
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,710
she also lost her memory.

64
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,980
Her identity and background, both are suspicious.

65
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,040
I had no results after talking to her. So I hope—

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,400
As long as you take me in,

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,860
I will do everything I can.

68
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,560
What can you do?

69
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:51,970
Timing & subtitles brought to you by the L∞Ve Team @ Viki.com

70
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,840
Miss, you are here idling.

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,000
It took me ages to find you.

72
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,490
I even thought about going to find Young Master Qin myself,

73
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,210
unexpectedly he has come here in person.

74
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,280
After all, I am considerate toward a beauty.

75
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,030
What a playboy!

76
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,030
Just now you said you wanted to see me, I guess that something has troubled you.

77
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,360
Little Chun, I'm right, am I not?

78
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,380
If you guess it wrong, then you really don't live up to the title of your narcissism.

79
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,340
Young Master Qin, how smart you are!

80
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,140
Actually, I wanted to ask you.

81
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,820
What on earth does Xiao Bai like?

82
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,480
This is a good question! He likes weapons, kungfu, musical instruments, and similar things.

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,250
As a disciple from an influential family, you could say he has knowledge in a wide range of subjects, and is too profound to be understood.

84
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,300
Then what does he dislike?

85
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,490
This is also a good question. Young Master is broad-minded

86
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,990
and never gossips about others.

87
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,300
That's not helpful at all!

88
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,560
I think you care less about the things he likes

89
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,600
but more about the people he likes.

90
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,840
Am I right?

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,490
I didn't expect Young Master Qin to be such an honest man.

92
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,530
Oh right,

93
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,560
I heard that Xiao Bai had a marriage arrangement before?

94
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,400
You're referring to the daughter of the Hua family?

95
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,800
The Hua family is rich.

96
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,270
Miss Hua is beautiful and smart.

97
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,190
It just that fate messes with people.

98
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,620
She passed away before she could meet in the matrimony with young master.

99
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,390
But...

100
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,200
- But what? 
 - But Miss Hua's death was very strange.

101
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,470
The fire burnt down the bridal chamber,

102
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,670
but her corpse was never found.

103
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,950
Don't you think that's strange?

104
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,860
Disappearing from the face of the earth, that means

105
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,820
Xiao Bai and I are destined to be together.

106
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,330
Miss, where did that confidence come from?

107
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,930
I'm not telling you.

108
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,840
Originally, I was going to invite Young Master on the morrow

109
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,720
to do lunch together but now, under this circumstance...

110
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,970
I might have thought too much into it.

111
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,880
Wait! Have lunch together?

112
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,360
Where? Just me and Xiao Bai?

113
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,850
11:45 in Qian Hua Xuan.

114
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,200
As for the participants, sorry, I will also be there.

115
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,570
That's fine! Just eat more and talk less.

116
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,410
Thank you. I'll go find some nice clothes.

117
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,240
Master, here is Hengshan Sect’s Xin Fa.

118
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,290
Sell it on the market.

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,100
This...

120
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,220
Just say what's on your mind.

121
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,720
I am slow-witted.

122
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,520
I don't understand why you want to sell what we worked so hard to get.

123
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,790
Why would I care about such shoddy kungfu?

124
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,400
What is the foundation of each group?

125
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,380
Movement and mantra.

126
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,760
Their movements are not rare but their mantra is precious to them.

127
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,270
I want what they treasure to become worthless.

128
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,220
The impartial justice of the martial arts world is just like this, isn't it?

129
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,760
I will do what they won't do.

130
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,050
I understand.

131
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,500
This kind of task should be done by the hard-hearted Master Shi.

132
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,140
Yes.

133
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,420
Three books is not enough.

134
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,970
I don't know how well my silly sister

135
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,210
is stealing the Xiao family's Xin Fa.

136
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,710
What is it, Brother Qin?

137
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:43,000
If Miss Chun Hua isn't a master of disguise to the extent where even I can’t see through her,

138
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,800
then she really lost her memory.

139
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,670
It seems her identity still cannot be confirmed.

140
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,990
Brother Qin, I also have a favor to ask.

141
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,870
Go ahead and ask.

142
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,100
Brother Xiao, what's the meaning of this?

143
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,350
- That's not right. 
 - What is it that's not right?

144
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,620
The sword is wrong.

145
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,270
 After the incident, I inspected the corpse of the healer. 

146
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,440
 That sword had directly stabbed the heart. 

147
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,150
 It didn’t miss by any tiny deviation. 

148
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,830
 Now that I think about it, it was from a chisel. 

149
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,810
Brother Qin, I apologize for offending you.

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,630
Is there anything else that’s suspicious?

151
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,600
There’s something else that’s even more suspicious. That palm print!

152
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,950
The healer's death wasn’t caused by a stab from the chisel?

153
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,800
When I was inspecting the corpse of the healer,

154
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,750
there was a faint palm print.

155
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,860
 This palm had stopped the beating of his heart. 

156
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,500
To have easily injured him to this extent, I'm really not sure who is capable of this in the pugilist world.

157
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Besides, to be killed in such condition,

158
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,750
the healer's character isn’t that bad to the extent of suffering the wrath of Heaven, is he?

159
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,220
What do you think?

160
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,510
In my opinion, the healer's death

161
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,050
was probably caused due to being caught off-guard by a surprise attack.

162
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,900
I concur.

163
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,570
Xiao Bai?

164
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,110
Miss Chun Hua’s clothes are extremely exquisite today.

165
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,860
One look and you know that it was put together at the tailor shop.

166
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,230
What do you know?

167
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,250
This is specially tailored for the date between Xiao Bai and I.

168
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,730
Each stitch represents my sincere feelings towards Xiao Bai.

169
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,670
You wear your affections for him on your body,

170
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,240
- but Xiao Bai– 
 - Qin Liufeng, shut up!

171
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,120
It’s your fault for talking too much. Even Xiao Bai is standing up for me.

172
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,870
What is this?

173
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,780
This is the ginseng soup I made for Xiao Bai.

174
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,100
Xiao Bai has to practice martial arts every day. It’s very tiring,

175
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,110
so he must drink more.

176
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,460
Since this feast is prepared for Brother Qin,

177
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,790
it still would be better if he eats more.

178
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,310
How can I enjoy this delicious food alone? Come! Let’s enjoy it together.

179
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,540
Thank you, Miss Chun Hua.

180
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,280
Miss Chun Hua.

181
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,330
If an attack is from an acquaintance,

182
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,570
this is how the expression in the eyes and the state of the limbs would be.

183
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,980
 Xiao Bai, you are finally beginning to understand. 

184
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,750
I only pushed her and it naturally left no trace.

185
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,570
Your analysis is correct.

186
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,780
Thus, we can pinpoint the murderer as someone whom the healer was familiar with.

187
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,760
Thank you, Brother Qin.

188
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,070
It hurts so much.

189
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,750
Come! Let’s set aside work-related matters for now.

190
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,540
Please forgive my rash action.

191
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,050
Have a seat!

192
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,360
Then let me toast this cup of light wine to Brother Qin’s arrival.

193
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,470
Also, thank you, Miss Chun Hua, for dressing up for this feast.

194
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,480
You’re welcome!

195
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,390
Miss Chun Hua, this is our hometown’s specialty.

196
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,170
You must definitely try it and see if it is to your taste.

197
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,760
Then I won’t… stand on ceremony.

198
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,000
 Using fish as an example,  a person who likes eating the fishtail is probably from a poor family. 

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,140
 A person who likes eating the fish belly is probably the youngest in the family. 

200
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,940
 And a person who likes eating the fish gill 

201
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,370
 is bound to be from a wealthy family. 

202
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,120
Young Master Qin is really skillful!

203
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,870
- You flatter me. 
 - When eating fish, the most delicious part

204
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,080
is at the fish… belly!

205
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,780
 What else does the fish belly mean? 

206
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,930
 Fish belly has much meat and is a favorite for children in poor families. 

207
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,190
 Could it be that her family is in dire circumstances? 

208
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,390
This fish is a little spicy.

209
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,330
But… I like it.

210
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,960
 The Southerners like sweet, Northerners like salty, Easterners like spicy, and Westerners like sour. 

211
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,470
 According to her taste, we can find out the location of her hometown. 

212
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,350
 She likes spicy? Is she really from Sangtian Village? 

213
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,600
This beancurd, its taste is fine and smooth.

214
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,790
It's sweet but not too rich. So delicious!

215
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,350
Here, Young Master. Let’s toast. Cheers!

216
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,920
There are rumors in the pugilist world that the healer found the longevity fruit but was unexpectedly murdered.

217
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,920
The whereabouts of the longevity fruit are also unknown.

218
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,950
According to the medical records, Miss Chun Hua was revived from the dead.

219
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,520
I’m speculating that she ate the longevity fruit.

220
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,600
However, she has completely lost her memories and doesn’t even know who she, herself, is.

221
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,320
As I see it, she isn’t a crafty person.

222
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,110
Thus, I have already ordered for the news to not be spread.

223
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,680
Are you sympathetic towards Miss Chun Hua,

224
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,420
and therefore, keeping her by your side?

225
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,020
It is extremely easy for an evil person to murder her.

226
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,740
How can I leave her wandering out there?

227
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,920
Right, right, right.

228
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,160
Until she finds her family, she can stay in Fengming Mountain Manor.

229
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,900
As for the longevity fruit,

230
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,420
my father is critically ill so I still need to quicken my search.

231
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,200
According to my recent investigation, news of the longevity fruit

232
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,300
was first released by a Master Shi in the pugilist world.

233
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,260
He does things extremely discreet and secretive.

234
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,970
Nobody in the pugilist world has seen his actual face before.

235
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,120
A person who has never been seen before, spreading news of a thing that has never been seen before.

236
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,030
Seems like none of the news of the longevity fruit and its genuineness can be believed as of yet.

237
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,040
 [Chuanqi Sect] 

238
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,240
Don’t wake her up.

239
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,440
Have a good look, and see if she has anything else that’s suspicious on her.

240
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,210
Gorge Master, her hidden weapon.

241
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,730
Qianyue Sect?

242
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,640
They’re so used to secretly sending spies

243
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,120
that they’re sending spies to my sect?

244
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,280
Gorge Master Fu,

245
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,050
for jobs like the appreciation of hidden weapons, you should be looking for a blacksmith instead.

246
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,300
Shangguan Qiu Yue, you have been sending people to sneak into Chuanqi Sect many times.

247
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,460
What exactly are your motives?

248
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,820
If we were to trace back by a hundred years, both of us would be from the same sect.

249
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,120
Am I wrong to be concerned about you and send people to check up on you?

250
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,080
I’m afraid that killing within the sect is indeed a tradition of your Qianyue Sect, isn’t it?

251
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,280
Gorge Master Fu, you must be joking.

252
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,310
But it is truly a pity.

253
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,250
We have been busy with our internal conflicts all these years,

254
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,810
and have allowed Fengming Mountain Manor to strengthen its Wulin sects.

255
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,700
It turns out that you want to unify the pugilist world.

256
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,500
Don’t worry! I have no interest in your great ambitions.

257
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,550
It looks like you have taken an interest in the woman who was revived from the dead.

258
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,480
Because of the longevity fruit?

259
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,380
It’s a pity that she’s protected by Fengming Mountain Manor.

260
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,670
Shangguan Qiu Yue, don’t think I won’t dare lead people to attack Qianyue Sect today.

261
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,370
Gorge Master Fu, you are now at the edge of Qianyue Sect’s territory.

262
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,660
You even had to beg me to come to meet you.

263
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:17,050
If you really have the skills, why didn't you go straight into the cave to look for me?

264
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,820
Who is there?

265
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,640
- Miss Chun Hua? 
 - Xiao Bai?

266
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,900
You should get out!

267
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,710
Young Master!

268
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,780
What are you doing here?

269
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,410
Don't you know this is the private bath place for Young Master?

270
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,580
How could I know? No one told me.

271
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,860
You still don't want to get out?

272
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,220
Hurry up and leave!

273
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,940
You... you are still looking?

274
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,850
If this is your private bath, why don't you put up a sign?

275
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,430
Let's go!

276
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,850
[Private Bath]

277
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,450
It definitely says "private bath" here.

278
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,320
Xiao Lei.

279
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,670
I want to drink water.

280
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,720
Water.

281
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,740
Is nobody here?

282
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,630
No one is here.

283
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,240
You caught a cold from the pool. There's nothing to be afraid of.

284
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,100
Silly Sister, let go. Lie down!

285
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,460
I am not going to let go.

286
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,230
Unless...

287
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,630
Older Brother, you let me take advantage of you, then I will recover.

288
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,530
All right. You lay down first,

289
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,790
then you can take advantage of me.

290
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,630
You will really let me take advantage of you?

291
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,300
You can take advantage any time.

292
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,840
Older Brother, there is no need to worry about me. I am almost fully recovered.

293
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,760
How could it be so fast?

294
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,050
I want some water.

295
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,880
What now? You no longer want to take advantage of me?

296
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,870
Are we really siblings?

297
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,350
Of course.

298
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,630
Am I not treating you nice enough?

299
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,090
Then, were we like this before?

300
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,370
Before? No.

301
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,700
Ever since our parents passed away, we have been eating and sleeping together.

302
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,040
Back then, Xiao Chun Hua is much braver than now.

303
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,750
Really?

304
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,900
Why would I lie to you?

305
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,230
[Qian Hua Xuan]

306
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,430
How could he be such rigid

307
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,900
in the way he talks, walks, and does things?

308
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,380
Miss Chun Hua, what are you doing?

309
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,350
I saw you standing upright so firmly.

310
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:32,120
I wanted to see if I could push you.

311
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,420
Xiao Bai, cleary you're a young man,

312
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,990
why are you acting like an old man?

313
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,970
Xiao Bai, I didn't take a bath in your hot spring on purpose!

314
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,760
I didn't see the words, "private bath"!

315
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,660
I even thought you were a gentleman and didn't have an interest in those things.

316
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,130
I didn't think you would be this shy!

317
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,110
Miss Chun Hua, why are you—

318
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,460
You're talking about how you saw me taking a bath, aren't you?

319
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,510
It's okay, you're my husband anyways.

320
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,270
Xiao Bai, you are a man of honor.

321
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,190
What do you want to do?

322
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,640
Miss Chun Hua, the weather is nice today.

323
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,620
I wonder if you know how to fly a kite?

324
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,890
What?

325
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,230
Xiao Bai.

326
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,140
The kite won't fly high with you holding it so tightly.

327
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,140
The thread spool...

328
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:16,600
- What's wrong with it? 
 - It's old and small. Why don't you throw it away?

329
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,130
Do you remember the first time we met?

330
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,450
I remember.

331
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,010
It's Xiao Bai who saved me.

332
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,310
I remember you called me,

333
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,950
husband.

334
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,080
Did I? I have forgotten already.

335
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,920
I remember.

336
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,230
It can't be wrong.

337
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,320
That's what you called me.

338
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,160
Then maybe it's because

339
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,790
I felt really close to you.

340
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,000
It's like I'd seen you before.

341
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,430
What is the earliest thing you can remember?

342
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,150
I don't remember. I don't remember anything.

343
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,700
You don't even remember who you are?

344
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,530
I really don't remember!

345
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,620
You are an important guest of our Fengming Mountain Manor.

346
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,590
I will do my best to protect you.

347
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,660
Xiao Bai, do you care this much about me?

348
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,430
Miss, if there is something you are afraid to express.

349
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,570
Don't be afraid, you can tell me.

350
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,850
As long as you are here, I won't be afraid.

351
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,980
Xiao Bai is finally starting to get the idea.

352
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,530
Get what idea?

353
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,050
Older Brother, why did you come here?

354
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:00,110
There is a huge and luxurious mirror here, I can't take a look?

355
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,060
Did you get a new hairpin?

356
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,430
You could tell? Does it look good?

357
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,960
What's so good about a crudely made product?

358
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,770
It's already broken!

359
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,740
Why do you care about useless things?

360
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,800
Have a chat with me!

361
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,560
Look! You look like a bun when you're mad.

362
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,400
I will gift you another one.

363
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,700
It looks a lot better than that.

364
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,300
I'm giving this to you, take it!

365
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,180
This is too precious! I can't accept it.

366
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,930
Then, what do you want?

367
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,610
I want you to make me happy.

368
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,060
All right.

369
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:47,010
Then, what do you want me to do?

370
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,700
I will definitely satisfy you.

371
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,310
Really?

372
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,630
The Master of Qianyue Sect does not go against his words.

373
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,620
Older Brother...

374
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,050
should bark like a dog. No!

375
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,700
Bark until I am happy.

376

 ''The Unfinished Moment'' - Singer: Li Hongyi 

378
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,770
♫  It's a time for accidental appearances  ♫

379
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,670
♫  It's a broken promise of spring, summer, autumn and winter  ♫

380
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:52,100
♫  It's the full moon reflected on water, blinking it's eye  ♫

381
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,280
♫  Seeing through the fickleness of love  ♫

382
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,320
♫  It's the touching melody of a fast beating heart  ♫

383
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,500
♫  It's such a  pity for not stepping forward  ♫

384
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,800
♫  The peach blossom valley without you  ♫

385
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,470
♫  Is not as lovely as it used to be  ♫

386
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,130
♫  Even the admiring for the freshness and the beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon  ♫

387
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:25,320
♫  Can't compare to seeing you for just a fleeting moment  ♫

388
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,130
♫  A brief instance determined forever  ♫

389
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:33,470
♫  It's hard to walk on, there's even no one to argue with  ♫

390
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,630
♫  Sealing up half of my memories in this place  ♫

391
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,030
♫  Leaving another half to be changed by time  ♫

392
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,900
♫  The loneliness that I’m fated to have, is difficult to put into words  ♫

393
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:53,080
♫  How I wish that you could see it  ♫

411
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,160
♫  For you, I pieced together the predetermined storyline  ♫

412
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,000
♫  That passing moment that we missed  ♫

413
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,390
♫  Yet this insatiable longing seems like it will go on for years  ♫

414
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,620
♫  The falling snow and blossoming flowers carpeted the ground  ♫

415

♫  I've left behind distinct traces from loving you  ♫

416
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,960
♫  The brightness of the moon changes as the years press on  ♫

417
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,780
♫  Yet, how can you still not see it  ♫
