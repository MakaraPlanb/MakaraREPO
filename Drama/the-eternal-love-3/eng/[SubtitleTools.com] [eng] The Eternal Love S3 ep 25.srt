18
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,080
Miss! Miss!

19
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,679
The physical wounds are healing,

20
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,000
but the internal injuries aren't
getting any better.

21
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,000
It sure does seem like Yi Feng's doing.

22
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,119
Who exactly are you?

23
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,640
You know Mo Yi Feng?

24
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,839
A longtime friend of mine.

25
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,399
And Miss, you are…?

26
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,880
No need for you to know.

27
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,519
Wait till Mo Yi Feng sees your corpse,

28
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,160
then he will understand.

29
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,679
Your wounds might have healed,

30
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,359
but Yi Feng is a master at combat.

31
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,040
You can't move yet.

32
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,119
Be a good girl.

33
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,239
When I cure you,

34
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,440
it's not too late for you to kill me.

35
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,239
Come on.

36
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,399
May I now

37
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,440
know your name?

38
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,920
Don't get distracted.

39
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,799
This Love's Reflection

40
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
can help heal your wounds.

41
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,440
There's ample spiritual power here.

42
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,640
It can help your wounds

43
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,440
heal faster.

44
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,640
You must learn this song first,

45
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,559
so that even if I'm gone in the future,

46
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,400
you can treat yourself.

47
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,719
So can you now tell me

48
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,000
your name?

49
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,400
Qu Xiang Tan.

50
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,039
Qu Xiang Tan.

51
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,359
Young Master Lian Cheng.

52
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,320
Why am I reading this?

53
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:21,520
Like she's actually going to
ask me these questions?

54
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,320
She's just trying to separate me and Cheng Cheng.

55
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,840
Lower your voice.

56
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,280
This is the royal study.

57
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,039
There are guards outside.

58
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,400
Forget it! I'm not going to read it!

59
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,119
It's not like I'm actually going to
become the empress here.

60
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,239
If I have the free time,

61
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,760
I should be investigating more useful things.

62
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,799
The Soul-guarding Bead.

63
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,000
The Altar of Souls.

64
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,400
Red Star of Demise.

65
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,359
The Qu family is a royal family

66
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,799
and she looks exactly like me.

67
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,359
Who founded Dongyue?

68
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,919
In the original world,

69
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,520
Dongyue

70
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,200
was founded by Mo Yi Feng,

71
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,799
gaining independence
in the Xuanling Continent.

72
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,960
Then what about this Qu family?

73
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,840
They...

74
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,479
They probably are...

75
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:25,559
related to the Qu Clan from the
Xuanling Continent.

76
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,200
I don't even know

77
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:28,119
what you're doing,

78
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,919
talking to yourself all day.

79
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:32,960
It's too hardcore.

80
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,239
You won't understand.

81
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,880
I need some more time to figure it out.

82
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:38,320
It's because

83
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,919
I'm used to living in the Dongyue

84
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,400
that has both the Qu family

85
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,239
and the Mo family,

86
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,559
so I

87
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,799
didn't think about it in this way.

88
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,520
Now that I think about it,

89
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,400
if the empress's last name is Qu,

90
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,479
then she should be

91
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,039
the Mo Yi Feng

92
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,719
from the original world.

93
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,159
Then she's...!

94
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,000
Right.

95
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,039
Everything you say is right.

96
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,760
So it is indeed you.

97
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,159
Didn't you already know?

98
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,159
That's right.

99
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,159
But...

100
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,440
how could this be?

101
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:42,599

102
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,479
you were murdered by your lover's sword.

103
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,520
It must have been painful.

104
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,640
All these years, I've been waiting
for you to tell me

105
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:58,280
whether it's more painful to die
by your lover's hands

106
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,119
or to kill your lover with your own hands.

But I still need to look it up.

186
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,319
Even if they don't contain the empress's name,

187
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,239
there must be some clues.

188
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,760
Clues about

189
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,079
the secret of this world.

190
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,839
Official Qu.

191
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:21,040
Official Qu is

192
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,400
the only distant relative the empress has now.

193
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,560
Right!

194
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,520
How could I forget about him?

195
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,560
Jing Xin.

196
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Go distract the guards at the door.

197
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,719
I need to go see him now.

198
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,760
Understood.

199
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,119
Your Highness.

200
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:44,239
Her Majesty ordered me to
bring you some desserts,

201
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,079
saying that you've worked hard
reviewing memorials.

202
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,400
Where is Her Majesty now?

203
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:55,079
Her Majesty is in the imperial gardens

204
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,359
learning the zither with Prince Consort.

205
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,959
Her Majesty?

206
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,719
Wasn't he teaching the consorts of the harem?

207
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,640
Please enjoy your meal, Your Highness.

208
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,119
I'll take my leave now.

209
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,319
If she's indeed Qu Xiang Tan,

210
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,239
her approaching Cheng Cheng now…

211
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,839
Tan!

212
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,560
The guards outside the doors

213
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,040
have been removed from their posts.

214
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,239
Great.

215
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,680
Jing Xin,

216
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,680
I need to go

217
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,520
find Cheng Cheng right now.

218
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,880
Didn't she say

219
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,000
she is going to find Official Qu?

220
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,079
Cheng Cheng! Cheng Cheng!

221
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,439
Cheng Cheng! Cheng Cheng! Cheng Cheng!

222
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,000
Your injuries…

223
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,160
Right.

224
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:12,839
I'm living with my dying breath,

225
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,959
waiting for you to come.

226
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,479
Xiang Tan, listen to me.

227
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,160
Tan Er! Tan Er!

228
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:27,920
It's not what you think!

229
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,040
Tan Er!

230
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,680
It's really not what you...

231
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Go.

232
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:36,880
Go.

233
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,880
Tomorrow, I'll still be here

234
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,000
waiting for you.

235
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,719
You're the empress.

236
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,199
It wouldn't be appropriate for me
to meet you in private.

237
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,479
Don't you want to know my secrets?

238
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,520
Alright.

239
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,920
But only to treat you.

240
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
You've finally come face-to-face
with Young Master Lian Cheng.

241
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,479
Hope that

242
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:27,560
your years of perseverance won't go to waste.

244
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,520
Tan Er.

245
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,400
She's Qu Xiang Tan.

246
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,680
Yes, she is.

247
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,880
You knew already, didn't you?

248
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,479
It was only a guess.

249
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,359
I've only just found out.

250
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,000
Just now,

251
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:45,199
I was treating her wounds.

252
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,599
Cheng Cheng.

253
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,839
I've always thought that

254
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,920
we were destined to be together.

255
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,839
However, the ultimate origin of this destiny

256
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,520
has something to do with the connection
between Qu Xiang Tan and me.

257
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,199
But now...

258
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,359
Tan Er,

259
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,040
you are the one I love.

260
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,239
As for her…

261
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,640
I haven't figured out

262
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,959
what exactly is going on.

263
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,079
Give me some time.

264
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,640
Once I find out the truth,

265
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,319
then maybe

266
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,839
we can go back to our world.

267
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,160
Go back to our world?

268
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,359
I'm tired.

269
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,400
I want to go home.

270
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,640
I miss Yu Er.

271
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,880
What?

272
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,800
Not used to seeing me dressing like this?

273
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,760
You can ask anything you want to know.

274
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,359
I'll tell you everything.

275
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,599
Your illness…

276
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,520
What was the cause of it?

277
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,000
And why

278
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,760
are you here in Dongyue?

279
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,199
That year,

280
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,439
Mo Yi Feng and I fought a hard battle
with Demon Lord.

281
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,479
Even though we managed
to seal Demon Lord away,

282
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,359
we were badly injured.

283
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,239
After I woke up,

284
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,719
I realized that it was Xiao Zhen who saved me

285
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,199
and before I knew it, I was already in Dongyue.

286
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,199
If it weren't for the Soul-guarding Bead
and the Soul-parting Flute,

287
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,920
I probably would have died already.

288
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,959
I may have lived

289
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,800
but was gravely injured.

290
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,719
So I need

291
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,680
an altar suitable for training with
the Soul-guarding Bead.

292
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,800
And that's the Altar of Souls.

293
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,199
You ascended the throne

294
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,839
so you could have the money and power

295
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,400
to build the Altar of Souls?

296
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,719
I did it so I could live.

297
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,520
I was in unimaginable pain, but I was able to
hold out long enough for you to come.

298
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,319
It's quite preposterous.

299
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,400
My injuries

300
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,959
prevent me from being able to love.

301
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,800
The more I love someone,
the worse the injuries become.

302
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,000
But as long as I am alive, I will think of you.

303
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:19,000
And to be able to think of you, I must stay alive.

304
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,880
Here I am in this unsolvable maze,

305
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:26,839
using the pain caused by you

306
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,479
to remember you.

307
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,959
No need for you to do so.

308
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:37,959
Your illness...

309
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,000
I'll help you cure it.

310
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,560
And after it's cured?

311
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,319
If you leave me once I'm cured,

312
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,800
then I'd rather you never be able to cure me.

313
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,839
I still don't understand.

314
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:19,359
You were Eighth Young Master before.

315
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,920
How did you get yourself back?

316
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,280
It's true that Eighth Young Master before

317
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,079
was not me.

318
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,920
I don't know where he went either.

319
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,040
Perhaps he has died.

320
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:33,239
And why

321
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,239
am I living in his body?

322
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,119
To be honest,

323
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:39,520
I don't know either.

324
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,920
I've been thinking that

325
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,959
Qu Tan Er's has also changed a lot.

326
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,839
Then tell me.

327
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Who is she?

328
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,319
Isn't she Qu Jiang Lin's daughter?

329
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,239
How would I know

330
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,439
if she has changed a lot?

331
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,439
But

332
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,640
I've been curious.

333
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,040
What kind of power

334
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,079
allowed us to meet here

335
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,839
once again?

336
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:14,000
Now it seems that

337
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,439
you not only have the Soul-guarding Bead,

338
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,319
but also the Soul-parting Flute.

339
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,920
There is nothing

340
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,319
you cannot do.

341
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,839
If I were really that capable,

342
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,839
would I have needed to use Eighth Young Master
as a replacement for you

343
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,439
and struggled until now?

344
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,000
It happened a long time ago.

345
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,920
If you are still...

346
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,880
It's been a long time,

347
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,400
yet I still want to ask you.

348
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,640
When we were at Xuanling Continent,

349
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,119
were your feelings towards me

350
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,079
genuine?

351
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,880
They were genuine feelings of
Young Master Lian Cheng.

352
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:01,640
But now,

353
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,359
I am Mo...

354
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,520
I'm heading back.

355
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,160
Don't forget what you promised me.

356
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,560
Tomorrow...

357
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,040
Tomorrow, I'll wait for you here

358
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,880
so that you can continue to treat me.

359
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,280
Cheng Cheng.

360
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,560
You're back.

361
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:44,560
Come on.

362
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,800
See what I've made for you.

363
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,000
It's your favorite

364
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,599
braised carp

365
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,760
and steamed shrimp.

366
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:53,839
What do you think?

367
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,319
There are more here.

368
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,439
Desserts I made for you myself.

369
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,000
I've got the bath water ready too.

370
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,040
Do you want to

371
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,880
eat first

372
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,079
or shower first?

373
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,040
What?

374
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,160
Don't tell me...

375
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,800
that you're too used to being Prince Consort

376
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,400
and are weak to me spoiling you?

377
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,160
Are you still the Tan Er I know?

378
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:20,119
Or am I dreaming?

379
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,119
Of course, I'm Tan Er.

380
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,040
Come on, sit down.

381
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,239
Tell me.

382
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:27,959
Did everything

383
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,880
go well today?

384
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,359
We just reminisced about the old days.

385
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,560
But

386
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,280
she was suspicious of your real identity.

387
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,920
Reminiscing...

388
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,119
That's good to hear.

389
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,640
It has been so long since it happened.

390
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,719
You do need to reminiscence about it.

391
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,560
That's right.

392
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,520
Otherwise, it'd be so awkward.

393
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,239
Here.

394
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,920
Try this dessert I made for you.

395
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,719
Since Tan Er is so well-behaved,

396
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,040
I'll tell you a bit more information.

397
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,439
You don't need to tell me anything

398
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:07,719
too detailed...

399
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,280
I just

400
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,359
revisited everything

401
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,079
that we did before.

402
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,359
Revisited everything?

403
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:21,160
There are some things

404
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,800
that we can't revisit in broad daylight.

405
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,959
So I'll go meet her

406
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,800
in her bedchamber at night.

407
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,199
Mo Lian Cheng!

408
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,800
You're going too far!

409
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:29,959
I thought that

410
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,760
I could be more considerate

411
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,719
and give you some space so that
you can deal with it yourself.

412
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,719
But do you think

413
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,319
I'm a pushover?

414
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,760
You were teasing me on purpose?

415
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:44,239
Calm down.

416
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,319
If I didn't say so,

417
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,479
would you be able to

418
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,839
release all of your anger?

419
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:50,560
So that means that

420
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,239
you guys didn't revisit anything?

421
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,599
Nothing at all.

422
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,439
But

423
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,680
I don't think she's someone
who will let things go easily.

424
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:00,880
Perhaps

425
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,719
my complicated relationship with her

426
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,959
is the key for us

427
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,599
to return to our world.

428
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,839
Since you promised her you will cure her,

429
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,920
then you must keep your promise.

430
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,040
But

431
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,040
it will take some time

432
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,199
for her injuries to be cured.

433
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,719
Is it difficult?

434
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:28,199
Tan Er,

435
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,079
the hardest step

436
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,839
is this last step.

437
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:35,680
The two of us need to be locked up together

438
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,359
for seven days and seven nights in a private room.

439
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:40,439
And we need to

440
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:42,040
have our clothes off

441
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,000
so that my pure chi of Yang

442
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,920
can mix with her.

443
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,239
Mo Lian Cheng, do you want to die?

444
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,000
Are you looking for a beating?

445
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:53,959
I...

446
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,920
enjoy seeing your jealous face.

447
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,439
Don't know if I should say you have good taste

448
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,680
or strange taste.

449
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,680
Then...

450
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,599
how about I go with you?

451
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,640
No.

452
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,040
Absolutely do not

453
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:12,160
act recklessly.

454
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,079
I can't even see for myself

455
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,000
how I get cheated on.

456
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,159
Every time I hear this song,

457
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,719
our past stands before me

458
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,840
like a dagger

459
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,840
and cuts wounds in my mind and heart.

460
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,600
But if it weren't for the sound of the flute,

461
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:10,520
I would never be able to fall asleep.

462
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,360
Your Majesty

463
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:16,639
taught me this song.

464
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,280
I shouldn't have passed this
Soul-parting Flute to you,

465
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,199
but at that time,

466
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,320
you were the only one with me.

467
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,639
Who else could I pass it on to?

468
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,280
Your Majesty, you still remember.

469
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,199
I'm tired.

470
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,679
When you leave,

471
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,000
leave the Soul-parting Flute here.

472
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,320
I need to use it tomorrow.

473
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,840
<i>To you, the Soul-parting Flute</i>

474
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,760
<i>represents the memories you had with him.</i>

475
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
<i>But to me,</i>

476
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:50,560
<i>it also represents the memories we had.</i>

477
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,360
Your Majesty, your illness

478
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,360
is due to injuries to your circulatory system.

479
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,199
Besides taking medicine every day,

480
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,159
you need to use the sound of the zither

481
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,679
to soothe your frustration.

482
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,560
Why did Her Majesty call me here?

483
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,760
This is a booklist

484
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,679
Her Majesty made for you, Your Highness.

485
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,879
Please read it over carefully,

486
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,040
Crown Princess.

487
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,000
<i>That's my Cheng Cheng.</i>

488
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:00,199
<i>Based on what I see, their distance</i>

489
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
<i>is the normal social distance
between a doctor and his patient.</i>

490
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
<i>The Soul-parting Flute.</i>

491
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,280
The Soul-parting Flute.

492
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,439
Crown Princess,

493
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:34,159
how do you know about the Soul-parting Flute?

494
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:38,800
Father once mentioned it when I was a kid,

495
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:39,879
so I recognize it.

496
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,600
I'll read the books on this list carefully.

497
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,479
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

498
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,280
Since the string is broken,

499
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,719
I have no choice but come to

500
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,280
treat Your Majesty at another time.

501
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:14,800
I will take my leave now.

502
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,280
How could you speak about
the Soul-parting Flute out loud?

503
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:41,919
Good lord.

504
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,520
I somehow managed to gloss it over.

505
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,800
Is my explanation just now

506
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,560
alright?

507
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Deceive him?

508
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,840
He's a very paranoid person.

509
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:49,239
He will never believe your explanation

510
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,719
and will definitely make some preparations.

511
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,560
But after this,

512
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm suddenly enlightened.

513
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,560
Suddenly enlightened?

514
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,280
Yes.

515
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,959
The only person that knows how to play

516
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,439
the Soul-parting Flute is the chief

517
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,959
of the Qu Clan in Xuanling Continent.

518
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,560
Liu Qian Shui gave you the sheet music

519
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,320
and you were able to teach yourself.

520
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,520
That is precisely because

521
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,959
you are the descendant

522
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,040
of the chief of the Qu Clan from that world.

523
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,360
And she

524
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,479
is the Qu Xiang Tan from a parallel universe.

525
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,679
The Young Master Lian Cheng

526
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,520
that fell in love with her is also the
Lian Cheng of that parallel universe.

527
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,679
It was not me.

528
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,959
Then that means

529
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,360
there's nothing

530
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:25,600
between you and the empress.

531
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,000
Theoretically,

532
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:32,120
that is so.

533
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,879
But it is no lie that I've played

534
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,600
the song, Love's Reflection, before.

535
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,320
What the Young Master Lian Cheng

536
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,520
from the parallel universe did,

537
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,040
I also did.

538
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,199
So even if I'm from

539
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,679
another parallel universe,

540
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,800
I can't pretend that she is

541
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,600
a complete stranger to me.

542
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,520
After all this talking,

543
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,679
you're saying you still have to face it.

544
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,600
Hope that it wasn't because of
this star-crossed fate

545
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,800
that the Soul-guarding Bead brought us here.

546
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:09,639
Qu Tan Er...

547
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,679
How could she recognize the Soul-parting Flute?

548
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,639
Your Majesty.

549
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,600
Have you really mentioned it to Qu Jiang Lin?

550
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
Qu Jiang Lin

551
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:21,919
does not even know of the existence
of the Soul-parting Flute.

552
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,600
Your Majesty.

553
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,919
As I expected,

554
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,199
this Qu Tan Er

555
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,199
has a mysterious background.

556
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:30,479
Find out who she is

557
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:32,000
as soon as possible.

558
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:33,040
Yes, Your Majesty.
