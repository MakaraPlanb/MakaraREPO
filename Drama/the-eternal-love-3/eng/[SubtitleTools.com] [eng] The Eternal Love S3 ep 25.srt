18
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:06,580
Miss! Miss!

19
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,179
The physical wounds are healing,

20
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,500
but the internal injuries aren't
getting any better.

21
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,500
It sure does seem like Yi Feng's doing.

22
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,619
Who exactly are you?

23
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,140
You know Mo Yi Feng?

24
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,339
A longtime friend of mine.

25
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,899
And Miss, you are…?

26
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,380
No need for you to know.

27
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,019
Wait till Mo Yi Feng sees your corpse,

28
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:36,660
then he will understand.

29
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,179
Your wounds might have healed,

30
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,859
but Yi Feng is a master at combat.

31
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:56,540
You can't move yet.

32
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,619
Be a good girl.

33
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:00,739
When I cure you,

34
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,940
it's not too late for you to kill me.

35
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,739
Come on.

36
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,899
May I now

37
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:40,940
know your name?

38
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,420
Don't get distracted.

39
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,299
This Love's Reflection

40
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,100
can help heal your wounds.

41
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,940
There's ample spiritual power here.

42
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:22,140
It can help your wounds

43
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:23,940
heal faster.

44
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,140
You must learn this song first,

45
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,059
so that even if I'm gone in the future,

46
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:52,900
you can treat yourself.

47
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,219
So can you now tell me

48
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,500
your name?

49
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,900
Qu Xiang Tan.

50
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,539
Qu Xiang Tan.

51
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:34,859
Young Master Lian Cheng.

52
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:49,820
Why am I reading this?

53
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:53,020
Like she's actually going to
ask me these questions?

54
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,820
She's just trying to separate me and Cheng Cheng.

55
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:58,340
Lower your voice.

56
00:11:58,419 --> 00:11:59,780
This is the royal study.

57
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:01,539
There are guards outside.

58
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,900
Forget it! I'm not going to read it!

59
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:05,619
It's not like I'm actually going to
become the empress here.

60
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,739
If I have the free time,

61
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,260
I should be investigating more useful things.

62
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:16,299
The Soul-guarding Bead.

63
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,500
The Altar of Souls.

64
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,900
Red Star of Demise.

65
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,859
The Qu family is a royal family

66
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,299
and she looks exactly like me.

67
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,859
Who founded Dongyue?

68
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,419
In the original world,

69
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,020
Dongyue

70
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:41,700
was founded by Mo Yi Feng,

71
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:44,299
gaining independence
in the Xuanling Continent.

72
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,460
Then what about this Qu family?

73
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,340
They...

74
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:52,979
They probably are...

75
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:57,059
related to the Qu Clan from the
Xuanling Continent.

76
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:58,700
I don't even know

77
00:12:58,739 --> 00:12:59,619
what you're doing,

78
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:01,419
talking to yourself all day.

79
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:04,460
It's too hardcore.

80
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,739
You won't understand.

81
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,380
I need some more time to figure it out.

82
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:09,820
It's because

83
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,419
I'm used to living in the Dongyue

84
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:13,900
that has both the Qu family

85
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,739
and the Mo family,

86
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,059
so I

87
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,299
didn't think about it in this way.

88
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:29,020
Now that I think about it,

89
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:31,900
if the empress's last name is Qu,

90
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,979
then she should be

91
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:36,539
the Mo Yi Feng

92
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,219
from the original world.

93
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,659
Then she's...!

94
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,500
Right.

95
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,539
Everything you say is right.

96
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,260
So it is indeed you.

97
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,659
Didn't you already know?

98
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,659
That's right.

99
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,659
But...

100
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,940
how could this be?

101
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:14,099
Back then,

102
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,979
you were murdered by your lover's sword.

103
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,020
It must have been painful.

104
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:26,140
All these years, I've been waiting
for you to tell me

105
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:29,780
whether it's more painful to die
by your lover's hands

106
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,619
or to kill your lover with your own hands.

But I still need to look it up.

186
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:39,819
Even if they don't contain the empress's name,

187
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,739
there must be some clues.

188
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,260
Clues about

189
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:45,579
the secret of this world.

190
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,339
Official Qu.

191
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:52,540
Official Qu is

192
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,900
the only distant relative the empress has now.

193
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,060
Right!

194
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,020
How could I forget about him?

195
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,060
Jing Xin.

196
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,380
Go distract the guards at the door.

197
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:07,219
I need to go see him now.

198
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,260
Understood.

199
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,619
Your Highness.

200
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,739
Her Majesty ordered me to
bring you some desserts,

201
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,579
saying that you've worked hard
reviewing memorials.

202
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,900
Where is Her Majesty now?

203
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:26,579
Her Majesty is in the imperial gardens

204
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:27,859
learning the zither with Prince Consort.

205
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,459
Her Majesty?

206
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:33,219
Wasn't he teaching the consorts of the harem?

207
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:35,140
Please enjoy your meal, Your Highness.

208
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,619
I'll take my leave now.

209
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,819
If she's indeed Qu Xiang Tan,

210
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,739
her approaching Cheng Cheng now…

211
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,339
Tan!

212
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:58,060
The guards outside the doors

213
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,540
have been removed from their posts.

214
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:03,739
Great.

215
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,180
Jing Xin,

216
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,180
I need to go

217
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,020
find Cheng Cheng right now.

218
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,380
Didn't she say

219
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,500
she is going to find Official Qu?

220
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:25,579
Cheng Cheng! Cheng Cheng!

221
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,939
Cheng Cheng! Cheng Cheng! Cheng Cheng!

222
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,500
Your injuries…

223
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:40,660
Right.

224
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,339
I'm living with my dying breath,

225
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,459
waiting for you to come.

226
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,979
Xiang Tan, listen to me.

227
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,660
Tan Er! Tan Er!

228
00:20:58,219 --> 00:20:59,420
It's not what you think!

229
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:00,540
Tan Er!

230
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:02,180
It's really not what you...

231
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,900
Go.

232
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:08,380
Go.

233
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,380
Tomorrow, I'll still be here

234
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,500
waiting for you.

235
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:23,219
You're the empress.

236
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,699
It wouldn't be appropriate for me
to meet you in private.

237
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:26,979
Don't you want to know my secrets?

238
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:31,020
Alright.

239
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,420
But only to treat you.

240
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
You've finally come face-to-face
with Young Master Lian Cheng.

241
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,979
Hope that

242
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:59,060
your years of perseverance won't go to waste.

244
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,020
Tan Er.

245
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:49,900
She's Qu Xiang Tan.

246
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,180
Yes, she is.

247
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,380
You knew already, didn't you?

248
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,979
It was only a guess.

249
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:09,859
I've only just found out.

250
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,500
Just now,

251
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:16,699
I was treating her wounds.

252
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,099
Cheng Cheng.

253
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:32,339
I've always thought that

254
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,420
we were destined to be together.

255
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,339
However, the ultimate origin of this destiny

256
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,020
has something to do with the connection
between Qu Xiang Tan and me.

257
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:46,699
But now...

258
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:47,859
Tan Er,

259
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:51,540
you are the one I love.

260
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:53,739
As for her…

261
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,140
I haven't figured out

262
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,459
what exactly is going on.

263
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,579
Give me some time.

264
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,140
Once I find out the truth,

265
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,819
then maybe

266
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,339
we can go back to our world.

267
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:15,660
Go back to our world?

268
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,859
I'm tired.

269
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,900
I want to go home.

270
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:32,140
I miss Yu Er.

271
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,380
What?

272
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:21,300
Not used to seeing me dressing like this?

273
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:25,260
You can ask anything you want to know.

274
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,859
I'll tell you everything.

275
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,099
Your illness…

276
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:34,020
What was the cause of it?

277
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:37,500
And why

278
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,260
are you here in Dongyue?

279
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,699
That year,

280
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,939
Mo Yi Feng and I fought a hard battle
with Demon Lord.

281
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:49,979
Even though we managed
to seal Demon Lord away,

282
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:51,859
we were badly injured.

283
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,739
After I woke up,

284
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,219
I realized that it was Xiao Zhen who saved me

285
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,699
and before I knew it, I was already in Dongyue.

286
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,699
If it weren't for the Soul-guarding Bead
and the Soul-parting Flute,

287
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:05,420
I probably would have died already.

288
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:07,459
I may have lived

289
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:10,300
but was gravely injured.

290
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:12,219
So I need

291
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:15,180
an altar suitable for training with
the Soul-guarding Bead.

292
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:18,300
And that's the Altar of Souls.

293
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,699
You ascended the throne

294
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,339
so you could have the money and power

295
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,900
to build the Altar of Souls?

296
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,219
I did it so I could live.

297
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,020
I was in unimaginable pain, but I was able to
hold out long enough for you to come.

298
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,819
It's quite preposterous.

299
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:40,900
My injuries

300
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,459
prevent me from being able to love.

301
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,300
The more I love someone,
the worse the injuries become.

302
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,500
But as long as I am alive, I will think of you.

303
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:50,500
And to be able to think of you, I must stay alive.

304
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:55,380
Here I am in this unsolvable maze,

305
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:58,339
using the pain caused by you

306
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,979
to remember you.

307
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,459
No need for you to do so.

308
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:09,459
Your illness...

309
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,500
I'll help you cure it.

310
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:13,060
And after it's cured?

311
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,819
If you leave me once I'm cured,

312
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,300
then I'd rather you never be able to cure me.

313
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,339
I still don't understand.

314
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:50,859
You were Eighth Young Master before.

315
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:53,420
How did you get yourself back?

316
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:57,780
It's true that Eighth Young Master before

317
00:27:58,339 --> 00:27:59,579
was not me.

318
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,420
I don't know where he went either.

319
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,540
Perhaps he has died.

320
00:28:03,939 --> 00:28:04,739
And why

321
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,739
am I living in his body?

322
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:09,619
To be honest,

323
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,020
I don't know either.

324
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,420
I've been thinking that

325
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:17,459
Qu Tan Er's has also changed a lot.

326
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,339
Then tell me.

327
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,180
Who is she?

328
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,819
Isn't she Qu Jiang Lin's daughter?

329
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:28,739
How would I know

330
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,939
if she has changed a lot?

331
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,939
But

332
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,140
I've been curious.

333
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,540
What kind of power

334
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,579
allowed us to meet here

335
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,339
once again?

336
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:45,500
Now it seems that

337
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,939
you not only have the Soul-guarding Bead,

338
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,819
but also the Soul-parting Flute.

339
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,420
There is nothing

340
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:51,819
you cannot do.

341
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,339
If I were really that capable,

342
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,339
would I have needed to use Eighth Young Master
as a replacement for you

343
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,939
and struggled until now?

344
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,500
It happened a long time ago.

345
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,420
If you are still...

346
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,380
It's been a long time,

347
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,900
yet I still want to ask you.

348
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:08,140
When we were at Xuanling Continent,

349
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,619
were your feelings towards me

350
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:13,579
genuine?

351
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:20,380
They were genuine feelings of
Young Master Lian Cheng.

352
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:33,140
But now,

353
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:33,859
I am Mo...

354
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,020
I'm heading back.

355
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:37,660
Don't forget what you promised me.

356
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,060
Tomorrow...

357
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,540
Tomorrow, I'll wait for you here

358
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,380
so that you can continue to treat me.

359
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,780
Cheng Cheng.

360
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,060
You're back.

361
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:16,060
Come on.

362
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,300
See what I've made for you.

363
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,500
It's your favorite

364
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,099
braised carp

365
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,260
and steamed shrimp.

366
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,339
What do you think?

367
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:28,819
There are more here.

368
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,939
Desserts I made for you myself.

369
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,500
I've got the bath water ready too.

370
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:34,540
Do you want to

371
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,380
eat first

372
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,579
or shower first?

373
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,540
What?

374
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:43,660
Don't tell me...

375
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:45,300
that you're too used to being Prince Consort

376
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,900
and are weak to me spoiling you?

377
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,660
Are you still the Tan Er I know?

378
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:51,619
Or am I dreaming?

379
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:52,619
Of course, I'm Tan Er.

380
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,540
Come on, sit down.

381
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:57,739
Tell me.

382
00:30:58,739 --> 00:30:59,459
Did everything

383
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,380
go well today?

384
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:02,859
We just reminisced about the old days.

385
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,060
But

386
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:05,780
she was suspicious of your real identity.

387
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,420
Reminiscing...

388
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,619
That's good to hear.

389
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,140
It has been so long since it happened.

390
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,219
You do need to reminiscence about it.

391
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:21,060
That's right.

392
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:23,020
Otherwise, it'd be so awkward.

393
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,739
Here.

394
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:29,420
Try this dessert I made for you.

395
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:32,219
Since Tan Er is so well-behaved,

396
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:34,540
I'll tell you a bit more information.

397
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,939
You don't need to tell me anything

398
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,219
too detailed...

399
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:40,780
I just

400
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,859
revisited everything

401
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,579
that we did before.

402
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,859
Revisited everything?

403
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:52,660
There are some things

404
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,300
that we can't revisit in broad daylight.

405
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,459
So I'll go meet her

406
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:57,300
in her bedchamber at night.

407
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,699
Mo Lian Cheng!

408
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,300
You're going too far!

409
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:01,459
I thought that

410
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,260
I could be more considerate

411
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,219
and give you some space so that
you can deal with it yourself.

412
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,219
But do you think

413
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,819
I'm a pushover?

414
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,260
You were teasing me on purpose?

415
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:15,739
Calm down.

416
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,819
If I didn't say so,

417
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:18,979
would you be able to

418
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,339
release all of your anger?

419
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,060
So that means that

420
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,739
you guys didn't revisit anything?

421
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:26,099
Nothing at all.

422
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,939
But

423
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,180
I don't think she's someone
who will let things go easily.

424
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,380
Perhaps

425
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:34,219
my complicated relationship with her

426
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,459
is the key for us

427
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,099
to return to our world.

428
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:41,339
Since you promised her you will cure her,

429
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:43,420
then you must keep your promise.

430
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:46,540
But

431
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:49,540
it will take some time

432
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:51,699
for her injuries to be cured.

433
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,219
Is it difficult?

434
00:32:58,939 --> 00:32:59,699
Tan Er,

435
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:01,579
the hardest step

436
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:03,339
is this last step.

437
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:07,180
The two of us need to be locked up together

438
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,859
for seven days and seven nights in a private room.

439
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:11,939
And we need to

440
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:13,540
have our clothes off

441
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,500
so that my pure chi of Yang

442
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,420
can mix with her.

443
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,739
Mo Lian Cheng, do you want to die?

444
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:24,500
Are you looking for a beating?

445
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:25,459
I...

446
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:27,420
enjoy seeing your jealous face.

447
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,939
Don't know if I should say you have good taste

448
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:31,180
or strange taste.

449
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:35,180
Then...

450
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,099
how about I go with you?

451
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,140
No.

452
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,540
Absolutely do not

453
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:43,660
act recklessly.

454
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,579
I can't even see for myself

455
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:49,500
how I get cheated on.

456
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,659
Every time I hear this song,

457
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,219
our past stands before me

458
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,340
like a dagger

459
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,340
and cuts wounds in my mind and heart.

460
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:37,100
But if it weren't for the sound of the flute,

461
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,020
I would never be able to fall asleep.

462
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,860
Your Majesty

463
00:34:45,939 --> 00:34:48,139
taught me this song.

464
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,780
I shouldn't have passed this
Soul-parting Flute to you,

465
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,699
but at that time,

466
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,820
you were the only one with me.

467
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,139
Who else could I pass it on to?

468
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,780
Your Majesty, you still remember.

469
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:12,699
I'm tired.

470
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,179
When you leave,

471
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:16,500
leave the Soul-parting Flute here.

472
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,820
I need to use it tomorrow.

473
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:11,340
<i>To you, the Soul-parting Flute</i>

474
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:14,260
<i>represents the memories you had with him.</i>

475
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,060
<i>But to me,</i>

476
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:22,060
<i>it also represents the memories we had.</i>

477
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:32,860
Your Majesty, your illness

478
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:34,860
is due to injuries to your circulatory system.

479
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,699
Besides taking medicine every day,

480
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,659
you need to use the sound of the zither

481
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,179
to soothe your frustration.

482
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,060
Why did Her Majesty call me here?

483
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,260
This is a booklist

484
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,179
Her Majesty made for you, Your Highness.

485
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,379
Please read it over carefully,

486
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:03,540
Crown Princess.

487
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,500
<i>That's my Cheng Cheng.</i>

488
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:31,699
<i>Based on what I see, their distance</i>

489
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,780
<i>is the normal social distance
between a doctor and his patient.</i>

490
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
<i>The Soul-parting Flute.</i>

491
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,780
The Soul-parting Flute.

492
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,939
Crown Princess,

493
00:38:03,979 --> 00:38:05,659
how do you know about the Soul-parting Flute?

494
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,300
Father once mentioned it when I was a kid,

495
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:11,379
so I recognize it.

496
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,100
I'll read the books on this list carefully.

497
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:35,979
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

498
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:37,780
Since the string is broken,

499
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,219
I have no choice but come to

500
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,780
treat Your Majesty at another time.

501
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:46,300
I will take my leave now.

502
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:11,780
How could you speak about
the Soul-parting Flute out loud?

503
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,419
Good lord.

504
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:15,020
I somehow managed to gloss it over.

505
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,300
Is my explanation just now

506
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,060
alright?

507
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Deceive him?

508
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,340
He's a very paranoid person.

509
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:20,739
He will never believe your explanation

510
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,219
and will definitely make some preparations.

511
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:26,060
But after this,

512
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:28,500
I'm suddenly enlightened.

513
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:30,060
Suddenly enlightened?

514
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,780
Yes.

515
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:34,459
The only person that knows how to play

516
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,939
the Soul-parting Flute is the chief

517
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:37,459
of the Qu Clan in Xuanling Continent.

518
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,060
Liu Qian Shui gave you the sheet music

519
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,820
and you were able to teach yourself.

520
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,020
That is precisely because

521
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,459
you are the descendant

522
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,540
of the chief of the Qu Clan from that world.

523
00:39:45,939 --> 00:39:46,860
And she

524
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,979
is the Qu Xiang Tan from a parallel universe.

525
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,179
The Young Master Lian Cheng

526
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:52,020
that fell in love with her is also the
Lian Cheng of that parallel universe.

527
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,179
It was not me.

528
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,459
Then that means

529
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,860
there's nothing

530
00:39:55,899 --> 00:39:57,100
between you and the empress.

531
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,500
Theoretically,

532
00:40:01,939 --> 00:40:03,620
that is so.

533
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,379
But it is no lie that I've played

534
00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:07,100
the song, Love's Reflection, before.

535
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,820
What the Young Master Lian Cheng

536
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,020
from the parallel universe did,

537
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,540
I also did.

538
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,699
So even if I'm from

539
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:15,179
another parallel universe,

540
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:17,300
I can't pretend that she is

541
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:19,100
a complete stranger to me.

542
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,020
After all this talking,

543
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,179
you're saying you still have to face it.

544
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,100
Hope that it wasn't because of
this star-crossed fate

545
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:29,300
that the Soul-guarding Bead brought us here.

546
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:41,139
Qu Tan Er...

547
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,179
How could she recognize the Soul-parting Flute?

548
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,139
Your Majesty.

549
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,100
Have you really mentioned it to Qu Jiang Lin?

550
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,060
Qu Jiang Lin

551
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,419
does not even know of the existence
of the Soul-parting Flute.

552
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,100
Your Majesty.

553
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,419
As I expected,

554
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:57,699
this Qu Tan Er

555
00:40:57,739 --> 00:40:58,699
has a mysterious background.

556
00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:01,979
Find out who she is

557
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,500
as soon as possible.

558
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:04,540
Yes, Your Majesty.
