Every person...

18
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,119
has only one heart.

19
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,440
I've let you down in the end.

20
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,160
Tan!

21
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,559
You're finally back.

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
Did Her Majesty mistreat you?

23
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,080
You must be starving.

24
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,199
I'll get you some supper.

25
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,279
Never mind.

26
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,440
I'm exhausted.

27
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,360
Dismiss.

28
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,600
I don't need the supper either.

29
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,760
Tan Er!

30
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,200
Liu Bai Shui told me

31
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,959
your life could be in danger.

32
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,880
I'm glad you're safe.

33
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,799
What did he say?

34
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,720
Nothing in particular.

35
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:39,600
I'm glad you are all right.

36
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,799
Was it

37
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,640
Xiao Zhen who sent you back?

38
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
Tan Er.

39
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,480
I failed to keep you safe.

40
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,079
I'm sorry that you had to go through this.

41
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,399
Cheng Cheng.

42
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,480
What happened to your hand?

43
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,399
It's nothing.

44
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,959
It was an accident.

45
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
<i>Tan Er's kiss</i>

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,720

47
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
What is it?

48
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,160
Nothing.

49
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,959
I was mesmerized by your charm.

50
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,920
<i>I've been observing.</i>

51
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,559
<i>There wouldn't be any mistake.</i>

52
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,239
Are you not feeling well?

53
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,760
I spent days in prison.

54
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,559
I was in constant fear.

55
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,359
I need time to calm my nerves.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,880
Feel my hand.

57
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,399
It's icy cold.

58
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,839
Is this warm enough for you?

59
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:53,920
<i>I can barely remember</i>

60
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,880
<i>the last time I smiled with such joy.</i>

<i>Lian Cheng, you gave me everything.</i>

62
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,480
<i>I don't want to lose it again.</i>

63
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:01,839
Promise me.

64
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,519
No matter what happens,

65
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,799
don't leave me.

66
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,839
Silly.

67
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,920
I promise.

68
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,239
Pinky swear.

69
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,600
<i>This must be Qu Tan Er's childish trick.</i>

70
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,040
<i>Pinky swear.</i>

71
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,519
Forever and always.

74

76
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,960
Get rid of the mirrors!

77
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't want to see any of them here!

78
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,280
Get it done!

79
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,799
What's wrong?

80
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,960
Why would you want the mirrors removed?

81
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,000
I was in prison for so long.

82
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,000
The moment I saw my reflection,

83
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,320
I realized how much I've aged.

84
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,880
I'll get rid of them for you.

85
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,960
Out of sight, out of mind.

86
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,119
Your Highness.

87
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
Your Highness has been summoned to the palace.

88
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,840
Understood.

89
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,840
As decreed by Her Majesty,

90
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,359
the ruler of the Xihe regime,

91
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,000
this announcement shall be made public.

92
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,919
Her Majesty humbly succeeded

93
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,960
the ancestors' legacy.

94
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,599
Continuous exhaustion from the state affairs
had taken a toll on Her Majesty.

95
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,000
Her Majesty's health was deteriorating.

96
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,239
However,

97
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,799
the nation and its people

98
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,200
need a ruler to lead them.

99
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,359
Crown Princess Qu Tan Er

100
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,599
is virtuous and wise.

101
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,359
Her Highness

102
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
will unit the people of this country.

103
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,559
Crown Princess will succeed the throne

104
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,200
as the next Empress.

105
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,000
The funeral shall be minimalist.

106
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,719
Her Majesty shall be mourned for five days.

107
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,320
This shall be the announcement

108
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,440
for all people.

109
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,239
I am aware

110
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,039
that I'm not as wise as Her Majesty.

111
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,000
I shall devote myself to the duties

112
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,280
and live up to Her Majesty's expectation.

113
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,840
Official Sun.

114
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,359
When did Her Majesty pass away?

115
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,239
This morning during the period
from five to seven.

116
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,640
Who was with Her Majesty

117
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,159
at that time?

118
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,080
Official Xiao,

119
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,119
Imperial Physician Li,

120
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,640
and several servants.

121
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,799
Where is Official Xiao?

122
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:26,799
The loss broke his heart and mind.

123
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,479
He chose to join Her Majesty in the afterlife.

124
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,719
Eldest Sister,

125
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,679
you wish to know other information, don't you?

126
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,840
Her Majesty's passing was too sudden.

127
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,799
And with only a handful of people
looking after her,

128
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,479
things don't add up.

129
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,960
Shouldn't we find out what really happened?

130
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,640
Her Majesty only passed away hours ago.

131
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,799
Yet I do not see a tint of sadness

132
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,320
on your expression.

133
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,840
But you raise one question after another.

134
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,119
How disrespectful!

135
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,919
I was merely concerned about
Her Majesty's passing.

136
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,359
You should be worried about yourself.

137
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,960
Unless you want me to rake over the ashes,

138
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,640
I suggest you get out now.

139
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:02,225
<i>Princess's Residence</i>

140
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,640
Cheng Cheng.

141
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,719
Cheng Cheng.

142
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,840
I'm going to have the throne soon.

143
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,640
You will soon become

144
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,479
the top of the harem.

145
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,919
I was told you behave like Her Majesty

146
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,679
in the main hall.

147
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,880
How was my acting?

148
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,280
Had I not done so,

149
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Qu Mei Er would never stop bothering me.

150
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,440
Her Majesty passed away,

151
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,719
but you don't seem surprised at all.

152
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,719
When we visited her,

153
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,960
she was already ill.

154
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,760
We knew she was dying.

155
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,599
I feel sorry for her,

156
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,919
but I'm not surprised.

157
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,080
What about the five days of mourning?

158
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,840
Her Majesty ordered you

159
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,960
to mourn only for five days,

160
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,520
why would she

161
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,440
be in such a hurry to let you take over?

162
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,520
Perhaps Her Majesty knew

163
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,799
the court was in disorder

164
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,119
and there were other factions

165
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,440
brewing their plans.

166
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,400
You answered everything with ease.

167
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,000
You don't act like the silly Tan Er I knew.

168
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,479
I'm not silly.

169
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,919
If Her Majesty didn't teach me all these,

170
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,719
I wouldn't know at all.

171
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,799
Do you

172
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,440
still remember our promise?

173
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,599
If you become Empress...

174
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,719
I remember.

175
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,719
For every right that women have,

176
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,400
every man shall have it too.

177
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,080
After the reformation,

178
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,719
we can finally go home

179
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,599
when the Red Star of Demise arrives

180
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,440
and reunite with Yu Er.

181
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,359
It's been so long.

182
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,280
I wonder if he has grown up.

183
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,280
<i>Did he just say the two of them</i>

184
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,119
<i>were going back to a different world?</i>

185
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,919
<i>Could that Yu Er be their son?</i>

186
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,080
Yes.

187
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,320
It's been too long since I last saw him.

188
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,599
I miss him a lot.

189
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,719
<i>That kid is nothing but a worthless child.</i>

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,760
<i>How is it worth it to return just for him?</i>

191
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,159
<i>I will figure something out</i>

192
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,799
<i>to make you stay in this place willingly</i>

193
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,280
<i>and start a new life with me.</i>

194
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,119
She asked Jing Xin

195
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,599
to remove all the mirrors?

196
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,479
Yes.

197
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,719
Her Highness's condition

198
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
is getting restless.

199
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,679
Not only is she wary of Jing Xin,

200
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,119
but she also thinks someone is watching her.

201
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,919
Don't you think she seems

202
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,440
like an entirely different person sometimes?

203
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,799
I don't understand.

204
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,880
Tan Er's condition

205
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:21,799
is far worse

206
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,320
than the trauma from her imprisonment.

207
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,599
I'm afraid

208
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,239
there are other causes.

209
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:28,000
What do you plan to do?

210
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,799
To find the answers.

211
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,320
Stop right there!

212
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,640
Get out of our way.

213
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,919
Greetings, Your Highness.

214
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,320
Do you admit your crime?

215
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,760
I don't understand.

216
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,599
Was Crown Princess

217
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,559
released back to the Snow Court directly?

218
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,239
Prince Consort, please have mercy on us!

219
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,679
It was Official Xiao who took her.

220
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,159
Official Xiao?

221
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,320
Where did he take her?

222
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,320
Official Xiao told me nothing.

223
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,960
Do you understand your crime

224
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,799
will warrant a death sentence

225
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,840
to your entire clan
when she ascends to the throne?

226
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,799
All I know was

227
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,400
that they went to the imperial chamber.

228
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,520
As for the rest,

229
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,320
I know nothing.

230
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,760
Please have mercy on us!

231
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,440
I knew it.

232
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,359
They were meeting Her Majesty.

233
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,159
Inside the imperial chamber,

234
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,280
there is only one place that is suspicious.

235
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,520
Her Highness is about to move here.

236
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,479
I have been ordered to inspect the house.

237
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,159
Open the door.

238
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,400
Prince Consort.

239
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,080
By the law,

240
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,760
there must be no inspection
before the coronation.

241
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,200
Do you mean

242
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,679
that Her Highness's order

243
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,080
wasn't good enough as a royal decree?

244
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,440
Is that why you are disobeying her?

245
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,599
I meant no disrespect.

246
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,400
I'll ask this one last time.

247
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,159
Stand aside!

248
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,799
Even if Her Highness was brought here,

249
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,000
the traces

250
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,039
would have already been wiped clean.

251
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,880
Young Master...

252
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,680
This is the remnant

253
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,280
of the burned Glacial Soulweed.

254
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,920
Glacial Soulweed?

255
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,719
It grows in the Xuanling Continent.

256
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,000
It's rare anywhere else.

257
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,680
It has unique properties.

258
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:32,280
Well...

259
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,239
The most unique effect it has

260
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,479
is enabling the host of Soul-guarding Bead
to take over another person's body.

261
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,479
But the price

262
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,880
is human sacrifice.

263
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,400
Put out the candles.

264
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,640
Young Master.

265
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,719
These shimmering specks of dust

266
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,560
are the disintegrated flesh

267
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,719
of the human sacrifice used in the ritual.

268
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,800
I finally understand why

269
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,520
Xiao Zhen

270
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,479
passed away with Her Majesty.

271
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,040
Young Master.

272
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,920
Someone is coming.

273
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,239
Let's head back.

274
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,075
<i>Princess's Residence</i>

275
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,760
Young Master.

276
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,680
Our investigation last night

277
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:10,839
didn't bear any result.

278
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,680
Tonight, should we go...

279
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,359
No.

280
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,839
Our frequent visits to that place

281
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,560
will draw her suspicion.

282
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:19,719
Remember.

283
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,280
We must not alert her.

284
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,439
There is something I don't understand.

285
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,880
Where would the original soul go

286
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,079
after another soul

287
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,719
has taken over the body?

288
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,640
The original soul?

289
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,439
I merely

290
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,079
fell from the wall

291
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,040
by accident.

292
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,959
I'm fine.

293
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,160
Tan Er's consciousness

294
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,040
is still inside the same body.

295
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:53,800
However,

296
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,359
Her Majesty is suppressing her.

297
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,479
She can only take control

298
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,760
indirectly at times.

299
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,400
I understand now

300
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,079
why she asked Jing Xin

301
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:06,959
to remove all the mirrors.

302
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,040
This must be the real reason.

303
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,199
We have half an hour

304
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,599
to redecorate the living room.

305
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,560
Don't let anyone notice it.

306
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,040
Yes.

307
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,400
This is how it goes.

309
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:38,040
Admit it.

310
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,719
You're not the real Tan Er.

311
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,599
Indeed.

312
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,880
I am Qu Xiang Tan.

313
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,760
Qu Tan Er's body

314
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
has always been mine to use.

315
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,319
Your voice...

316
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,400
Yes. You can tell by it.

317
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,719
This meddlesome girl's consciousness

318
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,640
will soon fade into oblivion.

319
00:21:57,239 --> 00:22:00,319
<i>Cheng Cheng! Save me! Cheng Cheng!</i>

320
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:00,920
Tan Er!

321
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,040
Can you hear me?

322
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,800
I'm right here.

323
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:04,839
Come out!

324
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
Stop yelling!

325
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,000
Her mind is weaker than mine.

326
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,439
Even with these mirrors,

327
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,359
she won't last for long.

328
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,040
<i>Cheng Cheng! Cheng Cheng! Save me!</i>

329
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,599
<i>Cheng Cheng!</i>

330
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,599
<i>Cheng Cheng!</i>

331
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,120
Tan Er!

332
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,800
<i>Cheng Cheng!</i>

333
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,119
You hear me, right?

334
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,280
Tan Er, is that you?

335
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,119
<i>It's me.</i>

336
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,000
Is that you, Tan Er?

337
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,839
<i>Cheng Cheng!</i>

338
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:36,959
Stop it!

339
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,160
No.

340
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,319
You can't afford to kill her.

341
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,479
You still need this body.

342
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,400
Indeed.

343
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,079
But I couldn't care if this body
is covered in wounds.

344
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,280
What about you?

345
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,920
I hope you always keep this in mind.

346
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,319
Two souls

347
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,599
share this body at the moment.

348
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,239
Behave and do as I say...

349
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,719
if you don't want her to suffer.

350
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:33,760
Do you really think

351
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,560
using her life as leverage

352
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,280
can make me bow to your will?

353
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,719
Listen closely.

354
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,560
You might as well end her life.

355
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:46,959
I will join her in the afterlife.

356
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,560
I will be with her in heaven or hell.

357
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,199
Play along with this act.

358
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,359
Outsiders

359
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,119
shouldn't know my true identity.

360
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,520
Otherwise...

361
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,160
the consequences will be severe.

362
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,000
Tan Er.

363
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:30,775
<i>Princess's Residence</i>

364
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,160
Since the date is fixed,

365
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,079
Official Sun will be in charge

366
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,280
of the preparation for my coronation.

367
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,319
Yes, Your Highness.

368
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,560
Unfortunately,

369
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,800
I have a relapse from a previous disease.

370
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,719
I'm afraid I couldn't make it to attend the ceremony.

371
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,640
It doesn't matter.

372
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,319
I will

373
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,479
have the proper arrangement for you.

374
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,599
Even if you're bedridden,

375
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:03,000
I will have the guards carry you there.

376
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:03,800
You...

377
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,680
Now that you are part of the court,

378
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,239
not only do you refuse to kneel

379
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,160
before Crown Princess,

380
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,079
you even disrespected me with your ill manner.

381
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,560
Do you wish

382
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,920
to be buried in a casket

383
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,119
before my coronation?

384
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,359
You even dare to take my life?

385
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Of course I wouldn't.

386
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,719
I'm not you.

387
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:31,640
I'm not foolish enough to attempt
an assassination before my coronation.

388
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,599
Even if I was,

389
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:36,520
I wouldn't leave any traces

390
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,319
as some simpleton once did.

391
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,400
However,

392
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,800
I can't say the same for these people.

393
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,040
They only respect you, Eldest Sister,

394
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,479
and have no respect for me.

395
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,680
They are also corrupted to the core

396
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,719
by taking from the people.

397
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,920
I think...

398
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,160
it's time for them to meet their demise.

399
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,119
Guards.

400
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,439
Execute all of them.

401
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,319
Your Highness, have mercy on us!

402
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,079
Qu Tan Er!

403
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,800
Are you going to disobey my order

404
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,439
over some sinful officers?

405
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,319
Do not give me more reasons

406
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,680
to take your life.

407
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,959
Eldest Sister.

408
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,400
What more do you have to say?

409
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,079
I was out of line a moment ago.

410
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:47,959
I humbly ask for Your Highness's forgiveness.

411
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,439
On the Prayer Ritual to Heaven,

412
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,079
I will

413
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,520
send my blessing to the new Empress.

414
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,520
In that case,

415
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,000
everyone may leave

416
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,839
and start preparing now.

417
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,560
Yes.

418
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,280
Stay, Eldest Sister.

419
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,800
There is something

420
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,000
only you can settle.

421
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,920
Your Highness,

422
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,280
how may I be of service?

423
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,239
I need you to eliminate the rebel leader,

424
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:57,079
Mo Yuan Long.

425
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,160
You two were conspiring against the throne.

426
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,479
I found out about it a long time ago.

427
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,880
As for Mo Yuan Long's plans
and evidence of his crime,

428
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,800
I need you

429
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,839
to hand them over.

430
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,160
Dismiss.

431
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:49,119
Eliminating Mo Yuan Long?

432
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,959
Why would Tan do such a cruel thing to the Mo family?

433
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,479
Judging by her tone just now...

434
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,280
No.

435
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,719
<i>Tan has been acting strange lately.</i>

436
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,640
<i>I must tell Prince Consort.</i>

437
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:26,920
Prince Consort.

438
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:28,839
I have

439
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,800
something to report.

440
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,079
I was passing by the study.

441
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,920
I overheard a conversation

442
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
that the Mo family might...

443
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,160
Perhaps

444
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,560
I got it wrong.

445
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,160
You heard it right.

446
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,319
What will happen to the Mo family?

447
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,680
Tell me.

448
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,239
How can you be sure I didn't hear it wrong?

449
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,599
Did you expect her to do such a thing?

450
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,479
So she isn't the real Tan!

451
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,800
It's Her Majesty.

452
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,520
It's Her Majesty who had just passed away.

453
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,319
Her Majesty?

454
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,359
What about Tan?

455
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:24,040
Where is Tan now?

456
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,920
Is Tan already...

457
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:30,959
No.

458
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,520
I must save Princess!

459
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,959
Let go of me!

460
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,800
If we could take her life,

461
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
your blade wouldn't be needed.

462
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,160
Her Highness is still in there.

463
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,680
She is still inside that body.

464
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,359
We cannot harm her at the moment.

465
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:45,760
You two knew this all along?

466
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,359
If you knew this all along,

467
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,040
why didn't you tell me?

468
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:50,599
We kept you in the dark

469
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,560
because you are with her all the time.

470
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,800
If you knew,

471
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,400
you would draw her suspicion.

472
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,760
If you didn't know,

473
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,479
it would be for the best.

474
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,400
What do we do now?

475
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,040
How can we save Tan from her?

476
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,520
Be by her side.

477
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,959
Pretending nothing had happened.

478
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,680
She started to suspect me.

479
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,520
Yu Hao

480
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
can't approach her at all times.

481
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,560
You're the only one

482
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,319
who can stay by her side,

483
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:24,479
pretend as if nothing had happened,

484
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,599
find out more about her

485
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,199
and find her weakness.

486
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,760
Can you do this?

487
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,800
Yes.

488
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,319
I can do it.

489
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,040
But what about the Mo family?

490
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,520
From what I heard,

491
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,680
she seemed to have evidence about
the Mo family's plan for rebellion.

492
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,640
Fourteenth Young Master is in the residence.

493
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,640
And Eldest Young Master too.

494
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,079
Can you talk her out of this?

495
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:47,959
If I did it,

496
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:50,280
nothing would change,

497
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,359
and she would even be more alert.

498
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,680
Right now,

499
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:54,640
we must inform my father

500
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,800
as soon as possible,

501
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,119
so he can be ready.

502
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,199
Perhaps

503
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,760
we can weaken her power with this.

504
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,800
Then we'll have better leverage

505
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,199
to negotiate with her.

506
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,079
Okay.

507
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:04,040
I'll get to it now.

508
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,040
Wait.

509
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,439
You mustn't go.

510
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,479
Once you are gone,

511
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,719
she must notice.

512
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,239
Yu Hao.

513
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,400
You should do it.

514
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,439
Yes.

515
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,119
Jing Xin.

516
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,920
Tell me.

517
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:17,880
What did you overhear just now?

518
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I need the details.

519
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:19,880
Okay.

520
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:30,275
<i>Mo Residence</i>

521
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,319
I know you hate to see me right now.

522
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:43,359
But this is urgent.

523
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,239
I must speak to you.

524
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:55,439
Qu Tan Er talked to me.

525
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,920
What have you done to her?

526
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,959
What have I done to her?

527
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,280
Forget it.

528
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,560
She knows your father's plan.

529
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,959
She questioned me.

530
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,479
I told her everything.

531
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,040
You told her my father's grand plan?

532
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,719
I had no choice.

533
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,680
The Capital Guards will no longer
cooperate with the plan.

534
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,560
Our only chance now

535
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,640
is to employ another strategy

536
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,640
to thwart the tyrannical Qu Tan Er now.

537
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,199
Only then can we survive
and keep the Mo family safe.

538
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:35,040
You plan to use the Mo family

539
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,199
as your scapegoat to take out Qu Tan Er!

540
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,520
I know you hold a grudge against me.

541
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,320
What will I gain now

542
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,120
by telling you lies?

543
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:50,159
Even if your father overthrows her,

544
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,639
he will disempower me when he has no use of me later.

545
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,080
I came here

546
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,199
not only out of my guilt for you,

547
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,840
but also out of my fear

548
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:00,520
for Qu Tan Er's cruelty now.

549
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,919
She means to wipe out the whole Mo family.

550
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,080
Is this really Tan Er's plan?

551
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,320
Trust me.

552
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:09,399
That person

553
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:10,479
isn't the Tan Er we knew.

554
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,959
She isn't the other Tan Er either.

555
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,600
Or maybe

556
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,760
she is no longer

557
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,840
the same person we once knew.

558
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,600
She acts like the late Empress

559
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,840
more than anything.

560
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,360
Even if I believe you,

561
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,439
that doesn't mean we will share
a relationship in the future.

562
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,600
After today,

563
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,239
we will still be strangers to each other.

564
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:48,120
I thought so as well.

565
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,800
I came to tell you all of this...

566
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,719
only to make the rest of my life

567
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,560
pass with less guilt.

568
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,439
That's all there is to it.

569
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,360
Take care.

570
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,760
If you lost your life because of this,

571
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
I would be in your debt again.

572
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,439
As long as we sever all ties,

573
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,479
we don't owe each other anything.

574
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,159
In this lifetime or the next,

575
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,719
as long as you don't ask to settle the score,

576
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,479
I will ask nothing of you.

577
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:56,360
We hate each other now.

578
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,879
Let our grudge

579
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,600
along with love...

580
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:05,439

Qu Tan Er barely has much influence.

This is our chance to strike.

591
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,080
Mr. Mo, you are right.

592
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,760
With Eldest Princess as our informant,

593
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,600
we can proceed with this plan.

594
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,040
Father!

595
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,199
Who let you in?

596
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:03,719
Dismiss!

597
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,399
Yu Hao has important news for you.

598
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:06,679
My Lord.

599
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,040
Young Master has a message for you.

600
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:08,879
He said

601
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,560
that Her Highness might already
knew Mo family's plan of attack.

602
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,639
Her Highness is ready to strike at any time.

603
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,560
Young Master hopes

604
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,399
you make some changes to the plan.

605
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,840
Mr. Mo.

606
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,520
This is...

607
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,080
Calm down.

608
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,399
Your Eighth Brother and Qu Tan Er

609
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:24,719
are on the same side.

610
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,800
They share benefits and losses together.

611
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:28,560
His information

612
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,520
cannot be trusted.

613
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,600
Father.

614
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,679
Eighth Brother would never send Yu Hao to lie to you.

615
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,439
It's better

616
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,639
to be ready than to be sorry.

617
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:35,600
What do you know?

618
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,679
This is a critical moment.

619
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,919
Do not bring disorder to my troops!

620
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,199
Dismiss!

621
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:41,120
Father!

622
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,199
I talked to Eldest Princess.

623
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,239
She told me the Capital Guards

624
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,320
wouldn't cooperate with us.

625
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:50,320
We need another strategy.

626
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,959
It seems I have no choice

627
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,360
but to alter our plan.

628
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,399
The information from Eldest Princess

629
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,560
matches with Yu Hao's.

630
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,560
Yu Hao.

631
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:10,320
I got the information.

632
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:11,479
You may return now.

633
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,439
Yes.

634
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:16,159
Mr. Mo.

635
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,679
How should we proceed?

636
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,560
General Lu.

637
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,360
You have the yin imperial token.

638
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,919
I must ask you to risk your life

639
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,560
to prove that the late Empress was killed

640
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,760
and subdue the uprising.

641
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,439
By doing so, we'll be saved.

642
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,800
Are you willing to do that?

643
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,840
For the people of Dongyue,

644
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:37,840
I will

645
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:39,040
take this mission.

646
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,959
Good.

647
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,679
Everyone,

648
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:43,600
we shall set out now.

649
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:45,439
Inform our allies at the borders.

650
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,439
Order them to march to the capital now

651
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:47,399
for one last battle.

652
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,439
Time is not on our side.

653
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:49,280
Do it now.

654
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:50,520
Yes.

655
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,439
This residence is no longer safe for us.

656
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,399
Qu Tan Er would never hurt Lian Cheng.

657
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,120
But yours and Jing Xuan's safety

658
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,919
is still a concern for me.

659
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:05,919
Both of you

660
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:06,840
should seek shelter outside the city.

661
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:07,879
When the battle is over,

662
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:09,439
we'll make further arrangements.

663
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,199
Father.

664
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,479
In this critical moment,

665
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,280
I cannot leave you behind.

666
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,679
I'm the eldest son of the Mo family.

667
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,639
I shall fight by your side.

668
00:39:20,879 --> 00:39:21,719
Very well.

669
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,360
If things go south,

670
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:26,000
meet me at the Luomei Pavilion
of the eastern suburb.

671
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,399
Yes.

672
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,000
You shall leave the city.

673
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:33,919
Father.

674
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,159
I'll stay too.

675
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,280
You will only get in the way of my plan.

676
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:39,239
Do you understand?

677
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,239
Fourteenth.

678
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,120
At least one of our Mo family must survive.

679
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,199
You are leaving

680
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,600
not for your life,

681
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:48,080
but our family's bloodline.

682
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,919
In that case,

683
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,000
I will follow your order.

684
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,725
<i>Mo Residence</i>

685
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,639
The men we sent out

686
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,280
should have reported in.

687
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:06,879
What is taking them so long?

688
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,199
My Lord!

689
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:11,719
My Lord!

690
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,719
Bad news!

691
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,439
Troops of imperial guards

692
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,760
are marching this way.

693
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,239
They are going to surround the Mo residence.

694
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,080
Do not tell Yan Chen

695
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,959
about this for now.

696
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,000
Order Yun Ying to take him
out of this house now!

697
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,199
Through the back door.

698
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,639
Yes!
