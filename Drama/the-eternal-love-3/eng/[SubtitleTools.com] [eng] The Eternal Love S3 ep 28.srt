Every person...

18
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,619
has only one heart.

19
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,940
I've let you down in the end.

20
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:51,660
Tan!

21
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,059
You're finally back.

22
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,580
Did Her Majesty mistreat you?

23
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,580
You must be starving.

24
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,699
I'll get you some supper.

25
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:57,779
Never mind.

26
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,940
I'm exhausted.

27
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:04,860
Dismiss.

28
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,100
I don't need the supper either.

29
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,260
Tan Er!

30
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:58,700
Liu Bai Shui told me

31
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,459
your life could be in danger.

32
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,380
I'm glad you're safe.

33
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,299
What did he say?

34
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:08,220
Nothing in particular.

35
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,100
I'm glad you are all right.

36
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,299
Was it

37
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,140
Xiao Zhen who sent you back?

38
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
Tan Er.

39
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,980
I failed to keep you safe.

40
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,579
I'm sorry that you had to go through this.

41
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:40,899
Cheng Cheng.

42
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:51,980
What happened to your hand?

43
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:53,899
It's nothing.

44
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,459
It was an accident.

45
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,100
<i>Tan Er's kiss</i>

46
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,220

47
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,220
What is it?

48
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:16,660
Nothing.

49
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,459
I was mesmerized by your charm.

50
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,420
<i>I've been observing.</i>

51
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,059
<i>There wouldn't be any mistake.</i>

52
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:44,739
Are you not feeling well?

53
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:48,260
I spent days in prison.

54
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,059
I was in constant fear.

55
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:53,859
I need time to calm my nerves.

56
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,380
Feel my hand.

57
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,899
It's icy cold.

58
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,339
Is this warm enough for you?

59
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:25,420
<i>I can barely remember</i>

60
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,380
<i>the last time I smiled with such joy.</i>

61
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,540
<i>Lian Cheng, you gave me everything.</i>

62
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:31,980
<i>I don't want to lose it again.</i>

63
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:33,339
Promise me.

64
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,019
No matter what happens,

65
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,299
don't leave me.

66
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,339
Silly.

67
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,420
I promise.

68
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,739
Pinky swear.

69
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,100
<i>This must be Qu Tan Er's childish trick.</i>

70
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:51,540
<i>Pinky swear.</i>

71
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,019
Forever and always.

<i>Princess's Residence</i>

73
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,100

74
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,520
<i>Cheng Cheng, save me</i>

75

Jing Xin!

76
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:34,460
Get rid of the mirrors!

77
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,500
I don't want to see any of them here!

78
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,780
Get it done!

79
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,299
What's wrong?

80
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,460
Why would you want the mirrors removed?

81
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,500
I was in prison for so long.

82
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:48,500
The moment I saw my reflection,

83
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:50,820
I realized how much I've aged.

84
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,380
I'll get rid of them for you.

85
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:08,460
Out of sight, out of mind.

86
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:11,619
Your Highness.

87
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:14,539
Your Highness has been summoned to the palace.

88
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:22,340
Understood.

89
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,340
As decreed by Her Majesty,

90
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,859
the ruler of the Xihe regime,

91
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,500
this announcement shall be made public.

92
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,419
Her Majesty humbly succeeded

93
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:54,460
the ancestors' legacy.

94
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,099
Continuous exhaustion from the state affairs
had taken a toll on Her Majesty.

95
00:09:58,179 --> 00:09:59,500
Her Majesty's health was deteriorating.

96
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,739
However,

97
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:02,299
the nation and its people

98
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,700
need a ruler to lead them.

99
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,859
Crown Princess Qu Tan Er

100
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,099
is virtuous and wise.

101
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:09,859
Her Highness

102
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,700
will unit the people of this country.

103
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,059
Crown Princess will succeed the throne

104
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,700
as the next Empress.

105
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:17,500
The funeral shall be minimalist.

106
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:19,219
Her Majesty shall be mourned for five days.

107
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,820
This shall be the announcement

108
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,940
for all people.

109
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:31,739
I am aware

110
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:33,539
that I'm not as wise as Her Majesty.

111
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,500
I shall devote myself to the duties

112
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,780
and live up to Her Majesty's expectation.

113
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,340
Official Sun.

114
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:44,859
When did Her Majesty pass away?

115
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,739
This morning during the period
from five to seven.

116
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:48,140
Who was with Her Majesty

117
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,659
at that time?

118
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,580
Official Xiao,

119
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,619
Imperial Physician Li,

120
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,140
and several servants.

121
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:56,299
Where is Official Xiao?

122
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:58,299
The loss broke his heart and mind.

123
00:10:58,419 --> 00:10:59,979
He chose to join Her Majesty in the afterlife.

124
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,219
Eldest Sister,

125
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,179
you wish to know other information, don't you?

126
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,340
Her Majesty's passing was too sudden.

127
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,299
And with only a handful of people
looking after her,

128
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:12,979
things don't add up.

129
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:16,460
Shouldn't we find out what really happened?

130
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:25,140
Her Majesty only passed away hours ago.

131
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,299
Yet I do not see a tint of sadness

132
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,820
on your expression.

133
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,340
But you raise one question after another.

134
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,619
How disrespectful!

135
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:38,419
I was merely concerned about
Her Majesty's passing.

136
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,859
You should be worried about yourself.

137
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:52,460
Unless you want me to rake over the ashes,

138
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,140
I suggest you get out now.

139
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:33,725
<i>Princess's Residence</i>

140
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,140
Cheng Cheng.

141
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,219
Cheng Cheng.

142
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,340
I'm going to have the throne soon.

143
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,140
You will soon become

144
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,979
the top of the harem.

145
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,419
I was told you behave like Her Majesty

146
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,179
in the main hall.

147
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,380
How was my acting?

148
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,780
Had I not done so,

149
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
Qu Mei Er would never stop bothering me.

150
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,940
Her Majesty passed away,

151
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:59,219
but you don't seem surprised at all.

152
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,219
When we visited her,

153
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,460
she was already ill.

154
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:04,260
We knew she was dying.

155
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,099
I feel sorry for her,

156
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,419
but I'm not surprised.

157
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,580
What about the five days of mourning?

158
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:10,340
Her Majesty ordered you

159
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,460
to mourn only for five days,

160
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,020
why would she

161
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,940
be in such a hurry to let you take over?

162
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,020
Perhaps Her Majesty knew

163
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,299
the court was in disorder

164
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:18,619
and there were other factions

165
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:19,940
brewing their plans.

166
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,900
You answered everything with ease.

167
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,500
You don't act like the silly Tan Er I knew.

168
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,979
I'm not silly.

169
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,419
If Her Majesty didn't teach me all these,

170
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,219
I wouldn't know at all.

171
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,299
Do you

172
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,940
still remember our promise?

173
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,099
If you become Empress...

174
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,219
I remember.

175
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:44,219
For every right that women have,

176
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,900
every man shall have it too.

177
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,580
After the reformation,

178
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:53,219
we can finally go home

179
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,099
when the Red Star of Demise arrives

180
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:56,940
and reunite with Yu Er.

181
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,859
It's been so long.

182
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,780
I wonder if he has grown up.

183
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,780
<i>Did he just say the two of them</i>

184
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,619
<i>were going back to a different world?</i>

185
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,419
<i>Could that Yu Er be their son?</i>

186
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:13,580
Yes.

187
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:16,820
It's been too long since I last saw him.

188
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:19,099
I miss him a lot.

189
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:21,219
<i>That kid is nothing but a worthless child.</i>

190
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,260
<i>How is it worth it to return just for him?</i>

191
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,659
<i>I will figure something out</i>

192
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:28,299
<i>to make you stay in this place willingly</i>

193
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,780
<i>and start a new life with me.</i>

194
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:35,619
She asked Jing Xin

195
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,099
to remove all the mirrors?

196
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:37,979
Yes.

197
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,219
Her Highness's condition

198
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
is getting restless.

199
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:42,179
Not only is she wary of Jing Xin,

200
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,619
but she also thinks someone is watching her.

201
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,419
Don't you think she seems

202
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,940
like an entirely different person sometimes?

203
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:50,299
I don't understand.

204
00:14:50,979 --> 00:14:52,380
Tan Er's condition

205
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,299
is far worse

206
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,820
than the trauma from her imprisonment.

207
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,099
I'm afraid

208
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:57,739
there are other causes.

209
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:59,500
What do you plan to do?

210
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,299
To find the answers.

211
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:04,820
Stop right there!

212
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:06,140
Get out of our way.

213
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,419
Greetings, Your Highness.

214
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,820
Do you admit your crime?

215
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,260
I don't understand.

216
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:16,099
Was Crown Princess

217
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,059
released back to the Snow Court directly?

218
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:19,739
Prince Consort, please have mercy on us!

219
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,179
It was Official Xiao who took her.

220
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:22,659
Official Xiao?

221
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:24,820
Where did he take her?

222
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,820
Official Xiao told me nothing.

223
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,460
Do you understand your crime

224
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:30,299
will warrant a death sentence

225
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,340
to your entire clan
when she ascends to the throne?

226
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:34,299
All I know was

227
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,900
that they went to the imperial chamber.

228
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,020
As for the rest,

229
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,820
I know nothing.

230
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:39,260
Please have mercy on us!

231
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:39,940
I knew it.

232
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:41,859
They were meeting Her Majesty.

233
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:43,659
Inside the imperial chamber,

234
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:45,780
there is only one place that is suspicious.

235
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,020
Her Highness is about to move here.

236
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,979
I have been ordered to inspect the house.

237
00:15:59,099 --> 00:15:59,659
Open the door.

238
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,900
Prince Consort.

239
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:01,580
By the law,

240
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:03,260
there must be no inspection
before the coronation.

241
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,700
Do you mean

242
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,179
that Her Highness's order

243
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:07,580
wasn't good enough as a royal decree?

244
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:09,940
Is that why you are disobeying her?

245
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,099
I meant no disrespect.

246
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,900
I'll ask this one last time.

247
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:17,659
Stand aside!

248
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:40,299
Even if Her Highness was brought here,

249
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:41,500
the traces

250
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,539
would have already been wiped clean.

251
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,380
Young Master...

252
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,180
This is the remnant

253
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,780
of the burned Glacial Soulweed.

254
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,420
Glacial Soulweed?

255
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,219
It grows in the Xuanling Continent.

256
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,500
It's rare anywhere else.

257
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,180
It has unique properties.

258
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:03,780
Well...

259
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:06,739
The most unique effect it has

260
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:09,979
is enabling the host of Soul-guarding Bead
to take over another person's body.

261
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,979
But the price

262
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,380
is human sacrifice.

263
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,900
Put out the candles.

264
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:40,140
Young Master.

265
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,219
These shimmering specks of dust

266
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,060
are the disintegrated flesh

267
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,219
of the human sacrifice used in the ritual.

268
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,300
I finally understand why

269
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,020
Xiao Zhen

270
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,979
passed away with Her Majesty.

271
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,540
Young Master.

272
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,420
Someone is coming.

273
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:23,739
Let's head back.

274
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,575
<i>Princess's Residence</i>

275
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,260
Young Master.

276
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,180
Our investigation last night

277
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:42,339
didn't bear any result.

278
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,180
Tonight, should we go...

279
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:45,859
No.

280
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,339
Our frequent visits to that place

281
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,060
will draw her suspicion.

282
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:51,219
Remember.

283
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,780
We must not alert her.

284
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,939
There is something I don't understand.

285
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,380
Where would the original soul go

286
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,579
after another soul

287
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:04,219
has taken over the body?

288
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:06,140
The original soul?

289
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,939
I merely

290
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,579
fell from the wall

291
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,540
by accident.

292
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,459
I'm fine.

293
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:22,660
Tan Er's consciousness

294
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,540
is still inside the same body.

295
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:25,300
However,

296
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:26,859
Her Majesty is suppressing her.

297
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,979
She can only take control

298
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,260
indirectly at times.

299
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:33,900
I understand now

300
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,579
why she asked Jing Xin

301
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:38,459
to remove all the mirrors.

302
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,540
This must be the real reason.

303
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:47,699
We have half an hour

304
00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:49,099
to redecorate the living room.

305
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:51,060
Don't let anyone notice it.

306
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,540
Yes.

307
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:54,900
This is how it goes.

309
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:09,540
Admit it.

310
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,219
You're not the real Tan Er.

311
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,099
Indeed.

312
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,380
I am Qu Xiang Tan.

313
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,260
Qu Tan Er's body

314
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,300
has always been mine to use.

315
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,819
Your voice...

316
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:22,900
Yes. You can tell by it.

317
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,219
This meddlesome girl's consciousness

318
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:28,140
will soon fade into oblivion.

319
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:31,819
<i>Cheng Cheng! Save me! Cheng Cheng!</i>

320
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:32,420
Tan Er!

321
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:34,540
Can you hear me?

322
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,300
I'm right here.

323
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:36,339
Come out!

324
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,900
Stop yelling!

325
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,500
Her mind is weaker than mine.

326
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,939
Even with these mirrors,

327
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,859
she won't last for long.

328
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:49,540
<i>Cheng Cheng! Cheng Cheng! Save me!</i>

329
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,099
<i>Cheng Cheng!</i>

330
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,099
<i>Cheng Cheng!</i>

331
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,620
Tan Er!

332
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,300
<i>Cheng Cheng!</i>

333
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,619
You hear me, right?

334
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:03,780
Tan Er, is that you?

335
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,619
<i>It's me.</i>

336
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,500
Is that you, Tan Er?

337
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,339
<i>Cheng Cheng!</i>

338
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,459
Stop it!

339
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,660
No.

340
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,819
You can't afford to kill her.

341
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,979
You still need this body.

342
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,900
Indeed.

343
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,579
But I couldn't care if this body
is covered in wounds.

344
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,780
What about you?

345
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:44,420
I hope you always keep this in mind.

346
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,819
Two souls

347
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:49,099
share this body at the moment.

348
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:50,739
Behave and do as I say...

349
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,219
if you don't want her to suffer.

350
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:05,260
Do you really think

351
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,060
using her life as leverage

352
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,780
can make me bow to your will?

353
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,219
Listen closely.

354
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:15,060
You might as well end her life.

355
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:18,459
I will join her in the afterlife.

356
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:21,060
I will be with her in heaven or hell.

357
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,699
Play along with this act.

358
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:27,859
Outsiders

359
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,619
shouldn't know my true identity.

360
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,020
Otherwise...

361
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,660
the consequences will be severe.

362
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,500
Tan Er.

363
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:02,275
<i>Princess's Residence</i>

364
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,660
Since the date is fixed,

365
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,579
Official Sun will be in charge

366
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:08,780
of the preparation for my coronation.

367
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,819
Yes, Your Highness.

368
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,060
Unfortunately,

369
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,300
I have a relapse from a previous disease.

370
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:19,219
I'm afraid I couldn't make it to attend the ceremony.

371
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:24,140
It doesn't matter.

372
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:26,819
I will

373
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,979
have the proper arrangement for you.

374
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:32,099
Even if you're bedridden,

375
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,500
I will have the guards carry you there.

376
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:35,300
You...

377
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:38,180
Now that you are part of the court,

378
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,739
not only do you refuse to kneel

379
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:41,660
before Crown Princess,

380
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,579
you even disrespected me with your ill manner.

381
00:25:44,699 --> 00:25:46,060
Do you wish

382
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,420
to be buried in a casket

383
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,619
before my coronation?

384
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,859
You even dare to take my life?

385
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Of course I wouldn't.

386
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:00,219
I'm not you.

387
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:03,140
I'm not foolish enough to attempt
an assassination before my coronation.

388
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,099
Even if I was,

389
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:08,020
I wouldn't leave any traces

390
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,819
as some simpleton once did.

391
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:16,900
However,

392
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,300
I can't say the same for these people.

393
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,540
They only respect you, Eldest Sister,

394
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,979
and have no respect for me.

395
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:30,180
They are also corrupted to the core

396
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,219
by taking from the people.

397
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:35,420
I think...

398
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,660
it's time for them to meet their demise.

399
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,619
Guards.

400
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,939
Execute all of them.

401
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,819
Your Highness, have mercy on us!

402
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,579
Qu Tan Er!

403
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:56,300
Are you going to disobey my order

404
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:57,939
over some sinful officers?

405
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,819
Do not give me more reasons

406
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:05,180
to take your life.

407
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,459
Eldest Sister.

408
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:13,900
What more do you have to say?

409
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:17,579
I was out of line a moment ago.

410
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:19,459
I humbly ask for Your Highness's forgiveness.

411
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:25,939
On the Prayer Ritual to Heaven,

412
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,579
I will

413
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:31,020
send my blessing to the new Empress.

414
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:35,020
In that case,

415
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,500
everyone may leave

416
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:38,339
and start preparing now.

417
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:40,060
Yes.

418
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:48,780
Stay, Eldest Sister.

419
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:14,300
There is something

420
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,500
only you can settle.

421
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,420
Your Highness,

422
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,780
how may I be of service?

423
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,739
I need you to eliminate the rebel leader,

424
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:28,579
Mo Yuan Long.

425
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,660
You two were conspiring against the throne.

426
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,979
I found out about it a long time ago.

427
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:43,380
As for Mo Yuan Long's plans
and evidence of his crime,

428
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,300
I need you

429
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:48,339
to hand them over.

430
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:56,660
Dismiss.

431
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:20,619
Eliminating Mo Yuan Long?

432
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:25,459
Why would Tan do such a cruel thing to the Mo family?

433
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,979
Judging by her tone just now...

434
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,780
No.

435
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,219
<i>Tan has been acting strange lately.</i>

436
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:42,140
<i>I must tell Prince Consort.</i>

437
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:58,420
Prince Consort.

438
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:00,339
I have

439
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,300
something to report.

440
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:09,579
I was passing by the study.

441
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,420
I overheard a conversation

442
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,540
that the Mo family might...

443
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,660
Perhaps

444
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:20,060
I got it wrong.

445
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,660
You heard it right.

446
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,819
What will happen to the Mo family?

447
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:24,180
Tell me.

448
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,739
How can you be sure I didn't hear it wrong?

449
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,099
Did you expect her to do such a thing?

450
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,979
So she isn't the real Tan!

451
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:43,300
It's Her Majesty.

452
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,020
It's Her Majesty who had just passed away.

453
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,819
Her Majesty?

454
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,859
What about Tan?

455
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,540
Where is Tan now?

456
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,420
Is Tan already...

457
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:02,459
No.

458
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:04,020
I must save Princess!

459
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,459
Let go of me!

460
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,300
If we could take her life,

461
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,420
your blade wouldn't be needed.

462
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,660
Her Highness is still in there.

463
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,180
She is still inside that body.

464
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,859
We cannot harm her at the moment.

465
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:17,260
You two knew this all along?

466
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:19,859
If you knew this all along,

467
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,540
why didn't you tell me?

468
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,099
We kept you in the dark

469
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,060
because you are with her all the time.

470
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,300
If you knew,

471
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,900
you would draw her suspicion.

472
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,260
If you didn't know,

473
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,979
it would be for the best.

474
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:35,900
What do we do now?

475
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,540
How can we save Tan from her?

476
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,020
Be by her side.

477
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,459
Pretending nothing had happened.

478
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,180
She started to suspect me.

479
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,020
Yu Hao

480
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,140
can't approach her at all times.

481
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,060
You're the only one

482
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,819
who can stay by her side,

483
00:31:53,939 --> 00:31:55,979
pretend as if nothing had happened,

484
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:57,099
find out more about her

485
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,699
and find her weakness.

486
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,260
Can you do this?

487
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,300
Yes.

488
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,819
I can do it.

489
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,540
But what about the Mo family?

490
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,020
From what I heard,

491
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,180
she seemed to have evidence about
the Mo family's plan for rebellion.

492
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,140
Fourteenth Young Master is in the residence.

493
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,140
And Eldest Young Master too.

494
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,579
Can you talk her out of this?

495
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:19,459
If I did it,

496
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:21,780
nothing would change,

497
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,859
and she would even be more alert.

498
00:32:23,979 --> 00:32:25,180
Right now,

499
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:26,140
we must inform my father

500
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,300
as soon as possible,

501
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,619
so he can be ready.

502
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:29,699
Perhaps

503
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,260
we can weaken her power with this.

504
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,300
Then we'll have better leverage

505
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,699
to negotiate with her.

506
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:34,579
Okay.

507
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:35,540
I'll get to it now.

508
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,540
Wait.

509
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,939
You mustn't go.

510
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,979
Once you are gone,

511
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,219
she must notice.

512
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,739
Yu Hao.

513
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,900
You should do it.

514
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,939
Yes.

515
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,619
Jing Xin.

516
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,420
Tell me.

517
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:49,380
What did you overhear just now?

518
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I need the details.

519
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:51,380
Okay.

520
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,775
<i>Mo Residence</i>

521
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,819
I know you hate to see me right now.

522
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:14,859
But this is urgent.

523
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,739
I must speak to you.

524
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:26,939
Qu Tan Er talked to me.

525
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,420
What have you done to her?

526
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,459
What have I done to her?

527
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,780
Forget it.

528
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,060
She knows your father's plan.

529
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,459
She questioned me.

530
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,979
I told her everything.

531
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,540
You told her my father's grand plan?

532
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,219
I had no choice.

533
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:58,180
The Capital Guards will no longer
cooperate with the plan.

534
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,060
Our only chance now

535
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:00,140
is to employ another strategy

536
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,140
to thwart the tyrannical Qu Tan Er now.

537
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,699
Only then can we survive
and keep the Mo family safe.

538
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:06,540
You plan to use the Mo family

539
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:08,699
as your scapegoat to take out Qu Tan Er!

540
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,020
I know you hold a grudge against me.

541
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,820
What will I gain now

542
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,620
by telling you lies?

543
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,659
Even if your father overthrows her,

544
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,139
he will disempower me when he has no use of me later.

545
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,580
I came here

546
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,699
not only out of my guilt for you,

547
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,340
but also out of my fear

548
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:32,020
for Qu Tan Er's cruelty now.

549
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,419
She means to wipe out the whole Mo family.

550
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,580
Is this really Tan Er's plan?

551
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,820
Trust me.

552
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:40,899
That person

553
00:34:40,939 --> 00:34:41,979
isn't the Tan Er we knew.

554
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,459
She isn't the other Tan Er either.

555
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,100
Or maybe

556
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,260
she is no longer

557
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,340
the same person we once knew.

558
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,100
She acts like the late Empress

559
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:52,340
more than anything.

560
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,860
Even if I believe you,

561
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:04,939
that doesn't mean we will share
a relationship in the future.

562
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,100
After today,

563
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,739
we will still be strangers to each other.

564
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:19,620
I thought so as well.

565
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:24,300
I came to tell you all of this...

566
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,219
only to make the rest of my life

567
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,060
pass with less guilt.

568
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,939
That's all there is to it.

569
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,860
Take care.

570
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,260
If you lost your life because of this,

571
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,860
I would be in your debt again.

572
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,939
As long as we sever all ties,

573
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,979
we don't owe each other anything.

574
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,659
In this lifetime or the next,

575
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,219
as long as you don't ask to settle the score,

576
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:24,979
I will ask nothing of you.

577
00:36:25,899 --> 00:36:27,860
We hate each other now.

578
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,379
Let our grudge

579
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,100
along with love...

580
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:36,939

Qu Tan Er barely has much influence.

This is our chance to strike.

591
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:27,580
Mr. Mo, you are right.

592
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:29,260
With Eldest Princess as our informant,

593
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,100
we can proceed with this plan.

594
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:32,540
Father!

595
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,699
Who let you in?

596
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:35,219
Dismiss!

597
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,899
Yu Hao has important news for you.

598
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:38,179
My Lord.

599
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:39,540
Young Master has a message for you.

600
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:40,379
He said

601
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,060
that Her Highness might already
knew Mo family's plan of attack.

602
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:44,139
Her Highness is ready to strike at any time.

603
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,060
Young Master hopes

604
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,899
you make some changes to the plan.

605
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,340
Mr. Mo.

606
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:51,020
This is...

607
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,580
Calm down.

608
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:54,899
Your Eighth Brother and Qu Tan Er

609
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,219
are on the same side.

610
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,300
They share benefits and losses together.

611
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:00,060
His information

612
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,020
cannot be trusted.

613
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,100
Father.

614
00:38:02,139 --> 00:38:04,179
Eighth Brother would never send Yu Hao to lie to you.

615
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,939
It's better

616
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:06,139
to be ready than to be sorry.

617
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:07,100
What do you know?

618
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,179
This is a critical moment.

619
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,419
Do not bring disorder to my troops!

620
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,699
Dismiss!

621
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:12,620
Father!

622
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:17,699
I talked to Eldest Princess.

623
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,739
She told me the Capital Guards

624
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,820
wouldn't cooperate with us.

625
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:21,820
We need another strategy.

626
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,459
It seems I have no choice

627
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,860
but to alter our plan.

628
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:34,899
The information from Eldest Princess

629
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:38,060
matches with Yu Hao's.

630
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:40,060
Yu Hao.

631
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:41,820
I got the information.

632
00:38:41,939 --> 00:38:42,979
You may return now.

633
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,939
Yes.

634
00:38:46,379 --> 00:38:47,659
Mr. Mo.

635
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,179
How should we proceed?

636
00:38:53,419 --> 00:38:55,060
General Lu.

637
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:56,860
You have the yin imperial token.

638
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,419
I must ask you to risk your life

639
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:00,060
to prove that the late Empress was killed

640
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:01,260
and subdue the uprising.

641
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,939
By doing so, we'll be saved.

642
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,300
Are you willing to do that?

643
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:08,340
For the people of Dongyue,

644
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:09,340
I will

645
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:10,540
take this mission.

646
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,459
Good.

647
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,179
Everyone,

648
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,100
we shall set out now.

649
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:16,939
Inform our allies at the borders.

650
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:17,939
Order them to march to the capital now

651
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:18,899
for one last battle.

652
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,939
Time is not on our side.

653
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:20,780
Do it now.

654
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:22,020
Yes.

655
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:30,939
This residence is no longer safe for us.

656
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,899
Qu Tan Er would never hurt Lian Cheng.

657
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,620
But yours and Jing Xuan's safety

658
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,419
is still a concern for me.

659
00:39:36,899 --> 00:39:37,419
Both of you

660
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,340
should seek shelter outside the city.

661
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,379
When the battle is over,

662
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,939
we'll make further arrangements.

663
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,699
Father.

664
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,979
In this critical moment,

665
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,780
I cannot leave you behind.

666
00:39:45,899 --> 00:39:47,179
I'm the eldest son of the Mo family.

667
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,139
I shall fight by your side.

668
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:53,219
Very well.

669
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,860
If things go south,

670
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,500
meet me at the Luomei Pavilion
of the eastern suburb.

671
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,899
Yes.

672
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,500
You shall leave the city.

673
00:40:04,379 --> 00:40:05,419
Father.

674
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,659
I'll stay too.

675
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:08,780
You will only get in the way of my plan.

676
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,739
Do you understand?

677
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:12,739
Fourteenth.

678
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,620
At least one of our Mo family must survive.

679
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:15,699
You are leaving

680
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:17,100
not for your life,

681
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:19,580
but our family's bloodline.

682
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,419
In that case,

683
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,500
I will follow your order.

684
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:31,225
<i>Mo Residence</i>

685
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:34,139
The men we sent out

686
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:35,780
should have reported in.

687
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:38,379
What is taking them so long?

688
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,699
My Lord!

689
00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:43,219
My Lord!

690
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,219
Bad news!

691
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:44,939
Troops of imperial guards

692
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:46,260
are marching this way.

693
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,739
They are going to surround the Mo residence.

694
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:57,580
Do not tell Yan Chen

695
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,459
about this for now.

696
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,500
Order Yun Ying to take him
out of this house now!

697
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,699
Through the back door.

698
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,139
Yes!
