<i>Episode 27</i>

17
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,770
Stop!

18
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,820
You, stop!

19
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,740
Over there! Someone is over there!

20
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,940
Keep up.

21
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,820
This way.

22
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,690
Someone is here. Go.

23
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,940
Eldest Brother.

24
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,820
This is too risky.

25
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,580
I worry about her no less than you.

26
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,050
I have something

27
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,020
that I need to ask her in person.

28
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,330
Take care.

29
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,050
I'll lead the guards away.

30
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,530
I'll meet you at the prison.

31
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,300
You should also take care.

32
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,660
I'll bribe the Lead Prison Guard,

33
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,610
it'll help you get into the prison

34
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,740
more easily.

35
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,610
Let's go.

36
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,130
Who is there? Stop!

37
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,170
Stop!

38
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,130
Here, dishes are here.

39
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,690
So slow.

40
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,610
Come, come, come.

41
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,220
We have alcohol and meat.
Let's enjoy ourselves to the fullest.

42
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,380
You, come to the toilets with me.

43
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,380
Continue drinking.

44
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,580
Slow down.

45
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,580
Who are you?

46
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,700
Official Xiao asked me to ask
Her Highness some questions.

47
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,610
Official Xiao?

48
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,770
Do you have a token?

49
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,980
Does Official Xiao need a token

50
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,850
to ask questions?

51
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,010
Asking questions privately is

52
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,450
probably Her Majesty's order.

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,290
A token is too ostentatious.

54
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,140
Lead Prison Guard, do you know what I mean?

55
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,540
I understand.

56
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,170
She is a major criminal. You should be quick.

57
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,140
Tan Er.

58
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,500
Cheng Cheng.

59
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,820
Yan Chen.

60
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,500
Why is it you?

61
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,890
Sorry, I just woke up.

62
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,890
How did you come in?

63
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,170
Are you here to rescue me?

64
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,940
You surely are a good bro.

65
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,730
I appreciate your kindness,

66
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,100
but you should leave.

67
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,420
It's the death penalty.

68
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,890
I've never doubted you.

69
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,890
I chose to forgive and understand

70
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,850
all your strange behaviours.

71
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,940
I even convinced myself

72
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,500
that staying by your side is enough.

73
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,540
However, today,

74
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,980
I wavered,

75
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,500
I was confused.

76
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,220
Tell me.

77
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,540
Are you still my Qu Tan Er?

78
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,100
As long as you answer me,

79
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,820
I'll believe whatever you say.

80
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,940
I...

81
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,730
What should I say?

82
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,170
No one will believe me other than Cheng Cheng.

83
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,500
Should I fool him with a fake story?

84
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,140
No, no, no.

85
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,380
It's too evil to lie at this moment.

86
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,140
The Mo Yan Chen in this world
loves Qu Tan Er deeply.

87
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,540
How can I tell him the truth?

88
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,980
I'm not Qu Tan Er,

89
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,940
so I've never loved you.

90
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,100
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,330
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,940
Stop right there.

93
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,820
You are not her?

94
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,100
Then who are you?

95
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,700
Where is Tan Er?

96
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,610
How should I tell you?

97
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,660
This body

98
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,140
belongs to Qu Tan Er.

99
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,890
But it's me who currently lives

100
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,100
in this body.

101
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,570
I'm

102
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,940
Qu Xiao Tan.

103
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,330
Then tell me, where is Tan Er?

104
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,700
She was killed by Qu Mei Er way before.

105
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,450
But should I tell him the truth at this moment?

106
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,140
Cheng Cheng.

107
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,010
The real Qu Tan Er died

108
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,500
when she fell into the water that time.

109
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,220
Tan is

110
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,420
from another world.

111
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
She makes

112
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,570
this body continue to be alive.

113
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,290
As for why Qu Tan Er fell into the water,

114
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,570
you should know the reason
behind it after thinking a bit.

115
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,290
How is this possible?

116
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,940
How can such an absurd incident
exist in this world?

117
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,140
Eldest Brother.

118
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,980
Even if you don't believe

119
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,660
the absurd incident we speak of,

120
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,380
you should believe

121
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,050
the actual Qu Tan Er

122
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,940
will not fail you.

123
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,580
Tan Er will never fail me.

124
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,700
I'll get her back.

125
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,460
Yan Chen.

126
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,050
Is it okay

127
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
that we told him the truth?

128
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,140
Although it's cruel,

129
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,780
it's the truth.

130
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,460
I missed you so much.

131
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,610
We need to go now.

132
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,700
No.

133
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,090
Her Majesty definitely knows that

134
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,500
we're meeting each other here tonight.

135
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,140
She permitted you to come

136
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,700
for some reasons.

137
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,290
I don't want you to suffer here.

138
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,500
Not even for a second.

139
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,580
It's okay.

140
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,170
Take it easy.

141
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,610
You?

142
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,410
Heart?

143
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,610
I know

144
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,380
that no matter where we are,

145
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,170
no matter what situation we are in,

146
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,460
and no matter if we are poor or rich,

147
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,410
you will always

148
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,850
be in my heart.

149
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,900
Take care of yourself.

150
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,290
Go.

151
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,210
Go.

152
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,210
Tan Er.

153
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Go.

154
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,340
So,

155
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,780
suffering in this kind of place,

156
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,900
being in this kind of situation

157
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,340
for the one you love

158
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,290
can bring such happiness.

159
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,140
You really don't know anything
about the incident

160
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,780
that Second Princess fell into the water?

161
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,650
I don't.

162
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,410
I have asked Tan Er.

163
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,500
When she brought the wedding invitation to me,

164
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,900
she was pushed into the water
by Eldest Princess herself.

165
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,020
I saw you being nervous after that.

166
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,140
How do you explain that?

167
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,820
She is posing as Second Princess.

168
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,900
She is trying to sow discord
among you and Eldest Princess.

169
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,780
Why did you go to
Second Princess's Residence?

170
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,650
Why did Eldest Princess
go to Second Princess's Residence?

171
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,820
We...

172
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,090
We went there merely to visit.

173
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,210
When I asked Eldest Princess if she had seen

174
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,020
Tan Er that day,

175
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,380
she said she hadn't seen her.

176
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,020
Are you saying

177
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,780
that Eldest Princess was lying?

178
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,850
My memories fail me.

179
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,780
Days have passed, I...

180
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,090
Don't say anything more.

181
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,170
Now that you know the truth,

182
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,140
feel free to take revenge for her.

183
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Since the first time I met you,

184
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,170
I knew,

185
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,970
in this world,

186
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,970
I am the only one who can see the real you

187
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,140
and help you make achievements with your talent.

188
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,850
No matter how capricious I am,

189
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,820
I only hope

190
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,500
that you can see

191
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,020
my sincere and fragile side.

192
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,020
But you wanted to kill Tan Er.

193
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,410
I can only see your cold and emotionless side.

194
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,650
I did that because I wanted to give you
the best in the world.

195
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,260
Only then

196
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,610
would you be with me willingly.

197
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,290
Yan Chen.

198
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,530
I still want to say,

199
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,290
no matter what you want to do,

200
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,610
I'll do it with you.

201
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,820
Even if we need to defy the world's opinion,

202
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,940

<i>Mo Residence</i>

219
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,580
Chen Er.

220
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,900
Does it still hurt?

221
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,090
Eldest Princess sent over some tonics,

222
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,210
and I've accepted on your behalf.

223
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,500
Chen Er.

224
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,530
Do you still remember
what I told you at the pavilion

225
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,090
the day you married Eldest Princess?

226
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,260
You said you would give your all
for the Mo Family.

227
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,850
You would bear any grievances

228
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,410
after

229
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,290
marrying Eldest Princess.

230
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,460
I don't know why you came back to

231
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,050
Mo Residence.

232
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,410
However, I want you to remember
what you said before.

233
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,210
Eldest Princess

234
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,970
treats you well.

235
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,020
You should be content.

236
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,970
Father, I'm sorry for letting you down.

237
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,380
My destiny with her has already ended.

238
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,140
Chen Er,

239
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,780
you are the only one I can count on

240
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,690
in this family.

241
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,210
How can you say such unreasonable words?

242
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,090
Second Princess is going to be abolished soon.

243
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,900
Cheng Er is handling a lot.

244
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,900
Xuan Er is still young.

245
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,900
Feng Yang is an unfilial daughter...

246
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,690
You shouldn't be so capricious when it comes to

247
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,090
the fate of the Mo Family.

248
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,450
Also,

249
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,610
what I'm planning now is meant to

250
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,380
fulfill your mother's last wish.

251
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,260
Mother's last wish?

252
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,420
What do you mean?

253
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,900
I have never told you about this before.

254
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,730
In fact,

255
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,210
our Mo Family was the feudal lord of this land

256
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
before this kingdom was established.

257
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,500
Her Majesty relied on our power

258
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,970
to unite the country

259
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,780
and establish Dongyue.

260
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,300
However, nowadays,

261
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,930
Her Majesty is tyrannical.

262
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,900
Collecting extra taxes and
not listening to the people's wills.

263
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,380
People are suffering.

264
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,610
Your mother's last wish

265
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,090
is to replace Her Majesty.

266
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,140
Our Mo Family

267
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,900
had such great achievements?

268
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,780
Chen Er.

269
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,540
Your mother did everything

270
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,690
for you.

271
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,850
I'm planning everything

272
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,500
for you too.

273
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,330
Don't act on emotions.

274
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,780
I made this medicine for you.

275
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,660
Rest well.

276
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,610
Remember what I said.

277
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,420
After you recover,

278
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,690
return as soon as possible.

279
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,210
Get some rest.

Your Majesty.

282

We can activate the magic circle today.

283
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,780
I don't need to

284
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,500
drink this medicine.

285
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,500
Your Majesty.

286
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,300
I've already

287
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,970
finished composing the Soul-destroying Song.

288
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,060
Go get everything ready.

289
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,330
What else?

290
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,180
Since Your Majesty saved me

291
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,500
from the wolves,

292
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,060
I swore to live

293
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,380
only for you.

294
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,850
Time passed rapidly.

295
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,930
Now you can rebuild your body.

296
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,140
I'm very happy for you.

297
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,140
Yes.

298
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,300
You were so little back then,

299
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,260
but you fought with the wolf pack all night.

300
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,500
I really couldn't believe it.

301
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,380
Your Majesty wasn't any older than

302
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,060
I was at the time.

303
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,900
Why are you so emotional today?

304
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,780
I'm just

305
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,900
missing the days

306
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,060
when I played instruments with Your Majesty.

307
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,450
After I am reborn,

308
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,540
you'll be

309
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,020
the first person to play instruments with me.

310
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,570
Does that sound good?

311
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,450
I'll

312
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,810
remember this.

313
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,500
Official Xiao?

314
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,330
I can leave?

315
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,260
I can wash up once I'm back at my residence.

316
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,930
You don't have to go through such trouble.

317
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,300
I'll feel bad.

318
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,690
Crown Princess,

319
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,380
please get yourself ready as soon as possible.

320
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,540
This looks so much like getting ready

321
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,420
for the execution.

322
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,850
Anyway,

323
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,850
I'll try to prolong the process as much as I can.

324
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,540
Official Xiao.

325
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,930
Why are you so loyal to Her Majesty?

326
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,260
How did you meet?

327
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,210
Why are you so loyal to her?

328
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,540
Is poker face also popular here?

329
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,420
According to my observations,

330
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,330
with this solid employer-employee
relationship between you,

331
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,330
you must've been tricked by Her Majesty.

332
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,540
Simply speaking,

333
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,970
you fell into

334
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,380
Her Majesty's setup.

335
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,300
If you want to win her heart,

336
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,690
you need to do the same to her.

337
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,420
Your Highness,

338
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,780
your words are more and more presumptuous.

339
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,260
I have a few tips and tricks,

340
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,900
do you want to know?

341
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,180
First,

342
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,500
a four-character short phrase,

343
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,570
and a five-step trap.

344
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,730
They are

345
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,140
triggering curiosity,

346
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,610
gaining attention,

347
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,330
building relationship,

348
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,780
criticizing misunderstandings

349
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,420
and abusing feelings.

350
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,900
If Your Highness keeps rinsing,

351
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,500
you will eventually lose your mouth.

352
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,420
I haven't finished.

353
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,300
These are only some of the setups

354
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,210
Her Majesty may have used,

355
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,930
I have more...

356
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,900
I know you are trying
to hold off from getting ready.

357
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,540
Never mind,

358
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,420
this is going to be the last time
we see each other.

359
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,180
The last time we see each other?

360
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,810
What does that mean?

361
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,180
You just asked me

362
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,930
how I met Her Majesty.

363
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,300
Her Majesty

364
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,730
saved my life.

365
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,930
Saved your life?

366
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,690
She appeared at my most helpless moment.

367
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,610
The whole world had abandoned me at that time.

368
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,900
She was the only one who helped me
without any hesitation.

369
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,540
She taught me how to read.

370
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,900
She is only a few years older than me,

371
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
but she always appeared to be so mature.

372
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,850
She made me want to take care of her.

373
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,140
Sadly, I was too young at the time.

374
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,570
I didn't understand anything.

375
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,660
I could only hide behind her.

376
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,500
You like her?

377
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,500
After we had grown up,

378
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,540
I got mad when I saw

379
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,420
other men being nice to her.

380
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,970
When I saw her being tired,

381
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,730
I blamed myself for not being a better man.

382
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,420
She always laughed at my foolishness

383
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,500
and childishness.

384
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,970
But I know,

385
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,690
she is the foolish one,

386
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,610
because she doesn't know true love.

387
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,500
Your Highness,

388
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,730
you should get changed

389
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,420
in the next room.

390
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,610
You haven't finished your story.

391
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,730
What happened next?

392
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,930
Did you tell her your feelings?

393
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,450
We grew up together

394
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,660
away from secularization.

395
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,450
She was born for people to look up to.

396
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,330
I knew she didn't like me.

397
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,300
That was good.

398
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,500
She wouldn't like others either.

399
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,570
I once thought we could be like this

400
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,570
until we grew old.

401
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,690
Who knew...

406

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,540
my only wish is

408
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,660
to see her smile when I look up.

409
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:47,940
♪Lonely music-playing looks to the waning lights♪

410
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,660
Her smile is like warm sunshine in the winter,

00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,330

Your Highness,

418
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,380
let's go.

419
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,210
Senior.

420
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,210
Prince Consort.

421
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,380
You look

422
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,780
exhausted today.

423
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,060
Tan Er was imprisoned despite being innocent,

424
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,060
I really couldn't sleep.

425
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,420
I came to ask you

426
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,300
if there are any signs

427
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,330
of the Red Star of Demise.

428
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,300
Don't worry Your Highness.

429
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,140
Before you came,

430
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,210
I did the divination for you.

431
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,900
Let me tell you.

432
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,060
The "Shi Star" moved three times from the north,
<i>*Should be "Di Star", a constellation in ancient China</i>

433
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,850
the two poles are in anti-phase,

434
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,930
indicating a great chance.

435
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,810
However, the moon has grown an angular light,

436
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,260
indicating danger.

437
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,850
Senior.

438
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,610
Can you say everything in simpler terms?

439
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,900
What do you mean?

440
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,570
I felt good today,

441
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,380
and have done the divination for Your Highness.

442
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,020
Even if there is a great chance

443
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,450
to change fate today,

444
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:26,930
two stars clash,

445
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,020
only one of them can stay.

446
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,140
And there appears to be

447
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,180
uncertain danger.

448
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,540
Thank you, Senior.

449
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,420
I...

450
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,210
I haven't finished, why did you leave?

451
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,810
Fate has been settled,
external forces can hardly change it!

452
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,500
Your Majesty.

453
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,540
The process of body-usurping

454
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,420
will be tortuous.

455
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,660
There will be a process when
two people's consciousnesses

456
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,380
exist in the same body.

457
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,570
You should remain clear-headed
and strong the entire time.

458
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,660
Otherwise,

459
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,660
you will lose yourself
in Qu Tan Er's consciousness.

460
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,330
I'm telling you,

461
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,970
my consciousness is very strong.

462
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,810
I have already experienced this twice.

463
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,140
You are playing with fire.

464
00:31:58,930 --> 00:31:59,850
Let go.

465
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,020
Let go of me.

466
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,540
Let go of me.

467
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,540
Let go.

468
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,970
Let go of me, let go of me.

469
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,260
Let go...

470
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,780
You've lost your mind.

471
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,450
Qu Xiang Tan.

472
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,330
Do you dare to play fair in a competition with me?

473
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,140
I must get

474
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,690
what I want.

475
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,380
Your Majesty.

476
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,930
Your Majesty.

477
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,570
I wondered why you let Cheng Cheng marry me

478
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,060
even though you deeply liked
Eighth Young Master of Mo family,

479
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,900
and even made me Crown Princess.

480
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,090
It turns out

481
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,610
that you've planned everything.

482
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,780
You knew you were dying,

483
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,730
so you planned to take over my body.

484
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,450
You planned to have Cheng Cheng and the country

485
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,540
in your hands.

486
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,420
How despicable.

487
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,210
Don't worry.

488
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,060
I've been waiting for this moment

489
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,930
for so many years.

490
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,500
No one's consciousness

491
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,540
is stronger

492
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,690
and more solid

493
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,060
than mine.

494
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,100
Let's begin.

495
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,410
I'm looking forward

496
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,580
to playing instruments with you.

497
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,210
Okay.

498
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,650
What is this?

499
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,930
Qu Xiang Tan.

500
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,860
Completing this altar

501
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,730
will sacrifice Xiao Zhen.

502
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,970
Do you know that?

503
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,060
Do you want

504
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,370
Xiao Zhen to sacrifice himself for you?

505
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,540
To die for you?

506
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,650
What should I do?

507
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,780
Bring me to Her Highness.

508
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,450
Crown Princess left a while ago.

509
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,930
Really.

510
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,650
Official Xiao brought Her Majesty's message,

511
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,820
suggesting that Crown Princess is innocent.

512
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,300
Her Majesty worried Crown Princess would feel
uncomfortable staying in the palace,

513
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,300
so she ordered Official Xiao

514
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,500
to send her back to her residence.

515
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,100
They all saw it.

516
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,020
Take me inside.

517
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,500
Okay, okay.

518
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,930
See?

519
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,300
Now,

520
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,730
do you believe me?

521
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,130
Mo Lian Cheng.

522
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,820
Cheng Cheng.

523
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,620
Cheng Cheng.
